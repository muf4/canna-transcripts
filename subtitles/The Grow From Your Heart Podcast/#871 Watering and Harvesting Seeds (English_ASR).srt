00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,640
question on today's podcast came from

25
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,640
the growel tab it came from our new

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,280
friend who wants to be called Lone Wolf

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,200
welcome to the party Lone Wolf thank you

28
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,280
for the great question this is a good

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,920
question it goes a lot like this it says

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,079
rosta Jeff what are your thoughts on

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,719
cheap water meters I got two for 12

32
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:30,478
bucks on Amazon you probably got what

33
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,719
you paid for to be honest with you cheap

34
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,359
[ __ ] on Amazon is cheap [ __ ] on Amazon

35
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,879
and also I'll teach you a way to get

36
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,920
away from this water meter you're not

37
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,719
even going to need it uh save somebody

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,280
else two for2 in the future here but it

39
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:47,039
says I have had a bad problem with

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,680
overwatering well the first step is

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,040
water less my dude but I'm going to give

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,880
you more details don't let me just troll

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,520
you right here on the show it says I'm

44
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,519
hoping this will solve it and part two I

45
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,599
guess is a good what is a good set of

46
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,399
nutrients for a beginner grower and how

47
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,199
often to use them

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,560
uh let me talk first about let me put a

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,719
little star and make sure I get to the

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,640
second part here uh there's a two-part

51
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,280
question uh let me address the first

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,439
part of this question here because this

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
is the part that really needs some help

54
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,800
uh what are my thoughts on cheap water

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,480
meters I don't use any sort of water

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,080
meter in a small home grow in a

57
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,639
medium-sized commercial grow uh maybe in

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,680
a gigantic really large facility I would

59
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,598
have moisture meters uh placed

60
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,000
strategically to let me know if there's

61
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:31,318
an emergency and something gets too dry

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,759
but in a personal home grow I don't ever

63
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,639
use a moisture meter I've done another

64
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,199
full episode that is titled Water Tech 1

65
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:42,199
through 5 I'm going to kind of reiterate

66
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,679
quickly watertech 1 through 5 here today

67
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,039
and hopefully this will give you a

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,519
breakdown on how to successfully water

69
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,878
your plants without overwatering I don't

70
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,760
mean to be a troll I don't mean to be a

71
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,759
smartass but I am a smartass and kind of

72
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,679
a troll it's how it's going to go um you

73
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,518
know you're overwatering let's just cut

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,040
back a little bit on the water that's

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,879
the first step but this will apply for

76
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,719
everybody out there this may be helpful

77
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:06,439
I use a method called one through five

78
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:09,000
watering Tech think about if you load

79
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,639
your pot your container whatever size it

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,080
is if it's a fabric pot if it's a

81
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,279
plastic pot and whatever Medium you're

82
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,440
putting in there if you're putting in

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,719
Cocoa if you're putting in soilless mix

84
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,079
if you're putting in soil living soil

85
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,799
whatever goes in here stuff that pot the

86
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,440
way that you would fill it put that

87
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,200
plant in there you've got that plant in

88
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,199
there there's no water in there at this

89
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,839
point let it be completely dry this is a

90
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:33,280
hypothetical situation at this point

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,039
right now with no water in there that

92
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
plant is at what we call a one that is

93
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,919
one on the moisture scale one through

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,438
five we are at a level one on that

95
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,359
moisture completely dry if we don't

96
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:46,400
water that plant almost immediately it

97
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,959
will die so that is level one on

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,400
moisture remember how heavy that pot is

99
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,079
now with no moisture in there pick it up

100
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,959
feel it this pot when you go to pick it

101
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,959
up you're going to lift it and you're

102
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,360
going to go oh [ __ ] you're going to

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,239
throw it up in the air because it's way

104
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,360
light because there's no moisture in

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,280
there that is level one now I'm going to

106
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,439
go all the way to level five and then

107
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,959
you'll see where I'm going and we'll

108
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,239
work our way into the middle of this

109
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,239
scale level five would be if I took a 5

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,438
gallon bucket of water and I watered the

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
[ __ ] out of this new transplanted pot

112
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:17,079
and we let that all that dirt all that

113
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,599
Medium cocoa whatever we're using inside

114
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,680
that pot fully saturate that bad [ __ ]

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,919
to the point of runoff where water is

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,360
running out of the bottom of that

117
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,399
container that is a number five so

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,919
number one and then pick it up at this

119
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,439
point pick it up see how much that

120
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,719
weighs it's it's going to be heavy as

121
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,360
[ __ ] if you got a 3 gallon a 5 gallon a

122
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,800
seven especially if it's any bigger it's

123
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,840
going to be hard to pick up it's loaded

124
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,280
with water and a plant it's going to be

125
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,439
quite heavy all that soil is saturated

126
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,079
remember that weight remember God that's

127
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,399
heavy right there bro that's a five then

128
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,599
that light [ __ ] when you almost threw

129
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,478
the pot that's a number one now let's

130
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,639
work our way through this scale let's go

131
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,758
backwards uh from number five because

132
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,319
we've now at this point in our

133
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,600
hypothetical we have saturated this

134
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,759
plant it is nice and wet so on a number

135
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,879
five scale that plant is what we're

136
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,360
going to call flooded uh it's as wet as

137
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,879
it can get if you've got a big plant um

138
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,000
if your plant's in a three gallon pot

139
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,279
it's well established got a root Zone

140
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,639
you can hopefully water that plant to a

141
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,559
level five get it to runoff and it will

142
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,079
be okay don't let it sit in the runoff

143
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,439
but water to that runoff and it will be

144
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,879
okay but that is level five that's fully

145
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:25,439
saturated if that plant sits in that for

146
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,120
too long we may see issues but if you've

147
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,800
got a wellestablished plant you should

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,240
be able to water to runoff if you've got

149
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,439
a smaller plant we've got to adjust

150
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,560
think about however big your container

151
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,240
is how much space are the roots taking

152
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,519
let's kind of water the roots and then a

153
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,960
little bit more to encourage growth but

154
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,680
don't flood that if your plants are a

155
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,680
little smaller maybe you want to stick

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
with a level four or a level three which

157
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,280
is what we're going to work our way into

158
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,000
next level five is flooded um that's as

159
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,000
wet as that [ __ ] can get remember how

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,360
heavy that is that's level five it

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,759
doesn't get any whiter than that water

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,439
is pouring out of the bottom uh you may

163
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,919
see droopy plants you may see a little

164
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,600
bit a claw that is overwatering if the

165
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,639
plant starts yellowing out when you do

166
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
this you're

167
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,960
overwatering um if they're little like I

168
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,080
said water a little bit less work your

169
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,598
way to a four or a three so number four

170
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,959
is when level five dries out a little

171
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,240
bit you don't see as much the top still

172
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,399
appears a little bit wet but not super

173
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,680
dark uh and it's a little bit lighter

174
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,638
now pick that pot up feel that weight

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,959
that plant should be it should look real

176
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,000
happy at this point it should be like Oh

177
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,758
I'm not overwatered I've got enough

178
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,800
saturation I've got enough oxygen in my

179
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,199
root zone I'm growing I'm thriving

180
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,680
that's about a level four um depending

181
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,400
on the size of your pots how big your

182
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,079
plants are level five to level four

183
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,159
could take if you're in a three gallon

184
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,279
cocoa pot with a big plant could be a

185
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,120
couple of hours if you're in a s gallon

186
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,279
pot with a soilless mix that four to

187
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,199
five could be half of a day to take it

188
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,399
to get from that from that one moisture

189
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,240
level to the other just pay attention to

190
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,839
the plants pick them up feel them and

191
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,598
you got to understand the the different

192
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,318
types of medium and the size of pot and

193
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,918
the environment the size of plant this

194
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,720
is all going to come into play here so

195
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,279
adjust is necessary but your smaller

196
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,440
plants keep them at that level four

197
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,679
that's wet but not flooded saturated but

198
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,719
not [ __ ] fully dripping and dunked

199
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,959
with water so that's four or five that

200
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,440
wet area level three is when those

201
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,918
plants are preying you've got that

202
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,399
perfect level of the top is not showing

203
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,598
any water but the middle of the root

204
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,120
zone is nice and saturated that's a

205
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,639
level three that's right about where we

206
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,079
want to hover when those plants look

207
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,759
real good now we've got to start paying

208
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,079
attention we need to keep an eye on

209
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,000
level three because what's next is level

210
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,359
two and that's when those plants start

211
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
to get droopy they went from praying and

212
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,199
now they've gone ah [ __ ] we need some

213
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,439
water they're starting to get a little

214
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,439
bit sad a little bit Droopy when you see

215
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,918
them doing that droop now it's time to

216
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,598
really pick them up and see what they

217
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,598
weigh because this right before that

218
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,038
droop just right before that was when

219
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,319
you should have water them but if you

220
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:57,839
see that droop pay attention to how long

221
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,158
it's been since you watered them last

222
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,878
time and just a few minutes maybe a few

223
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:04,079
hours before that is when you need to

224
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,039
water next time right when you see them

225
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,878
going I'm sleepy I'm tired I need some

226
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,719
water that's when they're thirsty right

227
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,759
when they start to do the droop that is

228
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,840
when you need to get some water in them

229
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,439
as soon as possible that is probably be

230
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,638
2.5 is really the ideal time to water

231
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,399
them if you can learn to time that uh

232
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,120
right before they droop right after the

233
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,758
prey you'll see them they some plants

234
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,199
won't pray but you'll some plants will

235
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,360
have their arms up they'll be like la la

236
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,680
la la la I'm super happy some will stay

237
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,639
just like this they'll have their arms

238
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,240
almost horizontal kind of going up when

239
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,680
you see them start to go down and droop

240
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,360
and get a little bit tired right before

241
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,439
that was when they wanted water learn

242
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,639
that time learn how to identify that

243
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,320
learn to pick up that pot and check that

244
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,838
moisture level in that pot you're

245
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,278
probably just under three just above two

246
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,600
that's a 2.5 on this scale that's right

247
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,879
when you're probably going to want to

248
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,240
water them level two is when they're

249
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,639
droopy they're going hey water please

250
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,360
that's level two when they're looking a

251
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,759
little bit like I should have watered

252
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,720
those like a little bit ago like I

253
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,559
overslept after I got home from morate

254
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,200
or whatever happened the concert went

255
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,199
long the comedy show went longer than I

256
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,399
had intended the drive took longer

257
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,600
whatever could have

258
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,519
happened uh they need some water that's

259
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,120
the point here whatever you were doing

260
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,440
these plants needed some water just a

261
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,039
little bit ago so learn that schedule

262
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,800
then number one uh number one is when

263
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,679
we're back at that super dryness if

264
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,519
you've got a plant that is established a

265
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,479
root Zone and that uh that uh medium the

266
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,240
cocoa the soil the soiless mix whatever

267
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,480
we're playing with if it's reached to

268
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,039
level one is probably dead or pretty

269
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,839
close to dead at this point so number

270
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,519
one is you're fired that's that's what

271
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,560
number one is number two is water these

272
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,759
things pretty [ __ ] soon number three

273
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:43,559
is we're pretty cool uh number four is

274
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,639
we're wet man number five is we're

275
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,559
[ __ ] saturated so that's for a

276
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:49,600
wellestablished plant you're going to

277
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,679
have to adjust that for smaller plants

278
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,680
of course think about the amount of dirt

279
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,879
you've got in that plant think about how

280
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,239
much water to dirt it's going to take to

281
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,519
saturate that water it until it runs off

282
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,360
a little bit if you got a small

283
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,679
container uh don't go flooding that

284
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,399
plant water it until you just get a

285
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,719
couple of drips out of there then stop

286
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,360
watering and then don't water again

287
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,480
until it looks like it really needs some

288
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,000
water the plant will tell you uh when it

289
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,720
starts to get a little sad a little bit

290
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
droopy pick it up feel it stick your

291
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,079
finger in the dirt there are a lot of

292
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,680
different ways to tell we've been

293
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,879
checking the moisture on plants for

294
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:23,078
thousands of years uh before we even had

295
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,799
electricity or moisture content meters

296
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:28,159
or any of that [ __ ] and honestly some of

297
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:30,319
the best herb I ever grew was before we

298
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,039
had all these [ __ ] toys I had two

299
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,480
magnetic ballasts in a room um nothing

300
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,919
real fancy I had a like a Home Depot fan

301
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,839
in there blowing wind around I didn't

302
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,479
have any uh the only thing that was in

303
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,079
there that was designed to be for a grow

304
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,480
were the grow lights everything else was

305
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,958
just hodg Podge put together [ __ ] I had

306
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,639
a high pressure sodium light I had a

307
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,119
metal Hy light in that room and we

308
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,399
banged out some of the uh most potent

309
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,320
most photogenic most impressive herb I

310
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,000
grew in that time period of my life

311
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,839
until I got into commercial cultivation

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,799
and then uh we got the double-ended

313
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,680
bulbs and [ __ ] went kapow but my point

314
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,199
here uh I don't even [ __ ] remember oh

315
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,359
my point we don't need all these tools

316
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,480
all these electric meters we've got the

317
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,600
tools within us we can develop these

318
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,399
skills to become that's a grower that is

319
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,360
a farmer right there not having to walk

320
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,958
and I can't tell the pH of a solution

321
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,000
without sticking a [ __ ] meter I wish

322
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:20,879
I could stick my finger in the solution

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,159
lick my finger and go 6.5 I wish I could

324
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,759
do that but that's not a skill I've got

325
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,120
I don't know how to do that as a human

326
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,319
but as a as a person I can save my time

327
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,360
I don't need to buy another tool by just

328
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,959
observing the plant like looking at it

329
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,759
is it perky is it sad is it droopy is it

330
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,039
bright green is it dark green all these

331
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,639
things tell me does it need water or not

332
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,719
does it need nutrients or not does it

333
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,159
need to be up potted does it need I can

334
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,399
see if it's too dry uh the humidity the

335
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,319
VPD I can tell the plant tells me 90% of

336
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,278
these things if you watch the plant and

337
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,360
stop relying on all the fun toys and

338
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,120
gadgets and the expensive [ __ ] uh you'll

339
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,800
develop a really solid relationship with

340
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,440
the plant you'll become that's a true

341
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,958
grower that is when you're a grower when

342
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,200
you're not just a GOOG

343
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,278
and a guy with some plants you're

344
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,480
actually learning and understanding like

345
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,078
oh I see uh this happening whatever

346
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,360
hypothetical situation I couldn't even

347
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,879
think one right now I see this um I

348
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,519
think I understand that I've grown this

349
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,838
plant enough times I overfed it

350
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,039
something that's cuz I gave it too much

351
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,760
nitrogen I can correct that uh just

352
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,599
start developing that relation with the

353
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,399
relationship with the plants and uh the

354
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,278
tools are great and they're fun but a

355
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,839
real a good farmer a good grower can

356
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:27,159
look and figure the same [ __ ] out

357
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,600
without walking all the way over there

358
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,679
and picking up my meter and coming back

359
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,800
and checking I could have just went Dink

360
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,519
and picked it up said that's like a

361
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,120
level three this plant's cool for now

362
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,278
we'll water that in a couple hours move

363
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,440

where is we where are we the question

434
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,600
what's the answer drying and curing of

435
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,039
seeds that's real easy so um before the

436
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,120
seeds are done um I let me remind you

437
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,319
that I put the lights on 18 hours on in

438
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,198
6 hours off to finish my seeds I make I

439
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,000
feel like that makes bigger fatter

440
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,039
beefier happy healthier seeds and they

441
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,078
finish more quickly so I've got my

442
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,759
lights on

443
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,679
186 um just a couple days before Harvest

444
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,240
I will go in there and pull off all as

445
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,758
many leaves as I can I want to strip

446
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,879
that room as naked as possible it's

447
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,159
going to be much easier to get the

448
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,439
leaves now than it is after I cut the

449
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:38,600
plants down so uh go in there and I'm

450
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,759
going to give you more details than you

451
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,440
asked for about harvesting you're

452
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,079
wanting the drying and curing method but

453
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,319
this is part of it to be honest with you

454
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,838
um go in there and take off all the

455
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:48,479
leaves I've got the plants naked we just

456
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,279
got a bunch of buds with seeds

457
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,159
protruding out not a lot of leaves on

458
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:54,519
there when Harvest day comes I will get

459
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,600
and depending on the size of the plant

460
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,120
it depends on what I'll use most of the

461
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,319
time you've heard me talk about it I've

462
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,240
got they either Rubbermaid or sterlite

463
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:07,519
bins they are four maybe 5 or 6 in deep

464
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,318
and they are 28 or 30 in Long by

465
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,839
probably 15 in wide just a little tray

466
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:14,278
like a big cat litter box essentially

467
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,839
it's made so that you can put clothes in

468
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:17,838
it and stash your clothes or whatever

469
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,240
[ __ ] under the bed it's not meant to be

470
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,199
real high for taking up space uh makes a

471
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,000
beautiful tray so I use one of those

472
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,599
trays per plant and the way that I will

473
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,919
do it is in the heart in the flowering

474
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,480
room I will cut down the Plant sometimes

475
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,958
it's in a trellis net we'll work it out

476
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,199
of that net the best we can uh cut down

477
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:36,239
the Plant put that plant in that

478
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,559
individual sterlite bin I will take the

479
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,919
plant tag out of the plant out of the

480
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,239
dirt and clean it off and affix that

481
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,240
plant with some duct tape to the Stick

482
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,399
of that plant now that plant is labeled

483
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,839
whatever it is that label stays with it

484
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,879
forever those bins get moved to another

485
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,800
area after I chop down every plant now I

486
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,958
will hang up those plants with plenty of

487
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,240
space between each one and I'll put the

488
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,278
plastic bin underneath it my the reason

489
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,240
for this is as those plants hang some of

490
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,119
those seeds will fall out and a lot of

491
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,679
times those become table seeds because I

492
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,558
don't want to get confused and not give

493
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,519
you the proper seed that is how it is

494
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:12,879
labeled so those seeds that fall out

495
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,038
they land on the floor they get scooped

496
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,799
into a pile those are table seeds I sell

497
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,879
those on the website for like a buck a

498
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,918
seed uh you can get like 50 of them for

499
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,079
50 bucks I think I did 100 table seeds

500
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,720
for 50 bucks during a sale that's what

501
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,838
table seeds are my seeds that I don't

502
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,120
know what the [ __ ] they are but they're

503
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,319
still really good seeds and you guys

504
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,439
will enjoy growing them uh but anyway I

505
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,720
got the plant hanging upside down I hang

506
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,240
it upside down until it becomes a very

507
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,360
specific point of dryness this is very

508
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,000
critical and the drying curing and

509
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:44,558
harvesting process my plants hang upside

510
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,319
down at this point I'm not really drying

511
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,200
or curing them so I'm not super

512
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,079
concerned about VPD I want them to dry

513
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,319
so I can get the seeds out that's I'm

514
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:54,359
not going to smoke the butt there's

515
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,759
nothing there to smoke when I put pollen

516
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,479
in a room I [ __ ] go hard I pollinate

517
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,000
the [ __ ] out of that room so it's all

518
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,480
seated it I let it get to a very

519
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,480
specific uh crispiness which I measure

520
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,120
as dry as [ __ ] that is my unit of

521
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,798
measurement I want these plants bone dry

522
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,119
I want them crispy what I'm going to do

523
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,200
when the plants are bone they're hanging

524
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,158
up they're bone dry the stems go pop if

525
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,038
I grab the buds uh they don't crumble it

526
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,480
rains [ __ ] seeds you can hear seeds

527
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:22,879
hitting the little sterlite the

528
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,960
Tupperware the rubber made bin

529
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,480
underneath it plink PL PL PL plank

530
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,000
that's how I know I'm ready I want them

531
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,640
bone dry so at this point I'll take that

532
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,839
plant off the hanger off the hook how I

533
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,919
had it hanging up I'll put it inside

534
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:37,558
that sterlite bin I'll put on a rubber

535
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,480
glove and I will hold the stick and I'll

536
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,158
pull the buds off of the stick just pull

537
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,038
them right off I don't care if I destroy

538
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,080
the buds and break the sticks none of

539
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,599
that matters I want seeds so I'm just

540
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,038
pulling the sticks out pulling the buds

541
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:50,439
off over the bin it's all falling into

542
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,440
the bin I'm taking the stick putting the

543
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,080
stick in the trash can remove as much

544
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,080
stick as possible get all of the uh Bud

545
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,678
Material off of the stick then I put on

546
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,119
uh sometimes I got to wear two gloves or

547
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,600
different gloves to do this because this

548
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,678
[ __ ] gets sticky and sometimes it'll

549
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,719
break your gloves but at this point I

550
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,440
pick up all the material and I just rub

551
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,079
it through my hands in circles and I

552
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,679
break all of the material basically into

553
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,319
like I was going to roll a fat joint and

554
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,440
we got to get the seeds out of it but

555
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:20,279
I've got a machine now once it's all

556
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,000
ground up into uh joint rolling size

557
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,759
material which I do not smoke by the way

558
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,759
that gets discarded into a compost heap

559
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,000
but once I get it all to that fine

560
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,640
powdery sort of texture then I run it

561
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,640
through a little machine it's the grow

562
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,919
easy or the easy seed seed separator

563
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,960
they're unavailable right now and hard

564
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,919
to find so I'm not even going to

565
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,240
advertise it but I've got a seed

566
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,120
separator that I run it to if you uh

567
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,919
Google seed separator hemp seed

568
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,279
separator you'll find a lot of great

569
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,880
options the the big tall Plinko machine

570
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,480
looking [ __ ] thing that works great

571
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,799
use that model use that idea but I will

572
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,159
run all those seeds through that

573
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,519
separating machine um then they'll come

574
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,880
out there'll be a pile of chaff which is

575
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,038
the sticks the wasted Bud material the

576
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,919
leaf and then the other drawer is all

577
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:03,440
seeds I got to run it through a couple

578
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,679
times to refine it and clean it but I

579
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,880
get all my seeds out then those go into

580
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,200
a baggie that is sealed and labeled uh

581
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,720
sometimes if I have enough jars they'll

582
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,640
go into the jar that gets sealed and

583
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,360
labeled you asked about the drying and

584
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,720
curing process of the seeds at this

585
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:21,079
point those seeds are ready to go I let

586
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,120
them grow so long if you're letting your

587
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:24,839
seeds finish properly they will fall out

588
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,079
a couple will fall out of the plant into

589
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,720
the dirt below and start to pop up in

590
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,519
your pots that's a really good way to

591
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,960
say I think my [ __ ] seeds are done

592
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,480
that is a really good hint of how to

593
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,640
finish uh to know you're finished but my

594
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,000
dry and cure process is on the stick

595
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,200
they just hang up there and they just

596
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,599
dry until they reach that critical

597
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,400
important point of dry as [ __ ] and then

598
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,639
I just grind them up separate it pull

599
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
the seeds out uh the rest of the stuff

600
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
sometimes it goes to the chicken cou and

601
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,599
not mine but there's a a homie with the

602
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,200
chicken Coe shout out to Jesse or

603
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,439
sometimes a compost bin one time I put

604
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,600
it in the bokashi bucket we get creative

605
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
get rid of that waste of the most

606
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,558
creative and uh economical way we can I

607
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,240
don't put in the trash can that I wanted

608
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,839
to go some it's organic and it's not

609
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,159
organic it's organic material you know

610
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,399
what I mean it's carbon based I wanted

611
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,320
to go re put it back to the Earth man

612
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,080
that's what I'm saying but uh my whole

613
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:12,599
dry and cure process with the seeds is

614
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:15,079
basically up there on the stick while

615
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,719
they're hanging uh let them get dry

616
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,558
we're not going to smoke them and they

617
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,079
could be ready as soon as that plant

618
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,639
cuts down but it's easier to separate

619
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,918
them when it's super dry is why I do

620
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,640
that so if you're letting them get

621
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,960
finished they're almost ready by the

622
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,960
time you cut them down off the stick

623
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,200
they're falling into the dirt and

624
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,440
germinating they're ready to rock so

625
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,558
just let them get dry as [ __ ] sift them

626
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,000
out uh put them in a jar make sure

627
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,440
they're dry dry before you put them in

628
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,558
the jar if there's any moisture on there

629
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,120
and you put them in the jar uh they will

630
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:42,558
get some mildew growing on the seeds

631
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,959
that way maybe leave the lid off and

632
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,519
stir them around for a few days but by

633
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,319
this point they should be plenty dry so

634
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,679
I think I've said the catchphrase dry as

635
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:54,119
[ __ ] uh and crumble them out and then

636
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,400
get them out maybe get a machine if not

637
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,798
spend all [ __ ] day sitting there

638
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,038
tipping a record back and forth and

639
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,079
getting the seeds from the chaff

640
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:01,400
um you don't have to do that though

641
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,918
because I'm going to send you a coupon

642
