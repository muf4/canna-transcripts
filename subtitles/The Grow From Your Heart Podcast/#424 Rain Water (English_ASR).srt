83
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,879
is for so just knowing that I'm helping

84
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,370

85
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,469
thought about how far my show reaches I

86
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,120
know I get a lot of comments I know I

87
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:19,830
get a lot of emails I get a lot of

88
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,980
interaction but I'm really not sure

89
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,900
exactly how much help I am providing so

90
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,939
thank you that means a lot to me just to

91
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,409
know that I'm probably reaching further

92
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,599
than I had realized is a great

93
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,159
compliment and a great little boost so

94
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,229
thank you I'm gonna continue with the

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,239
email that goes on to say when I decided

96
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:38,579
to email you my question I just plan to

97
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,009
email you and ask you the question but

98
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,320
you asked on your show what 4/20 means

99
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:45,449
to me I know it's a little bit late and

100
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,569
I'm not saying this because of a contest

101
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:51,988
but when 4/20 means to me is seeing my

102
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,939
mom smile so let me explain so what this

103
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:56,819
email is referring to right here is a

104
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,889
few episodes before 4/20 I started

105
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,769
asking my audience for submissions to

106
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,599
tell me what 4/20 means to you so this

107
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,489
guy is a little bit late for the 4/20

108
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,229
episode but I still want to hear his

109
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,200
opinion and I still want to share his

110
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:11,759
4/20 story with you and what 4/20 means

111
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,060
to him so let's continue with the

112
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,009
message it goes like this again I am in

113
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,410
prohibition land right now in the Bible

114
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:21,329
Belt so growing up my mom was a

115
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,550
schoolteacher and of course we all grew

116
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,220
up with the impression that cannabis was

117
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,810
the devil so as a teenager when she

118
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,170
found out I smoked cannabis

119
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,860
she was pissed but even worse she was

120
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,110
disappointed in me

121
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,150
oh that phrase right there have you ever

122
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,040
had a parent say I'm not mad at you but

123
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:40,199
I'm disappointed in you that's just

124
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,180
that's the worst I'd rather somebody be

125
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,250
[ __ ] mad at me cuz I [ __ ] up when

126
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,750
you feel I'm disappointed in you

127
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,519
I'm not even mad I'm just disappointed

128
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,230
that makes you feel like [ __ ] as a

129
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,269
person that makes you feel about two

130
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,810
inches tall it just makes you feel so

131
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,909
weak

132
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,290
you're like ah you know they're only a

133
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,820
couple of people you really want to make

134
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,620
happy in the world and when you're

135
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:01,349
younger it's your mom and your dad and

136
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,139
when one of them says I'm disappointed

137
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,629
oh that is [ __ ] everything up so I get

138
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,569
you even worse she was disappointed in

139
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:12,629
me so let's fast forward I am 36 now

140
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:15,599
when I was 31 my mom was diagnosed with

141
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:17,909
severe rheumatoid arthritis and that is

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,100
painful and miserable and I'm sorry to

143
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,169
hear that the message says little did I

144
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,580
know what my mother was about to go

145
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:25,709
through

146
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:28,079
absolutely RA is miserable to experience

147
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:30,599
and it is almost as miserable watching

148
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,609
someone you love experience those sort

149
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,960
of symptoms you can almost see the pain

150
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,669
in their hands you can almost see the

151
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,319
pain in their joints when they walk if

152
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,240
you know that person you have seen them

153
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,189
go from a healthy person to a person who

154
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,449
hurts and that's just terrible to see so

155
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:45,060
let's keep going with the message it

156
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,769
says within four years my mom had both

157
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,689
of her hips and both of her shoulders

158
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:49,709
replaced from her joints flattening that

159
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:52,319
sounds painful

160
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:54,899
then shortly after she was diagnosed

161
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,269
with severe COPD and congestive heart

162
00:05:54,899 --> 00:06:00,299
failure the doctor told my mom that she

163
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:03,329
had two choices he could prescribe her

164
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,668
opioid pain meds and she would be on

165
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:07,529
them for the rest of her life and if she

166
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:09,870
went a day without them basically god

167
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,639
bless her soul the other option was

168
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,860
taking drugs that killed her immune

169
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,269
system so she would get sick easily and

170
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,400
the sickness would get really bad

171
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:20,759
because her body can't fight it off

172
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,449
naturally so she picked the opioid meds

173
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,769
because it honestly was the safer option

174
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,930
man she didn't have much to choose from

175
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:30,659
she had crap or a crap and it sounds

176
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,949
like she picked the less crappy crap man

177
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,470
I'm sorry to hear that your mom and your

178
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,538
family are in this type of situation as

179
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,490
if the RA weren't enough then she had to

180
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:41,579
have surgeries then she ends up with

181
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,228
COPD which is a chronic obstructive

182
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,459
pulmonary disorder which makes it hard

183
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:47,188
to breathe and you feel like you're

184
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:49,138
drowning constantly and she's also got

185
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,659
congestive heart failure it sounds like

186
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,848
she's having a string of bad luck then

187
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:55,680
we've got her on opioid pain medicine

188
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:58,500
which can't turn out well for her so

189
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,050
let's keep reading it says since we are

190
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,689
in Indiana there is no medical cannabis

191
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,418
so she had no other option than to wipe

192
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:10,020
out her immune system or just literally

193
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:12,779
suffer my mom being my mom she just quit

194
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,029
the pain meds and suffered and that is

195
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:17,068
that's a strong lady right there for two

196
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:19,408
years she couldn't sleep or walk without

197
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,900
groaning every step because it hurts so

198
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:24,269
badly she is on oxygen and she can't

199
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,728
smoke any good edible is impossible to

200
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:28,889
get around here you can get butter

201
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:31,500
someone made and I'm not even sure is

202
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,689
real but one day my buddy came back from

203
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,680
vacation from Cali and brought edible

204
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:40,769
gummy bears me being me I had to buy

205
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,240
some and try them I ate two of them that

206
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:44,698
night and I woke up the next morning

207
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,310
sitting in my recliner with a bowl of

208
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,348
melted ice cream spilled all over my lap

209
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,060
all right so it sounds like the gummy

210
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:52,560
bears worked you ate two of them they

211
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,060
put you out while you were eating ice

212
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,668
cream you woke up with ice cream all

213
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,098
over your lap dude imagine how asleep

214
00:07:56,668 --> 00:08:00,448
this guy had to be if cold ice cream I

215
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,399
know it was melted but it still wasn't

216
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:05,580
warm and it was spilled in his lap on

217
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,079
his junk imagine how soundly this guy

218
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:09,028
was sleep and those gummy bears were

219
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,490
working let's continue with the email it

220
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:14,370
says so I decide I'm gonna make my mom

221
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,759
try one alright so this guy's mom was a

222
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,939
teacher she was anti cannabis she was

223
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,319
not mad at him she was disappointed when

224
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,800
she discovered that this person was a

225
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,990
cannabis consumer so this guy is going

226
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,168
to try to give his mom one of these

227
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,269
cannabis infused gummy bears so let's

228
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:35,250
jump back into the email it says I game

229
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,440
planned all day how I was gonna bring it

230
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,990
up to her and had built up the level of

231
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,880
balls to actually offer my 60 year old

232
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,509
ex school teacher mom cannabis which

233
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:47,370
isn't even legal here so finally I go

234
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:49,078
over there the next evening and I just

235
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,818
drop it on her I told her I have

236
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:53,370
something I think will help her sleep

237
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:55,949
she asked what and I told her and what

238
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,049
happened next blew my mind

239
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,850
so this guy finally got the balls he

240
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:01,379
drove over there and he said mom I got

241
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,690
something I think is gonna help you and

242
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:06,778
what happened next is going to blow our

243
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,579
minds because she told me she has wanted

244
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,828
to try it and has been reading about it

245
00:09:08,578 --> 00:09:13,588
but didn't figure she would ever be able

246
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:16,109
to get any because of their location so

247
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:18,300
she snatched the gummy bear out of my

248
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,940
hand and couldn't chew it up fast enough

249
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:23,129
that's pretty cool that your mom was not

250
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,829
only open to the idea but she had been

251
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:29,220
excited and researching the idea herself

252
00:09:25,828 --> 00:09:30,929
that shows you what pain and suffering

253
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,000
will do to you when you were in pain

254
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:34,528
long enough and nothing works and you've

255
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,089
got enough things making you

256
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:38,159
uncomfortable and you've tried something

257
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,779
and it just made you even worse then

258
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,719
will open your mind you may say you know

259
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:45,539
what I think I'm ready to try just about

260
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,850
anything so that opened this lady's mind

261
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:50,338
she was ready to try some cannabis she

262
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,050
snatched up this gummy bear she chewed

263
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,120
it up I want to read more into this it

264
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:56,159
says I lived 30 minutes away from her

265
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,078
and a different City but my brother was

266
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,719
taking care of her that night so I went

267
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,789
home the next day my mom calls me and

268
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,629
tells me she got the best sleep she has

269
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:09,569
had since she got RA even better than

270
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:11,578
with any pills my bro said she was

271
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,850
walking to the bathroom without groaning

272
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:19,049
in pain and was even walking faster than

273
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,430
regular so this lady ate one cannabis

274
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,809
infused gummy bear I don't know how many

275
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:25,139
milligrams it was I don't know the

276
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:27,359
potency I don't know the THC CBD ratio

277
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,909
ahh it doesn't seem that that matters

278
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,209
too much because it worked it helped

279
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:37,189
improve the quality of this young lady's

280
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:39,899
life her rheumatoid arthritis is not

281
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,420
debilitating her because cannabis eased

282
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:45,089
up the symptoms enough for her to walk

283
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,649
to the bathroom without groaning imagine

284
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:49,230
if something you have to do multiple

285
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,940
times a day like simply walk to the

286
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,930
bathroom everybody has to do that you

287
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,760
got to get there somehow

288
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:55,019
you got to either roll over there you

289
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,759
got to crawl over there you got to walk

290
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,839
over there you can do cartwheels you've

291
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,220
got to get there if you're gonna take a

292
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,510
piss you've got to get there or you get

293
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,850
to wallow around in your own piss all

294
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,740
day imagine if that was painful

295
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,839
just getting up right now to go piss it

296
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,730
hurts my back hurts my hips hurt my

297
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,900
knees hurt it takes effort I have to

298
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:14,009
grunt and groan

299
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:15,899
sound like this Oh Oh I'm just trying to

300
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,819
get up imagine if your pain felt like

301
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,500
that and you found something that you

302
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,000
could eat and it would take your pain

303
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,679
away enough to order you don't groan

304
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,879
you're still gonna hurt you're still

305
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,500
gonna have some some aches and pains

306
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,929
some discomfort but if you could just

307
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,789
take that one level up oh I just tone

308
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,620
that down take that off of it you are

309
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,539
improving the quality of your life and

310
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,789
for that not to be allowed because of

311
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:38,338
some invisible line that separates

312
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:41,099
States from states and legality from

313
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,570
legality that is [ __ ] stupid this

314
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,190
lady feels better because she ate

315
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,260
something that came off of a plant that

316
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,200
grows out of the ground and the law is

317
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,639
trying to stop that from happening all

318
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,140
right I'm getting way off track let's

319
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,480
get back on track here there is more to

320
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,519
this message it says the problem is I

321
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,009
can't barely get edibles here I've

322
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,659
gotten edibles three more times since

323
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,759
that people have brought from legal

324
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:04,319
states and every time I get and give

325
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,789
them to my mom she gets the biggest

326
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,950
smile on her face

327
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:10,559
because she knows she's going to get

328
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,990
some relief and some sleep again that

329
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,689
invisible line that prevents people from

330
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,060
getting relief and sleep is [ __ ]

331
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,920
ridiculous in my mind there's more to

332
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,019
this email and it says even though it is

333
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,789
just a few hours of a break it means

334
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,769
everything to her oh yeah I'm sure

335
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:27,509
that's like setting down weights that

336
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:29,250
you've been carrying all day like pain

337
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:31,439
is terrible pain will put you in a bad

338
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,089
mood pain will make you depressed pain

339
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,500
will make you not able to enjoy your

340
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:38,820
life so that few hours of relief is

341
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,708
everything to her that is the best few

342
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,260
hours of her month probably when she

343
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:45,389
gets to eat that edible 3045 minutes

344
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,458
after it kicks in that is the best time

345
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,528
of her month so I can imagine that she

346
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,929
gets a big smile on her face even though

347
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:53,549
it is just a few hours he says we will

348
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:55,919
be lucky to have her with us for another

349
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:58,229
year so I can't think of anything better

350
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,069
that I could give her at this point in

351
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,950
her life

352
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,300
wow that is a bold finishing sentence

353
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,610
right there you'll be lucky to have her

354
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:07,769
with you for another year oh man I'm

355
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,580
glad you have found something to keep

356
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:12,929
her comfortable for this year I am

357
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,400
saddened to hear that you've only got

358
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:16,889
her for another year please enjoy that

359
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,958
year with her I can't encourage you to

360
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:21,179
acquire edibles in your illegal State I

361
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,729
can't do anything to help you out but

362
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:26,039
man I hope that somehow you were able

363
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,569
to keep mom heavily medicated I hope

364
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,458
you're able to spend a lot of time with

365
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:31,259
her I just enjoy her while she's here

366
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,688
and keep her as comfortable as you

367
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,909
possibly can he wraps up this portion of

368
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:40,019
the message and it says so that is what

369
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:43,438
4/20 means to me dude that is a serious

370
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,028
heavy deep 4/20 message I appreciate

371
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:48,448
that thank you for sharing so much with

372
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:48,928
me we got a lot of really serious really

373
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:51,358
deep

374
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,980
what does 4/20 mean to you submissions

375
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:55,528
and I appreciate that thank you to

376
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,989
everybody for opening up so much to me

377
00:13:55,528 --> 00:14:00,989
to the audience for the show for the

378
00:13:57,989 --> 00:14:02,790
sake of cannabis thank you now there is

379
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:05,100
a second half to this email this is the

380
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:07,828
question portion and it goes a lot like

381
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,259
this but here is my question

382
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:12,988
since the cannabis here is all shitty

383
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:15,629
schwag Mexican brick [ __ ] I've

384
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:17,278
decided I'm going to grow or hopefully

385
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:20,278
grow some quality cannabis to make

386
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,259
edibles for my mom like I said earlier I

387
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:23,938
can't encourage condone or promote you

388
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,949
doing anything illegal but you're an

389
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:28,318
adult so you're responsible for yourself

390
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:30,269
and I am proud of you for taking action

391
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:32,009
to take care of your mom I will continue

392
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:34,048
with the message and it says I know

393
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:36,089
hydro isn't the smartest way for a noob

394
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:38,519
but from what I understand it is quicker

395
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,679
I'm also going to grow three plants in

396
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,139
soil in case I [ __ ] up the hydro but I

397
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:45,028
have studied a lot more on soil growing

398
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,350
all right so let's talk about one

399
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:49,379
statement here in that first paragraph

400
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:51,028
he says I know hydro is it the smartest

401
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,579
for a new but from what I understand it

402
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:56,038
is quicker your plants will grow more

403
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:57,778
quickly you may be able to cut off seven

404
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:59,668
to ten days of your veg time depending

405
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,470
on how big you want your plants but it's

406
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:03,629
not going to go so much more quickly

407
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,839
than it's going to save you a lot of

408
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:08,038
time especially in a small home grow

409
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,350
you're probably going to be running

410
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:11,938
small plants one or two weeks at the

411
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,220
very most is all you're going to save

412
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:16,139
and a hydro setup and it's going to take

413
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,139
you a couple of runs to get that dialed

414
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,808
in so yes they may grow more quickly you

415
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:23,850
may see more productivity in a hydro

416
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:25,948
system but it is going to take more

417
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,319
detail it is going to take more work you

418
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:31,318
have to pay much more attention you'll

419
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:33,688
also notice that the plants in soil are

420
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:35,578
much more forgiving than the plants in

421
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:36,870
your hydro system if you mess up with

422
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:38,459
your soil crop you

423
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,560
can rescue it if you make a small

424
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,210
mistake in your hydroponic setup you

425
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,699
will notice it and it may be hard to

426
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,970
recover so soil is much more forgiving

427
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,129
now talking about being faster it is

428
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,950
going to take the same amount of time to

429
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,809
flower if you were in soil soilless mix

430
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,610
hydro whatever you're growing in

431
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:58,588
whatever your setup is if your plant

432
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,960
takes nine weeks to flower it's going to

433
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:03,210
take nine weeks to flower you can't make

434
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,519
you go faster because of your medium so

435
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,230
yes in theory your hydroponic plant will

436
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,778
grow a little more quickly it'll have

437
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,789
more vigor it may get larger but it also

438
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:13,830
is more work it takes a lot more

439
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:16,679
attention to detail and if you mess up

440
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,870
it is much harder to correct your

441
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,729
mistake it sounds like you've got a

442
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,500
great idea you're going to run a few

443
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,139
plants in hydro you're going to run a

444
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,159
few plants in soil I'm really hoping

445
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:28,740
that you're going to run the same

446
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,360
cultivar in each setup so that you can

447
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,610
pay attention to what's going on and not

448
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,560
be confused by different plants reacting

449
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,419
differently what I mean by that is in

450
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,699
your hydroponic setup and your soil

451
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,399
setup I hope you've got golden goat in

452
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,550
hydro and golden goat in soil and not

453
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,610
golden goat in soil and [ __ ] blue

454
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:49,079
dream in hydro because those are two

455
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,750
different plants are going to grow two

456
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,150
different ways it is much easier to have

457
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,799
one plant and learn that one plant I've

458
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:58,649
talked about that in previous episodes

459
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:01,079
this is just my suggestion again you're

460
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:03,809
a grown-ass man or a grown-ass woman or

461
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,699
a grown-ass non-binary gender - dolt

462
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:08,818
do whatever you want to do hashtag

463
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,199
America but I would suggest one cultivar

464
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:12,420
I would try to run the same thing

465
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,400
especially as a new grower running

466
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,050
multiple setups you can learn a lot this

467
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,480
way you've got an opportunity to learn a

468
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,818
lot about one specific cultivar so if

469
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,068
you can get six clones or eight clones

470
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:25,109
of one thing and plant them in your

471
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:26,970
hydro and in your soil and then you have

472
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,369
some room for experiments with each one

473
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,079
within each setup you can learn a lot of

474
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:33,149
things that is basically like having two

475
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:36,029
grows that you can experiment on at the

476
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,070
same time but I again highly suggest one

477
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:39,720
cultivar I do know that you're in

478
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:41,819
prohibition land so you're going to have

479
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,589
to get whatever you get you may not have

480
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:46,200
access to clones I don't know how you

481
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:48,178
feel about ordering seeds online it

482
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,799
doesn't sound like you're going to do a

483
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,700
female hunt it sounds like you're ready

484
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,009
just to get Starr

485
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,330
so once you get clones or seeds I assume

486
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,799
you're going to just pop some in these

487
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:58,049
pots and get started I would suggest

488
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,210
doing a quick phyno hunt I've done

489
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:02,309
episodes on Fino hunting before I would

490
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,230
do a quick phyno hunt find a keeper and

491
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:06,000
then clone that cultivar and run it

492
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,430
throughout all of your systems learn

493
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,160
that cultivar learn your systems and get

494
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,720
that dialed in if you're interested in

495
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,970
listening to the pheno hunt episode I

496
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,539
did an entire talk about Fino hunting on

497
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:20,700
episode 376 so I suggest starting with a

498
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:22,559
Fino hunt narrow it down to one keeper

499
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,509
then work that one keeper and all

500
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,470
systems that is my idea for what I would

501
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:27,240
do if I were you

502
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,160
alright there is more to this email so I

503
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,170
need to get my rambley ass back on track

504
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,210
big shot at again to the Tropicana

505
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,640
cookies full-spectrum extract it really

506
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,789
got me talkative for this episode there

507
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,520
is more it says my question is this and

508
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:43,559
it relates to both soil and hydro I

509
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,019
always hear you talk about reverse

510
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,649
osmosis or filtered water being the best

511
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:51,779
to use how about pH rain water would

512
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,030
that be good to use to put your nuts in

513
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,710
and water your soil plants or to run in

514
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:58,170
your deep water culture reservoir I'm

515
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:01,380
just wondering because I went to Walmart

516
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,630
and I have a 20 gallon rez ro water was

517
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,940
six dollars and fifty cents for five

518
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,100
gallons so if I go that route I'll be

519
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,890
spending thirty two dollars a week just

520
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:13,619
on water if rainwater isn't good is

521
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,410
there a cheaper option rain water is

522
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:19,409
acceptable rain water will contain trace

523
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,330
minerals just be careful in most regions

524
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,700
rain water should be safe if you live in

525
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:25,529
a really densely if you live in China

526
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,390
you may reconsider that if you've got a

527
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:30,389
lot of pollution a lot of fog you may

528
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,550
reconsider most areas you should be okay

529
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,440
one thing to think about when you were

530
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:36,629
collecting rainwater how are you

531
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,160
gathering it is that water running off

532
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,660
of something before it gets to your

533
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,490
collection vessel is it coming off of

534
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,680
the tin roof which may have rust on it

535
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,180
which may have other stuff on it

536
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,860
just think about where that water is

537
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,990
running before it ends up in your

538
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:50,549
collection vessel and it should be safe

539
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,220
to feed to your plants of course add

540
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:55,019
your nutrients then adjust the pH you're

541
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,880
gonna want to put nutrients in it then

542
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:58,859
adjust the pH before feeding it to the

543
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,030
plants don't adjust the pH then put

544
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:03,029
newts in it because you're going to have

545
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:03,819
to adjust the pH once again so nutrients

546
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:06,428
pH

547
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:07,989
check your EC and your ppm and then feed

548
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:10,419
it to the plants if you were in the

549
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:12,429
acceptable ranges there is a follow-up

550
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,830
question it says also what is the best

551
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:17,919
temperature to keep my water in my res

552
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:20,408
I'm reading everything from 55 to 72

553
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,840
degrees thanks again for what you do you

554
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:23,590
can use my name and location on the show

555
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,388
if you wish

556
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:27,908
maybe someone important will hear it and

557
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:30,428
change these BS laws here so my mother

558
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:32,409
can get the relief she so desperately

559
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,659
needs and deserves

560
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:36,429
best wishes bro and then he sends a fist

561
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:39,729
bump hey thanks for the great message

562
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:42,340
man I hope that somebody realizes that

563
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:44,048
cannabis is helping your mother improve

564
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:45,939
the quality of her life and they will

565
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:47,470
help change those [ __ ] laws that we

566
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,210
talked about so let's address this

567
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,729
question he said what is the best

568
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,950
temperature to keep the water in my

569
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:57,278
reservoir I'm going to say somewhere

570
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:59,769
between 62 and 68 degrees is the best

571
00:20:57,278 --> 00:21:01,868
range to keep the temperature of the

572
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,608
water in your reservoir any colder than

573
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:05,138
that the plants will start slowing down

574
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:06,939
they won't take up any nutrients the

575
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,709
metabolism will start slowing down their

576
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,840
plants will actually think that it is

577
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,519
becoming wintertime if you are not

578
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:14,769
flowering the plants they may try to

579
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,960
flower they may try to start finishing

580
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:18,700
and ripening up because that's what they

581
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,619
think is time for they think oh it's

582
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,558
cold winter is coming it is time to

583
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:25,628
finish up so somewhere between 62 and 68

584
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:27,398
degrees would be your ideal temperature

585
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:30,579
to keep your plants in their most

586
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:32,558
vigorous state of growth alright that

587
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:34,358
was a long great email I want to thank

588

593
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:46,089
the start of the show I had two emails

594
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:47,440
to read that one email got away from me

595
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:49,269
I got a little rambling a little

596
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,580
long-winded because of these Tropicana

597
