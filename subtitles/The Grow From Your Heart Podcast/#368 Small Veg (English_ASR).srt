42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,978
this is going to be another grow lesson

43
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:43,319
I hope you have been following along

44
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:45,239
with my long series of grow lessons we

45
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,250
started off by selecting a goal for our

46
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,379
grow we worked on selecting a proper

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,090
space we built a good grow room we

48
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,310
decided if we wanted to grow from seeds

49
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,799
or clones we acquired seeds and clones

50
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,439
we have got them sprouted now they are

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,600
potted into their little pots I think by

52
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,728
this time all of our seeds and clones

53
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,859
should be about the same size we've got

54
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:06,929
stuff any either a four inch pot or a

55
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,969
six inch net pot we should have clones

56
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,920
or seedlings with just a few sets of

57
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,780
leaves they're probably four maybe six

58
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,919
inches tall by now and that is what I

59
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,379
call small

60
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,109
vej so let's do a podcast about the

61
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,719
small vegetative phase of growing your

62
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,489
cannabis garden in my opinion the

63
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,310
vegetative phase of growing cannabis is

64
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:28,349
often the most overlooked phase of

65
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,449
growing people think they need to invest

66
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,909
all their time energy and money on the

67
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:34,979
flowering process that is very important

68
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:37,169
but I like to believe that you can't

69
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,929
build a strong building without a solid

70
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:43,259
foundation and that foundation starts in

71
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,120
the veg phase by the time we get these

72
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,709
plants to the flowering room we need

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,810
them to be healthy we need them to be

74
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,370
robust we need them the shape we want

75
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,650
them we need them the structure we want

76
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,650
them and we need them pests and pathogen

77
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,340
during the small vegetative stage is to

78
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,080
develop a strong root system for these

79
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,969
plants I want to get those roots thick

80
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,920
and busting out of that pot before I

81
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,680
transplant them into their forever homes

82
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,259
my second goal is to keep these plants

83
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,150
past and pathogen free now if I'm

84
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:15,359
working from seeds I'm also paying

85
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,010
attention for issues mutations problems

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,320
whatever a seedling may show you a

87
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,090
ceiling has a ton of options that can

88
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,500
occur through the entire growth cycle

89
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,299
you need to pay special attention to

90
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,579
your seedlings if you're growing from

91
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,530
clones you should know what to expect so

92
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,109
my main focus during this small

93
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,629
vegetative phase is developing a strong

94
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:35,850
root system my second priority is

95
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:37,229
maintaining clean healthy plants I don't

96
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:39,659
want any bugs and I don't need any

97
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,578
pathogens then my third priority if I'm

98
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,500
growing from seeds I want to pay close

99
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,030
attention to those seedlings and I want

100
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,699
to keep my eye out for any weird

101
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,259
mutations or weird problems now if

102
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,988
things go right we are only going to

103
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,419
spend two to four weeks in these small

104
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:57,120
pots in our small veg phase but in my

105
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:59,399
opinion this phase is equally as

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,590
important as the flowering process we

107
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,200
need to treat every step of the grow

108
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,420
process as an important process we all

109
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,669
want to focus on that flowering phase we

110
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,039
all get excited around week four we get

111
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,138
super pumped up at week five by week six

112
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,060
you're just ecstatic week seven and

113
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,590
eight you can't wait to cut it down by

114
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,120
week nine you're in there every single

115
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,349
day taking pictures looking at the

116
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,910
plants hoping you can cut them down

117
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,890
today or tomorrow just trying to be

118
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,200
patient why don't we put that much

119
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,519
energy into the starting phase of our

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,329
plants I know they're not as pretty

121
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,000
there's nothing

122
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:31,529
show for it but it is just as import now

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,649
let's get a little deeper into this

124
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:36,959
small veg phase what makes this small

125
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:39,000
veg what makes it small veg as my plants

126
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,198
are small they are in small pots now

127
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,939
what makes it veg veges the light cycle

128
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,468
cannabis plants are triggered by the

129
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,569
light cycle if they have enough light

130
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:50,430
they will not flower once we reduce the

131
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,680
light to approximately 12 hours on and

132
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,449
12 hours off every day that triggers our

133
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,860
plants to flower they think that the

134
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,538
fall is coming they think it's the end

135
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,949
of the season they start doing their

136
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:01,439
end-of-season business which is

137
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:03,478
producing flowers the parts that we call

138
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,759
buds are the cannabis flowers they are

139
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:08,370
dried flower tops from a cannabis plant

140
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,038
that is induced by changing the light

141
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,829
cycle so until we manipulate that light

142
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,538
cycle we are in veg since we are using

143
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:18,359
small pots and have small plants once

144
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:20,009
again we are back to small now let's

145
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,348
talk a little bit about these light

146
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:25,979
cycles we've got plenty of options for

147
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:28,168
light cycles in our veg phase from what

148
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:31,740
I have experienced the most common and

149
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:35,490
most popular veg light schedule is 18

150
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,129
hours on and 16 hours off in a daily 24

151
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,639
hour cycle there are other options you

152
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:44,310
can go 24 hours on and 0 hours off I

153
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,500
have seen great success with 2 hours of

154
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,658
darkness so that's 22 hours on and two

155
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,639
hours off every day in a commercial

156
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:53,459
facility and a mother room and in a veg

157
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,879
room I am known to do 20 hours on and

158
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:58,829
four hours off now I mentioned the 18:6

159
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,229
that is kind of a classic that's really

160
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:03,810
close to what nature does also there is

161
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:06,568
the sixteen on and eight hours off all

162
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,430
of these have their advantages also they

163
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:10,740
all have their disadvantage

164
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,259
what is the advantage of 24 hours and

165
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,750
zero hours of darkness 24 hours of light

166
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:19,050
means your plants are getting 24 hours

167
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:22,050
of light energy I usually recommend a 24

168
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:25,139
hour on cycle only for clones and tiny

169
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,759
plants or if your rivetting sometimes we

170
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,319
have mother plants that if they get root

171
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,580
bound or if they don't get enough light

172
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,189
or if they don't get the proper energy

173
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,500
they will decide to OTO flower on you

174
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:36,538
over time I like to keep those plants

175
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,158
under 24 hours of light that does

176
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:39,389
prevent them from flipping themselves

177
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:40,889
into flower because of another

178
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:42,689
environmental factor

179
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,000
so most of the time I would not

180
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:46,500
recommend a 24-hour light cycle unless

181
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,418
you were cutting clones or you're trying

182
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,370
to revenge or perhaps you've got a

183
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:52,378
mother plant it gets temperamental and

184
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,079
wants to try to auto flower on you

185
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,330
I like the 20 on and 4 off for a

186
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,430
commercial environment I like a little

187
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:01,680
bit of dark cycle I think every living

188
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,569
thing likes a little bit of dark cycle

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,280
I think roots develop in the dark I

190
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:08,789
think the plants like a little rest

191
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,068
also that is 4 hours of electricity not

192
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:12,568
being sucked up if you've got one light

193
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:15,120
you're saving a little bit of money if

194
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:17,580
you've got 50 lights you were saving a

195
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,840
lot of money that is 200 light hours

196
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,568
that you are not running right there

197
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,918
that's 200,000 watt light hours that you

198
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,830
don't have to pay for if you've got a

199
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,389
larger facility so 20 hours on four

200
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:29,038
hours off is always great for a

201
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,538
commercial facility you can keep your

202
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,158
mother plants in that room you can keep

203
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:34,228
your small veg in that room you can keep

204
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:35,879
your large veg in that room usually I

205
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:38,188
put the clones in that same room

206
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,300
underneath the t5 light in the corner so

207
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,528
there's just a little bit of light in

208
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,788
the room it doesn't really bother the

209
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:43,408
rest of the plants they're able to do

210
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:44,939
their thing that t5 doesn't do much in a

211
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:47,098
giant bedroom in a commercial facility

212
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,199
now I always like to mention the

213
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:51,478
downside of what I'm talking about

214
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,419
there's not much of a downside to a 20

215
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,978
on and 4 off cycle I guess really the

216
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:57,870
only downside is that you are always

217
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:58,620
running lights you only get four hours

218
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,838
of darkness

219
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,620
compared to my next method which is an

220
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:06,990
18 on and 6 hour off everyday cycle a

221
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,899
lot of growers prefer this because it is

222
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,460
closer to the natural cycles of life it

223
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:13,560
is closer to the natural rhythms of the

224
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,838
Sun outside it's a little closer to the

225
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,278
natural circadian rhythm that our plants

226
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:18,838
would be subject to in their normal

227
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:21,899
environment and it just feels a little

228
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:24,718
more natural in general so the pros to

229
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:27,568
an 18-6 cycle is it feels pretty natural

230
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:29,668
to you and the plants it also saves you

231
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:31,770
quite a bit of electricity having a six

232
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:33,598
hour night cycle that is six hours that

233
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:35,098
you don't have your lights on that's six

234
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,469
hours you don't have to cool the room as

235
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,060
much that's and multiply that by however

236
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:41,339
many lights you've got and you start

237
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,218
saving more and more money and I also

238
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,480
think the plants really enjoy a nice six

239
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,760
hour nap you can see a lot of

240
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,579
productivity from that 6 hour nap that

241
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:54,419
the plants get now our next option is a

242
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:54,819
16 and 8 cycle that is very similar to

243
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:57,759
the 8

244
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,920
six but some plants will show you some

245
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:03,220
differences some plants may try to

246
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,870
flower under that 16 8 cycle if they get

247
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,000
root bound if they become nutrient

248
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,460
deficient if there are any environmental

249
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,679
factors that stress those plants they

250
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,800
may decide to flower on you underneath

251
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,569
that 16 and 8 light cycle depending on

252
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,459
what part of the globe your plants

253
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,560
originated from they may have a

254
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,840
different critical period and let me

255
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,929
explain the critical period the critical

256
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,210
period is the amount of dark hours a

257
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:31,659
plant needs to induce its flowering

258
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:34,210
cycle some plants will flower with a 14

259
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:36,699
hour dark cycle some plants will flower

260
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,920
with a 10 hour dark cycle the reason we

261
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,300
go for that 12 on 12 off is it's right

262
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,099
in the middle and it seems to work well

263
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:44,529
with most of the plants that we have

264
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,690
bread for our indoor environment now

265
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,490
since some plants come from north of the

266
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,230
Equator and some plants come from south

267
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,019
of the equator we do have different

268
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,370
flowering times in tropical areas those

269
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:55,990
plants can flower for much longer

270
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,600
because they're not going to get snowed

271
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,879
on also in those areas we don't get as

272
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,529
drastic of a day and night cycle change

273
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,240
there may be as much as one hour

274
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:07,209
difference between your summer and your

275
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,090
winter day period in other areas we get

276
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:12,879
winter we get snow we get dumped on and

277
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,310
we get long dark periods so our plants

278
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,289
have evolved and adapted and climatized

279
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:18,909
themselves to those regions then we have

280
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:21,699
bred with those plants and we've created

281
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:23,649
hybrids and brought them indoors indoors

282
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,350
some of our plants will flower with a

283
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:28,419
tan our dark period indoors some of our

284
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,670
plants will flower with a 12 hour dark

285
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,769
period we have established that 12 on

286
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:35,289
and 12 off seems to work really well for

287
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:37,449
most of the plants that we have bred now

288
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:39,370
to prevent them from flowering early we

289
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,680
like to use an extended light cycle

290
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,269
that's we put them on 16 hours on at a

291
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,459
minimum that way we know they are not

292
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:48,009
going to flower I like to go that 18

293
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,110
hours because why not give them two more

294
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,240
full hours of energy every day light is

295
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,460
the number one desired nutrient from our

296
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,950
plants white is the number one desired

297
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,990
factor for growth from our plants so why

298
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,000
not give it that extra two hours now in

299
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,370
my mind I say why not give it that full

300
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,440
20 hours every day so that we can get

301
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,419
maximum growth and give our plants a

302
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,720
four hour a nap every day I think it

303
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:10,969
works really well

304
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,209
no another reason I like the 20 on and

305
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,100
four off is I find that when I move my

306
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:18,318
plants into the flowering room and I

307
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,800
take them from a 20-hour day to a

308
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:24,019
12-hour day they induce flowering very

309
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,028
quickly in other facilities where I'm

310
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:27,740
running shorter vege periods I noticed

311
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:29,899
they take a little longer for the plants

312
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,028
to start popping up bud set their little

313
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:34,250
pre flowers the little pistols don't

314
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:36,649
start popping up as early as if I were

315
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,870
to run those plants on a long day cycle

316
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:40,698
and then kick that 12:12 right away I

317
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,620
feel like the plants go oh [ __ ] it is

318
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:44,929
time to flower we have really had a

319
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,289
reduction in daylight they know it so

320
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:51,219
that's why I do 20 on and 4 off in my

321
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:54,289
veg and mom area of course I'm running

322
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,899
sometimes I've got 50 or 75 different

323
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:58,759
cultivars in a mom room so I've really

324
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:00,948
got to keep things happy and I found

325
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,959
that the 20 on and 4 off prevents

326
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:05,208
anything from auto flowering and again

327
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:08,149
it really triggers that flowering when I

328
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:10,338
put them into the 1212 room so those are

329
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:14,720
the basic veg schedules I would

330
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:16,519
recommend 24 20 and for 18 + 6 or 16 + 8

331
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,620
I wouldn't go much lower than that you

332
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,600
may notice problems you won't have the

333
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,759
desired robust vegetative growth that

334
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,470
you need and also you may get plants

335
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,360
that decide to flower before you're

336
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,399
ready alright I feel like we know how

337
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,350
long to leave the light on now let's

338
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,958
talk about what kind of light to put

339
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,519
these plants under we don't have to

340
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,318
throw these small plants under the

341
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,879
Gavita lights right away we may crisp

342
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:39,948
them up we may roast them they may not

343
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,860
be prepared for that so I like to start

344
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:45,799
my small plants under smaller lights in

345
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,019
most situations I think a t5 would work

346
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:51,109
for most people in most commercial

347
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:52,879
environments I use the 3 foot long t5

348
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,889
fixtures they're three feet long they

349
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,110
have 8 bulbs I feel like you can fit

350
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:59,480
quite a few small veg plants under those

351
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,430
in a commercial environment I like to

352
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,519
set up a two-tiered veg

353
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:06,588
system I get a Uline rack I put plants

354
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,350
on the bottom shelf of that Uline rack I

355
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:11,629
hang a light underneath the top shelf to

356
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,670
light those plants now I've got that top

357
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:15,889
shelf freed up I put plants up there and

358
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,509
I hang a light from the ceiling now I've

359
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:19,730
got two layers of plants and I'm

360
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:22,169
maximizing my space by using a

361
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,600
two-tiered veg system

362
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:26,370
I like to use a t5 fixture for the

363
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,019
plants on the bottom shelf and then for

364
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,659
the plants on the top shelf I either use

365
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:32,278
a Kavita or a metal halide either

366
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:33,899
somewhere between a four and a thousand

367
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,519
watt depending on my space depending on

368
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,649
my environment depending on how far from

369
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,209
those plants I am but those small veg

370
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:42,059
plants start off on the bottom shelf

371
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:43,469
under the t5 s then as I transplant I

372
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,698
move them up to the top shelf and they

373
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,800
go underneath the metal halides

374
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:49,049
sometimes those are kavita's it just

375
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,458
depends again on my environment now I

376
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:52,349
really find the t5 s to be

377
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,239
cost-effective I think they're efficient

378
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,310
and I think they do a great job if you

379
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,000
want to invest a little more money on a

380
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:02,578
better light I have seen great success

381
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,820
vegging underneath LED lighting small

382
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:07,799
plants really love LED lights and also

383
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,570
those LEDs don't produce much heat and

384
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,969
they don't use a lot of electricity

385
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,920
they are a little pricey up front but I

386
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,889
think they are worth the money if you

387
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,838
get a quality LED I personally don't

388
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:21,810
have much experience with LED lighting

389
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,240
but I have seen great things from LED

390
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:26,969
lights in small veg in large veg and

391
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,698
through flower the most important thing

392
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,230
about an LED in veg is the spectrum and

393
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:33,240
that's also important when it comes to

394
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,070
t5 let me back up because I overlooked

395
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,690
that part when I was talking about t5 s

396
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,890
I do not have any notes on this this is

397
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,019
all coming out of the top of my head

398
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,708
today so let me catch myself before I go

399
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,230
too fast

400
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:45,239
t5 lights are commonly available in two

401
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,778
spectrums most of the time you will find

402
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,750
them in a 3000 Kelvin and a 6400 Kelvin

403
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:54,448
for your veg phase I recommend the 60

404
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,578
400 Kelvin they will put off a more blue

405
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:58,919
light which is what we want for the veg

406
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:00,689
later on when we move the flower we want

407
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,599
more of that orange spectrum so that's

408
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,640
when he would switch to the 3000 Kelvin

409
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,470
t5 bulbs if you are going to flower

410
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,958
under them which I do not recommend but

411
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,819
they are great for veg so spectrum is

412
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,289
very important and I almost overlooked

413
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:16,349
that when you were selecting her t5

414
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:18,719
bulbs make sure that you get the six

415
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,339
thousand four hundred Kelvin bulbs those

416
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,040
are what I would recommend for your veg

417
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:25,230
phase I also recommend the bluer or

418
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,509
wider spectrum lights when it comes to

419
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,699
LEDs a lot of the new LED is give you

420
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,379
the option to turn on certain boards and

421
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:33,448
turn off certain boards when you were

422
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:36,019
vegging you want more of the blue and

423
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:38,149
wider spectrums again once we turn to

424
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,819
that's when we want those orange and red

425
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:42,799
spectrums so while we're in veg whatever

426
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,129
kind of light you're using focus more on

427
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,929
the white or blue spectrums so I've got

428
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:50,000
another option for lighting that I can

429
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:53,778
recommend but I would only suggest this

430
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,120
for a very small scale grow environment

431
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:57,799
maybe for one or two very small plants

432
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,169
maybe for a cabinet grow or something

433
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,899
this would be an effective grow light in

434
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:05,120
a pinch I have seen a lot of folks build

435
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:07,970
a small grow cabinet with a compact

436
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,730
fluorescent light those CFLs they put

437
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,950
off barely any heat and they use barely

438
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,420
any electricity so if you can get enough

439
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,860
of them around your plant to feel like

440
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:18,649
you're giving it enough light the plant

441
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,750
will grow don't expect huge growth don't

442
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:23,570
expect robust plants don't expect a lot

443
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,759
of harvest but you can make a plant grow

444
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,459
with a compact fluorescent light of

445
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,110
course the more light the better but

446
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:32,359
some people are very limited in space

447
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,220
and power and some people only want a

448
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,690
small grow for a small personal

449
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,300
experiment so a compact fluorescent

450
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,690
light may work for you that would always

451
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:44,088
be my very last option now let's talk

452
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,950
about a big-boy light a lot of people

453
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:48,380
are familiar with growing under

454
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,149
high-intensity discharge lighting a lot

455
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:53,419
of people are going to flower under an

456
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:56,208
HID light if we are careful to not roast

457
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:58,819
the plants a metal halide light will be

458
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:01,069
perfect for your small veg plants maybe

459
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,410
a four hundred maybe a six hundred a

460
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,630
thousand maybe overkill unless you keep

461
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:07,519
it a little distance away you can get a

462
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,309
four hundred watt light fairly close to

463
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,720
your small plants if you keep it cool if

464
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:13,308
you've got a ducted hood and you're

465
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,929
keeping air moving over that lights

466
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:16,699
where none of that heat is making it to

467
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:18,800
your canopy you can get that four

468
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,779
hundred watt light fairly close to your

469
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,938
plants just don't let that heat roast

470
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:25,490
your plants and dehydrate your soil I

471
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:27,650
would say maybe keep a 400 watt light 18

472
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,589
to 24 inches away from your small plants

473
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,390
the t5 s you can get those t5 s six to

474
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:33,919
eight inches away from the plants the

475
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,360
bigger the light we need to go a little

476
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,340
further because it's going to be hotter

477
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,289
and more intense and you don't want to

478
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:41,089
have super hot and tense light right in

479
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,799
your face all day you survive from the

480
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:44,779
Sun and you're happy with it being real

481
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,789
far away think about the plants and the

482
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:48,740
light and the Sun and yourself having a

483
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:49,519
similar kind of a relationship you need

484
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,910
plenty of it

485
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,680
you don't

486
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,600
want anything in the way but also you

487
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,600
don't want to get barbecue so you can

488
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:59,419
put a 400 watt light 18 24 inches away a

489
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:01,579
six hundred I would probably go 2030

490
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,110
inches away a thousand watt light you're

491
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:04,759
gonna want to be a few feet away from

492
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:07,189
those small plants it's going to get hot

493
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,170
it's going to be very intense but if

494
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,299
you've got a 400 watt light and it's

495
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,560
ducted which means it's got a duct

496
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,089
coming off of each end and you're

497
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,099
sucking air through it to move that heat

498
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:18,199
away from that bulb and you've got glass

499
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:19,849
between the bulb and the canopy you

500
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,039
should be able to run a 400 watt light

501
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:24,619
with very minimal problems if you pay

502
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:26,750
attention to heat and the distance from

503
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:28,639
those plants all right I think that

504
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,339
pretty much covers our lighting options

505
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,200
for our small veg plants let's talk a

506
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:34,689
little bit about the environment let's

507
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,210
talk about the temperature and humidity

508
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,759
for these small plants in my experience

509
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,890
my small plants appear to be happiest

510
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,589
when they are somewhere between 70 and

511
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,220
80 degrees Fahrenheit I really think

512
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:50,240
they like it

513
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,339
about 75 degrees to 77 degrees is right

514
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,960
about the prime spot for small veg

515
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,879
plants that's when I see the most growth

516
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,140
that's when I see the most production

517
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,880
that's when I see the most root

518
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,060
development that's when I see the

519
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,400
happiest plants so somewhere between 70

520
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:07,339
and 80 degrees or if you can dial it in

521
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,410
perfectly 75 to 77 is that sweet spot

522
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:11,059
they really seem to like it right there

523
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,830
now for that temperature to work

524
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,049
perfectly you need to dial in your

525
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:17,029
humidity temperature and humidity work

526
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:19,009
together there is a math equation I've

527
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:21,319
done a full Episode on it this creates

528
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:24,440
what is called a vapor pressure deficit

529
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:26,779
I encourage you to listen to episode 314

530
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,730
and learn about vapor pressure deficit

531
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,859
and now let's talk about humidity these

532
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,990
small plants would like to be in an

533
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:36,919
environment with the humidity somewhere

534
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:38,839
between 50 and 70 percent I have noticed

535
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,090
that when the humidity is too low the

536
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,129
plants do not produce there is no

537
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:45,289
production for the whole day when the

538
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,000
humidity is too low the leaves start to

539
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,980
droop the plants don't make any progress

540
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,660
they don't look as robust as they should

541
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,579
the roots are not growing

542
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,680
there's no productivity in that plant

543
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:57,230
and they also start to develop a woody

544
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,660
texture on the outside of the stems so I

545
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,400
encourage proper humidity too much

546
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,769
humidity on the other hand can cause

547
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,390
similar problems it can cause slow

548
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,609
it can cause rot it can encourage

549
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,900
powdery mildew try to keep the plants

550
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:11,029
happy by giving them the proper

551
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,740
conditions how much better do you

552
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:15,109
perform when you are happy with your

553
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,099
conditions if I made you go do your job

554
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:17,659
some of you are gonna laugh at me

555
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:20,059
because you have to do this if I made

556
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,890
you go do your job outside in 30-degree

557
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:23,389
weather and shorts and a t-shirt how

558
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,820
happy are you gonna be you're not gonna

559
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,130
get [ __ ] done if I put you in shorts and

560
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:30,049
a t-shirt and put you in a 77 degree

561
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,150
room and I dial that humidity back to

562
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,680
about 50% you're gonna be completely

563
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,259
comfortable in that room and you're

564
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,090
gonna get a lot done the plants feel the

565
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:40,009
same about life if we keep them

566
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:41,750
comfortable and we keep them happy

567
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:43,940
they're gonna produce for us and give us

568
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,039
what we want if we don't keep them happy

569
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,480
if we don't treat them properly they're

570
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:49,970
not gonna give a [ __ ] it's gonna be a

571
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,890
struggle the entire grow so again for

572
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,890
temperature I want somewhere between 70

573
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,360
and 80 degrees right around 75 to 77 is

574
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,370
that sweet spot from what I have

575
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:00,859
experienced and then again with humidity

576
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:03,049
I like to stay between 50 and 70 percent

577
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,250
too low he started slowing down growth

578
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:06,319
too high

579
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,359
you start slowing down growth so that is

580
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,009
the temperature and humidity again I

581
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,529
highly recommend you go listen to

582
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:14,839
episode 314 and learn all about vapor

583
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:16,339
pressure deficit all right you guys we

584
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,199
have talked about lighting we have

585
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:19,579
talked about environment I feel like

586
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,220
this is going to turn into a long

587
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:23,839
podcast I'm 20 minutes in I am going to

588
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,160
press pause for a moment I need to take

589
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,199
a drink of course I'm gonna take a

590
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,480
couple of dabs I encourage you to dab

591
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,970
with me I will be right back and we will

592
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,029
talk about nutrients and feeding our new

593
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,620
small veg plants hey guys well I'm

594
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:38,389
taking a couple of dabs I thought it

595
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:40,159
would be a good opportunity to give

596
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,200
thanks to people who have supported the

597
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,240
show on patreon I want to give you huge

598
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,549
thanks to my friend Sam how about a

599
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,190
giant thanks to Aldrich a big giant

600
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:52,039
shout-out to Tanner Martin oeq and also

601
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:54,200
a big shout-out to Todd Keller thank you

602
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:55,430
for all of the patreon support if you

603
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,289
would like to learn how to support the

604
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:11,330
show on patreon all you have to do is go

605
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:14,269
to patreon.com/scishow and I'm ready to

606
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:15,679
talk more about our small veg plants I

607
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,960
said we were going to jump into

608
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,970
nutrients I've got

609
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,100
one more thing I want to add to our grow

610
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,850
environment before we talk about what we

611
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:25,959
are feeding let's add a small fan to our

612
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:28,269
grow environment

613
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,640
I want to ruffle each leaf of our small

614
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:33,220
plants as they grow I don't need the fan

615
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,590
blasting the plants constantly I don't

616
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,509
need the fan making the plants bend over

617
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:39,788
I don't need a whole lot of fan activity

618
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:41,890
if you've got an oscillating fan that's

619
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:43,629
perfect put it on low and just let it

620
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,190
breathe across the canopy of those

621
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,720
plants that's gonna make the plants more

622
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,909
robust and it's going to make them

623
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,740
develop stronger roots and I think the

624
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,179
plants do better when we give them a

625
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,009
little bit of wind if there's wind

626
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:56,110
outside it would get blown around a

627
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:57,879
little bit I think that what happens

628
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:59,109
when I push you if I shove you a little

629
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,278
bit not super hard you know but if I

630
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:02,619
just give you a little nudge what do you

631
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,000
do natural instinct is to spread your

632
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:05,979
feet further apart to have better

633
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,538
balance I kind of feel like if we blow

634
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,220
on a plant make it wobble around a

635
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:10,869
little bit maybe it's gonna spread its

636
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,788
roots a little bit wider to get better

637
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:15,099
balance which will also result in a more

638
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:16,990
robust stalk which will result in an

639
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:18,849
overall more productive plant when we

640
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,710
move that plant into the flowering phase

641
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:22,509
so let's give the plants a little bit of

642
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,308
wind they would get wind outside let's

643
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:27,579
introduce a little bit of that to our

644
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:30,730
indoor environment again don't blast the

645
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:33,519
plants if some of the leaves closest to

646
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,710
that fan start getting dry or leathery

647
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,200
or crinkly or they start looking like a

648
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,538
potato chip they're getting blasted too

649
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,399
hard by the fan reduce either the fan

650
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:43,750
speed or the frequency that they're

651
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:45,639
getting hit by the fan they're getting

652
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,648
too much air movement and you're

653
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,230
disrupting the vapor pressure deficit in

654
00:23:47,648 --> 00:23:51,699
that area so pay attention to the leaves

655
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,110
they will let you know if they're

656
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,850
getting too much wind but give them a

657
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:56,979
little bit of airflow and your plants

658
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:58,359
will really be happy for it you like a

659
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,038
nice little breeze don't choose nice

660
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:01,569
warm day a nice sunshine on your face

661
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,798
what's the next best thing that could

662
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:04,538
come along it's just a nice little

663
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,308
breeze I think the plants kind of feel

664
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:08,048
the same way so give them a nice little

665
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:09,428
breeze and I think they'll appreciate it

666
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:10,778
you'll make them stronger you'll make

667
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:13,690
them more robust and you'll give them

668
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:15,460
just some fresh air more frequently now

669
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,970
let's talk a little bit about nutrients

670
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,399
for our small veg plants we don't need a

671
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,048
supercharged nutrient regimen for these

672
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:24,819
little plants we don't want to burn them

673
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:26,648
we don't want to shock them we don't

674
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:29,168
want to stunt them while they're babies

675
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:30,639
we want to focus on a balanced diet and

676
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:32,800
I like to focus

677
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,990
I keep saying enroute development for

678
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,879
these small plants so I like a light

679
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,069
vegetative nutrient if you're working

680
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,590
with bottled nutrients there are a few

681
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:44,799
things to think about if you are working

682
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:46,990
in cocoa or soil or soilless mix or

683
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,970
hydro you need to pay attention to

684
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:52,690
whatever product line you decide to buy

685
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:55,269
and see if they offer a soil a cocoa or

686
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,130
a hydro variety the nutrients will be

687
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:59,170
show laded differently and they will be

688
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,730
in different ratios because your plants

689
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,400
will uptake things differently in

690
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,480
different mediums

691
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,810
many of the companies that make

692
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,250
nutrients offer a soil or a hydro option

693
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:12,129
when it comes to buying their products

694
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:15,009
if you are growing in cocoa I recommend

695
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:17,320
you get the hydroponic version of the

696
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:19,569
product you are buying cocoa is more

697
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:21,759
like hydro than it is like soil or a

698
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:24,369
soilless mix so if you're shopping for

699
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,440
nutrients and you're in cocoa I would

700
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:29,199
recommend that you buy the bottle that

701
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,490
is recommended for hydro now when you're

702
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,980
looking at bottled nutrients you're

703
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:35,829
going to find 3 numbers displayed on the

704
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,410
bottle that is the NPK value of that

705
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:41,169
nutrient the first number is nitrogen

706
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,430
that tells us the ratio of nitrogen in

707
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,500
that product

708
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,630
the next number will be the amount of

709
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,269
phosphorous then the next number will be

710
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,890
the amount of potassium when it comes to

711
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:53,889
veg nutrients we are looking for a

712
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,870
product with a high end ratio and lower

713
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,700
P and K numbers we don't need a lot of

714
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:59,709
phosphorus and potassium we want to

715
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,509
focus on that nitrogen for building

716
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:05,230
strong robust plants with a lot of

717
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:07,240
energy so we need a good solid grow base

718
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,360
nutrient let's talk a little bit about

719
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,410
base nutrients whatever company you

720
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:13,929
choose to work with

721
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,720
they probably offer a two or three part

722
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,509
base nutrient system a lot of them will

723
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,730
have a grow and a bloom that makes it

724
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:23,769
pretty obvious you use the grow for your

725
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,930
vegetative stage and you use the bloom

726
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:28,420
for your flowering stage a lot of

727
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:30,850
companies offer a two-part product which

728
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,950
will be an A and a B grow they also

729
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:34,299
offer an A and a B bloom but we don't

730
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,049
need those so let's talk about those

731
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:40,089
later you will take your grow a and grow

732
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:42,669
P and you will mix those into your water

733
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:44,740
to create your vegetative nutrient based

734
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:47,170
solution the reason they sell an

735
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,539
B is because there are things in bottle

736
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:51,700
a and things in bottle B that will bind

737
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:54,099
together typically if they are mixed

738
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,170
together without being diluted in our

739
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:57,879
water so you would fill your container I

740
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:59,470
generally use a five-gallon bucket in a

741
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,510
home grow you'd fill your five-gallon

742
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,579
bucket with water you would apply the

743
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:05,079
correct amount the appropriate amount of

744
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:06,909
veg a then you would apply the

745
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:08,230
appropriate amount of veg B then you

746
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,940
would mix it up then you would continue

747
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,370
to add the rest of the required

748
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:15,220
nutrients that is a two part vegetative

749
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:16,719
nutrient solution other companies will

750
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,910
offer their products in a different

751
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,950
format they will offer what is called a

752
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:23,950
base and then they will give you a grow

753
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,630
and a bloom to add on top of that with

754
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,580
that type of nutrient regimen you will

755
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,400
use that base product through the entire

756
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:32,319
cycle through veg and through flour then

757
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,550
you'll use that grow additive during the

758
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,500
growth phase and when you switch to

759
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,879
flour you'll switch to that flowering

760
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,589
additive and they've just put the

761
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,750
appropriate additives in those bottles

762
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:43,299
to keep everything running smoothly with

763
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,460
that base nutrient in there now whatever

764
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:47,919
brand you choose be sure you get the

765
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,660
appropriate veg nutrient set up if it's

766
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,460
a two part make sure you get the a and B

767
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,558
if it's the kind where you have to have

768
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,600
a base and a grow nutrient make sure you

769
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:56,889
get the base and the grow if you get

770
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:58,990
something simple where there's just a

771
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,730
bottle that says veg there you go you're

772
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,829
ready to go you've got that one strong

773
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,929
bench nutrient alright I feel like we

774
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:07,240
have a good handle on base nutrients we

775
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:10,509
need a good base nutrient with a strong

776
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,940
nitrogen value now I would recommend you

777
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:14,440
feed those plants maybe a quarter of the

778
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,120
recommended strength for the first

779
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,308
couple times you feed your plants new

780
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:21,039
nutrients give them a light feeding and

781
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:22,839
pay close attention write it down so

782
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,629
that you know exactly what you did also

783
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:27,669
write down the pH write down the EC if

784
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,280
that is an option for you the more notes

785
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:32,950
you take the more you can do research to

786
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:35,259
dial in where you went wrong a lot of us

787
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,058
consume a lot of cannabis some of us

788
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:38,950
consume cannabis while we're working in

789
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:40,660
the gardens sometimes you say I wonder

790
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,890
what I put in there and you have no idea

791
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,690
where you went wrong

792
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,400
that won't happen if you take notes and

793
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,620
write things down I've done an entire

794
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,630
episode on journaling and I suggest you

795
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:51,459
listen to that one as well so we've got

796
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,590
a reliable base nutrient we've decided

797
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,110
how much to use it started 1/4 strength

798
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:58,089
maybe work your way up to 1/3 maybe 1/2

799
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,539
you're definitely not going to need full

800
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:00,639
strength

801
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:02,559
nutrients for small plants a lot of your

802
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,270
nutrient companies will offer a feeding

803
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,220
schedule a lot of those feeding

804
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:08,650
schedules will have a small plant

805
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,079
recommendation I still recommend you

806
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:13,360
reduce that a little bit until you see

807
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:16,569
how the plants will react so we've got a

808
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:19,419
base nutrient with small plants I always

809
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:21,639
recommend some sort of myko product some

810
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:24,310
sort of root inoculants something to

811
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,680
make those roots go Kapow I try to avoid

812
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:29,019
recommending specific products here is a

813
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,970
long list of reliable products that will

814
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:34,420
work great for your roots

815
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:36,940
I like mammoth pea I like plus life from

816
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,940
veg bloom I like recharge from Scotty

817
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,650
real I like great white shark and Orca

818
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,990
and my coach um I think that is a great

819
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,759
combination some of those products are a

820
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,769
little expensive some are more

821
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,690
affordable I can also recommend a

822
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:52,839
product called mykos it is a very

823
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,730
affordable bag of micro products as long

824
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:57,129
as you are using some sort of micro

825
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,680
product I think you will see very

826
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:02,140
increased root production compared to if

827
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,940
you did not use it of course I like the

828
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,680
higher end fancier more expensive

829
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,049
products but if you can't afford that

830
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,990
get what you can't afford I highly

831
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:13,419
recommend a microbe or a Maiko or a root

832
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,190
inoculant product for your small plants

833
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,960
it will really speed up your production

834
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,029
and I think the plants will really show

835
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,680
a huge difference and you will notice it

836
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:23,049
and it will make you a happier grower

837
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,240
so we've got a reliable vegetative

838
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:27,849
nutrient with enough nitrogen in it we

839
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,370
have decided on a micro product that

840
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:32,829
would be enough for our small veg plants

841
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:35,799
for two to four weeks you may want to

842
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:37,569
add some fulvic acid to your mix I like

843
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:39,339
adding some folding I think it makes the

844
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,169
plants uptake the nutrients more quickly

845
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,970
and I think it's really worth the

846
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,490
investment just a small bottle of fulvic

847
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:47,589
acid will really improve your nutrient

848
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,630
uptake and your plants now if you've got

849
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:51,159
a good solid base nutrient and you're

850
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,360
feeding your roots your plants are

851
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,550
really happy you've added a little

852
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,679
fulvic acid that's increasing the uptake

853
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:59,430
as the plants get a little bit bigger

854
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,950
you may need to introduce some cal-mag

855
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:05,590
be careful not to overdose small plants

856
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,509
on cal-mag sometimes the young plants

857
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:09,970
really don't react well to too much

858
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:12,069
cal-mag so be careful now basically

859
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,019
we've got a veg nutrient we

860
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:16,629
got some mykos we've got a little bit of

861
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:19,170
fulvic acid and maybe around week three

862
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:22,090
we are going to add a dose of cal-mag

863
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:23,920
this feed should keep our plants super

864
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:26,259
happy one important thing we need to

865
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,900
think about is the pH of our feeding

866
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,819
solution for plants this size I

867
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,830
generally recommend we adjust the pH

868
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:36,039
somewhere between five point nine and

869
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:38,199
six point two and again we adjust the pH

870
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,849
after all of the nutrients have been

871
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,490
mixed in you've got your bucket of water

872
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:44,919
you add in the appropriate recommended

873
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,720
amount of each bottle of nutrients then

874
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,210
you give it a good stir make sure it's

875
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,579
nice and mixed then we check the pH then

876
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,100
we adjust accordingly so we've got a

877
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:56,559
solid veg mix we've got at pH adjusted

878
00:31:54,099 --> 00:31:59,019
now it is time to water our plants I

879
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,599
recommend when you water you saturate

880
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:03,190
your medium thoroughly don't drown the

881
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,439
plants but make sure that all of the

882
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,690
soil or cocoa or whatever medium you are

883
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,000
watering make sure it is saturated we

884
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,759
don't want any dry pockets your roots

885
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,519
will not grow into dry spots so moisten

886
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:18,150
all of your medium now is probably a

887
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,829
good time to remind you guys of episode

888
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:23,140
337 where I do a lesson on what is

889
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:24,519
called one through five water tank if

890
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,230
you're a new grower and you haven't

891
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,509
heard the one through five water tech

892
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:30,640
discussion I highly recommend you listen

893
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:33,039
to that episode right after this it is

894
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,710
episode 337 and it will teach you a lot

895
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,599
about watering your plants correctly so

896
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,059
we have appropriately watered our small

897
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,579
plants with nutrients when do we need to

898
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,990
give our plants nutrients again that is

899
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:46,569
a really good question

900
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:49,420
in cocoa I like to feed nutrients to my

901
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:52,299
plants at every single watering every

902
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,970
single day I will feed my plants a solid

903
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:57,250
base mix then I will add a booster every

904
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,259
day and I will rotate those boosters

905
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:02,049
depending on what the plants may need in

906
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:04,210
this small veg case my booster would be

907
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:06,430
the cal-mag I would water the nutrients

908
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,319
I would put the base nutrient put the

909
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,450
full vet fulvic acid and I would put the

910
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:13,029
mykos in my nutrient solution every

911
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,590
single day then once a week I would put

912
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:17,230
that cal-mag in there that would be my

913
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:19,209
booster for these small plants now if

914
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,069
you're working in soil or soilless mix

915
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,779
you don't need to feed nutrients as

916
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:24,789
often because they stick around in the

917
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:25,279
dirt a little better I would recommend

918
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:27,649
you

919
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,450
feed with nutrients one feed then water

920
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:32,060
the next feed when you're feeding with

921
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,740
just clean water please adjust the pH

922
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:35,809
just like you do when you're mixing

923
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,329
nutrients fill your container with water

924
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:40,909
stick your pH meter in there see what it

925
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:43,369
says adjust it up or down accordingly

926
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,500
you need to adjust the pH at every

927
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:48,289
feeding so I would recommend you do one

928
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,569
feeding of nutrients one watering of pH

929
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:52,940
adjusted water then I would go back to

930
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:55,490
that basic nutrient regimen for the next

931
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:58,009
watering these small veg plants will

932
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,900
need frequent watering pay attention to

933
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:01,519
them don't let them get too dry don't

934
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,650
let them be over watered once again

935
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,329
check out the 1 through 5 watering tank

936
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,329
another thing we need to pay attention

937
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:10,009
to is over nutrient ting are we over

938
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:12,500
fertilizing these plants are we burning

939
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,690
them pay attention to the leaf tips if

940
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,969
the very tips of the leaves start to

941
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,039
look brown or the wrong color or if they

942
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:21,739
start to curl we are feeding too much if

943
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:24,409
your leaves look pale and yellow we are

944
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:26,359
not feeding enough if you have a mixture

945
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:28,640
of those two symptoms your pH is

946
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,289
probably off one of the very first

947
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,389
things I recommended in these grow

948
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:34,579
lessons was that you buy a book and you

949
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,199
read it hopefully you've already done

950
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:37,909
some reading hopefully you have looked

951
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,980
at some leaf charts and you know what

952
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,329
deficiencies look like so you know what

953
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,918
to pay attention to you know what a

954
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,750
healthy leaf looks like and you know

955
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:46,699
what an unhealthy leaf looks like and

956
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,110
it's gonna pop out in your head when you

957
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:49,609
see those leaves doing something weird

958
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,409
you're gonna say that's not what the

959
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:52,760
book said this should look like so

960
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:55,398
hopefully you've gotten the book

961
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,750
hopefully you have read the book so pay

962
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:57,710
attention to your plants if they are

963
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,949
showing you that they need more

964
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:03,139
nutrients increase your nutrients give

965
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:04,789
it a little more base nutrients you

966
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:07,279
probably don't need to increase the

967
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:10,219
amount of fulvic when it comes to mykos

968
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,680
I have learned that it is better to feed

969
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:15,049
small amounts more frequently than to

970
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:16,789
try to feed a whole bunch at one time

971
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,050
you're not gonna do any good by pouring

972
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:19,969
the whole bottle in there at one time

973
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,720
it'd be more effective to pour the

974
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:23,750
bottle in there

975
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,909
slowly over a course of time so maybe if

976
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,010
you see a deficiency just increase that

977
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:29,960
base nutrient which you're going to run

978
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,640
into a deficiency with and small plants

979
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,449
is either going to be nitrogen or

980
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,460
cal-mag

981
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:36,559
that is going to be your most common

982
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,909
deficiency so pay attention that those

983
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,308
two things and learn what that look

984
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:43,798
like the next common thing you're gonna

985
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:46,349
find is nutrient burn people are going

986
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:48,929
to try to feed too much to these plants

987
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:51,329
I heard somebody say the term [ __ ] I

988
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:53,098
just want to put more on it to make it

989
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:55,289
grow faster I thought it was hilarious

990
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:58,619
when I heard that I know a lot of people

991
00:35:55,289 --> 00:36:00,329
like that don't be that guy now if

992
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:02,430
you're running a hydroponic system if

993
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:04,260
you're in rock wool cubes and you're

994
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:06,598
doing a top feed or if you're in some

995
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,270
type of ebb and flow system your small

996
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,730
veg phase will not be nearly as long as

997
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:14,460
us growing in cocoa or a soilless mix

998
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,380
your small veg phase zips right by

999
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,720
I think the hydro grows go much more

1000
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,030
quickly in veg so your small veg phase

1001
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,828
may be only about a week long you're

1002
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:26,069
going to need to introduce more

1003
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:28,798
nutrients at a higher rate sooner in a

1004
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:30,869
hydroponic setup but pay attention to

1005
00:36:28,798 --> 00:36:33,210
the plants that is very plant specific

1006
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:35,369
and very strain specific but since the

1007
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,829
plants grow a little more quickly you

1008
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:39,869
are going to need more nutrients sooner

1009
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:41,910
one thing I'm going to remind you of in

1010
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:45,539
your hydroponics is to stay on top of

1011
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:48,739
your pH and your EC or your ppm s check

1012
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:51,510
it every single day and adjust as needed

1013
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:53,759
water is going to evaporate from your

1014
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:56,789
hydroponic setup but the nutrients will

1015
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,559
not evaporate so your pH and your ppm s

1016
00:36:56,789 --> 00:37:00,930
are going to fluctuate during that

1017
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,670
evaporation also the plants are going to

1018
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:04,739
consume some of the water so the water

1019
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,568
is going to disappear throughout the day

1020
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:09,149
which is going to cause changes in your

1021
00:37:06,568 --> 00:37:11,639
reservoir as a hydroponic grower you

1022
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:14,309
need to be on top of that every single

1023
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:17,730
day also I'm going to recommend you take

1024
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:19,140
extra notes as a hydro grower reactions

1025
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,818
happen a little more quickly and the

1026
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:22,440
plants are a little more sensitive when

1027
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:24,808
you're running hydro because you don't

1028
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,450
have that big soil life system to work

1029
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:29,400
as a buffer all right boys and girls I

1030
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:31,769
feel like that is a good talk on small

1031
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,510
veg we're going to leave these plants in

1032
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:35,369
these pots for two to four weeks

1033
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,960
depending on how quickly they grow

1034
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:39,450
that's very strained dependent that's

1035
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,519
very environment dependent one thing I

1036
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:43,588
want to remind you to do is spread your

1037
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,909
small veg plants out we do have them

1038
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:47,219
crush together now because there are

1039
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:48,929
small plants but as they get larger make

1040
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:50,730
sure you spread them out give them more

1041
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:51,899
space they want to grow they want to

1042
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,338
branch out if you

1043
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,960
got them all crushed together they're

1044
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,699
gonna grow straight up and get really

1045
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,130
really tall if you give them space to

1046
00:37:56,699 --> 00:38:01,588
branch out they will do so and then when

1047
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,079
you top them you've got nice bushes but

1048
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:05,849
that's coming up in the future you guys

1049
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,528
I know I didn't talk about soil I didn't

1050
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:09,298
talk about containers in this episode I

1051
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:11,099
feel like I covered that in the previous

1052
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:12,809
episodes so we were up to speed there

1053
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:14,970
we're gonna leave these plants in these

1054
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:17,490
containers for two to four weeks then we

1055
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:18,989
will pop them into three gallon or five

1056
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:21,000
gallon or perhaps seven gallon

1057
00:38:18,989 --> 00:38:22,858
containers maybe some of you out there

1058
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,449
are gonna go huge and go into a 20 or an

1059
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:26,429
even larger container but we're gonna

1060
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:27,598
work on that on the next episode so

1061
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:30,179
we've got a little time to let these

1062
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,650
plants grow your job now is to keep them

1063
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:34,588
healthy keep them happy

1064
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,990
keep them pests and pathogens on those

1065
00:38:34,588 --> 00:38:38,880
roots if you see any yellow or funky

1066
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:40,889
leaves make sure you pull that stuff off

1067
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,119
just take good care of your new sweet

1068
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:44,038
little babies make sure they don't have

1069
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,660
any problems so that when we transplant

1070
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,490
them into their bigger pots they're

1071
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:49,259
ready to go they've got a fat root

1072
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:51,899
system and they don't go into any shock

1073
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,119
from a transplant I just realized that I

1074
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,858
did not cover any pest management for

1075
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,789
our small plants let's talk about that

1076
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:58,769
really quickly

1077
00:38:56,789 --> 00:39:01,559
hopefully you have decided on an

1078
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:03,179
integrated pest management system for

1079
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,210
your garden before this point hopefully

1080
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:07,409
that was part of your planning phase

1081
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:10,048
hopefully we don't have any pests or

1082
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:12,269
problems on our small plants some folks

1083
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:15,150
will choose to apply a pesticide as a

1084
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:17,579
preventative some folks will wait until

1085
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,039
they see a problem to use a pesticide on

1086
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:22,019
a plant this small I would like to wait

1087
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:23,940
until I transplant these into their

1088
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:26,429
three gallon pots before I put any

1089
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,470
pesticides on them however in some

1090
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:30,868
environments I don't trust the place and

1091
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:33,239
I need to put a pesticide on it I would

1092
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,430
use something like evergreen and I would

1093
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:37,500
probably use it around 15 mils per

1094
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:39,358
gallon I would make sure to apply it

1095
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,460
while the lights were off and I would be

1096
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,098
sure that the plants were completely dry

1097
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,619
before I turn the lights back on and I

1098
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,838
would probably do this approximately

1099
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,880
every five to seven days while the

1100
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:53,639
plants are little if I were in a place

1101
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,890
that had a reputation for getting a pest

1102
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:57,868
infestation all right I feel like that

1103
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:59,629
should keep us pest free for the first

1104
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:02,190
four weeks and then we can really start

1105
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,500
implementing our integrated pest

1106
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,190
management once we transplant into those

1107
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,650
three gallon

1108
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,809
pots all right podcast rolled I feel

1109
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:12,059
like that is a solid show about small

1110
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:14,159
veg if you feel like this episode was

1111
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:15,659
educational informative or entertaining

1112
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,088
and you would like to make a financial

1113
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:20,389
contribution to the show I encourage you

1114
00:40:18,088 --> 00:40:24,088
to do so and you can do that by going to

the support now while I'm talking about

1120
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:35,910
patreon let me bring up something I keep

1121
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:39,269
forgetting to mention on the podcast

1122
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:42,299
recently patreon changed the way the

1123
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:44,759
contributors cards are billed during

1124
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:47,400
that process many contributors were

1125
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,650
removed from content creators pages if

1126
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,260
you feel like you are contributing to a

1127
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:54,389
patreon campaign I encourage you to log

1128
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,819

1134
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:08,848
content creators and it would really

1135
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:11,220
break our hearts to lose contributions

1136
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:12,990
