smoke though they ask crispy the only

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,910
reason my eyes would be crispy is cuz

131
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:04,120
opportunity to either take him to jail

132
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:06,250
and keep him or I can release him to a

133
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,199
responsible adult who will declare

134
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,430

I was picking him up be the cop asked

177
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,060
basic questions and then he got friendly

178
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,639
with us and started asking questions

179
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,990
about the industry and work and at one

180
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,159
point I just shut up I was like oh I

182
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:52,580
he tricked me he's my friend now and I'm

183
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:54,229
telling him [ __ ] to pull myself out of

184
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,759
that one but it brings us to this

185
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:59,449
episode it's a really good way to segue

186
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,649
into this don't drive high because

187
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:02,629
they're out looking for people in

188
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,219
Colorado right now it's the start this

189
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:06,079
officer told us it's the start of their

190
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,990
searching for DUI season all the

191
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:11,209
troopers have recently taken a drug

192
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,360
expert class a lot of the state troopers

193
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:16,699
are now cannabis what is tox cannabis

194
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,740
intoxication or impairment experts or

195
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,539
whatever so where they could tell how

196
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,699
high you are and this cop said things

197
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,410
that made me think he was serious he

198
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,019
knew stuff about my buddy being

199
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,240
intoxicated that I know about cannabis

200
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:31,219
like he knew that level he said your

201
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,720
buddy doesn't look high or act high but

202
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,870
when I interviewed him I can tell there

203
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,840
are things inside of him

204
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,389
that are going on that indicate that

205
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,789
he's high well that's kind of [ __ ]

206
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:44,599
like I was impressed by the way that he

207
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:47,189
put it by are a Jedi Master like right

208
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,640
port medical training like whatever I

209
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:51,089
don't know

210
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:54,360
but ah so let's talk about some things

211
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:58,079
that we could do to maybe help ourselves

212
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,900
out and not get in as much trouble and

213
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,819
maybe prevent ourselves maybe hopefully

214
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,099
walk away without any [ __ ] handcuffs

215
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,420
or maybe instead of getting all the way

216
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,340
taken to the jail keep yourself in a

217
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,660
situation where they call Rasta Jeff and

218
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:11,969
he gets to come pick you up and sign for

219
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:16,290
you so let's talk about like if you get

220
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:18,060
pulled over ah you've told me a your

221
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,350
method our friend buzzy over here he's

222
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,019

223
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,670
himself when he gets pulled over so I'm

224
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,319

225
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,240

226
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,180

228
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,759

229
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,610

do before you get the car

236
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,680
also if you are driving with weed

237

regardless of where you are should

238
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,969
pretty much put it in the trunk

239
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:58,379

262
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,838
you're pulled over walks up to the

263
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:02,480
window shines is like right [ __ ]

264
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,850
goddamn face and usually he'll say

265
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,950
something like yeah I would have the

266
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,050
window rolled down before he gets there

267
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,149
okay your hands should be on the

268
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:12,379
steering wheel all right both hands on

269
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:13,610
the steering wheel yeah you want to be

270
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,889
able to the cops should be able to see

271
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:21,940
both your hands this is to my method is

272
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:25,039
avoid anything possible be extremely

273
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,110
what the cop wants to happen him the

274
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,809
most desirable situation possibly

275
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:33,320
submissive to him all trying to avoid

276
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:37,609
paying money to the state for getting

277
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,570
shot as my goal so far yeah so you just

278
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,669
keep your hands on the wheel

279
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,260
he's like bleh license registration say

280
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:44,419
it's in my glove box can I reach into it

281
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:46,639
he says sure you go into it you get your

282
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:48,349
stuff out give it to him then I don't

283
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,370
know different things can happen from

284
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:54,950
there okay so he grabs your license like

285
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,750
how you doing you're like um pretty good

286
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,459

288
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,819
license registration proof of insurance

289
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,200
he's gonna walk back to the car

290
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,860
hopefully he's gonna come back and he's

291
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,300
gonna say my friend buzzy you were going

292
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,980

293
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:12,129
I quit driving like an [ __ ] in these

294
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,289
parts I'm just gonna give you a warning

295

hopefully it goes well so the key to it

296
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:20,208
I think we're all gonna have the same

297
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:23,028
story be polite to the cop don't try to

298
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:24,559
be know your rights but don't try to

299
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:25,970
invoke them immediately when the cop

300
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,588
comes up give him what he wants and

301
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,990

303
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:36,470

you've gone through all the [ __ ] our

326
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,100
buddy buzzy over here is handled but now

327
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,420
when the cop comes back with your

328
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,870
license registration proof of insurance

329
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:27,789
he goes hey Mike uh kind of smells like

330
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,068
you got weed in there I would like to

331
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:33,120
search your vehicle now what's the

332
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:36,120
proper response at this point I don't

333
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,120
sloppy

334
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:43,870
law enforcement unless it's in a video

335
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:46,088
game so just I do not consent to any

336
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,440
searches there's just you keep repeating

337
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:50,500
that when they ask you to search your

338
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,970
stuff all right they need major probable

339
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,720
cause and they'll make [ __ ] up like

340
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,740
you've got Altoids that's probable cause

341
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,500
excuse that to come under breath new

342
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,318
that that's not probable cause what

343
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,028
about like myself I work in a giant Gro

344
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:05,649
I was trimming plants there were six

345
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:07,269
feet tall today I had to chop I had to

346
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:08,919
lean in between two plants and chop

347
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:11,560
plants down and carry six foot tall

348
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,719
plants so my shirt I probably reek I've

349
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,039
got trim on me right now if I was coming

350
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,300
from work and they said you smell like

351
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,799
marijuana it's I work in the legal

352
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:19,479
marijuana industry that's just a side

353
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,099
effect of my job it's probably the

354
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,699
probable cause to search my vehicle

355
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:27,069
though not be I'm sorry to jump in I

356
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:28,750
would say be strong on distinguishing

357
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:31,870
the different smells between smoke

358
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,370
marijuana and fresh marijuana this

359
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,019
doesn't this does this smell that you're

360
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,299
smelling is work-related this is not

361
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:40,539
smoke marijuana is the smell of a plant

362
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:42,309
right at this point you're like they're

363
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:43,750
arguing about smells because you're not

364
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:45,188
slurring your speech because your eyes

365
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,818
aren't red because they didn't catch you

366
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:50,318
weaving so I don't do that [ __ ] is

367
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:51,849
probably one of the things we should put

368
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:54,129
on the list to avoid getting your ass in

369
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,050
truth you're sober right now you can

370
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:59,198
argue it this is a smell that I picked

371
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:01,629
up at work working wall sober I'm on my

372
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,549
way home sober like that's what you're

373
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:05,559
smelling if you insist on searching the

374
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:07,088
car like unless they're finding roaches

375
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,659
in the ashtray or add a brick in the

376
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,880
cupholder

377
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:11,379
and put your [ __ ] away you guys yep

378
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,679
you're headed on the road yeah have it

379
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:14,659
out of reach

380
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:16,639
you're Stephanie you know if you've got

381
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:18,319
a locked container that would be ideal

382
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,639
that's what they'd prefer to keep in the

383
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,980
trunk I think we were talking about that

384
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,379
earlier right it works just like booze

385
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,289
if you've got a 12-pack in the backseat

386
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:29,120
of the trunk you're fine if that 12-pack

387
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:31,789
is open and the 12th one is in your cup

388
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,169
holder you ain't fine no more sloppy

389
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,579
little blunt he never passed it to

390
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:37,969

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,629

younger

409
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,500
cuz I have two totally different

410
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,120
perspectives on this that's why I got

411
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,919
you here from being an adolescent to

412
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,620
being in a you know what I'm saying like

413
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:42,708
from going from you I told ya when I was

414
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:44,509
just saying I'm just a respect for the

415
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,000
blunt and my homey yeah I could die

416
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:51,409
happy right now

417
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,039
no I have goals no okay so when I was

418
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,079
younger

419
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:56,399
I was one of those oh [ __ ] the police

420
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,530
man they can't do [ __ ] to me too

421
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,539
and I would you know approach to the

422
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:02,189
situation they pulled me over and I'd be

423
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:04,500
like why'd you pull me over this is then

424
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,540
I'd be really confrontational towards it

425
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,860
and then I'd go to jail and that's what

426
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:09,449
would happen because I was being

427
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,389
confrontational in a scenario or II

428
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,879
didn't need to nowadays you comply you

429

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,900

454
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,088
little bit of personal because I didn't

456
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:24,450

457
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:26,220
that I got we now I actually got pulled

458
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,140
over in Kansas worst place to get pulled

459
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,490
over ever so he got out with the badge

460
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,400
on his hat and I was like oh he's gonna

461
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,950
shoot me and my dogs I had two little

462
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,250
puppies but so I'm nervous I'm like [ __ ]

463
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:40,890
[ __ ] [ __ ] Colorado plates and I remember

464
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,380
right until he was in my peripherals

465
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:46,290
I was nervous like scared and as soon as

466
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,020
he was that I sung to him he was I could

467
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:49,500
have sung him a hole disc I was so nice

468
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:53,940
to him

469
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,230
and he asked me why I was speeding I was

470
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,009
like officer I've been driving for like

471
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:00,690
eight hours I saw that there's a rest

472
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:01,980
area up there I was honestly just trying

473
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,220
to make it there so I can go to sleep

474
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,990
runs my stuff now I don't know how the

475
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,569
police things work but I'm pretty sure

476
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,319
that when they run my name in any state

477
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:12,269
they can see my

478
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,648
criminal background I'm pretty sure it

479
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:16,620
goes from state to state so he saw

480
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:19,768
somehow perfect but the bigger stuff yes

481
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:21,719
yeah I'm sure he saw I had a record and

482
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:23,970
he treated me totally respectfully he

483
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,798
looked me he said I pulled you over to Z

484
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,210
were speeding and I wanted to really

485
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,250

488
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,250

491
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:42,389
him feel comfortable and I was polite

492
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,009
cuz fifteen over they could take your

493
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:46,258
license on the spot if they really want

494
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:48,808
to be a dick and we were in Kansas and I

495
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:50,308
had two pit bulls in the car and after

496
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:54,960
he left I threw up because I was like oh

497
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:57,329
my god Duke yeah I really thought I was

498
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,819
going back to jail and I was like I hate

499
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:01,230
life they're gonna take my dogs but I

500
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:03,119
could have handled it like when I was

501
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,490
younger and been an [ __ ] and got my

502
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,349
dog shot and got [ __ ] tasered she

503
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,870
killed myself for throwing back in jail

504
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:11,908
but I was polite that's what I hate I

505
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:15,089
hate seeing all these videos where

506
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:18,059
they're like oh that's that's police

507
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:20,308
abuse that's police abuse but the dude

508
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:22,740
isn't doing what the police is asking

509
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:25,589
him like lay down on the ground lay the

510
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,048
[ __ ] down like what why do you want to

511
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:31,339
get DDT doc I just don't see the point

512
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:35,069
like they're pointing like I saw a video

513
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:38,609
that's all video the police had a gun

514
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:40,470
pointed at a guy he had a knife and he

515
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:42,839
lunged at him and they shot him and

516
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,149
people are like I'm necessary force

517
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,069
you're a [ __ ] hypocrite because if

518
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:48,298
you have a legal gun on you and I come

519
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:49,740
and try to stab you right now you're

520
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,349
gonna shoot me you [ __ ] so don't

521
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,599
[ __ ] don't vitae it on the police and

522
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:56,369
and and when I say [ __ ] I don't mean

523
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:58,230
gay people's it'll be all upside up it's

524
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:59,878
an old-school version yeah yeah for sure

525
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,798
don't be a little [ __ ] [ __ ] about it

526
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:03,298
don't be a little [ __ ] like because if

527
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,509
I try to stab you say one more time

528
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:08,250
we're gonna do something

529
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:09,720
but not I hate that because people are

530
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,359
so hypocritical because if they put

531
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,799
themselves in the same position they

532
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,689
would act totally different than what

533
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,700
they're speaking and I hate that because

534
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,100
if you try to stab me I'm shooting you

535
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,240
if I have a legal right yeah like stand

536
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,619
in front of that guy with a knife and I

537
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,880
give you half a second decide he will

538
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:30,659
shoot him or not you're shooting them

539
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:32,880
every time the judges be like why didn't

540
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,050
you shoot him 17 times there was only 16

541
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,970
bullets I was like Big Lebowski

542
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:40,678
reference for all the people that didn't

543
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:43,410
get it the real trick here though is to

544
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,240
just be calm and go through the script

545
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:48,210
that they're expecting and that's really

546
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,259
easy to do yeah if you're not doing

547
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,259
something you're not supposed to be

548
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:53,519
doing like but a lot of people are doing

549
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,710
something we shouldn't be doing well no

550
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,808
like I remember how he used to be in

551
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,220
Colorado I used to have to drive go pick

552
00:20:57,808 --> 00:21:01,500
up weed and drive at home all the time

553
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,720
and that was the time that I was most at

554
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,569
risk is when I just went and picked up a

555
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,819
new quarter and had to drive at home and

556
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:10,379
I made it real easy on myself I threw it

557
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:11,939
in a backpack when I bought it I threw

558
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,280
that backpack in the trunk when I got to

559
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,039
the car if I got pulled over on the way

560
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,750
home it wasn't for speeding cuz I did my

561
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,339
damnedest not to break a single traffic

562
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,929
law with weed in the car crews could but

563
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:24,089
I got pulled over plenty of times with

564
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:25,679
weed in the car and when they walk up to

565
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:27,119
your car and go good evening officer and

566
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,880
it doesn't stink like weed in the car

567
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,039
you're fine they go oh I pulled you over

568
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,570

569
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,308

570
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:38,579

571
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:41,639
it's done click try 205 on i-25 rasta

572
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:43,919
Jeff right yeah cruise control I also

573
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,259
think looking looking them in the eyes

574
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,330
is key yeah because you're hiding

575
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:50,429
something you're like aftershave yeah be

576
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:53,159
respectful like like if you can be calm

577
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:55,500
and confident they don't wonder why

578
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,360
you're nervous and try to figure out why

579
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,009
you're you're freaking out and want to

580
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,569
dig through your car the hardest part

581
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:02,700
for me is when they make you sign the

582
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,319
ticket like normally I sign my suit my

583
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,519
name like you'll get a little motion but

584
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,829
then you get all nervous and your [ __ ]

585
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,710

586
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:12,149
[ __ ] like I'm ok thanks officer right

587
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,090

645
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,889
as soon as you're pulled over turn your

646
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:17,029
camera phone on places somewhere or like

647
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:22,970
you know what I'm saying like just

648
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:25,730
stream it yeah for sure because then

649
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:28,850
like yo I mean why not at least is there

650
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,279
you a I don't want everyone seeing me

651
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:39,789
cry on periscope

652
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:42,250
if you can record it it's an extra layer

653
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:43,930
of protection for everybody it if you're

654
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,730
lucky you live in a place where the cops

655
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,759
have cameras stuck to their chests that

656
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:51,610
they can't turn off but you're not lucky

657
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,869
and then when you drive away don't get

658
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:57,099
all nervous and do something stupid

659
00:24:52,869 --> 00:25:07,689
right try not too hard I've done it

660
00:24:57,099 --> 00:25:09,459
before there's something else I was

661
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,670
thinking about earlier today that I had

662
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:15,400
to realize as an adult is a not every

663
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,690
officer is a [ __ ] scumbag you know

664
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,330
I'm saying by saying that every officer

665
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,370
is just trying to make your day worse is

666
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:23,649
basically being racist it's like the

667
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,989
same as labeling a racist doing so yeah

668
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:28,269
like I it's just Java store some [ __ ]

669
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,829
yeah yeah every fast-food person's gonna

670
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:31,900
be an [ __ ] and every cops trying to

671
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:34,240
[ __ ] you over because I've seen cool

672
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,680
cops I've interacted with wait cops who

673
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,750
are literally just trying to do their

674
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:42,130
jobs yeah cops ative giving me so when I

675
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:44,049
was younger like 24 25 ish my girlfriend

676
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,060
at the time worked managed a bar and we

677
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:47,950
would go smoke in the Halle

678
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:49,269
there was an alleyway that went one way

679
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,680
he could turn left or right to come into

680
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:51,759
the parking lot of the bar if you go to

681
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,070
the other way you'll go through another

682
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,329
area this cop would roll through and he

683
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:56,980
knew we were out there just puffing all

684
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:58,389
the time in that alley cuz you just walk

685
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,710
right out of the side door of the bar

686
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,420
and go sit on this little area between

687
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,590
cars and smoke when he would come

688
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,390
through it flashes brights

689
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:05,829
so we know put our [ __ ] away and be

690
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,910
prepared to he wouldn't have to [ __ ]

691
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:08,740
with us you know he would just rather

692
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,540
not see us smoking or maybe he's got

693
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,890
somebody else in the car but not all

694
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,299
cops are [ __ ] that guy was trying to

695
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,040
help us out like not have to do

696
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:18,490
paperwork yeah with us just cuz we want

697
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,559
to smoke some weed oh sorry oh no I've

698
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,970
just had dozens of interactions with

699
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,980
couple doing I was a teenager used to

700
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,170
get pulled over like twice a week I had

701
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,299
a car that had really loud subwoofers in

702
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,500
the area I grew up in that made me the

703
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:31,899
biggest star on the planet

704
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,960
yeah for sure I've seen that but if you

705
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,400
follow the script nine times out of ten

706
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,200
you drew out of there in 15 minutes tops

707
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,790
we never see we rarely see any good [ __ ]

708
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,630
about the cops on the news on the

709
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:45,460
internet on

710
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,320
anywhere like that because you rarely

711
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,759
hear anything about the good [ __ ] when

712
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:50,740
people do good [ __ ] like oh yeah that

713
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:53,019
cop helped that old lady up it's this

714
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:58,539
[ __ ] job you only see cop kick to get

715
00:26:53,019 --> 00:27:00,039
that space that's actually one

716
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:02,319
psychology class I learned about this

717
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:04,329
that's actually life period if you

718
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,939
notice like people talking about stuff a

719
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:10,299
lot or even the news it's never good

720
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,769
stuff because uh none even though it's

721
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:14,950
unknown you don't realize that good

722
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:17,259
stuff is happening all the time so that

723
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,180
bad stuff is a blip on the radar and

724
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:20,829
that's what you remember in reference to

725
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,610
because it's usually things are

726
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:23,109
copacetic

727
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:24,759
so when something bad happens it really

728
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:26,019
sticks out and that's what people want

729
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:28,329
to hear they don't want to hear like a

730
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:30,220
hundred kids were saved today they want

731
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:31,929
to hear you know puppies getting kicked

732
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,049
off of a cliff people are [ __ ] up man

733
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:39,519
like they see bad stuff and it it gives

734
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:40,899
them peace getting [ __ ] vine of six

735
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,779
seconds of just somebody planting

736
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:49,000
puppies just replays over my [ __ ]

737
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:51,879
head I personally feel like people want

738
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,789
to see bad things so they have a reason

739
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,070
to fuel unnecessary fire to complain

740
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:59,769
about why they're not doing well or to

741
00:27:57,069 --> 00:28:02,409
use it to to why things are so [ __ ] up

742
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:05,710
this and that like yeah especially like

743
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:07,600
oh man here in America like we are so

744
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,160
privileged as Americans I hate this

745
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,019
whole anti-american thing that's

746
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,370
happening like people standing off

747
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:14,079
flights if I see you standing on the

748
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:15,879
flag I'm running you over at my Prius I

749
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,649
don't give a [ __ ] like that's so that's

750
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,410
so ignorant you want to know why this yo

751
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:22,690
this is why this is why because no one

752
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,250
is fleeing from America you are not

753
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,170
putting your family on a door and

754
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:28,210
pushing it into the ocean to get

755
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,070
somewhere else like America is fine

756
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,720
there's no there's no death rage

757
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:33,250
happening when it's nighttime we're in

758
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,289
here making a podcast we're not having

759
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,640
one of us make sure that death troopers

760
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:38,559
aren't coming to killing everybody in

761
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,180
our [ __ ] village like you know what

762
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,089
I'm saying I hate people that are like

763
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,799
Oh America is horrible no you're able to

764
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:46,809
be the person that you want to be

765
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,460
because you're in America because being

766
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,980
yourself in other countries can get you

767
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,990
[ __ ] murdered like as shitty is that

768
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,980
sense jarl weed this is probably but you

769
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,839
think that's about a half ounce

770
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,319
yeah half ounce a weed right here in

771
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,990
most countries would probably

772
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:02,839
get your head cut off bro you over but

773
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,278
several in a few for sure yeah yeah a

774
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:09,558
lot of countries this would be the tail

775
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:11,869
time in most yeah we we are so like free

776
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:13,759
to do even like there aren't a lot of

777
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:19,518
problems you can't downplay the no no

778
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:20,960
there are you sure absolutely 75

779
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:22,970
different kinds of food we could drive

780
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,319
our own vehicles we can we're okay we

781
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,500
all I bet everybody in this room has

782
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:32,720
varying religious beliefs and we I'm not

783
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:34,638
gonna ask good all's that do but we

784
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,558
could all express them by having I've

785
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:38,388
got a tattoo here I've got dreadlocks oh

786
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:39,980
you've got your symbols there I think I

787
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:41,359
have a good idea what you follow and I'm

788
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,589
sure you two kind of linked up in the

789
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,538
same similar sort of way from

790
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:46,908
conversations we've had but in other

791
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:48,528
countries one of us would be beheaded

792
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:55,730
for what we all be fighting to the death

793
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:58,480
right very very least like spend all day

794
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:00,860
pretending like that wasn't you yeah

795
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,899
yeah I couldn't have these dreadlocks in

796
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:05,628
a lot of places you know I do a lot of

797
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:07,758
States not Colorado you get pulled over

798
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:09,349
like I asked you this profile at one

799
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,759
point I literally asked you like how the

800
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:13,009
[ __ ] do you not get pulled over all the

801
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:16,009
time and it's because you don't stand

802
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:18,649
out in Colorado anymore yes a lot of the

803
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:20,360
listeners don't realize they I've been

804
00:30:18,648 --> 00:30:23,538
told so many times that my voice doesn't

805
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:26,028
match my appearance when people

806
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:27,378
especially when I made the story green

807
00:30:26,028 --> 00:30:28,849
and healthy wellness all going I buy a

808
00:30:27,378 --> 00:30:35,959
lot of product there and I also deliver

809
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:38,538
products sometimes I buy a lot of

810
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,829
product there and when I do something to

811
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:41,089
people they're shopping and they're like

812
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:41,960
I recognize that voice and they turn

813
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,148
around they look at me and they're not

814
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,009
sure if that dreadlock guy is the guy

815
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:48,709
from the podcast it's really funny so

816
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:51,528
the listeners that have never that

817
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:55,250
aren't privy I guess I'm six five and

818
00:30:51,528 --> 00:30:58,250
I've got dreadlocks seriously to pass my

819
00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:00,319
ass like mid thigh region almost to my

820
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:03,500
knees one of the really longer ones goes

821
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:06,259
almost to my kneecaps by now so yet I

822
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,419
feel pressure from the police sometimes

823
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:09,408
the cop yesterday asked me he said how

824
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:10,680
long did it take you to get those

825
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,080
dreadlocks that long

826
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:17,130
like 11 years and he goes Wow commitment

827
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:19,679
buddy was cool I was at the courthouse

828
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:22,200
getting fingerprinted for when I worked

829
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,730
at a dispensary everybody had to go get

830
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,960
fingerprinted and had to go take a day

831
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,269
off because it took him all [ __ ] day

832
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,220
to fingerprint me but uh cop in there

833
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:32,400
walked by and he goes great dreadlocks

834
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:35,009
bro and I was like that was a cop like

835
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,360
cop complimented my dress now yeah and

836
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:38,190
he meant it he wasn't even being

837
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,889
sarcastic he was like had a smile on his

838
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:43,410
face and [ __ ] so not all cops are [ __ ]

839
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:45,000
some cops are cool but yeah and I'm a

840
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,460
frickin so sometimes they do feel some

841
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,319
pressure I think the police I think all

842
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,450
that America stuff time is it good with

843
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,869
the police like cuz that's just a big

844
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:57,990
thing going on now I I could really just

845
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:59,909
go on about go on man well social media

846
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,799
warriors and stuff people who are like

847
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,019
just bitching about the world but not I

848
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:06,240
think that what we were just talking

849
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:07,950
about earlier like all like how X public

850
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,650
executions and all that stuff like I

851
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:12,210
think that for one hour out of the

852
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,070
waiting about that yeah we were talking

853
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:17,309
about other countries being [ __ ] yes

854
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:24,839
yeah like really I think that no I

855
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:28,980
followed it was just we're all hi Steve

856
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:30,990
I've uh I think that uh everybody should

857
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,150
be made to watch one hour of what's

858
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,400
really going on in other countries like

859
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,259
a week one hour a week of like show me

860
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,509
like what's up in Mexico show me what's

861
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:42,319
up in Egypt like show you was really

862
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:44,640
[ __ ] up because that would be a great

863
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,950
it's all about the source where are you

864
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,900
gonna get that material the [ __ ]

865
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:53,910
Internet has all of it it has people

866
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:55,590
being publicly executed by the good also

867
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:58,170
does it have the good as well as the bad

868
00:32:55,589 --> 00:33:00,269
well yeah no no what I'm saying is every

869
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:02,130
was just referencing to the fact that

870
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:06,329
people [ __ ] about America oh yeah yeah

871
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:08,970
okay it's we are really okay here like I

872
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:10,710
got I just went to Cali Cali was awesome

873
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,120
first time ever in Cali amazing

874
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,960
shout-out to Cali

875
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:17,849
I think someone like Cali but I I got

876
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,340
into a debate with my friend there

877
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:22,139
because she's like an active feminist

878
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:24,079
and stuff which I support that's awesome

879
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,580
but she said they're like women

880
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,710
have a lot of rights here and they're

881
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:29,480
really restrained so on and so forth

882
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,980
which in some ways I do see like

883
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,019
statistically they get paid less and

884
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,390
stuff I understand but as far as

885
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:38,359
freedoms of the world women are really

886
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:40,278
free in America and and and I hate to

887
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:42,769
say it but like in other countries women

888
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:45,200
are still getting stoned to death for

889
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:47,450
talking to males in public and we got

890
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,429
women running for president so like yes

891
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,399
things are different but like we are we

892
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:54,559
are Farley advanced in a lot of ways I

893
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:56,569
don't know if that sounds like weird to

894
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,808
say but like how can people find you on

895
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,808
Twitter

896
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:03,080
angry to eat me if you want to I want to

897
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,079
hear everything make sure all of the

898
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:07,099
tweets about the the anti feminism

899
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:09,559
statements are headed towards sloppy

900
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:12,668
well I didn't say anything about anti I

901
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:17,418
said I'm totally for it there were some

902
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:19,940
microaggressions I feel like it was just

903
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:21,368
a statement you almost swallowed your

904
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:28,220
whole plot when I said the word

905
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:30,889
microaggression that [ __ ] was funny like

906
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:33,709
I also think that I think it's [ __ ] up

907
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:36,740
that it's [ __ ] up to be proud of your

908
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,329
heritage nowadays like like no but nope

909
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:40,699
nobody really doesn't nobody's like i'm

910
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:42,168
italian and then another like nobody's

911
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:44,658
with their roots everybody wants to be

912
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:46,279
guilty of cultural appropriation right

913
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:49,039
right is it well it's a step away from

914
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,530
being racist it's almost it's a foot

915
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,989
into the racist category which it isn't

916
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:56,300
but then again racism is isn't it just

917
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:58,579
having pride in one's race isn't bigotry

918
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,950
the real problem like or something like

919
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:03,588
that like cuz like it's okay I feel like

920
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:05,358
it's it's a thing like it shouldn't be a

921
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:07,699
thin line like everybody should be proud

922
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,170
of who they are like if you're German be

923
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:10,460
proud you're German if you're a black be

924
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,559
proud you're black if you're if you're

925
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,750
Asian you know what I'm saying like but

926
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,099
it's when you add hate to it like oh I

927
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,739
don't like these other people because

928
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:20,830
they're before sure oblem yeah but I

929
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:24,289
think that it's misinterpreted a lot

930
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:25,909
like if people just see what they want

931
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,769
to see like straight up you could take

932
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:30,279
any story and make it good or bad and by

933
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:35,900
changing some like minor details

934
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,240
altering [ __ ] I've seen them do it to

935
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,559
people

936
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,149
read the same book and get totally

937
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:41,009
different stories where two people can

938
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,019
watch the same car accident and tell two

939
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,660
totally different stories perspective is

940
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:47,489
the damn thing yeah and watch the same

941
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:52,319

942
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:53,789
stories both people one might beat the

943

1057
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,910

1154
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:37,379

1155
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:39,269

1158
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:44,219

1159
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:45,449
the warrant they're pretty much doing

1160
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:47,848
what they want to do they didn't knock

1161
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:49,469
anyway they booted in that [ __ ] door

1162
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:51,059
what it was was they planned on doing

1163
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:52,318
that to me anyway and then I went to the

1164
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:58,130
store and he was like oh you took all

1165

1166
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:03,119
alright so we all know what to do now if

1167
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:04,769
the cops come to the door step outside

1168
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,980
talk to them be kind keep your hands

1169
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:10,469
where they can see them if if a cop asks

1170
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:13,139
for your ID you do not have to present

1171
00:45:10,469 --> 00:45:14,459
ID but it helps with the interaction if

1172
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:16,048
you want to keep on that like polite

1173
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,880
like I don't want to go to jail side

1174
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:19,619
compliance just give me a [ __ ] ID if

1175
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,789
you're not hiding anything you can you

1176
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,608
can flex your rights and be like I don't

1177
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:24,390
have to give you my ID but just kind of

1178
00:45:23,608 --> 00:45:27,210
being a dick

1179
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:29,509
there are a lot of YouTube videos where

1180
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:32,970
you can really learn your rights and

1181
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:34,500
some people really enjoy pulling the am

1182
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:36,899
i detained am I free to go

1183
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,980
that's a good rapid-fire that's where

1184
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,838
I'm headed with this there are YouTube

1185
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,619
channels that are solely dedicated to

1186
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:45,420
people harassing police officers with

1187
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,950
assault rifles just to get a rise out of

1188
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:52,559
the police like sir what are you doing I

1189
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:54,778
can be here because of HB 41 be my

1190
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,359
nunchucks and samurai sword and what ass

1191
00:45:54,778 --> 00:45:58,858
naked are fairly legal right there well

1192
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:02,358
no depending on where you live in the

1193
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:05,699
u.s. like along our southern states

1194
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:07,679
anything bordering Mexico they've got

1195
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:10,169
random highway checkpoints where they

1196
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:12,750
look for immigration documents and all

1197
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:15,150
kinds of [ __ ] and a lot of that's

1198
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:19,048
unconstitutional it really pisses people

1199
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:21,630
off and so people who know exactly how

1200
00:46:19,048 --> 00:46:22,409
to flex their rights in a very specific

1201
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,900
way

1202
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:27,269
addressed giving the living [ __ ] beaten

1203
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,300
out of them and thrown in jail and go

1204
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:33,679
flex the rights it [ __ ] massive

1205
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:36,330
checkpoints and stuff and it's nuts but

1206
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:39,029
exactly how to do that makes getting

1207
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:41,849
pulled over really easy to handle like

1208
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:43,950
you stay calm keep your hands in plain

1209

competition where people grew cannabis

1270
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:30,739
and entered their cannabis and people

1271
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:33,119
were judging it and there was a party

1272
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:35,728
where people were consuming cannabis and

1273
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,858

00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:24,750
like I'm just not in the mood to be

1320
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:27,358
harassed that's how I play it not in the

1321
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:29,940
mood to be harassed yep all right do you

1322
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:32,130
say that to the cop occasionally

1323
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:33,630
occasionally it hasn't really come up

1324
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,970
that I've had to run it like that since

1325
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:37,559
I was a teenager like the good evening

1326
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:39,539
officer how are you what can I do for

1327
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:41,190
you like it doesn't matter if it's oh I

1328
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:43,409
was speeding or oh we got a noise

1329
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:46,170
complaint or oh it smells like weed out

1330
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:49,440
front like if you started off that way

1331
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:51,329
nine times out of ten just being played

1332
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,130
going like no I don't consent to any

1333
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:56,310
searches now I've got stuff to do later

1334
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:59,789
like stuff you guys know what can I do

1335
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:01,440
to howl like sorry guys have a good

1336
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:02,400
night usually that gets you through it

1337
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,710
in five or seven minutes

1338
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,150
worst case scenario they go get out of

1339
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:07,500
the car they search your car they find

1340
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:11,369
the weed they write your check for the

1341
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:13,079
way to go home all right that sounds

1342
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:16,230
reasonable sloppy standing up taking a

1343
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:17,818
DAB nice no I like it so you don't bump

1344
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:19,349
the rig on the mics you don't dab the

1345
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:21,179
microphone like you did last time you

1346
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:23,880
were here like even if you're about to

1347
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:26,848
get in a bunch of trouble playing it

1348
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,849
cool with the original interaction with

1349
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:32,519
the officer assume asurs you don't get

1350
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:34,289
really injured during that and don't get

1351
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:35,460
injured something I didn't mention

1352
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:37,980
earlier that I should have totally

1353
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:40,318
mentioned the cop that pulled my friend

1354
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:42,990
over and gave him a DUI asked him how

1355
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,429
long it had been since he smoked last my

1356
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:46,199
friend tried to play mr. honesty and

1357
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:47,818
told him a little too early I think I

1358
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:52,108
think that played a part of the the

1359
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:53,730
arrest say yesterday like if that cops

1360
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:55,719
like how long ago you're you're driving

1361
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:57,150
to get pulled over cops like well when

1362
00:52:55,719 --> 00:53:00,309
the last time you smoked cannabis

1363
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:02,320
yesterday yeah yeah not today before I

1364
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:04,719
went to bed I only smoked cannabis to go

1365
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,280
to any of those questions so when the

1366
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,348
cop goes how long has it been since

1367
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,590
you've consumed marijuana you can say I

1368
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:14,289
don't I'm not legally obligated answer

1369
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:16,900
that question plead fit like if you're

1370
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:19,059
thriving you're required to hand over

1371
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,070
like license registration proof of

1372
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:23,320
insurance but you're not legally

1373
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:24,849
required to self-incriminate you're not

1374
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:28,300
legally required to answer any other

1375
00:53:24,849 --> 00:53:30,039
questions dry snitching give them the

1376
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,599
minimum amount of the information that

1377
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:35,139
you need to give them you know let it go

1378
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:37,450
on which you're you're legally obligated

1379
00:53:35,139 --> 00:53:40,539
to comply you can get arrested for just

1380
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:42,219
resisting like if the cop walks up and

1381
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:44,500
you run away like the köppen even say

1382
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:46,118
anything you just walk onto your block

1383
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,619
or whatever it immediately turned and

1384
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:49,840
ran and he chose to chase you and arrest

1385
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:51,430
you you can get arrested for just

1386
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,490
resisting arrest got arrested for that

1387
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:58,029
all charges got dropped it immediately

1388
00:53:54,489 --> 00:54:02,108
but under correlation of mine got

1389
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:04,119
arrested just for that he they were

1390
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:06,369
climbing through the window of a party

1391
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:08,440
while he was in high school and he put

1392
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:09,880
his arms out just to the sides and went

1393
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,400
get out of my house piggy and he got

1394
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:15,490
tackled and handcuffed and he thought it

1395
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,880
was hilarious but he knew he he'd

1396
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:20,618
survive it because after he was tackled

1397
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,119
and handcuffed like he could do and say

1398
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:25,000
what he wanted he was gonna get bailed

1399
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:29,320
out in less than 24 hours anyway like

1400
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,460
yeah I I was young on probation walking

1401
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,099
with another friend that was on

1402
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:34,659
probation and we had heard that if

1403
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:36,338
you're on probation you're not supposed

1404
00:54:34,659 --> 00:54:38,588
to be with other people on probation so

1405
00:54:36,338 --> 00:54:41,679
these cops came up on us and I darted

1406
00:54:38,588 --> 00:54:44,529
and then I had a little dope sack on me

1407
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:47,019
but I threw it and then I got arrested

1408
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:48,490
and as soon as I like I went to jail got

1409
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:50,230
bailed out and then as soon as I went to

1410
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:52,358
court he was like where are the other

1411
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,710
charges and I was like what do you mean

1412
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:54,940
he was like well what else did you get

1413
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,409
charged for him I said oh I just ran

1414
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,300
because I thought I wasn't supposed to

1415
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:59,920
be hanging out with this person

1416
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,990
automatically dropped let it go bad I'm

1417
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,780
not right here nice umm so I mean that's

1418
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:06,399
a that's a easy so yeah if you could

1419
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,320
just come you know even if you're about

1420
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,010
to get in trouble it's so much easier to

1421
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,650
do with a core

1422
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:14,650
without the why did you run away like

1423
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:16,840
why did you live on a car chase yeah

1424
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:18,880
like why did you injure detective

1425
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:21,340
so-and-so with your door don't do that

1426
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,829
type of it just don't do that you just

1427
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:28,390
play it cool and you're locked in his

1428
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:30,340
head like I don't want to be played just

1429
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:31,809
let it go into the mic night now it was

1430
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,220
directed toward you though I don't think

1436
00:55:42,969 --> 00:55:49,809
Oh interesting thing about the police

1437
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,320
all right so if you're getting pulled

1438
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:55,420
over by an unmarked vehicle would you

1439

00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:58,960
sit there with your windows up and wait

1467
00:56:55,269 --> 00:57:02,108
yeah they can get that was an issue like

1468
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,250
it still is from time to time like every

1469
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:07,108
now and then you'll see in the police

1470
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:09,969
blotter was someone was arrested for

1471
00:57:07,108 --> 00:57:12,130
yeah yeah like a year ago that I was

1472
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:15,279
here so but they pulled over a cop oh

1473
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:16,780
wow immediately he was like you ain't a

1474
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,200
cop and like got out with his gun and

1475
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:20,030
was like somebody going to jail

1476
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:22,480
North Carolina somebody who's

1477
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:26,720
impersonating an officer and uh and

1478
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,699
robbing people like bless you Joe that's

1479
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:29,868
another thing would you do you think

1480
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:32,389
that you have to roll your window down

1481
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:34,190
all the way or can you just do it than

1482
00:57:32,389 --> 00:57:35,900
this necessary amount to talk and

1483
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:37,608
exchange like is that being a douche are

1484
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,680
you pushing the limit by not giving them

1485
00:57:37,608 --> 00:57:40,250
the full endo light what are you trying

1486
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:41,809
to prove

1487
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:43,489
yeah I just roll it down to talk to him

1488
00:57:41,809 --> 00:57:45,608
just yeah I mean yeah cuz if somebody's

1489
00:57:43,489 --> 00:57:49,009
gonna salt you they're doing it through

1490
00:57:45,608 --> 00:57:53,150
stopping no like sir how can I lick your

1491
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:55,190
ballsack today right like it that's why

1492
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:57,710
you play it cool from the get-go so that

1493
00:57:55,190 --> 00:58:01,099
the cop doesn't decide to play it the

1494
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:02,389
hardest way possible is they could just

1495
00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:04,880
decide to arrest you and come through

1496
00:58:02,389 --> 00:58:06,379
that window no problem like yeah just

1497
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,140
roll that [ __ ] down that's why you put

1498
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,519
the weed in the backseat or in the trunk

1499
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:12,170
throw it in an extra bag or a backpack
