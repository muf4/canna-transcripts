trick-or-treaters cannabis infused candy

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm proud of you guys and I want to say

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,480
thanks got a little bit of news article

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,599
here that I want to read if I can get it

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,359
to pop up hello

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,479
all right we got a news article here it

15
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,960
is from the Denver Associated Press the

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,558
high the headline is Halloween pot candy

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,239
scare baseless so far the article says

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,799
police in Colorado have warned parents

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,718
to look out for pot laced Halloween

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,599
candy but parents don't seem too worried

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,239
a denver-based testing company offered a

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,719
thousand free kits to parents wanting to

23
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,000
screen their trick-or-treaters hall for

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,280
marijuana psychoactive chemical however

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,480
only 45 parents took CBC CB scientific

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,879
up on the offer as of Friday there have

27
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,038
been no reported cases of people

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,920
slipping marijuana into unsuspecting

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,599
unsuspecting trick-or-treaters in

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,400
Colorado or in any other state but the

31
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,158
popularity of pot candies in the new

32
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,080
retail Market in Colorado prompted

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,920
warnings this fall from police in Denver

34
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,679
Fort Collins and

35
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,359
PUO as of Halloween Morning Denver

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,920
Police and the Rocky Mountain poison and

37
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,400
Drug Center reported no calls about

38
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,759
marijuana and Halloween candy my honest

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,719
opinion is that it's an overblown fear

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,519
that was created by the police said CB

41
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,679
scientific CEO Bill short the company's

42
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,599
$15 kits are usually used by medical

43
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,759
marijuana patients to test the potency

44
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:38,640
of their weed the kits include small

45
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,680
beakers and a liquid that turns reddish

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,079
in the presence of THC marijuana's

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,880
active ingredient I'm going to jump in

48
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:46,759
here uh marijuana does not have

49
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,280
ingredients marijuana is a plant so you

50
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,599
don't need ingredients to mix it

51
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,560
together and make a plant uh but nice

52
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,519
try uh short said the free kits were

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,039
available to parents anywhere but that

54
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,200
nearly all the requests came from

55
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,960
Colorado we stepped in to tell parents

56
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,840
don't be spooked we're not trying trying

57
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,239
to jump on some fear-mongering bandwagon

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,880
short said since January Children's

59
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,359
Hospital Colorado has reported nine

60
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,919
admissions for children accidentally

61
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,479
consuming edible marijuana it's unclear

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,479
whether those cases were from homemade

63
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,079
treats or edible marijuana purchased

64
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,280
products sold at dispensaries Colorado

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,800
Police have said they're just trying to

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,400
boost awareness because of a wider

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,920
availability of pot candies the larer

68
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,000
county sheriff's department for example

69
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,679
said in its warning that vigilance is

70
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,800
necessary because marijuana candies

71
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,400
don't necessarily appear unusual THC and

72
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,200
refused Edibles are often designed to

73
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,959
look very similar to popular name brand

74
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,039
treats the office warned in Washington

75
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,000
state the other state with legal sorry

76
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,799
I'm going to start that sentence over

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,840
again in Washington state the only other

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,400
state with legal recreational pot sales

79
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,840
authorities have been more

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,200
circumspect a sheriff's detective in

81
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,280
Pierce County Washington wrote a

82
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,919
newspaper column saying pot showing up

83
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,120
in trick or- treat bags is an urban myth

84
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,479
it's two it's too expensive hard to get

85
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,039
and users of these products are pretty

86
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,039
laid-back and not generally terrifying

87
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,519
in nature the detective said my page

88
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,280
just refresh let me scroll back down to

89
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,158
where I was there's something going on

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,680
with my internet where I am today so uh

91
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:08,959
I may lose my connection a couple times

92
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,760
but we will we will make that happen

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,479
where was I now uh it's too expensive

94
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,919
it's hard to get and these uh guys are

95
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,639
laid-back and generally not terrifying

96
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,518
in nature detective Ed Troyer wrote

97
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,199
Monday in the Tacoma weekly and you know

98
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,719
I think uh I think Ed's got the right

99
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,280
idea it's too expensive first of all

100
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:27,000
Edibles at a dispensary are kind of

101
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,039
expensive and people that are buying and

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
using cannabis were not try we're not

103
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,239
mean most of us are not mean-spirited

104
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,598
people we don't want to play tricks on

105
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,959
people we don't want to give people

106
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,479
cannabis and I think most of us have

107
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,120
realized that if we do that we are

108
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,598
fighting down our own movement so my

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,280
point here is that I'm glad nobody gave

110
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:47,318
anybody uh any cannabis infused candies

111
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,759
over Halloween my other point is that

112
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:50,199
that's a lot of hype and a lot of fear

113
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,518
so if you guys are believing that relax

114
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,679
a little bit it's not it's not as big of

115
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,120
a fear as we thought it was so I hope

116
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,040
everybody had a happy and safe

117
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,319
Halloween I am going to uh continue with

118
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,719
this next news article and then we'll do

119
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:04,719
a couple of ads this one's kind of

120
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,840
related part of that article that I just

121
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,039
read said that um a lot of Edibles are

122
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,560
designed to look like popular candies

123
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,239
but uh no more this article comes from

124
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,120
The Denver Post and it is written by

125
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,478
David magoya the headline says ganja

126
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,800
join no more Colorado Edibles firm

127
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,639
settle suit over Hershey

128
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,280
lookalikes uh the article says the small

129
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,439
Colorado Springs based producer of

130
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,918
marijuana edibles sued in June by candy

131
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,680
giant the Hershey Company allegedly

132
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,079
breaching a number of design and name

133
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,639
patents quietly settled the dispute in a

134
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,680
settlement pinned in late September

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,519
tinure Bell agreed to recall and destroy

136
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,639
all Edibles it sold that looked like the

137
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:45,399
famed chocolate company's products or

138
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,319
with names that played on their brands

139
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,038
though the Edibles company said it had

140
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,879
long ago stopped making products that

141
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,560
appeared uh like those products by

142
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,079
Hershey including well-known names such

143
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,720
as Reese's almondjoy and Heath long

144
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,758
before the federal lawsuit was filed in

145
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,160
June in US District Court in Denver the

146
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,240
settlement makes sure sure it won't

147
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,960
happen again so these guys were making

148
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,600
Edibles and some of them were delicious

149
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,079
dude uh they make a reefers peanut

150
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,639
butter bar that looks just like the

151
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,120
Reese's peanut butter bar but it says

152
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,560
reefers on it uh the packaging was the

153
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,879
same color as the Reese's Peanut Butter

154
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,240
Cups it looked very similar so I could

155
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,399
see why Hershey's kind of got pissed at

156
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,360
this um the heath was I forgot what they

157
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,000
called the heath bar uh but these C

158
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,479
candy bars looked just like the original

159
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,680
candy bar that could cause a problem I

160
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,719
could see that if your kid saw that

161
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,038
sitting on the counter which that [ __ ]

162
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,680
should not be sitting out for a kid to

163
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,560
get but if he saw that reefers bar

164
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,079
sitting up there that kid would probably

165
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,720
eat it and that kid would be wrecked and

166
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,439
you'd be a shitty parent and then you'd

167
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,960
be putting another Mark with one of

those kids in the hospital for cannabis

169
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,439
and you'd make the whole movement look

170
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,918
bad so uh the settlement also requires

171
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,719
tincture Bell not to use the product

172
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:58,038
names hashes ganja Joy hash Heath hash

173

candies that contain either peanut

176
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,478
butter or its flavorings the company

177
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,680
also agreed not uh not to make packages

178
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,240
with brown yellow and orange colors

179
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,879
which are those used by Reese's brand

180
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,000
according to a copy of the statement so

181
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,000
now they can't even use any of the

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,319
colors Hershey pretty much uh [ __ ] block

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,879
these guys pretty well from doing

184
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,280
anything like that uh Hershey's and

185
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,759
Hershey's had said tinure Bell's

186
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,879
products harm their brand name and could

187
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,080
be confused for regular Candy by

188
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,240
children which is kind of what I was

189
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,000
saying uh tinure Bell neither admitted

190
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,079
nor denied any allei ation in the

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,439

state legal commercial marijuana growers

to hide among them the rated address was

393

once home to the grow operation for a

394
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,838
medical marijuana product business the

395
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,279
state records show but it is unclear

396
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,560
whether the small business is still

397
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,240
there cannabis industry insiders said

398
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,439
they believe the address is now occupied

399
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,560
by people claiming to be medical

400
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,959
marijuana caregivers smaller scale

401
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,958
providers that operate with less

402
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,479
scrutiny at neighboring cannabis

403
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:18,039
business employees were bewildered by

404
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,720
the flurry of police activity Nate

412
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:35,958
about to get raided not somebody I knew

413
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,360
but there was a house uh in my

414
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,559
neighborhood a few weeks ago there were

415
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,839
just Vehicles like a block away and then

416
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,958

417
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,920

420
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,278
a police car was parked in front of the

421
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,160
shop and another was parked in the alley

422

strung around the perimeter Tuesday's

424
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,240
Tuesday's raids came 11 months after

425
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:58,679
local and federal authorities raided

426
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,480
several large marijuana businesses the

427
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,399
the largest raids on Colorado pop

428
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
businesses excuse me since medical

429
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,799
marijuana became legal four people

430
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,240
connected to the businesses raided then

431
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,198
have been charged with federal crimes

432
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,639
and prosecutors have also moved the

433
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:13,838
seize businesses have moved to seize the

434
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,759
business's

435
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,800
assets so uh I don't from what I have

436
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,360
read and seen recently and what's going

437
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:25,319
on on Facebook these uh facilities were

438
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,600
not legal medical marijuana me

439
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,399
registered facilities these were

440
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,120
caregivers who have kind of vague rules

441
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,839
but they were probably out of their

442
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,440
plant count and if they had that much

443
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,880
money on them they were doing something

444
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,480
that they shouldn't have been doing um a

445
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,240
friend of mine on Facebook said that he

446
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,879
saw at least a 100 lights stacked up

447
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,318
outside of one of these facilities and

448
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,078
imagine being the guys that work at

449
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:51,679

and they come in with guns blazing I'm

457
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,039
sure oh man imagine having the legal

458
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
business next door and you didn't get

459
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,919
raided and you're just sitting there

460
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,079

waiting for anymore oh man but from what

466
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,000
I've seen these places were not legal so

467
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,480
this wasn't the feds taking down medical

468
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,600
marijuana facilities this was actual

469
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,159
raids on illegal Groves and I know that

470
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,800
sounds weird being in Colorado but there

471
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,759
are a lot of these large scale illegal

472
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,078
grows going on I bet they'll keep taking

473
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,720
them down

474
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:42,638
too all right I've got another

475
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,440
article this one is

476
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,079
uh this one I found on where did I find

477
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,839
this is from to of the Town guys it's I

478
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:50,318
look at the Cannabis the to of the town

479
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,360
I look at a lot of websites to find my

480
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:55,039
cannabis news um unfortunately you have

481
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,680
to type in the word marijuana to find

482
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,799
good cannabis news I'm trying to change

483
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:01,638
that here's a reminder marijuana Iana is

484
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,719
a racist word it was created with racism

485
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,519
uh it supports a racist connotation so

486
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,919
we're going to stop saying marijuana and

487
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,720
let's all say cannabis uh cannabis is

488
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,559
the Revolutionary term uh the people

489
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,838
before us the older folks are afraid of

490
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,439
marijuana they're not as afraid of

491
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,399
cannabis we've kind of it's all about

492
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,240
the words if you say the right words you

493
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,839
can convince people just about anything

494
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,959
so let's start saying cannabis and not

495
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:23,879
saying

496
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,679
marijuana the uh headline of this

497
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,080
article Georgia drug agents bust man

498
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,360
with okra and believe it is marij

499
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,599
this kind of an old story some of you

500
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,479
guys might have heard about it it's from

501
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,000
Mike

502
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,400
Adams the article says oh this is really

503
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,240
long we might summarize some of this

504
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Americans are no longer safe to

505
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,558
cultivate common garden vegetables

506
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,079
without risking the violent Wrath of the

507
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:48,279
drug war no other citizen understands

508
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,480
this lunacy quite like Georgia resident

509
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,279
Dwayne Perry who told reporters that he

510
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,160
was raided by drug agents earlier last

511
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,480
week after an aerial surveillance unit

512
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,759
mistook his Oprah crop for marijuana

513
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,360
that's right it appears appears as

514
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,839
though Georgia law enforcement has not

515
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,519
had enough experience taking down

516
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,399
marijuana grow operations to distinguish

517
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:08,519
the difference between okra and the

518
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,038
cannabis plant dude there is a picture

519
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:15,319
of an okra plant here um does not look

520
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:17,359
at all like pot to me it's got big round

521
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:18,759
leaves the leaves are not serated it

522
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,359
doesn't have the fingery leaves it

523
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:25,119
doesn't look like a hand uh doesn't look

524
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:27,038
like weed at all uh train these guys a

525
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,678
little more so I'm going to summarize

526
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,519
this article reports indicate that drug

527
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,000
task force was conducting a marijuana

528
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,480
suppression Mission when officers

529
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,679
spotted Perry's okra plants and

530
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,279
immediately thought he was growing weed

531
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,159
okra plants incidentally consist of Five

532
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,119
Fat leaves while the cannabis plant has

533
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:45,080
very distinguishable F foliage they

534
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,319
spelled foilage Dr foliage wrong here

535
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:51,158
they put f o i o l i

536
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,158
a messed my brain all up in other words

537
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,559
the two plants look absolutely nothing

538
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:57,360
alike unfortunately that did not stop

539
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,359
officers with Georgia State Patrol from

540
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,798
swooping in on per

541
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,399
residents Dressed to Kill is what it

542
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:04,798
says here in an attempt to destroy the

543
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,840
suspected marijuana growing in his

544
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,639
backyard they were strapped to the gills

545
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,279
said Perry explaining to reporters how

546
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,840
the officers seemed prepared to shoot

547
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,839
him dead on the spot over a case of

548
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,759
mistaken

549
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:18,879
identity oh man these cops went in and

550
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,679
raided this guy imagine when you get

551
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,880
raided it's traumatic uh I've been

552
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,080
involved in a couple of raids

553
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,400
unfortunately knock on wood I'm never in

554
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,798
one of those again the cops come in they

555
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,640
you could they're coming into your home

556
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:31,558
you could have AK-47 you could have a

557
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,799
bomb you could have dogs you could be

558
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,678
crazy as [ __ ] and they're coming in they

559
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,599
are prepared for whatever you're doing

560
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,880
in there and it's scary they put you on

561
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,599
the ground they cuff you they put a gun

562
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,960
to your head they talk [ __ ] to you uh if

563
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,158
you're doing some kind of crime or in a

564
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,558
house where there's some [ __ ] going on

565
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,960
you might expect that you might be the

566
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:48,359
type of person that's prepared for that

567
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,200
you may have had police interaction and

568
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,879
you know how to handle yourself this

569
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,519
dude is a okra grower in Georgia I'm

570
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,360
pretty sure he's not uh experienced with

571
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,720
the SWAT team and the state patrol so so

572
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:01,839
he probably [ __ ] his pants when they

573
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,440
came in probably traumatized him

574
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,199
probably traumatized his family now if

575
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,120
there are any kids there they're scared

576
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,679
shitless of the cops now so let's get a

577
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,479
little more I skipped a couple of little

578
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
short paragraphs although Perry is

579
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,640
grateful that a trigger happy cop did

580
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,519
not riddle him full of holes during the

581
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,440
raid he says there is no excuse for this

582
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:21,279
level of domestic War Warfare over a

583
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,600
plan here I am at home and retired and

584
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,839
you know I do the right thing said Perry

585
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,240
they come to my house strapped with

586
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:30,000
weapons for no reason it ain't right

587
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,919
several officers did Apologize after

588
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,119
further investigating the plants but

589
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,360
that simply isn't good enough says Perry

590
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,639
because the situation could have

591
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,719
potentially gotten him killed or

592
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,559
seriously injured more I thought about

593
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,720
it what could have happened he said

594
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,279
anything could have happened so I'm

595
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,120
going to wrap up that article good job

596
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,639
Georgia police good job I bet that uh I

597
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:51,119
bet that made you feel good I bet that

598
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,480
was a good way to spend your money I bet

599
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,158
you scared the [ __ ] out of this old

600
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,159
retired guy for no

601
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,679
reason instead of making friends the

602
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,520
cops keep making more enemies by doing

603
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,080
[ __ ] like this if you'd put down your

604
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,679
guns and quit trying to be soldiers and

605
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:04,480
just be friends and police the community

606
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,880
like we designed the police for you'd

607
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,880
have a lot more damn friends I think and

608
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,320
then when [ __ ] goes wrong the cops uh

609
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,799
would have somebody to talk to they

610
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,480
wouldn't have to like when [ __ ] goes

611
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:14,839
wrong now everybody disappears nobody

612
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,558
wants to talk to the cops because the

613
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,519
cops are the bad guy now if you're the

614
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,119
good guy still we'd want to talk to you

615
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,038
because we know you'd help us now we

616
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,079
don't feel like you're going to help us

617
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,158
feel like you're going to kick my ass

618
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,399
just for pulling me over and it sucks

619
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,559
shouldn't be scared to pull over and the

620
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,080
cops are pulling me over you're the guys

621
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:32,240
I should trust

622
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:34,519
anyway I'm ranting uh this is a uh

623
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,440
ridiculous article I saw this unfold on

624
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:38,240
Facebook this was highly entertaining

625
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,558
this story is a little bit old but it's

626
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,880
well worth talking about we haven't done

627
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:43,319
any news on the show for a while we've

628
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,640
been packing up such great shows here's

629
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:48,519
a funny article this one is by William

630
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,278
Brees uh the article is headlined idiot

631
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,440
allegedly rips off pot leaves cell phone

632
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:55,880
behind we had a lot of fun with this one

633
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,679
you guys this guy named Chris

634
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,320
Mathers uh from Colorado

635
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,320
I'll just read the story Chris Mathers

636
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,038
is apparently a thief but not a good one

637
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,599
we know this because the junky scumbag

638
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:07,240
left his smartphone behind earlier this

639
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,079
week while allegedly ripping off a

640
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,640
Colorado Grower's outdoor

641
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,879
Garden one of several he's allegedly

642
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,640
burglarized now thanks to social media

643
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,880
he's got the attention of local police

644
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,480
see this Mastermind matters left his

645
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,600
phone unlocked which allowed the victim

646
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,440
to pull up more than enough information

647
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,119
on the scumbag to track him down and

648
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,960
eventually get the cops involved details

649
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,399
are hazy most to keep the Grower's

650
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,919
identity identity somewhat discreet but

651
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,720
after getting over the initial horror of

652
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:37,200
seeing their Harvest still weeks from

653
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,440
being finished gone the owners of the

654
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,319
grow were no doubt elated to find some

655
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,240
rather concrete evidence leaking Mathers

656
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,798
to their grow no word on how matters

657
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,599
would even know about the grow it says

658
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,359
in uh parenthesis After figuring out

659
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,519
that the guy left his phone his cell

660
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,399
phone open for anyone to use the grower

661
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,599
handed things over to the social media

662
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,440
here's a post from one of the Grower's

663
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,918
friends it says my friends outdoor was

664
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,558
ripped last night one of the Rippers

665
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,759
dropped his phone I'm going to post his

666
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:05,119
profile below and his buddy that was

667
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,960
involved found out through reading

668
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,678
messages please hit me up if you know

669
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,278
them and quickly it escalated I actually

670
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,159
saw these posts on Facebook and it was

671
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:15,960
really it was like it's like watching a

672
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,720
real soap opera or a reality show

673
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,919
happened on Facebook all

674
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,200
day so it says the victim pulled photos

675
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,159
of a passed out matters his address

676
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,600
phone number and even a list of other

677
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,400
grow Ops he had allegedly ripped off

678
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:32,599
while the Growers no doubt had the

679
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,400
inclination to go beat his head in they

680
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:37,719
wisely called the cops after all pot is

681
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,600
a legal thing to grow in this state and

682
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,120
this is outright theft so there was a

683
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,639
lot of talk on Facebook about people

684
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,239
just going and whipping this guy's ass

685
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,080
because we had his home phone number we

686
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,919
had his address we knew all of his

687
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:53,759
friends uh he was in deep [ __ ] uh but

688
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,919
like this article says it's legal to

689
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,519
have cannabis in this state so they

690
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,000
called the cops uh and and I'm pretty

691
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,200
sure this guy was arrested for this but

692
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,720
let's read the article it says for his

693
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,319

694
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,038

butt all right this article headline

783
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:25,440
says and you're going to have to pay

784
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,759
attention Wyoming governor candidate

785
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,679
wants to shoot wolves because Colorado

786
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,640
smoke

787
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,038
weed I'm going to say that again Wyoming

788
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,278
governor candidate wants to shoot wolves

789
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:39,359
because colorodans smoke

790
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:41,319
weed the article says Don Willis wants

791
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,719
to kill wolves he also wants to be

792
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:45,158
Governor but right now he's all about

793
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,558
killing him some wolves so much so that

794
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,360
he's made it part of his campaign

795
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,918
strategy see Wyoming has permitted wolf

796
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,839
hunts in the past but this year a

797
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,799
federal judge put the animals a key

798
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:57,599
component to the water ecosystem on a

799
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,720
protected list that pisses off Willis

800
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,879
who as previously noted just wants

801
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,440
wolves to die now Willis is saying that

802
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,640
the state should allow the hunt despite

803
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,240
Federal Protection because Colorado has

804
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,080
legal weed the wolf tags have been

805
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,278
issued and Hunters had already made

806
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:15,158
plans to start their hunts he said the

807
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,398
disruption to Hunters Outfitters and the

808
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,960
cost Wyoming Game and Fish to refund

809
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:22,239
hunting permits caused by a single black

810
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,600
robe judge who sits in Washington DC and

811
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,679
has probably never been in Wyoming is

812
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,439
outrageous and should be defied by

813
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,038
Wyoming yes apparently you live in you

814
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,600
have to live in Wyoming to actually care

815
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,278
about Wyoming's wolf population Willis

816
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,319
is now calling on Hunters to go ahead

817
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,720
and disobey the federal

818
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:42,319
order Colorado did just that in the

819
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,798
legalization of pot it's a federal crime

820
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,599
to Comm commercially grow pot and the

821
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,639
state of Colorado defied the federal

822
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,798
laws and it all worked out fine he told

823
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,720
the Billings Gazette while carefully

824
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,359
pointing out that he doesn't think

825
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,399
people should break federal law to use

826
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,959
cannabis nor was he endorsing cannabis

827
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,798
use he also taunted the US fish and

828
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,600
wildlife service saying he doubted they

829
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,639
would enforce the judge's ruling because

830
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,558
they normally side with Wyoming on such

831
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,519
matters current Wyoming Governor Matt me

832
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,720
agreed that the hunt should go on but

833
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,798
stopped short of advocating advocating

834
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,038
people disobey the federal protections

835
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:19,119
on animals which are purely shot for

836
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,640
trophy oh they just shoot wolves for

837
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,359
trophy uh Wyoming is successfully

838
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,440
negotiated against Federal overreach and

839
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:29,079
when necessary they have gone to court

840
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,919
he said in a relief I do not Advocate

841
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:32,918
taking an extreme stand doomed to

842
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:35,200
failure which undermines Wyoming's

843
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,519
interest instead of moving forward the

844
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,159
article goes on to say that they are

845
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,880
going to pretty much monitor the amount

846
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,840
of wolves and then they will uh

847
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,760
reconsider lifting the uh the ban on

848
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,959
Wolf hunting but I think this is funny

849
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:47,480
that the governor is like hey man

850
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,278
they're smoking pot in Colorado and the

851
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,960
FEDS ain't doing [ __ ] so let's shoot our

852
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:53,839
wolves in Wyoming and I bet the feds

853
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,919
won't do [ __ ] uh I'm curious to see how

854
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,798
that turns out that's coming up so uh I

855
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:02,559
might pay pay attention to that chances

856
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:04,440
are I will forget all about that one

857
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,200

article let me get to it it says

879
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,760
Colorado Congressman urges Oregon to

887
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,639
Friday uh that marijuana legalization is

888
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,638
sound policy and he urged oregonians to

889
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:13,678
follow in Colorado's footsteps and vote

890
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:16,278
Yes on recreational marijuana in next

891
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,840
week's election Colorado is approaching

892
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:19,638
the first anniversary of Legally

893
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,720
regulated recreational marijuana for

894
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:25,199
adults polus wrote uh in the Bend

895
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,519
Bulletin the implementation of our new

896
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,519
laws has gone smoothly overall providing

897
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,599
an excellent example for other states to

898
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,319
follow our success has made it clear

899
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,879
that when marijuana is regulated like

900
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:38,398
alcohol it can decrease crime help fund

901
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,200
schools and Drug education programs and

902
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:43,000
keep money out of the hands of criminals

903
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,919
and cartels big up I agree with most of

904
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,200
that uh Oregon voters are considering

905
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,240
measure 91 which would allow adults to

906
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,000
possess up to 8 ounces of marijuana at

907
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,960
home and up to 1 ounce in public taxes

908
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,798
on marijuana sales would fund schools

909
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,360
law enforcement and Drug prevention and

910
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,000
education programs while orgon while the

911
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,158
Oregon Liquor Control Commission would

912
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,038
regulate and monitor the

913
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,440
industry sounds like it makes sense

914
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,000
let's do it I'm excited Oregon will soon

915
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,880
decide whether to join Colorado and

916
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,240
Washington in regulating marijuana like

917
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,639
alcohol wrote polus who previously

918
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,960
sponsored legislation that would do just

919
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:19,959
that at the federal level more than ever

920
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,240
I believe it's time to change course on

921
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,399
Decades of failed marijuana prohibition

922
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,319
and demonstrate viable effective

923
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:27,839
alternatives to address the realities of

924
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,759
marijuana today

925
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:33,398
day uh Colorado's Colorado voters

926
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,240
legalized recreational marijuana in 2012

927
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:36,599
with the first sales beginning on New

928
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,480
Year's Day

929
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:39,918
2014 guys I don't know if I've mentioned

930
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,919
this on the show before I'm sure I

931
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,600
haven't being a smartass I was the first

932
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,159
guy to buy recreational Cannabis at The

933
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:49,000
Greener Side dispensary in PUO Colorado

934
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,919
I got there at like 5:40 6:00 in the

935
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,519
morning and sat in line and bought weed

936
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,278
first at one of my good friends

937
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,240
dispensaries kind of made me proud

938
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,480
anyway uh while the roll out of of the

939
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,120
new regulatory regime has been has not

940
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,240
been perfect it is largely been deemed a

941
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,599
success voters supported the end of

942
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,359
marijuana perit prohibition by a 10

943
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,759
percentage Point margin in 2012 and have

944
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,879
continued to support

945
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:15,960
it within the regulated market place T

946
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,639
teens appear to have been prevented from

947
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,120
making illegal

948
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:22,119
purchases the legal sale of recreational

949
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,199
and medical marijuana has been lucrative

950
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:27,479
for the state generating about $30

951
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,440
million in taxes and fees the Colorado

952
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,038
legisl legislative Council forecast that

953
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,519
in the first full fiscal year of legal

954
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:37,319
recreational sales the state will rake

955
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,359
in

956
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:43,798
47.7 million that's a lot of money if

957
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,839
Oregon passes measure 91 the state's

958
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:47,759
Financial estimate committee projects

959
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:51,678
that additional tax revenues could range

960
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,638
from 17 million to $40 million annually

961
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,559
a recent study from the personal finance

962
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:58,079
site nerd wallet placed the forecast

963
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:02,038
range for Oregon between 50 million and

964
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:04,319
$100 million in tax revenue voters in
