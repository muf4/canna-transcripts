season Growers and we are very thankful

for your willingness to do so uh that's

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,080
an amazing compliment thank you to be

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,598
empowering Growers uh new and

54
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,719
experienced that does mean a lot to me

55
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,159
that is actually the goal of the podcast

56
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,840
so it means a lot to hear that I'm

57
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,318
hitting that exact goal thank you now it

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,239
goes on it says I've got a pet peeve my

59
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,839
example is when I'm listening to a live

60
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,280
show or a podcast and they have someone

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,759
either in the community in the comments

62
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,840
or a guest being a no at all and not

63
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,959
being open to have a conversation to

64
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,039
talk about anything they're doing

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,680
themselves a disservice by being so

66
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,719
hard-headed and it just leaves a bad

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,239
Vibe thanks for the consideration much

68
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:46,840
respect from your friend shaie Mack yes

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,840
shaie Mack I agree with you in so many

70
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,959
ways it's frustrating when uh there's a

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,800
panel a group and one person does like

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,400
to just try to take control and push

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,200
their agenda uh I will admit I do talk a

74
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,120
lot when I'm on other podcasts but I

75
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,839
understand what I'm saying I'm educated

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,800
on the topic I try not to interrupt I

77
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,120
try to listen and I try to give uh

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
positive and useful Insight when I'm

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,360
talking on a show I don't just try to

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,840
talk about random [ __ ] I try to have

81
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,760
something that pertains to the subject

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,000
something that could help you out uh but

83
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,598
I do understand not everybody is as good

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,719
of a guest as we would like them all to

85
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,158
be some people will talk right over you

86
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:21,318
some people will interrupt you some

87
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,679
people are there with an agenda already

88
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:24,719
we brought them on a show where maybe

89
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,840
we're both a guest on a show to talk

90
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,479
about uh germinating seeds but they want

91
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,319
to talk about their new nutrient line so

92
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,158
every other paragraph out of them is

93
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,238
about their new nutrient line that [ __ ]

94
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,479
does happen super frustrating and the

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,480
know-it-alls in the comments the

96
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,560
know-it-alls on the shows yes that is

97
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:42,280
super frustrating there are so many ways

98
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,759
to grow this plant and it bothers me

99
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,640
when you come up with an idea you're you

100
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,759
start talking about your grow and this

101
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,119
often happens there are a couple of

102
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,318
Industries I've worked in that this

103
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,920
happens and I'm going to get off on a

104
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,000
side tangent here but this what is what

105
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,438
makes the show fun so I've shopped at

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,840
Guitar Center and I've shopped at grow

107
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:57,840
stores in the past and they both have

108
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,400
the same uh sort of thing you go in

109
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
there and you tell the person what

110
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,920
you're trying to do they're like hey

111
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,679
welcome to either a garden center or a

112
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:06,598
Guitar Center it's either [ __ ] one

113
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,959
they go hey welcome to the store what

114
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:09,158
are you trying to do today how can we

115
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,519
help you and he say yeah I'm trying to

116
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:12,318
complete this project here's what I'm

117
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,480
trying to do I need Part B I've got a

118
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,039
and c I need Part B can you show me

119
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,039
where that is it seems like at both of

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,000
those places the Guitar Center and the

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,319
grow center they both go oh your idea

122
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,839
sucks bro the only way it's going to

123
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,560
work is if you do my idea and that's so

124
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,879
frustrating when people can't they don't

125
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,160
even know my goal they don't know what

126
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,360
I'm trying to do they don't know my

127
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,479
situation but their way is better than

128
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,840
mine and only their way will work that

129
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,519
does drive me crazy and frustrate me I

130
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,439
do love it when I look into a garden and

131
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,240
I see I can go these people listen to

132
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,079
the show cuz they're growing uh three

133
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,120
gallon pots with cocoa with perlite they

134
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,599
got a drip system they got trellis uh

135
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,680
they got the light setup the way I talk

136
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,400
about I can see it I love that but guess

137
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,280
what if you don't grow the way that I do

138
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm totally fine with that grow the way

139
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,559
that works for you grow what works best

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,279
for you and absorb the knowledge and

141
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,639
information that works best for you also

142
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,079
keep in mind there are a lot of podcast

143
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,600
Asters out there I grow a certain way

144
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,839
all the other podcasters grow a

145
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,840
different way I don't know how they grow

146
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,079
but I know it's different because

147
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,119
they're not in my room doing it the

148
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,719
exact same way so we all grow a little

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,918
bit differently everybody out there

150
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
we're doing the same thing with a

151
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,240
different style with a Different Twist

152
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,199
on it so take the information you get

153
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,759
that applies to you use it if it doesn't

154
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,879
apply to you take it with a huge grain

155
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,400
of salt and then judge the vibe of the

156
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,240
podcaster that you're listening to the

157
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,519
guest whoever it is you know it sounds

158
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,918
like this person already knows who they

159
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,038
do and do not want to listen to so yes

160
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,758
there are so many ways to grow this

161
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,560
plant so the know it alls do drive me

162
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,160
crazy the hard-headed folks do drive me

163
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,000
crazy um something else that drives me

164
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,080
crazy and this is coming from a person

165
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,519
who is a podcast viewer and also a

166
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,599
podcast producer but also I'm a guest on

167
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:47,240
podcast so I get a lot of different uh

168
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,560
perspectives of this but when podcasters

169
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,639
interrupt guests it drives me freaking

170
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,079
crazy uh I don't have that problem on

171
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,478
this show because it's just me rambling

172
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,279
if somebody's interrupting it's probably

173
00:05:55,478 --> 00:06:00,038
Mike interrupting me and I approve of

174
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,959
that but um they'll get a a good flow

175
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,719
going right they'll have a a host and a

176
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,239
guest and then a co-host maybe or maybe

177
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,479
it's just even the host they'll get a

178
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,720
good flow going and they'll be like

179
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:11,159
question answer question answer and they

180
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,199
finally they got to warm up to each

181
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,680
other you know what I mean it takes a

182
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,199
couple of questions and answers and some

183
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,160
chatting to get comfortable on a show

184
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,240
but then they'll ask that one question

185
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,199
that we've all been waiting for and the

186
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,519
breeder or the answerer or sometimes

187
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,160
it's me I'll get excited like yes I'm

188
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,680
excited to answer this um if I'm excited

189
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
about the question I know that the

190
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,240
listeners are excited about my response

191
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,280
because I've been asked freaking

192
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,000
everything on a podcast by now so if you

193
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,719
ask me a cool creative question shout

194
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,918
out to Chad Westport for asking cool

195
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,000
questions it gets me excited then I get

196
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:43,399
excited to answer so I start telling you

197
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,720
something really cool I can talk for a

198
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,359
couple of minutes and tell you something

199
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,440
really cool but then about 30 seconds

200
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,439
into that either the co-host or the guy

201
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,199
that asked me the question will distract

202
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,038
me interrupt me ask me another question

203
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,840
and Sidetrack that you know I don't get

204
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,240
to finish that and I'm trying to keep up

205
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,918
with the show and keep the show moving

206
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,439
so I answer the second question uh the

207
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,799
audience if I'm the one listening to the

208
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,800
show or the one on the show I know the

209
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,800
audience got screwed out of hearing that

210
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,439
sometimes I go ah shut up I wanted to

211
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,520
hear that answer but the host will just

212
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:12,639
talk right over the guest not even give

213
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,318
us the opportunity to hear a really cool

214
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,879
answer if you just let a guest talk

215
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,720
sometimes uh you'll get a really cool

216
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,879
story you'll get really cool details

217
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,960
that you never would have gotten with

218
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,680
just a straight back and forth uh just

219
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,839
question answer question answer rapid

220
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,759
fire sort of thing let a guest talk is

221
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,799
something that I really enjoy or that is

222
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,240
a pet peeve when people do that if they

223
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,199
don't let the guests talk that drives me

224
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,240
crazy I do have more notes here um what

225
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,120
also drives me crazy on podcast is when

226
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,598
um I'm talking to a camera right now I

227
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,079
don't have any feedback from an audience

228
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:43,959
but I know you're there I'm imagining

229
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,478
you uh I'm imagining some people over

230
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,638
there just snacking popcorn some people

231
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:48,240
are hitting the bong some people are

232
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,879
just scrolling into their computer some

233
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,199
people are on their car but anyway um I

234
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,879
don't get any feedback right here but

235
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,879
when I'm talking to somebody or when I

236
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,000
watch a podcast where it's two people

237
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,960
talking back and forth and it's just

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,639
question answer question question answer

239
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,799
that's cool but I'd like it to connect a

240
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,038
little bit it drives me crazy when the

241
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,478
guy's like what's your favorite color

242
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,318
and he's like purple and he goes cool

243
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,399
where'd you grow up California cool what

244
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,520
do you drink soda cool what do you eat

245
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,079
tacos it's just such a boring interview

246
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,959
I like to see people connect a little

247
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,318
bit more but I do agree I am a podcast

248
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,079
listener a podcast consumer I'm also a

249
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,919
producer and a guest so I get to sit in

250
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,318
three different chairs and see three

251
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:26,680
different perspectives of podcasting and

252
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,759
everybody does it differently just like

253
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,158
we're growing all the podcasters do it

254
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,919
differently do it differently than the

255
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:33,958
dude grow show the dude grow show does

256
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,120
it differently than Adam Dunn and we all

257
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,439
do it differently than Tad hussy uh

258
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,000
everybody just has their own style but

259
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,440
um I do agree with you my friend it does

260
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,679
drive me crazy when there is a

261
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,839
know-it-all either on the show or in the

262
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,759
comments it's great to shine it's great

263
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,519
to have something to say but I feel like

264
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,240
some people just want to type into the

265
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,360
comments just to show that they can type

266
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,759

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,519
will get a coupon code for a free pack

326
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:07,439
of iy genetics premium seeds now let's

327
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,200
jump into the answer here um my friend

328
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,360
is experiencing yellowing and midflower

329
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,759
and they're asking if push uh could or

330
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,399
would help with that yellowing uh push

331
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,759
of course is a foler Fed product from

332
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,200
our friends at hydroponic research they

333
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,919
are the folks that put out the product

334
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,519
veg Bloom they also put out shine it's a

335
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,958
great set of products that they've got

336
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,519
there uh the question is will the push

337
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,958
product help with the yellowing um I

338
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,879
don't think it is going to be the

339
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,439
solution that you were looking for what

340
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,838
you are experiencing or what the plants

341
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,560
are showing you is a nitrogen deficiency

342
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,680
which means those plants basically need

343
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,838
nitrogen if you feed them push they're

344
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,278
going to start cycling even more quickly

345
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,320
and I think you're going to see more

346
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:50,639
deficiencies because of the uh the

347
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,200
already deficient uh nitrogen there so

348
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,278
what I really think you need is nitrogen

349
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,639
now what I would recommend uh is more

350
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,720
nitrogen late in the veg phase I know

351
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,600
you can't do that now but when you do

352
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,120
grow this plant next time I would

353
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,759
continue the nitrogen your base nutrient

354
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,679
uh it says you're doing Sanic so I don't

355
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,480
know what kind of bottles or what you're

356
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,000
doing I don't know your combo there of

357
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,519
your Sanic stuff see that's kind of why

358
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,120
it throws us off and I have no idea what

359
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,320
you're doing I just know that some of

360
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,198
it's organic some of it is bottled stuff

361
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,079
but one thing I would recommend is if

362
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:22,198
you grow this same cultivar the same

363
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,759
plant again is that you give this plant

364
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:26,799
more nitrogen late in the veg phase and

365
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:28,639
continue that nitrogen a little bit

366
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,120
later into the flowering phase we

367
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,600
already know this plant's going to use a

368
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,480
lot of nitrogen it's burning out early

369
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,320
let's give it more the plant will

370
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,600
receive most of its nitrogen in that

371
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,120
late veg phase and it will store it up

372
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,800
then it will use a lot of that stored

373
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,519
nitrogen into the flowering phase but in

374
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,519
this situation it seems like you did not

375
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,198
have enough of that nitrogen stored up

376
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:49,799
so the plants are running out of energy

377
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:51,559
now there are a couple of things you can

378
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,958
do you can bottle feed with a nitrogen

379
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,159
based nutrient that wouldn't be a

380
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,719
problem you can also fol your feed with

381
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,519
that nitrogen based nutrient I wouldn't

382
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,680
do the push the push is like I said the

383
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,198
push is going to uh probably make the

384
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,879
plants try to go faster than they're

385
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:07,240
already going it's going to create more

386
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,240
problems I would not use the push unless

387
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,159
everything looks good already push is

388
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,320
not a fixer push is an enhancer in my

389
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,759
opinion in my experience I wouldn't use

390
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,160
it to fix it's push it's called push

391
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,078
it's like everything else is already in

392
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,879
line now let's [ __ ] push so that's

393
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,638
what I think push would be for I think

394
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,639
the yellowing that you are seeing is a

395
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,879
nitrogen deficiency most likely most

396
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,759
commonly uh that yellowing is a nitrogen

397
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:31,759
deficiency so I would boost up the

398
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,919
nitrogen I would do that next time I

399
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,120
would do it by increasing that in veg I

400
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,078
would add more nitrogen later in the veg

401
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,360
phase let it store up all of that so

402
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,399
that it can use that early into the

403
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,839
flowering phase and keep feeding it the

404
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,839
nitrogen um you're probably not using an

405
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,040
a&amp; b a v in a bloom bottle but let's say

406
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,959
that somebody is using uh veg NES and

407
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,319
then they're going to flip to the

408
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,958
flowering NES uh for this particular

409
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,120
plant I would keep those vegetative

410
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,319
nutrients in the mix for at least one

411
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,159
more maybe 2 weeks and then switch to

412
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,040
that flow powering nutrient if you were

413
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,639
using the bottles so I really think that

414
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,480
uh the problem here is a nitrogen

415
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,959
deficiency another thing that you may

416
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,360
want to check on and you may want to

417
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:13,879
dial in is the pH of the feed or the

418
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,278
water going into your plant don't stress

419
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,600
too much on the pH of the soil itself

420
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:21,078
you will be chasing that forever uh that

421
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,639
will always be in flux based on how wet

422
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:26,078
how dry that soil is the flux the pH

423
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,320
will always be changing focus on the pH

424
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,359
of the solution that is going into that

425
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,480
I don't know if it's a bed a pot or what

426
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,839
you're working with but if you're mixing

427
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,278
[ __ ] up if you're pouring in just water

428
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,440
adjust that pH and get it consistent I

429
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,320
would recommend uh somewhere between 62

430
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,600
and 65 I'm not sure what you've got

431
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,399
going on but pick a number that you like

432
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,159
that you think will work for your setup

433
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,519
and stay consistent when you water that

434
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,198
may also help with your nutrient uptake

435
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,759
but what I really think happened was

436
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,319
these plants took off on you they didn't

437
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,959
have enough nitrogen now they're showing

438
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,120
a little bit of yellow the only thing to

439
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:00,198
do is feed them nitrogen we call this

440
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,839
chasing the plant and it's definitely

441
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:04,599
getting away from you all right my dude

442
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,480
Daniel thank you for the great question

443
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,278
do check your email because you've got a

444
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,639
coupon code for a free pack of seeds all

445
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,000
right we're having fun there's no reason

446
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,799
to stop now let's keep it going the next

447
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,440
question came from our friend who wants

448
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,399
to be called Brian Brian thank you for

449
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,440
the great question this one once again

450
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,519
came from that growel tab on iry

451
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,360
genetics.com the question says Hey Rasta

452
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,320
Jeff hey Brian thank you for the great

453
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,680
question says I just want to start off

454
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,120
by saying thanks for all of the

455
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,318
knowledge you give for free and for

456
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,399
inspiration to breed bro those are two

457
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:36,799
great things to get compliments for dude

458
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,519
thank you thank you for noticing that

459
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,559
the podcast is free that I don't charge

460
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,440
a thing for the show uh 825 episodes

461
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,559
available on YouTube go listen to all of

462
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,920
them and also thanks for saying that I

463
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,078
inspire you to breed I love that uh

464
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:52,318
breeding cannabis gives me joy so being

465
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,000
able to pass on that skill uh and that

466
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,679
joy to somebody else that puts a smile

467
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
on my face let me stay focused it says

468
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:00,879
I'm about to start popping some of your

469
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,318
feminine fzed seeds very good idea it

470
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,799
says I bought these seeds and I'm

471
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:07,159
wondering if I pollinate those feminized

472
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,679
plants with a male will it make more

473
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:13,879
than usual amount of female seeds or

474
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:15,799
just the usual 5050 male female that is

475
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:19,399
a very good question there are a lot of

476
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:21,519
uh weird ideas uh misconceptions myths

477
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,519
misnomers if you will about feminized

478
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,440
seeds uh this is a very good question

479
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,919
that pops up a lot and the answer to

480
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,519
this is very simple uh you should

481
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,838
probably get get 50% male and 50% female

482
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,519
nothing will be different um if this

483
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,079
seed if this plant came from if your

484
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,519
female plant came from a regular seed or

485
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,799
a feminized seed it will not make any

486
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,879
difference when you breed with that

487
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:47,000
plant if it will produce more male or

488
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:49,360
female seeds it will produce 50/50 the

489
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,318
only difference in that feminized plant

490
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,720
and a regular plant is that there were

491
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,719
no male chromosomes um shout out to my

492
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,319
friend Mr Soul because Mr Soul kind of

493
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,199
put this idea in my head this way of

494
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:01,719
thinking about fem seeds this is not the

495
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:03,639
way that it works but this is a good

496
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,279
mindset a good idea of how to grasp

497
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:09,160
feminized seeds and how they work think

498
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,838
about it this way the only difference is

499
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,839
if maybe hypothetically I had a male

500
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,119
plant over here and I've got a female

501
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,519
plant over here when I'm producing

502
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,678
feminized seeds think about it that I

503
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,318
magically created a force field that

504
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,640
does not let male pollen get to my

505
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:28,240
female plant because in my opinion in my

506
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,320
experience in my studies the pollen is

507
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,519
what determines the sex yes I have gone

508
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,678
back to the pollen why do I believe that

509
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,639
because I can make feminized seeds from

510
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,240
female pollen so think about my theory

511
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,919
my my idea that I want you to wrap your

512
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,839
head around is the only difference is

513
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,799
that I have sucked out of the room all

514
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,079
of the male pollen so let's just say

515
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,599
that the pollen's coming off of that

516
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,000
male plant 50% of that pollen will be a

517
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,439
boy 50% of that pollen will be a girl

518
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,679
I've got a security guard standing at

519
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,679
the door going ladies only bro or I've

520
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,600
got a shop vac that only sucks up male

521
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,038
pollen or a filter that only gets male

522
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:03,240
pollen so only girl female pollen has

523
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,319
made it to the female plants that is the

524
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,359
only difference once that pollination

525
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:09,720
has happened everything is the same

526
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,119
other than no dudes it's going to be all

527
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,519
females that is the only difference once

528
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:15,759
again I want to give credit to my friend

529
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,679
Mr Soul uh he is the one that put the

530
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,558
idea of to teach the vacuum the filter

531
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,519
uh that's a really good metaphor of how

532
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,279
to teach femin seeds that is not how it

533
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,119
works at all there's much more work to

534
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,440
it than that but that is the mindset

535
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,199
when you think about fem seeds the only

536
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,120
difference is that they are all girls

537
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,240
there was no male pollen no male

538
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,519
chromosome available I basically put up

539
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,000
a barrier and we kept all the dudes out

540
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,400
it's ladies night party on so that my

541
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,400
friend was the really long answer uh

542
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,240
they will be exactly like any other

543
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,519
plant that you ever breed with and then

544
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,839
the short answer is probably 50/50

545
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,240
you're going to see anomalies and

546
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,959
variation in every breeding project you

547
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,558
might get some that are 70% males 30%

548
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,079
females and the opposite but most of the

549
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,639
time you will see a 50/50 mix in the

550
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:05,279
progyny whether you're using a feminized

551
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,960
female or a regular male female produced

552
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,319
female pollen receiving plant well that

553
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,000
was a lot of technical words in one

554
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,519
sentence there dude that was a good

555
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,519

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,960
general grow question the question

589
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,679
starts off with good day rosta Jeff good

590
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,798
day Willie thanks for the question it

591
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,679
says I got a question about lighting

592
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:28,519
when in flower this is a good question I

593
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,519
had to switch tents mid flower in the

594
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,558
light spectrum from the lights are

595
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,798
different the one they came from is more

596
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,038
yellowish and soft compared to where

597
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,119
they are currently which is more white

598
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:42,158
can the change in light spectrum affect

599
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,359
the plants in any way uh without reading

600
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,360
the second half of this yes uh light

601
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,918
spectrum will change can change a lot of

602
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,079
things in the plants it will show a lot

603
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,600
of different expression just for an

604
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,038
example I've got a room running right

605
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,319
now that got a high press sodium lamp a

606
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:57,879
metal highight lamp and then a few LEDs

607
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,319
lined up on the Outer Perimeter just to

608
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,360
give some extra light and I can see a

609
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,839
difference in the sections in the room

610
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:06,158
that are getting different light I can

611
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,038
see the the different performances based

612
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,039
on those different lights the uh HPS

613
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,599
light is the one to the left it looks a

614
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,919
little more ragged it doesn't look as

615
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,119
healthy as the light next to it that

616
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,000
metal Halli light those plants look a

617
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,798
little bit more healthy I've been

618
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,200
overfeeding the plants I tend to do that

619
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:23,918
I like to do that I do it on purpose the

620
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,759
plants underneath the metal highight are

621
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,640
taking the over feeding very well

622
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,480
they're not showing as much abuse the

623
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,080
plants under the high pressure sodium

624
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,360
they look a little bit pissed off about

625
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:34,038
that overfeeding they're getting a

626
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,240
little uh more than their nails done

627
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:36,720
they're getting the tips and the edges

628
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,640
are getting a little bit crinkly I know

629
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,319
I need to pull back on the feeding but

630
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,520
no I want to push them it's my grow will

631
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,599
party how I want to but I can see a lot

632
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:46,278
of variation in the structure of the

633
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:48,359
plant the shape of the buds the bud

634
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,119
development uh the stretchiness of those

635
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,918
plants the plants under the the metal

636
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:53,959
hly did not stretch as far the plants

637
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,360
under the HPS they're stretchier their

638
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,759
branches are kind of falling over and

639
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,719
more gangly so I can see a difference in

640
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,158
that room just by the plants that are

641
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,000
under different lights the plants that

642
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,400
are under all three look amazing there's

643
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,640
one row that gets hit with the HPS the

644
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,200
metal highlight and the LEDs those

645
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,000
plants look freaking Stellar so uh we

646
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,240
will see some difference the lights will

647
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,480
make a lot of difference I've grown so

648
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,079
for several years I grow I grew under

649
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,240
high-press sodium lamps that was my

650
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:23,158
go-to light I loved it uh still love

651
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,798
them they work very well they bang out

652
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,440
really nice crops then one year I

653
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,440
decided to switch to LEDs my plants

654
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,720
looked totally totally different when I

655
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,880
switched to LEDs they were shorter uh

656
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,319
squatter that might be the same thing

657
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,799
but a little bit wider uh more compact

658
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,278
the inter noal spacing got tighter the

659
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,400
branching got tighter they still

660
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:44,038
branched out but they didn't go and

661
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,038
stretch out real far they just went bang

662
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,278
and stretched out real strong and real

663
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:50,079
Stout so I saw differences just

664
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:52,400
switching from light so you're going to

665
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,158
see some difference now he does go on

666
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,000
though he says I've seen the plants kind

667
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,960
of hit paw for about two weeks before

668
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,640
they hit their stride again they didn't

669
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,798
show any deficiencies or anything they

670
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,600
just slowed down um you went from a you

671
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,599
said from a light spectrum uh they came

672
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,639
from a yellow to a white so they're just

673
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,319
probably adjusting to that new Spectrum

674
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,240
to them it's a new season they're like

675
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:15,278
why did the Sun change the sun was

676
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,120
yellow for so long and now the sun is

677
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:18,919
white what the [ __ ] is going on they're

678
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,639
just trying to figure out what happened

679
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,520
also I'm not sure when you did the

680
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,360
switch if you did this at like week 2

681
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,480
week three they might have just been

682
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:27,599
transitioning and they were just

683
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,440
changing their hormones around anyway

684
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,119
and just went on stall mode cuz they

685
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,200
were confused but there is more uh it

686
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:37,359
says uh now this is my in between run

687
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,080
where I run eight one gallons with

688
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,558
organic nutrients six of the eight were

689
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,558
are dialed in and doing wonderfully but

690
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,960
the pause was across the board so yeah

691
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:47,200
it's probably just they were they

692
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,159
weren't mad or anything they were just

693
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,159
trying to figure out why like imagine if

694
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:53,120
you woke up one day and the sun went

695
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,360
from Orange to White you're just like

696
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,439
you you'd go ah [ __ ] you'd be really

697
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,119
confused it would take your brain uh all

698
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,759
the fruits and vegetables would go weird

699
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:02,558
everything would be stranged out from it

700
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:04,240
so it's probably What's Happening Here

701
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,918
uh it's just going hey why is the light

702
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,359
different colors it thought it might be

703
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,600
a different season I had to figure out

704
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,158
what to do excuse me for all the throat

705
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,399
clearing I did take dabs before the show

706
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,159
uh it said uh are there potential Pros

707
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,038
or cons when switching light spectrum's

708
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,240
midflower now we get midlow that makes

709
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:22,158
more sense uh could the Slowdown caused

710
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,640
by the change or was it from something

711
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,600
else no uh most likely caused by the

712
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,640
change that's something that Growers

713
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,959
like to do that's something we like to

714
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,960
do as humans we know the obvious cause

715
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,600
of something but we like to doubt that

716
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,360
uh stop second guessing yourself as a

717
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,158
person as a grower uh have some

718
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,038
confidence it's everybody out there uh

719
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,120
be confident in your first decision and

720
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,240
uh trust your intuition it is probably

721
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,879
right probably correct don't overthink

722
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,558
things that's most things in life you

723
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,799
guys uh so yes I'm going to assume that

724
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:52,119
that was uh the Slowdown was because of

725
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,558
the switch in light spectrums I'm not

726
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,798
sure if you went from uh more powerful

727
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,319
lights less powerful lights uh

728
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,879
definitely a different spect so that

729
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,519
changed them they were different um they

730
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,919
had a big change they like I said they

731
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,278
think you moved them from the top of the

732
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,480
mountain to the bottom of the mountain

733
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:10,319
or maybe from Colorado to Florida or

734
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,200
maybe even from Colorado to uh let's

735
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,240
pick some more way different Jamaica I

736
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,720
just picked some more different than

737
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,000
maybe I might want to go so you just

738
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,399
moved them and they're going where are

739
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,278
we bro and they're just trying to figure

740
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:21,839
it out um yeah I'm going to say it was

741
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:23,640
the light they're in a different they

742
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,720
not only is the DLI different because of

743
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,200
the light they're getting a different

744
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,798
Spectrum a different par uh the lighting

745
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,720
is way different but also I bet you the

746
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,278
VPD changed with that because the it's

747
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,960
in a different tent which means a

748
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,398
Different Light which probably different

749
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,159
airf flow the light's going to give you

750
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:40,079
a different temperature uh it's going to

751
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,399
create a different humidity so many

752
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,199
things change to these plants that

753
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:44,319
they're just going what the [ __ ] bro and

754
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,519
now they're going to catch up they'll

755
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,678
get their [ __ ] back together um most of

756
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:50,798
the time you can switch from that HPS or

757
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,559
the metal hly to the HPS about two weeks

758
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,079
in you won't see a big difference if

759
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,960
you're running a th000 watt or if you

760
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:57,759
step up and go if you go from a six to a

761
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,079
th000 you shouldn't see much slow down

762
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,839
but I really think you just confused

763
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:02,519
them that's all I think you did so if

764
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,918
you're going to switch lights you guys

765
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,918
try to do it more gradually uh go up in

766
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,799
wattage don't go down in wattage and try

767
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,520
to pay attention to the Spectrum and try

768
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,960
to use the proper Spectrum for the stage

769
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:15,798
of flowering which you are in um I need

770
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,240
a lighting expert to help me do a

771
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:19,359
podcast about lighting because I

772
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,798
honestly am not qualified to talk teach

773
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,119
too much about grow lights um I

774
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:25,158
understand the plants very well I

775
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,879
understand the systems I understand soil

776
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,640
I get photosynthesis I understand how

777
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,720
all that stuff works I deeply understand

778
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,038
breeding but when it comes to lights and

779
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,880
stuff um there's something in my brain

780
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,480
that just doesn't care so the add stops

781
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,679
me from learning if there's a lighting

782
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,240
expert out there that would like to come

783
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,440
on the show and teach us the basics of

784
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,480
lighting um I'm all ears and our

785
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,120
audience would love to hear from you

786
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,679
reach out grow fromy yourheart at

787
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,558
hotmail.com dude I am super rambly I

788
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,840
usually end the show right now but let's

789
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,319
do it banging out one more message here

790
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:56,839
on today's podcast this one came from

791
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,319
our friend who wants to be called one

792
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:00,759
deep of course this did come from that

793
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:04,359
grow help tab on the website it says I'm

794
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:07,200
growing indoors in soil using hlg lights

795
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:09,359
I use Liquid Fertilizer uh is it best to

796
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,360
preix your nutrients and let it aate for

797
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:16,359
24 hours and then water or should I just

798
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:18,119
mix pH check PPM um bro don't let that

799
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,879
[ __ ] sit out for too long it is not

800
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:23,398
meant to sit for a long time it is meant

801
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,840
to be uh mixed stirred up uh phed and

802
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:27,599
fed to the plants as soon as possible

803
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,278
there's a reason why all of the stuff is

804
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,558
sold in different bottles because when

805
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,440
you put them in one thing there's a

806
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,759
chance that they will bind also your

807
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,960
heavier nutrients are going to fall to

808
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:36,839
the bottom the lighter shit's going to

809
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,319
float to the top overnight you're going

810
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:40,079
to notice that different things lock up

811
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,918
and bind together everything will sink

812
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,119
to the bottom and get all shitty please

813
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,640
do not let that stuff sit out too long

814
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:48,719
mix it up stir it use it right away

815
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,080
definitely check that pH uh check the

816
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,919
ppms now people are going to say what

817
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,439
about Hydro that stuff's in there all

818
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,880
the time it's moving it's constantly

819
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,558
circulating it's not sitting there it's

820
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,000
getting stirred it's like you're shaking

821
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:59,558
the bottles the whole time so that's a

822
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,359
big difference but if you're going to

823
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:04,678
feed it in pots this person said that

824
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,959
they are in promix so yes mix it up uh

825
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,798
water it as soon as possible there is

826
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,919
more it says and does it matter if you

827
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,639
use compost teas with bottled nutrients

828
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,440
um you can use the compost teas with

829
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,399
bottled nutrients be careful not to burn

830
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,240
anything not to overdo it but those

831
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:22,000
compost teas should give you some good

832
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,319
life in your rizosphere uh get those

833
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,079
beneficial bacterias uh get them more

834
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,960
active which that does work as a good

835
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,359
buffer uh to help get those nutrients

836
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,798
balanced out all the microbes in the

837
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,678
soil work with the exudates in the

838
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,200
plants till the plant what to uptake a

839
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:35,759
little bit better of course all those

840
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,080
buffered and Chell nutrients are going

841
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,798
to get into that plant but that's

842
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,759
another whole another episode uh I said

843
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:43,278
I know it's a lot to go over but I would

844
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,480
really like to hear your thoughts on how

845
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,599
you water and feed uh really quickly I

846
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,079
could tell you on how I water and feed

847
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:53,719
um I get a reservoir we can use anything

848
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:57,000
from a 5 gallon bucket to a 35 gallon

849
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,679
trash can to a 155 million gallon drum

850
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,599
whatever we need mix it up with water um

851
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,320
in a personal grow I just use water from

852
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,519
the tap because our Municipal Water here

853
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,240
is pretty chill at a commercial grow I

854
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,599
would run it through a big boy filter I

855
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,359
usually do not do um what is it RO water

856
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:14,079
that's more of that causes more problems

857
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,959
that sets you up with more struggle to

858
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:19,199
begin with so water fill up my vessel

859
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,120
with water um if I'm going to add some

860
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,240
sort of potassium silicate or a silicate

861
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,759
product that one goes first add that in

862
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,359
there at the recommended dosage or

863
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:29,240
whatever I think I need oh excuse me for

864
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,479
burping at you but add the potassium

865
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,919
silicate mix that up uh get that mixed

866
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,079
up then I will start with my base

867
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,399
nutrients what am I using right now

868
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:38,480
hypothetically we're going to say we're

869
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,759
going with the Botanicare pure blend Pro

870
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,599
Line cuz it's very easy to use uh I'll

871
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,960
use the Botanicare pure blend Pro base

872
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,240
as much of that as I feel like I need

873
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,720
pour it into a measuring cup uh I think

874
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,599
that one I use for a 5 gallon bucket I

875
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,919
think I would use about 100 to 125

876
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:57,359
milliliters of that base pour that into

877
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,759
my 5 gallon bucket give it a little stir

878
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,879
then I would continue down the line

879
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,599
whichever nutrients I need for this mix

880
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,960
probably some cow mag the recommended

881
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:07,639
dosage of that probably some something

882
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,000
with some uh Bloom booster then uh I'm

883
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,840
just guessing what else might go in

884
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,200
there get all my liquids in there mix it

885
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:16,319
up um then I will adjust the pH then I

886
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,278
add my powdered microbes the microbes go

887
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,558
in after I adjust the pH uh then I feed

888
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,398
it directly to the plants it depends on

889
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:26,038
again the size of the room the amount of

890
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:28,079
plants the size of the reservoir but uh

891
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:29,679
hypothetically if it's a small space

892
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,599
I'll use a pitcher like a Kool-Aid

893
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,399
pitcher that you'd get at Walmart for uh

894
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,359
mixing up lemonade or Kool-Aid or

895
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,558
whatever you're going to put on the

896
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:38,678
fourth of July picnic table dip that

897
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:41,480
into my big container of water and just

898
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:44,080
hand water my plant as necessary I like

899
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,679
to water uh most of the time I use a 3

900
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,319
gallon pot uh with a soilless mix in a

901
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,519
personal grow so it's a 3 gallon pot

902
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:54,558
with a soilless mix I will water and

903
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,480
probably about half to 3/4 of a gallon

904
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,798
of water per pot if it's dry enough to

905
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,440
take that that's usually when I like to

906
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:00,839
water uh that's if you've listened to

907
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,798
Water Tech 1 through 5 that's when

908
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:04,959
they're ready so I'll hit that half to

909
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:07,278
3/4 of a gallon and then usually that

910
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,519
will give me just enough runoff to

911
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,480
almost fill that runoff tray that saucer

912
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,359
underneath the pot it'll almost fill

913
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,038
that and I do not dump that a lot of

914
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,678
people go and collect that water I do

915
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,240
not um my plants are big my plants are

916
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,000
Hardy my plants are healthy and stout

917
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,679
that that whole pot's filled with roots

918
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,638
that little bottom part isn't going to

919
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,240
get too angry with some extra water

920
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:27,959
honestly that's how I buy myself an

921
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,000
extra day or two of watering when I go

922
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,038
out of town so um mix it up pH it oh did

923
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,319
I mention pH I mix it all up yeah I pH

924
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:37,839
it then I throw in the microbes um

925
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,879
before the microbes go in I also check

926
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,079
the EC or the PPM I write all that [ __ ]

927
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,278
down uh throw in the microbes give it a

928
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,240
good solid mix uh then just go in there

929
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,798
and water each individual plant as

930
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,720
needed um that's basically it then I

931
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,278
wait for that runoff to come out in the

932
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,679
commercial grow I will document the ph

933
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,638
and EC of the runoff in my personal grow

934
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,159
I don't feel the need to do that um

935
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:01,678
there's not as many plants I remember

936
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:03,559
what's going on a little bit better and

937
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,679
uh it's my personal grow I I'm

938
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:07,798
accountable for it I feel like I'm

939
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,000
accountable that's I don't need to take

940
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:11,359
that note I could I should but it's myig

941
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,720
grow and I feel like I know I know

942
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,719
what's going on in there enough I'm I'm

943
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,880
paying enough attention in the

944
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,839
commercial grows I've got like room a

945
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,919
room B room C uh building a and Building

946
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,359
B with rooms A B and C that [ __ ] gets

947
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:24,399
overwhelming take all those [ __ ]

948
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,079
notes but in my personal grow I think I

949
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:27,879
can remember I don't need to document

950
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,599
the EC and pH my run off that's I got

951
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,080
enough going on all right let me see how

952
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,959
much of this message I covered where am

953
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:36,398
I here we are um how do I really like to

954
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,319
know my thoughts on how I water and feed

955
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,558
I think I did the quick version uh just

956
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:43,079
like most people bro fill the container

957
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,519
uh silicate first mix it up uh base

958
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:49,519
nutrients liquid Karma cow mag Bloom

959
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:50,919
booster um carbs most of that can go in

960
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,278
almost any order in my opinion the

961
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:56,840
silicate first then the bass then just

962
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:58,519
tag on everything else pH it um mark

963
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,359
down the ph and the EC throw in the

964
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,319
recharge makes the [ __ ] out of it and

965
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,000
then water it yeah nothing real

966
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,278
challenging nothing keep it simple

967
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,759
Stoner is really what works best for me

968
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:09,519
in a commercial environment there' be a

969
