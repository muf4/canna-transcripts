12
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,120
you know what I'm smoking today I've

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,370
been taking dabs of pineapple Fanta live

14
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,649
batter from Green Dot labs this is a

15
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:02,320
combination of golden pineapple and jet

16
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:04,748
fuel gelato on the label it is described

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,819
as tasting like citrus cleaner Hayes and

18
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:08,618
Fruit Chews I would agree with that but

19
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:10,718
I would also say it tastes just like a

20
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:13,179
pineapple Fanta it's got that sweet

21
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:15,640
pineapple citrus flavor and it even has

22
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:17,618
a fizzy flavor to it it may sound crazy

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,358
but when you dab it you will agree with

24
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:21,368
me so big shout out to our friends at

a sweet watermelon Jolly Ranchers sort

49
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:37,179
of flavor and I really like it the label

50

you guys let's work on a podcast this is

77
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:34,388
going to be another grow lesson I hope

78
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,609
you have been following along with my

79
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:38,889
long series of grow lessons we started

80
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:40,780
off by selecting a goal for our grow we

81
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,879
worked on selecting a proper space we

82
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,949
built a good grow room we decided if we

83
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,018
wanted to grow from seeds or clones we

84
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:49,689
acquired seeds and clones we have got

85
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,849
them sprouted now they are potted into

86
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:54,158
their little pots I think by this time

87
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:56,108
all of our seeds and clones should be

88
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,478
about the same size we've got stuff any

89
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:00,129
either a four inch pot or a six inch net

90
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,049
pot but we should have clones or

91
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,938
seedlings with just a few sets of leaves

92
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,009
they're probably four maybe six inches

93
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:08,978
tall by now and that is what I call

94
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:11,858
small veg so let's do a podcast about

95
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:14,620
the small vegetative phase of growing

96
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:16,389
your cannabis garden in my opinion the

97
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,180
vegetative phase of growing cannabis is

98
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,218
often the most overlooked phase of

99
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,348
growing people think they need to invest

100
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:25,810
all their time energy and money on the

101
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:27,969
flowering process that is very important

102
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,069
but I like to believe that you can't

103
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,830
build a strong building without a solid

104
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:36,159
foundation and that foundation starts in

105
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:37,990
the veg phase by the time we get these

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,700
plants to the flowering room we need

107
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,620
them to be healthy we need them to be

108
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,209
robust we need them the shape we want

109
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,860
them we need them the structure we want

110
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:48,939
them and we need them pests and

111
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,400
pathogens during the small vegetative

112
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:53,350
stage is to develop a strong root system

113
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,389
for these plants I want to get those

114
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,129
roots thick and busting out of that pot

115
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:59,889
before I transplant them into their

116
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:02,860
forever homes my second goal is to keep

117
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:04,689
these plants past and pathogen free now

118
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,330
if I'm working from seeds I'm also

119
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:09,670
paying attention for issues mutations

120
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:12,069
problems whatever a seedling may show

121
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,990
you a seedling has a ton of options that

122
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:15,399
can occur through the entire grow cycle

123
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,199
you need to pay special attention to

124
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,479
your seedlings if you're growing from

125
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,430
clones you should know what to expect so

126
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,009
my main focus during this small

127
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,530
vegetative phase is developing a strong

128
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:28,719
root system my second priority is

129
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:30,099
maintaining clean healthy plants I don't

130
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,530
want any bugs and I don't need any

131
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,390
pathogens then my third priority if I'm

132
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:36,399
growing from seeds I want to pay close

133
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:37,930
attention to those seedlings and I want

134
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,569
to keep my eye out for any weird

135
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,160
mutations or weird problems now if

136
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,889
things go right we are only going to

137
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,290
spend two to four weeks in these small

138
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:50,019
pots in our small veg phase but in my

139
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,300
opinion this phase is equally as

140
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:54,459
important as the flowering process we

141
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,100
need to treat every step of the grow

142
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:59,289
process as an important process we all

143
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,540
want to focus on that flowering phase we

144
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,939
all get excited around week four we get

145
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,979
super pumped up at week five by week six

146
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,509
you're just ecstatic week seven and

147
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:09,459
eight you can't wait to cut it down by

148
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,019
week nine you're in there every single

149
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,219
day taking pictures looking at the

150
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:13,810
plants hoping you can cut them down

151
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,790
today or tomorrow just trying to be

152
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,129
patient why don't we put that much

153
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,419
energy into the starting phase of our

154
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:21,279
plants I know they're not as pretty

155
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:23,560
there's nothing to show for it but it is

156
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,799
just as import now let's get a little

157
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,870
deeper into this small veg phase what

158
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,910
makes this small veg what makes it small

159
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,668
veg as my plants are small they are in

160
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,640
small pots now what makes it veg veges

161
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:38,740
the light cycle cannabis plants are

162
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,389
triggered by the light cycle if they

163
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,559
have enough light they will not flower

164
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:43,838
once we reduce the

165
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:45,969
to approximately 12 hours on in 12 hours

166
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:47,738
off every day that triggers our plants

167
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:48,939
to flower they think that the fall is

168
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:50,438
coming they think it's the end of the

169
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,849
season they start doing their

170
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,338
end-of-season business which is

171
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:56,438
producing flowers the parts that we call

172
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:58,658
buds are the cannabis flowers they are

173
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,239
dried flower tops from a cannabis plant

174
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:03,908
that is induced by changing the light

175
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:06,548
cycle so until we manipulate that light

176
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:08,408
cycle we are in veg since we are using

177
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:11,258
small pots and have small plants once

178
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:12,908
again we are back to small now let's

179
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,038
talk a little bit about these light

180
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:18,848
cycles we've got plenty of options for

181
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:21,068
light cycles in our veg phase from what

182
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:24,639
I have experienced the most common and

183
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:28,389
most popular veg light schedule is 18

184
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,819
hours on and 16 hours off in a daily 24

185
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,509
hour cycle there are other options you

186
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:37,209
can go 24 hours on and 0 hours off I

187
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:39,369
have seen great success with 2 hours of

188
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:41,528
darkness so that's 22 hours on and two

189
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:43,539
hours off every day in a commercial

190
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:46,838
facility and a mother room and in a veg

191
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:47,860
room I am known to do 20 hours on and 4

192
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:50,379
hours off

193
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,209
now I mentioned the 18 6 that is kind of

194
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:55,028
a classic that's really close to what

195
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:57,548
nature does also there is the sixteen on

196
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:59,889
and eight hours off all of these have

197
00:07:57,548 --> 00:08:02,408
their advantages also they all have

198
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:05,049
their disadvantage what is the advantage

199
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:07,298
of 24 hours and zero hours of darkness

200
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:09,928
24 hours of light means your plants are

201
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:12,848
getting 24 hours of light energy I

202
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:15,968
usually recommend a 24 hour on cycle

203
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:18,428
only for clones and tiny plants or if

204
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:20,288
your rivetting sometimes we have mother

205
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:21,638
plants that if they get root bound or if

206
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:23,168
they don't get enough light or if they

207
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,929
don't get the proper energy they will

208
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:28,389
decide to OTO flower on you over time I

209
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:30,038
like to keep those plants under 24 hours

210
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,899
of light that does prevent them from

211
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:34,629
flipping themselves into flower because

212
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:36,610
of another environmental factor so most

213
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:38,379
of the time I would not recommend a 24

214
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,300
hour light cycle unless you are cutting

215
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:42,278
clones or you're trying to revenge or

216
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,899
perhaps you've got a mother plant it

217
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:45,278
gets temperamental and wants to try to

218
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,980
Otto flower on you

219
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,230
I like the 20 on and 4 off for a

220
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,329
commercial environment I like a little

221
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,659
bit of dark cycle I think every living

222
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:56,459
thing likes a little bit of dark cycle

223
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,289
I think roots develop in the dark I

224
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,710
think the plants like a little rest also

225
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:03,959
that is four hours of electricity not

226
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,460
being sucked up if you've got one light

227
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,889
you're saving a little bit of money if

228
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,990
you've got fifty lights you were saving

229
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,460
a lot of money that is two hundred light

230
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,590
hours that you are not running right

231
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,060
there that's two hundred thousand watt

232
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,340
light hours that you don't have to pay

233
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:19,829
for if you've got a larger facility so

234
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,629
20 hours on four hours off is always

235
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,160
great for a commercial facility you can

236
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,720
keep your mother plants in that room you

237
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,279
can keep your small veg in that room you

238
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,529
can keep your large veg in that room

239
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,329
usually I put the clones in that same

240
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,980
room underneath the t5 light in the

241
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,940
corner so there's just a little bit of

242
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,289
light in the room it doesn't really

243
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,850
bother the rest of the plants they're

244
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,289
able to do their thing that t5 doesn't

245
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,360
do much in a giant bedroom in a

246
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:41,879
commercial facility now I always like to

247
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,919
mention the downside of what I'm talking

248
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:47,220
about there's not much of a downside to

249
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,899
a 20 on and 4 off cycle I guess really

250
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,759
the only downside is that you are always

251
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,360
running lights you only get four hours

252
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,730
of darkness

253
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,509
compared to my next method which is an

254
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,879
18 on and 6 hour off everyday cycle a

255
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:02,759
lot of growers prefer this because it is

256
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,289
closer to the natural cycles of life it

257
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,450
is closer to the natural rhythms of the

258
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:08,669
Sun outside it's a little closer to the

259
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,170
natural circadian rhythm that our plants

260
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:11,849
would be subject to in their normal

261
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,789
environment and it just feels a little

262
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,610
more natural in general so the pros to

263
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:20,459
an 18-6 cycle is it feels pretty natural

264
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,590
to you and the plants it also saves you

265
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,480
quite a bit of electricity having a six

266
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,490
hour night cycle that is six hours that

267
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,960
you don't have your lights on that's six

268
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,360
hours you don't have to cool the room as

269
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,950
much that's and multiply that by however

270
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,200
many lights you've got and you start

271
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:37,080
saving more and more money and I also

272
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,370
think the plants really enjoy a nice six

273
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,650
hour nap you can see a lot of

274
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,470
productivity from that six hour nap that

275
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:46,620
the plants get now our next option is a

276
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,960
sixteen and eight cycle that is very

277
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,120
similar to the eighteen six but some

278
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,120
plants will show you some differences

279
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,340
some plants may try to flower under that

280
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,230
sixteen eight cycle if they get root

281
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,330
bound if they become nutrient deficient

282
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,000
if there are any environmental factors

283
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,670
that stress those plants they may decide

284
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,159
to flower on you underneath that 16 and

285
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:08,360
8 white cycle depending on what part of

286
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,789
the

287
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,250
globe your plants originated from they

288
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:15,230
may have a different critical period and

289
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,169
let me explain the critical period the

290
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,539
critical period is the amount of dark

291
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:22,969
hours a plant needs to induce its

292
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:26,689
flowering cycle some plants will flower

293
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:29,120
with a 14 hour dark cycle some plants

294
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,010
will flower with a 10 hour dark cycle

295
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,659
the reason we go for that 12 on 12 off

296
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,669
is it's right in the middle and it seems

297
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,259
to work well with most of the plants

298
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:38,509
that we have bread for our indoor

299
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:40,399
environment now since some plants come

300
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:42,379
from north of the Equator and some

301
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,299
plants come from south of the equator we

302
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:46,578
do have different flowering times in

303
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:48,019
tropical areas those plants can flower

304
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:50,208
for much longer because they're not

305
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:52,519
going to get snowed on also in those

306
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:54,409
areas we don't get as drastic of a day

307
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,450
and night cycle change there may be as

308
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:58,309
much as one hour difference between your

309
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,060
summer and your winter day period in

310
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:04,309
other areas we get winter we get snow we

311
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:06,828
get dumped on and we get long dark

312
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:09,078
periods so our plants have evolved and

313
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:10,669
adapted and climatized themselves to

314
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:12,379
those regions then we have bred with

315
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:15,259
those plants that we've created hybrids

316
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:17,028
and brought them indoors indoors some of

317
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:19,578
our plants will flower with a tan our

318
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:21,740
dark period indoors some of our plants

319
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:23,989
will flower with a 12 hour dark period

320
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,120
we have established that 12 on and 12

321
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,250
off seems to work really well for most

322
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,350
of the plants that we have bred now to

323
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,269
prevent them from flowering early we

324
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,250
like to use an extended light cycle

325
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:35,990
that's where we put them on 16 hours on

326
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,360
at a minimum that way we know they are

327
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,909
not going to flower I like to go that 18

328
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,009
hours because why not give them two more

329
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:45,110
full hours of energy every daylight is

330
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:47,360
the number one desired nutrient from our

331
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,850
plants light is the number one desired

332
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,889
factor for growth from our plants so why

333
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,899
not give it that extra two hours now in

334
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:56,269
my mind I say why not give it that full

335
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,309
20 hours every day so that we can get

336
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:00,470
maximum growth and give our plants a

337
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:02,809
four hour nap every day I think it works

338
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,560
really well now another reason I like

339
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:08,599
the 20 on and 4 off is I find that when

340
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,849
I move my plants into the flowering room

341
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,690
and I take them from a 20 hour day

342
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,850
to a 12 hour day they induce flowering

343
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,350
very quickly in other facilities where

344
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,028
I'm running shorter vege periods I

345
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,990
noticed they take a little longer for

346
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:24,240
the plants to start popping up bud

347
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,100
at their little pre flowers the little

348
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,289
pistols don't start popping up as early

349
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,050
as if I were to run those plants on a

350
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:33,028
long day cycle and then kick that 12:12

351
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,278
right away I feel like the plants go oh

352
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:37,649
[ __ ] it is time to flower we have really

353
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:41,159
had a reduction in daylight they know it

354
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:44,089
so that's why I do 20 on and 4 off in my

355
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,889
veg and mom area of course I'm running

356
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,800
sometimes I've got 50 or 75 different

357
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:51,629
cultivars in a mom room so I've really

358
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,849
got to keep things happy and I found

359
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:55,860
that the 20 on and 4 off prevents

360
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,110
anything from auto flowering and again

361
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,050
it really triggers that flowering when I

362
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,240
put them into the 1212 room so those are

363
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:07,620
the basic veg schedules I would

364
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,209
recommend 24 20 and for 18 + 6 or 16 + 8

365
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,490
I wouldn't go much lower than that you

366
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:13,500
may notice problems you won't have the

367
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,659
desired robust vegetative growth that

368
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,370
you need and also you may get plants

369
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,259
that decide to flower before you're

370
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,269
ready alright I feel like we know how

371
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,250
long to leave the light on now let's

372
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:25,860
talk about what kind of light to put

373
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,419
these plants under we don't have to

374
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,220
throw these small plants under the

375
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:30,809
Gavita lights right away we may crisp

376
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,639
them up we may roast them they may not

377
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:35,759
be prepared for that so I like to start

378
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,669
my small plants under smaller lights in

379
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,889
most situations I think a t5 would work

380
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,979
for most people in most commercial

381
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:45,750
environments I use the 3 foot long t5

382
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,759
fixtures they're three feet long they

383
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,980
have eight bulbs I feel like you can fit

384
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,350
quite a few small veg plants under those

385
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,620
in a commercial environment I like to

386
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,990
set up a two-tiered veg system I get a

387
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,240
Uline rack I put plants on the bottom

388
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,730
shelf of that Uline rack I hang a light

389
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,100
underneath the top shelf to light those

390
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,990
plants now I've got that top shelf freed

391
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,300
up I put plants up there and I hang a

392
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,339
light from the ceiling now I've got two

393
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:15,328
layers of plants and I'm maximizing my

394
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:17,820
space by using a two-tiered veg system I

395
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:19,319
like to use a t5 fixture for the plants

396
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,060
on the bottom shelf and then for the

397
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,490
plants on the top shelf I either use a

398
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,169
Gavita or a metal halide either

399
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,789
somewhere between a four and a thousand

400
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:28,349
watt depending on my space depending on

401
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:30,539
my environment depending on how far from

402
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,889
those plants I am but those small veg

403
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:34,948
plants start off on the bottom shelf

404
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,938
under the t5 s then as I transplant I

405
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:37,168
move them up to the top

406
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:39,478
shelf and they go underneath the metal

407
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:41,908
halides sometimes those are kavita's it

408
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:43,349
just depends again on my environment now

409
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:45,239
I really find the two fives to be

410
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:47,249
cost-effective I think they're efficient

411
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:49,199
and I think they do a great job if you

412
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:51,889
want to invest a little more money on a

413
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:55,469
better light I have seen great success

414
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:58,709
vegging underneath LED lighting small

415
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,720
plants really love LED lights and also

416
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,969
those LEDs don't produce much heat and

417
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,220
they don't use a lot of electricity they

418
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:07,048
are a little pricey upfront but I think

419
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,199
they are worth the money if you get a

420
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:12,538
quality LED I personally don't have much

421
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:15,118
experience with LED lighting but I have

422
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:17,729
seen great things from LED lights in

423
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:20,189
small veg in large veg and through

424
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:22,739
flower the most important thing about an

425
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:24,808
LED in veg is the spectrum and that's

426
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:26,278
also important when it comes to t5 let

427
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:28,108
me back up because I overlooked that

428
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,698
part when I was talking about t5 s I do

429
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:30,959
not have any notes on this this is all

430
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,969
coming out of the top of my head today

431
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,598
so let me catch myself before I go too

432
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,119
fast

433
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:38,069
t5 lights are commonly available in two

434
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:41,668
spectrums most of the time you will find

435
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:45,418
them in a 3000 Kelvin and a 6400 Kelvin

436
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:47,338
for your veg phase I recommend the 6400

437
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:49,470
kelvin they will put off a more blue

438
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,809
light which is what we want for the veg

439
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,609
later on when we move the flower we want

440
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:56,488
more of that orange spectrum so that's

441
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:58,528
when he would switch to the 3000 Kelvin

442
00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:00,359
t5 bulbs if you are going to flower

443
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:02,849
under them which I do not recommend but

444
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:04,709
they are great for veg so spectrum is

445
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:06,179
very important and I almost overlooked

446
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,240
that when you were selecting your t5

447
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,610
bulbs make sure that you get the six

448
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,230
thousand four hundred Kelvin bulbs those

449
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,958
are what I would recommend for your veg

450
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,120
phase I also recommended the bluer or

451
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,519
wider spectrum lights when it comes to

452
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,588
LEDs a lot of the new LEDs give you the

453
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,269
option to turn on certain boards and

454
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:26,338
turn off certain boards when you were

455
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:28,710
vegging you want more of the blue and

456
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,658
wider spectrums again once we turn to

457
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,120
flower that's when we want those orange

458
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:34,528
and red spectrums so while we're in veg

459
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,989
whatever kind of light you're using

460
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:40,079
focus more on the white or blue

461
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,700
spectrums so I've got another option for

462
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,548
lighting that I can recommend but I

463
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,730
would only suggest this for a very small

464
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:49,970
scale grow environment maybe for one or

465
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,769
two very small plants maybe for a cab

466
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,679
grow or something this would be an

467
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:56,538
effective grow light in a pinch I have

468
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,000
seen a lot of folks build a small grow

469
00:17:56,538 --> 00:18:02,210
cabinet with a compact fluorescent light

470
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,089
those CFLs they put off barely any heat

471
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,380
and they use barely any electricity so

472
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:07,819
if you can get enough of them around

473
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,190
your plant to feel like you're giving it

474
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:12,259
enough light the plant will grow don't

475
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,750
expect huge growth don't expect robust

476
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:17,599
plants don't expect a large harvest but

477
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,609
you can make a plant grow with a compact

478
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,009
fluorescent light of course the more

479
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:24,259
light the better but some people are

480
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:26,329
very limited in space and power and some

481
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:28,400
people only want a small grow for a

482
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:30,589
small personal experiment so a compact

483
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,190
fluorescent light may work for you that

484
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:36,529
would always be my very last option now

485
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,509
let's talk about a big-boy light a lot

486
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:40,548
of people are familiar with growing

487
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:42,408
under high-intensity discharge lighting

488
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:45,798
a lot of people are going to flower

489
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:47,960
under an HID light if we are careful to

490
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:50,599
not roast the plants a metal halide

491
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,450
light will be perfect for your small veg

492
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:55,879
plants maybe a four hundred maybe a six

493
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,159
hundred a thousand maybe overkill unless

494
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,409
you keep it a little distance away you

495
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,200
can get a 400 watt light fairly close to

496
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:04,580
your small plants if you keep it cool if

497
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
you've got a ducted hood and you're

498
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:07,819
keeping air moving over that lights

499
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,590
where none of that heat is making it to

500
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:11,689
your canopy you can get that four

501
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:13,668
hundred watt light fairly close to your

502
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,830
plants just don't let that heat roast

503
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:18,380
your plants and dehydrate your soil I

504
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:20,538
would say maybe keep a 400 watt light 18

505
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:23,510
to 24 inches away from your small plants

506
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:25,279
the t5 s you can get those t5 s six to

507
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,839
eight inches away from the plants the

508
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,250
bigger the light we need to go a little

509
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,230
further because it's going to be hotter

510
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,298
and more intense and you don't want to

511
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,980
have super hot and tense light right in

512
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:35,690
your face all day you survive from the

513
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,669
Sun and you're happy with it being real

514
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,679
far away think about the plants and the

515
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:41,630
light and the Sun and yourself having a

516
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,370
similar kind of a relationship you need

517
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,990
plenty of it you don't want anything in

518
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:47,239
the way but also you don't want to get

519
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:50,839
barbecued so you can put a 400 watt

520
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,870
light 18 24 inches away a 600 I would

521
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,339
probably go 2030 inches away a thousand

522
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:56,989
watt light you're gonna want to be a few

523
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:58,730
feet away from those small plants it's

524
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,038
going to get hot it's going to be very

525
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,380
intense but if you've got a 400 watt

526
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:03,740
light and it's ducted which means it's

527
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,450
guy

528
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,980
adduct coming off of each end and you're

529
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,019
sucking air through it to move that heat

530
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,819
away from that bulb and you've got glass

531
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:12,740
between the bulb and the canopy you

532
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:14,928
should be able to run a 400 watt light

533
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,509
with very minimal problems if you pay

534
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:19,519
attention to heat and the distance from

535
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:21,528
those plants all right I think that

536
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:24,230
pretty much covers our lighting options

537
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:26,089
for our small veg plants let's talk a

538
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,548
little bit about the environment let's

539
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:31,099
talk about the temperature and humidity

540
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:33,648
for these small plants in my experience

541
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:35,778
my small plants appear to be happiest

542
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:38,479
when they are somewhere between 70 and

543
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:39,140
80 degrees Fahrenheit I really think

544
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,288
they like it

545
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,960
about seventy-five degrees to 77 degrees

546
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:46,519
is right about the prime spot for small

547
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,140
veg plants that's when I see the most

548
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:49,759
growth that's when I see the most

549
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,009
production that's when I see the most

550
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,950
root development that's when I see the

551
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:57,288
happiest plants so somewhere between 70

552
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,470
and 80 degrees or if you can dial it in

553
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:02,298
perfectly 75 to 77 is that sweet spot

554
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,950
they really seem to like it right there

555
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:05,720
now for that temperature to work

556
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,940
perfectly you need to dial in your

557
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,919
humidity temperature and humidity work

558
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,899
together there is a math equation I've

559
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,240
done a full Episode on it this creates

560
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:17,298
what is called a vapor pressure deficit

561
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,669
I encourage you to listen to episode 314

562
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:21,619
and learn about vapor pressure deficit

563
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:23,750
but now let's talk about humidity these

564
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:25,879
small plants would like to be in an

565
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,808
environment with the humidity somewhere

566
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,730
between 50 and 70 percent I have noticed

567
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:33,980
that when the humidity is too low the

568
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,019
plants do not produce there is no

569
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,179
production for the whole day when the

570
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:39,889
humidity is too low the leaves start to

571
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:41,870
droop the plants don't make any progress

572
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,549
they don't look as robust as they should

573
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:45,469
the roots are not growing

574
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:47,569
there's no productivity in that plant

575
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,120
and they also start to develop a woody

576
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:52,548
texture on the outside of the stems so I

577
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,288
encourage proper humidity too much

578
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:56,359
humidity on the other hand can cause

579
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:58,278
similar problems it can cause slow

580
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,500
growth it can cause rot it can encourage

581
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:02,000
powdery mildew try to keep the plants

582
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,919
happy by giving them the proper

583
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,630
conditions how much better do you

584
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,000
perform when you are happy with your

585
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,990
conditions if I made you go do your job

586
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,548
some of you are gonna laugh at me

587
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,950
because you have to do this if I made

588
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:14,778
you go do your job outside in 30-degree

589
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,308
weather and shorts and a t-shirt how

590
00:22:14,778 --> 00:22:17,240
happy are you gonna be you're not gonna

591
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:19,339
get [ __ ]

592
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,950
if I put you in shorts and a t-shirt and

593
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:24,259
put you in a 77 degree room and I dial

594
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,880
that humidity back to about 50% you're

595
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:28,069
gonna be completely comfortable in that

596
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,590
room and you're gonna get a lot done the

597
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:32,480
plants feel the same about life if we

598
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:34,490
keep them comfortable and we keep them

599
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,380
happy they're gonna produce for us and

600
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,058
give us what we want if we don't keep

601
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,830
them happy if we don't treat them

602
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:41,720
properly they're not gonna give a [ __ ]

603
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:43,668
it's gonna be a struggle the entire grow

604
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,140
so again for temperature I want

605
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:48,230
somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees

606
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,509
right around 75 to 77 is that sweet spot

607
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,278
from what I have experienced and then

608
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:55,460
again with humidity I like to stay

609
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:57,140
between 50 and 70% too low he started

610
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,210
slowing down growth too high

611
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,250
you start slowing down growth so that is

612
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,960
the temperature and humidity again I

613
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,419
highly recommend you go listen to

614
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,730
episode 314 and learn all about vapor

615
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:09,230
pressure deficit all right you guys we

616
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,089
have talked about lighting we have

617
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,470
talked about environment I feel like

618
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:15,109
this is going to turn into a long

619
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,730
podcast I'm 20 minutes in I am going to

620
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:18,048
press pause for a moment I need to take

621
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,089
a drink of course I'm gonna take a

622
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:22,369
couple of dabs I encourage you to dab

623
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:24,859
with me I will be right back and we will

624
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:27,918
talk about nutrients and feeding our new

625
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:29,509
small veg plants hey guys well I'm

626
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,309
taking a couple of dabs I thought it

627
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:33,048
would be a good opportunity to give

628
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:35,089
thanks to people who have supported the

629
00:23:33,048 --> 00:23:37,129
show on patreon I want to give you huge

630
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:39,439
thanks to my friend Sam how about a

631
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:42,110
giant thanks to Aldrich a big giant

632
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,929
shout out to Tanner Martin oeq and also

633
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:47,089
a big shout out to Todd Keller thank you

634
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,320
for all of the patreon support if you

635
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:50,178
would like to learn how to support the

636
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,859
show on patreon all you have to do is go

637
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,860
to patreon.com/scishow

638
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:04,429
I am back I am well hydrated I am very

639
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:07,700
well medicated and I'm ready to talk

640
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:09,140
more about our small veg plants I said

641
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,480
we were going to jump into nutrients

642
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,309
I've got one more thing I want to add to

643
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,890
our grow environment before we talk

644
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:19,278
about what we are feeding let's add a

645
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:21,649
small fan to our grow environment I want

646
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,509
to ruffle each leaf of our small plants

647
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:26,119
as they grow I don't need the fan

648
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:28,460
blasting the plants constantly I don't

649
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:30,408
need the fan making the plants bend over

650
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,069
I don't need a whole lot of fan activity

651
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:32,690
if

652
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,700
you've got an oscillating fan that's

653
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,528
perfect put it on low and just let it

654
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,090
breathe across the canopy of those

655
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:39,619
plants that's gonna make the plants more

656
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:41,808
robust and it's going to make them

657
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:43,609
develop stronger roots and I think the

658
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:45,079
plants do better when we give them a

659
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:46,908
little bit of a wind but there's wind

660
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:49,009
outside it would get blown around a

661
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:50,750
little bit I think that what happens

662
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:52,009
when I push you if I shove you a little

663
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,179
bit not super hard you know but if I

664
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:55,490
just give you a little nudge what do you

665
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:56,899
do natural instinct is to spread your

666
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,880
feet further apart to have better

667
00:24:56,898 --> 00:25:00,408
balance I kind of feel like if we blow

668
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,120
on a plant make it wobble around a

669
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:03,799
little bit maybe it's gonna spread its

670
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,719
roots a little bit wider to get better

671
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:08,000
balance which will also result in a more

672
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,889
robust stalk which will result in an

673
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,750
overall more productive plant when we

674
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,579
move that plant into the flowering phase

675
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,409
so let's give the plants a little bit of

676
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:17,210
wind they would get wind outside let's

677
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:20,480
introduce a little bit of that to our

678
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:23,629
indoor environment again don't blast the

679
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,419
plants if some of the leaves closest to

680
00:25:23,628 --> 00:25:28,609
that fan start getting dry or leathery

681
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:31,100
or crinkly or they start looking like a

682
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:33,408
potato chip they're getting blasted too

683
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:35,298
hard by the fan reduce either the fan

684
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:36,620
speed or the frequency that they're

685
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:38,538
getting hit by the fan they're getting

686
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:40,548
too much air movement and you're

687
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:43,128
disrupting the vapor pressure deficit in

688
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:44,599
that area so pay attention to the leaves

689
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:45,949
they will let you know if they're

690
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,750
getting too much wind but give them a

691
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,879
little bit of airflow and your plants

692
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,259
will really be happy for it you like a

693
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:52,939
nice little breeze don't choose a nice

694
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,440
warm day a nice sunshine on your face

695
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,700
what's the next best thing that could

696
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,298
come along it's just a nice little

697
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,590
breeze

698
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:59,480
I think the plants kind of feel the same

699
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,069
way so give them a nice little breeze

700
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,569
and I think they'll appreciate it you'll

701
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:04,220
make them stronger you'll make them more

702
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:06,980
robust and you'll give them just some

703
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,720
fresh air more frequently now let's talk

704
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,839
a little bit about nutrients for our

705
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,298
small veg plants we don't need a

706
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,949
supercharged nutrient regimen for these

707
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:17,720
little plants we don't want to burn them

708
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,519
we don't want to shock them we don't

709
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,069
want to stunt them while they're babies

710
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,319
we want to focus on a balanced diet and

711
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:26,569
I like to focus like I keep saying on

712
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,388
root development for these small plants

713
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:30,918
so I like a light vegetative nutrient if

714
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:33,888
you're working with bottled nutrients

715
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,528
here are a few things to think about if

716
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:39,199
you are working in cocoa or soil or

717
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:41,000
soilless mix or hydro you need to pay

718
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,730
attention to whatever product line you

719
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,109
decide to buy and see if they offer a

720
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,140
soil a

721
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:50,029
or a hydro variety the nutrients will be

722
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,070
show laded differently and they will be

723
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:53,629
in different ratios because your plants

724
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:57,019
will uptake things differently in

725
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:59,270
different mediums many of the companies

726
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:01,430
that make nutrients offer a soil or a

727
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:03,559
hydro option when it comes to buying

728
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,620
their products if you are growing in

729
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:08,679
cocoa I recommend you get the hydroponic

730
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:11,750
version of the product you are buying

731
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:14,210
cocoa is more like hydro than it is like

732
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,160
soil or a soilless mix so if you're

733
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,529
shopping for nutrients and you're in

734
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,830
cocoa I would recommend that you buy the

735
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:23,240
bottle that is recommended for hydro now

736
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:25,159
when you're looking at bottled nutrients

737
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,130
you're going to find 3 numbers displayed

738
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,830
on the bottle that is the NPK value of

739
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:33,260
that nutrient the first number is

740
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:35,299
nitrogen that tells us the ratio of

741
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:37,369
nitrogen in that product

742
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:39,529
the next number will be the amount of

743
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:42,169
phosphorus then the next number will be

744
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:43,759
the amount of potassium when it comes to

745
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:46,759
veg nutrients we are looking for a

746
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,740
product with a high and ratio and lower

747
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:50,569
P and K numbers we don't need a lot of

748
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,609
phosphorus and potassium we want to

749
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:54,409
focus on that nitrogen for building

750
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:58,129
strong robust plants with a lot of

751
00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:00,140
energy so we need a good solid grow base

752
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:03,260
nutrient let's talk a little bit about

753
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,130
base nutrients whatever company you

754
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:07,190
choose to work with

755
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:09,650
they probably offer a 2 or 3 part based

756
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,529
nutrient system a lot of them will have

757
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,630
a grow and a bloom that makes it pretty

758
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:16,639
obvious you use the grow for your

759
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,800
vegetative stage and you use the bloom

760
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,320
for your flowering stage a lot of

761
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,750
companies offer a two-part product which

762
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,849
will be an A and a B grow they also

763
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,200
offer an A and a B bloom but we don't

764
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:30,949
need those so let's talk about those

765
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,019
later you will take your grow a and grow

766
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,569
B and you will mix those into your water

767
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:37,879
to create your vegetative nutrient based

768
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:40,039
solution the reason they sell an A and a

769
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,410
B is because there are things in bottle

770
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:44,720
a and things in bottle B that will bind

771
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:47,000
together chemically if they are mixed

772
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,039
together without being diluted in our

773
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,750
water so you would fill your container I

774
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,369
generally use a five-gallon bucket in a

775
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,410
home girl you'd fill your five-gallon

776
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:56,479
bucket with water you would apply the

777
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,980
correct amount the appropriate amount of

778
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,880
veg a then you would apply the

779
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,829
appropriate amount

780
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,450
HB then you would mix it up then you

781
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:04,519
would continue to add the rest of the

782
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,340
required nutrients that is a two-part

783
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,230
vegetative nutrient solution other

784
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:11,240
companies will offer their products in a

785
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,250
different format they will offer what is

786
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,589
called a base and then they will give

787
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:18,200
you a grow and a bloom to add on top of

788
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:20,059
that with that type of nutrient regimen

789
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,160
you will use that base product through

790
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:24,649
the entire cycle through veg and through

791
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,210
flour then you'll use that grow additive

792
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,800
during the growth phase and when you

793
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,690
switch to flour you'll switch to that

794
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:31,250
flowering additive and they've just put

795
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,750
the appropriate additives in those

796
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,759
bottles to keep everything running

797
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,519
smoothly with that base nutrient in

798
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:39,410
there now whatever brand you choose be

799
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,509
sure you get the appropriate veg

800
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,519
nutrient set up if it's a two part make

801
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:45,289
sure you get the a and B if it's the

802
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,879
kind where you have to have a base and a

803
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:49,220
grow nutrient make sure you get the base

804
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,420
and the grow if you get something simple

805
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,400
where there's just a bottle that says

806
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,560
veg there you go you're ready to go

807
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,060
you've got that one strong veg nutrient

808
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,309
alright I feel like we have a good

809
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:01,039
handle on base nutrients we need a good

810
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:03,649
base nutrient with a strong nitrogen

811
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,809
value now I would recommend you feed

812
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,310
those plants maybe a quarter of the

813
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:09,019
recommended strength for the first

814
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:11,179
couple times you feed your plants new

815
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:13,940
nutrients give them a light feeding and

816
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,740
pay close attention write it down so

817
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,529
that you know exactly what you did also

818
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,569
write down the pH write down the EC if

819
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,180
that is an option for you the more notes

820
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:25,819
you take the more you can do research to

821
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,410
dial in where you went wrong a lot of us

822
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:29,509
consume a lot of cannabis

823
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,490
some of us consume cannabis while we're

824
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:33,170
working in the gardens sometimes you say

825
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,789
I wonder what I put in there and you

826
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,590
have no idea where you went wrong

827
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:38,269
that won't happen if you take notes and

828
00:30:36,589 --> 00:30:40,399
write things down I've done an entire

829
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:42,529
episode on journaling and I suggest you

830
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,330
listen to that one as well so we've got

831
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:46,460
a reliable base nutrient we've decided

832
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:49,009
how much to use it started 1/4 strength

833
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,990
maybe work your way up to 1/3 maybe 1/2

834
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:52,910
you're definitely not going to need full

835
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,740
strength nutrients for small plants a

836
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,750
lot of your nutrient companies will

837
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,700
offer a feeding schedule a lot of those

838
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,250
feeding schedules will have a small

839
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,710
plant recommendation I still recommend

840
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:06,079
you reduce that a little bit until you

841
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:09,079
see how the plants will react so we've

842
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:12,000
got a base nutrient with small plants I

843
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:14,039
always recommend some sort of my Co prod

844
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,930
some sort of route inoculant product

845
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,089
something to make those routes go Kapow

846
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:21,120
I try to avoid recommending specific

847
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:23,250
products here is a long list of reliable

848
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,879
products that will work great for your

849
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,329
routes

850
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,140
I like mammoth P I like plus life from

851
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:31,139
veg bloom

852
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,509
I like recharge from Scotty real I like

853
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,950
great white shark and Orca and my coach

854
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:37,500
um I think that is a great combination

855
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,870
some of those products are a little

856
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,029
expensive some are more affordable I can

857
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:44,309
also recommend a product called mykos it

858
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:46,799
is a very affordable bag of micro

859
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:49,109
products as long as you are using some

860
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,539
sort of microbe product I think you will

861
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:53,789
see very increased root production

862
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:56,069
compared to if you did not use it of

863
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:58,049
course I like the higher end fancier

864
00:31:56,069 --> 00:32:00,329
more expensive products but if you can't

865
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:03,450
afford that get what you can't afford I

866
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:06,299
highly recommend a microbe or a Maiko or

867
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:08,069
a root inoculants for your small plants

868
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,839
it will really speed up your production

869
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:11,909
and I think the plants will really show

870
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,159
a huge difference and you will notice it

871
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,440
and it will make you a happier grower so

872
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,269
we've got a reliable vegetative nutrient

873
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,120
with enough nitrogen in it we have

874
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:23,789
decided on a micro product that would be

875
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,250
enough for our small veg plants for two

876
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:29,039
to four weeks you may want to add some

877
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,779
fulvic acid to your mix I like adding

878
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,119
some fulvic I think it makes the plants

879
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:34,170
uptake the nutrients more quickly and I

880
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,629
think it's really worth the investment

881
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,850
just a small bottle of fulvic acid will

882
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:40,890
really improve your nutrient uptake and

883
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:42,750
your plants now if you've got a good

884
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,610
solid base nutrient and you're feeding

885
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,230
your roots your plants are really happy

886
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:48,869
you've added a little fulvic acid that's

887
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,579
increasing the uptake as the plants get

888
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:54,209
a little bit bigger you may need to

889
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:56,639
introduce some cal-mag be careful not to

890
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,250
overdose small plants on cal-mag

891
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,320
sometimes the young plants really don't

892
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,750
react well to too much cal-mag so be

893
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:06,419
careful now basically we've got a veg

894
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:08,369
nutrient we've got some mykos we've got

895
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:10,500
a little bit of fulvic acid and maybe

896
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:13,769
around week three we are going to add a

897
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:16,319
dose of cal-mag this feed should keep

898
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:18,359
our plants super happy one important

899
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,210
thing we need to think about is the pH

900
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:23,399
of our feeding solution for plants this

901
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,680
size I generally recommend we adjust the

902
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:29,730
pH somewhere between 5.9

903
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:31,620
and 6.2 and again we adjust the pH after

904
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,450
all of the nutrients have been mixed in

905
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:36,029
you've got your bucket of water you add

906
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:38,460
in the appropriate recommended amount of

907
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:40,019
each bottle of nutrients then you give

908
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,269
it a good stir make sure it's nice and

909
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,500
mixed then we check the pH then we

910
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:45,990
adjust accordingly

911
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,359
so we've got a solid veg mix we've got a

912
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,609
pH adjusted now it it's time to water

913
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:53,339
our plants I recommend when you water

914
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:55,469
you saturate your medium thoroughly

915
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:57,359
don't drown the plants but make sure

916
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,279
that all of the soil or cocoa or

917
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,109
whatever medium you are watering make

918
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,539
sure it is saturated we don't want any

919
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:06,539
dry pockets your roots will not grow

920
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:08,880
into dry spots so moisten all of your

921
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:12,509
medium now is probably a good time to

922
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,519
remind you guys of episode 337 where I

923
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:17,040
do a lesson on what is called 1 through

924
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,809
5 water tank if you're a new grower and

925
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,059
you haven't heard the 1 through 5 water

926
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:22,980
tech discussion I highly recommend you

927
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,619
listen to that episode right after this

928
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,090
it is episode 337 and it will teach you

929
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:29,489
a lot about watering your plants

930
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,980
correctly so we have appropriately

931
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,779
watered our small plants with nutrients

932
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,090
when do we need to give our plants

933
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,700
nutrients again that is a really good

934
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:41,130
question in cocoa I like to feed

935
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:44,069
nutrients to my plants at every single

936
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:46,800
watering every single day I will feed my

937
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:49,140
plants a solid base mix then I will add

938
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,120
a booster every day and I will rotate

939
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,699
those boosters depending on what the

940
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,159
plants may need in this small veg case

941
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:57,989
my booster would be the cal-mag I would

942
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,599
water the nutrients I would put the base

943
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:02,609
nutrient put the full VAT fulvic acid

944
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,949
and I would put the mykos in my nutrient

945
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:06,870
solution every single day then once a

946
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:08,730
week I would put that cal-mag in there

947
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:11,309
that would be my booster for these small

948
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:13,230
plants now if you're working in soil or

949
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:15,119
soilless mix you don't need to feed

950
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,769
nutrients as often because they stick

951
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,199
around in the dirt a little better I

952
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:21,719
would recommend you feed with nutrients

953
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,159
one feed then water the next feed when

954
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:26,159
you're feeding with just clean water

955
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:28,109
please adjust the pH just like you do

956
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,179
when you're mixing nutrients fill your

957
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,630
container with water stick your pH meter

958
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:32,789
in there

959
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,820
see what it says adjust it up or down

960
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:38,009
accordingly you need to adjust the pH at

961
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,360
every feeding so I would recommend you

962
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,720
do one feeding of nutrient

963
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,730
one watering of pH adjusted water then I

964
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,129
would go back to that basic nutrient

965
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,260
regimen for the next watering these

966
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,510
small veg plants will need frequent

967
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,520
watering pay attention to them don't let

968
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,290
them get too dry don't let them be over

969
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,809
watered once again check out the 1

970
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:59,699
through 5 watering tank another thing we

971
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:01,739
need to pay attention to is over

972
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,659
nutrient ting are we over fertilizing

973
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:06,059
these plants are we burning them pay

974
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:08,039
attention to the leaf tips if the very

975
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:10,139
tips of the leaves start to look brown

976
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,449
or of the wrong color or if they start

977
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:14,789
to curl we are feeding too much if your

978
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:17,549
leaves look pale and yellow we are not

979
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:19,860
feeding enough if you have a mixture of

980
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,990
those two symptoms your pH is probably

981
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,880
off one of the very first things I

982
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:25,619
recommend it in these grow lessons was

983
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,690
that you buy a book and you read it

984
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:29,219
hopefully you've already done some

985
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,809
reading hopefully you have looked at

986
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:32,849
some leaf charts and you know what

987
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:34,230
deficiencies look like so you know what

988
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:35,819
to pay attention to you know what a

989
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,619
healthy leaf looks like and you know

990
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,600
what an unhealthy leaf looks like and

991
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,009
it's gonna pop out in your head when you

992
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,509
see those leaves doing something weird

993
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,310
you're gonna say that's not what the

994
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,660
book said this should look like so

995
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:48,269
hopefully you've gotten the book

996
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:49,619
hopefully you have read the book so pay

997
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:50,579
attention to your plants if they are

998
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,849
showing you that they need more

999
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:56,009
nutrients increase your nutrients give

1000
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:57,690
it a little more base nutrients you

1001
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,150
probably don't need to increase the

1002
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:03,119
amount of fulvic when it comes to mykos

1003
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:05,579
I have learned that it is better to feed

1004
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,949
small amounts more frequently than to

1005
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:09,690
try to feed a whole bunch at one time

1006
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:10,919
you're not gonna do any good by pouring

1007
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,869
the whole bottle in there at one time

1008
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,059
would be more effective to pour the

1009
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:17,400
bottle in there slowly over a course of

1010
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:20,130
time so maybe if you see a deficiency

1011
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,780
just increase that base nutrient what

1012
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,519
you're going to run into a deficiency

1013
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,220
with and small plants is either going to

1014
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,349
be nitrogen or cal-mag that is going to

1015
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:30,209
be your most common deficiency so pay

1016
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:33,480
attention that those two things and

1017
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,740
learn what that looks like the next

1018
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,050
common thing you're gonna find is

1019
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:39,479
nutrient burn people are going to try to

1020
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:42,420
feed too much to these plants I heard

1021
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,030
somebody say the term [ __ ] I just want

1022
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,710
to put more on it to make it grow faster

1023
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,600
I thought it was hilarious when I heard

1024
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:51,840
that I know a lot of people like that

1025
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,250
don't be that guy now if you're running

1026
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,320
a hydroponic system

1027
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,150
if you're in rock wool cubes and you're

1028
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,490
doing a top feed or if you're in some

1029
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:02,160
type of ebb and flow system your small

1030
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:04,619
veg phase will not be nearly as long as

1031
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,349
us growing in cocoa or a soilless mix

1032
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:09,269
your small veg phase zips right by

1033
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:11,610
I think the hydro grows go much more

1034
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:13,920
quickly in veg so your small veg phase

1035
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,690
may be only about a week long you're

1036
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,960
going to need to introduce more

1037
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:21,690
nutrients at a higher rate sooner in a

1038
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,760
hydroponic setup but pay attention to

1039
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:26,099
the plants that is very plant specific

1040
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,260
and very strain specific but since the

1041
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:30,719
plants grow a little more quickly you

1042
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,760
are going to need more nutrients sooner

1043
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,799
one thing I'm going to remind you of in

1044
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,430
your hydroponics is to stay on top of

1045
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,760
your pH and your EC or your ppm s check

1046
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:44,399
it every single day and adjust as needed

1047
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,650
water is going to evaporate from your

1048
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,680
hydroponic setup but the nutrients will

1049
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,450
not evaporate so your pH and your ppm s

1050
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,819
are going to fluctuate during that

1051
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:55,769
evaporation also the plants are going to

1052
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,630
consume some of the water so the water

1053
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:59,460
is going to disappear throughout the day

1054
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,950
which is going to cause changes in your

1055
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,320
reservoir as a hydroponic grower you

1056
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:07,199
need to be on top of that every single

1057
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,620
day also I'm going to recommend you take

1058
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,089
extra notes as a hydro grower reactions

1059
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:13,710
happen a little more quickly and the

1060
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,329
plants are a little more sensitive when

1061
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:17,730
you're running hydro because you don't

1062
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:20,340
have that big soil life system to work

1063
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:22,289
as a buffer all right boys and girls I

1064
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,660
feel like that is a good talk on small

1065
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:26,190
veg we're going to leave these plants in

1066
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:27,960
these pots for two to four weeks

1067
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,849
depending on how quickly they grow

1068
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,340
that's a very strained dependent that's

1069
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:34,409
very environment dependent one thing I

1070
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:36,510
want to remind you to do is spread your

1071
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:37,859
small veg plants out we do have them

1072
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:40,110
crush together now because there are

1073
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,820
small plants but as they get larger make

1074
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:43,620
sure you spread them out give them more

1075
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,150
space they want to grow they want to

1076
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,650
branch out if you've got them all

1077
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,389
crushed together they're gonna grow

1078
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,160
straight up and get really really tall

1079
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:52,319
if you give them space to branch out

1080
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,659
they will do so and then when you top

1081
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,180
them you've got nice bushes but that's

1082
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:58,829
coming up in the future you guys I know

1083
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:00,839
I didn't talk about soil I didn't talk

1084
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:02,219
about containers in this episode I feel

1085
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,990
like I covered that in the previous

1086
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:05,699
episodes so we were up to speed there

1087
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:06,659
we're gonna leave these plants in these

1088
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:08,819
containers for two

1089
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:11,250
for weeks then we will pop them into

1090
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,470
three gallon or five gallon or perhaps

1091
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,820
seven gallon containers maybe some of

1092
00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:16,109
you out there are gonna go huge and go

1093
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,760
into a twenty or an even larger

1094
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:19,650
container but we're gonna work on that

1095
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,990
on the next episode so we've got a

1096
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,250
little time to let these plants grow

1097
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:24,659
your job now is to keep them healthy

1098
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,150
keep them happy

1099
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:29,519
keep them pests and pathogens reaching

1100
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:31,230
on those roots if you see any yellow or

1101
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,389
funky leaves make sure you pull that

1102
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,769
stuff off just take good care of your

1103
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,420
new sweet little babies make sure they

1104
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:38,070
don't have any problems so that when we

1105
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,110
transplant them into their bigger pots

1106
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,789
they're ready to go they've got a fat

1107
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:44,190
root system and they don't go into any

1108
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:46,170
shock from the transplant I just

1109
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,150
realized that I did not cover any pest

1110
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,680
management for our small plants let's

1111
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,660
talk about that really quickly

1112
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,449
hopefully you have decided on an

1113
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:56,250
integrated pest management system for

1114
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:58,099
your garden before this point hopefully

1115
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:00,300
that was part of your planning phase

1116
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:02,940
hopefully we don't have any pests or

1117
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,190
problems on our small plants some folks

1118
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:08,039
will choose to apply a pesticide as a

1119
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,650
preventative some folks will wait until

1120
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:12,960
they see a problem to use a pesticide on

1121
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,970
a plant this small I would like to wait

1122
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,829
until I transplant these into their

1123
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:19,319
three gallon pots before I put any

1124
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:21,329
pesticides on them however in some

1125
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,670
environments I don't trust the place and

1126
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:26,130
I need to put a pesticide on it I would

1127
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:28,289
use something like evergreen and I would

1128
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:30,390
probably use it around 15 mils per

1129
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:32,250
gallon I would make sure to apply it

1130
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:34,349
while the lights were off and I would be

1131
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,989
sure that the plants were completely dry

1132
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:39,420
before I turn the lights back on and I

1133
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:41,729
would probably do this approximately

1134
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,769
every five to seven days while the

1135
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:46,530
plants are little if I were in a place

1136
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:48,780
that had a reputation for getting a pest

1137
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:50,760
infestation alright I feel like that

1138
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,519
should keep us pest free for the first

1139
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,080
four weeks and then we can really start

1140
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:57,389
implementing our integrated pest

1141
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,670
management once we transplant into those

1142
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:01,799
three gallon pots all right podcast

1143
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,320
world I feel like that is a solid show

1144
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,510
about small veg if you feel like this

1145
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,130

patreon let me bring up something I keep

1155
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:32,160
forgetting to mention on the podcast

1156
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:35,190
recently patreon changed the way the

1157
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:37,649
contributors cards are billed during

1158
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:40,380
that process many contributors were

1159
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:42,539
removed from content creators pages if

1160
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:45,119
you feel like you are contributing to a

1161
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:47,099
patreon campaign I encourage you to log

content creators and it would really

1169
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:04,108
break our hearts to lose contributions

1170
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,879

contraband have that dryer sheett Terp

1221
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:18,549
I'm not sure which turf that is it

1222
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:21,160
really smells great my body really likes

1223
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:23,590
it it's kind of sweet it's kind of sharp

1224
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:25,420
it's got almost a citrus thing to it and

1225
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,680
if you let it sit on the nose for a

1226
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,900
minute and you just give it a nice smell

1227
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:30,940
and let it rest it has a really warm

1228
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,039
aroma to it something warm in the

1229
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,090
background that may sound crazy a lot of

1230
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,340
people tell me that my strained

1231
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,360
descriptions are completely crazy but if

1232
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,620
you bought a gram of this and you

1233
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,390
cracked it open and gave it a smell you

1234
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:42,250
would say that is sweet with a hint of

1235
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:44,079
citrus with a little warmth at the end

1236
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,909
and you would probably agree with me you

1237
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,319
guys I always loved the high of the

1238

1240
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:54,699

1241
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:56,650
dryer sheett sort of aroma has something

1242
00:45:54,699 --> 00:45:58,449

all right podcast world in this episode

1269
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:47,019
I am going to do another grow lesson if

1270
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,789
you have been following along you

1271
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:51,429
I've been doing a long series of grow

1272
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:53,860
lessons in that series we set a goal for

1273
00:46:51,429 --> 00:46:55,319
our grow we found a safe place for our

1274
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,700
grow we've selected the appropriate

1275
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,380
equipment for our grow we've also

1276
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:01,719
selected the appropriate nutrients and

1277
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,730
pest management system for that grow now

1278
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:05,618
we have either sprouted seeds or potted

1279
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:08,260
some clones now at this point of our

1280
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:10,690
grow we have got clones or seedlings in

1281
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,430
small pots that are probably 6 to 10

1282
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,349
inches tall at this point and they are

1283
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:16,419
developing nice fat roots that's where

1284
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:18,368
we are in these grow lessons in this

1285
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,320
lesson I plan to talk a little bit more

1286
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:22,180
about small veg we're going to continue

1287
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,650
that conversation since time has

1288
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:25,779
progressed since we put our plants into

1289
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:27,820
the small pox then I want to work my way

1290
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:29,680
into talking about microbe products and

1291
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,420
root development and the importance of

1292
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:35,109
healthy roots and the benefits of using

1293
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:37,000
a quality microbe product some of this

1294
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,769
episode may feel like a recap some of it

1295
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,690
will be a recap but we will work our way

1296
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:42,460
right into our current state so be

1297
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,530
patient sometimes I feel like it's good

1298
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,539
to remind people not everybody listens

1299
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:48,880
to every episode so I like to get people

1300
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:51,219
up to speed before I move forward I do

1301
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,619
need to correct myself I made a mistake

1302
00:47:51,219 --> 00:47:55,449
on the last episode in the last episode

1303
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:57,250
I was talking about ideal lighting for

1304
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:59,469
our small plants and I feel like I

1305
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:01,809
completely overlooked ceramic metal

1306
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:03,939
halide lighting ceramic metal halide

1307
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:06,279
lighting is a very viable and useful

1308
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,869
option for your small plants if you feel

1309
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,540
like I left you out by not mentioning

1310
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:12,190
the CMH lighting I apologize those are

1311
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:14,259
quality lights and I recommend new

1312
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:16,150
growers to use those lights for small

1313
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,590
plants if that is an option they are

1314
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,940
affordable they don't put out a lot of

1315
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:21,070
light and they don't use a lot of

1316
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,170
electricity so a ceramic metal halide

1317
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:25,600
light is a very viable option for a

1318
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,940
small grow for a new grower for small

1319
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,519
plants also if you want to step up move

1320
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,470
up from the 315 s to the 6 30s I've seen

1321
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:34,840
great results with those in a flowering

1322
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:36,309
room as well so don't let me forget the

1323
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:38,289
ceramic metal halide lighting anymore

1324
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:40,420
that is always a viable option in a

1325
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:42,789
cannabis grow now let's get back on

1326
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:45,700
track and talk more about continuing our

1327
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:48,489
small veg phase again what I consider

1328
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:50,618
small veg our small plants anything

1329
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:52,809
basically from a cloner or a ceiling

1330
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:54,640
that is in a small pot maybe like a four

1331
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:56,590
inch pot maybe a six inch net pot maybe

1332
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:58,029
all the way up to an eight inch pot but

1333
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,710
our smaller plants that don't have a

1334
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,310
super strong healthy developed root

1335
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,900
system

1336
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:03,789
our plants that are probably only eight

1337
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,880
to ten inches tall those are what I am

1338
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:08,650
considering my small veg plants now up

1339
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,510
to this point we've mainly been focusing

1340
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:13,570
on healthy pests and pathogens free

1341
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:16,060
plants I suggest you check every day for

1342
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:17,830
the presence of pests or pathogens even

1343
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:20,710
as the plants are small we still need to

1344
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:22,090
pay close attention flip a leaf over see

1345
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:23,949
if you see any weirdness on the bottom

1346
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:25,570
of the leaves pay attention to the tops

1347
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:27,639
of the leaves do you see any stippling

1348
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:29,470
that's a sign of spider mites do you see

1349
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:31,900
any gooey stuff that's a sign of thrips

1350
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:33,579
just pay attention flick some of the

1351
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,440
plants flick some of the containers do

1352
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:37,840
you see anything fly out that is a sign

1353
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,010
of either fungus gnats or white flies if

1354
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,420
they're white they're white flies if

1355
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:42,760
they're black they're probably fungus

1356
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:44,409
gnats just pay attention for pests in

1357
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,330
our small plants it's really easy to

1358
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:48,670
take care of them if we do get them but

1359
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:50,440
we need to identify our problems early

1360
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:52,720
so that we can conquer them before they

1361
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,269
get out of control so go in and check

1362
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:57,250
for pests every day check for powdery

1363
00:49:55,269 --> 00:49:59,320
mildew you should be able to spot it on

1364
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,420
these little plants very easily it will

1365
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,460
start in the center of a leaf it will

1366
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,079
usually start at the widest point of one

1367
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,880
of your biggest leaves and it will look

1368
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:08,949
like somebody just took a little drop of

1369
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,869
donut powdered sugar and just dropped it

1370
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:13,149
right on your leaf it'll look like some

1371
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:14,650
sort of white powdery water that dried

1372
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:16,930
up and just left a little stain right

1373
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:19,030
there that is the first indicator of

1374
00:50:16,929 --> 00:50:21,639
powdery mildew it will probably happen

1375
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:22,990
in a low light area we are not getting a

1376
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:25,420
lot of light but there is a lot of

1377
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:27,159
moisture oftentimes it will happen or

1378
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,990
that little bit of water just hangs on

1379
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:30,670
that one leaf in that one spot it never

1380
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:33,069
quite goes away that's where you're

1381
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,930
going to get the PM so pay attention for

1382
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:37,269
bugs pay attention for powdery mildew

1383
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:39,579
our main goal right now is to keep these

1384
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:41,829
plants pests and pathogens free and keep

1385
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:43,690
them developing strong healthy root

1386
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:45,969
systems so that we have strong healthy

1387
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:48,519
plants when it's time to transplant them

1388
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:49,809
and then later move them into flower now

1389
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:51,009
that your plants are starting to grow

1390
00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:52,840
and you've spent some time with them

1391
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:54,550
you've probably seen what happens when

1392
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,289
you over and under water them a little

1393
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:58,360
bit you've probably done one or the

1394
00:50:56,289 --> 00:51:00,909
other which has probably caused a little

1395
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,950
bit of funky leaves I encourage you to

1396
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:05,109
pull off all of the ugly leaves if

1397
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:07,509
you've got yellowing crispy leaves take

1398
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:10,420
those off those yellow leaves are an

1399
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:12,370
invitation for spider mites that's why

1400
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,450
we use yellow sticky cards in the garden

1401
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:15,069
to help the pest go

1402
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:16,659
those cards we see them on the cards and

1403
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,490
we can tell that they're there but the

1404
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:20,710
past loved to go to that yellow they

1405
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:22,629
think that is a weak leaf imagine you're

1406
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,519
a hungry spider mite and you see a big

1407
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:26,680
healthy robust leaf that's got a really

1408
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:28,030
thick layer of healthy vegetation to

1409
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:30,039
chew through before you can get some

1410
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,690
nutrients out of it or imagine just a

1411
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:33,489
little lower on the plant you've got a

1412
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,289
weak leaf it's yellow on the outside

1413
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:36,699
it's got a real thin layer and you can

1414
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:38,289
just poke right through it suck all the

1415
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:40,328
juice you want right out of it like a

1416
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:42,190
hungry little vampire bug you are you're

1417
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:44,109
gonna go right to those weak yellow

1418
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:45,550
leaves it's not as much work for food

1419
00:51:44,108 --> 00:51:46,059
you can get right in there and get what

1420
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,589
you need

1421
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:49,929
the spider mites are going right for

1422
00:51:47,588 --> 00:51:51,549
that yellow weak part so pull off all

1423
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:53,078
those weak parts pull off all the yellow

1424
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,400
leaves that's where the problems are

1425
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:56,260
going to start anyway that's where the

1426
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,119
plant is the weakest get that out of

1427
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,369
there now while you're pulling off

1428
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:01,809
leaves you may notice that the couple of

1429
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:03,608
branches at the very bottom of your

1430
00:52:01,809 --> 00:52:05,230
plant are just weak and shitty and kind

1431
00:52:03,608 --> 00:52:06,519
of in the way if you've got a couple of

1432
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:08,619
leaves that are hanging down into the

1433
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:10,480
dirt pick that stuff right off we don't

1434
00:52:08,619 --> 00:52:13,180
need that very bottom crap on the plant

1435
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,920
by the time it makes it to flower we're

1436
00:52:13,179 --> 00:52:16,659
going to clean up the bottom eight to

1437
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,730
ten inches of that stalk anyway those

1438
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:20,409
bottom branches will not even be there I

1439
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,030
feel like if you take some of those

1440
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:24,098
little sucker branches off the bottom

1441
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:25,660
now it will encourage growth up to the

1442
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,250
top of the plant we don't need that

1443
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:28,659
stuff on the bottom the lights not going

1444
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,550
to get to it that's where the problems

1445
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:32,828
are gonna happen why not cut that stuff

1446
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,359
right off if you're happy with the way

1447
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:35,859
your plants look without pruning

1448
00:52:34,358 --> 00:52:38,318
anything off the bottom you don't have

1449
00:52:35,858 --> 00:52:39,969
to do it but if you've got two or three

1450
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:40,389
branches on the bottom that just aren't

1451
00:52:39,969 --> 00:52:42,009
growing

1452
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:44,348
to reach the rest of the branches if

1453
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:45,760
they look weak why not take them off we

1454
00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:47,349
don't need that weak [ __ ] down there at

1455
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,510
the bottom of the plant wasting energy

1456
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:51,400
wasting nutrients and wasting water

1457
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:52,810
let's just cut it right off and send

1458
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,170
that energy right up to the top of the

1459
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:54,969
plant

1460
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,318
now as the plants get bigger you'll

1461
00:52:54,969 --> 00:52:58,509
notice they're starting to branch out a

1462
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:00,519
little bit on the bottoms of some of the

1463
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:03,130
branches you may start developing shoots

1464
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:05,318
if those little shoots are weak you can

1465
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:07,329
pinch those off as well you don't have

1466
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:08,829
to take off the entire branch you can

1467
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:10,660
just take off the shitty shoots at the

1468
00:53:08,829 --> 00:53:12,310
bottom and you can still leave the ends

1469
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:14,858
of those branches and you can still have

1470
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:16,960
more bud sites and more branches don't

1471
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,429
take off too much now you can always

1472
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,949
take off more in the future

1473
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:22,809
you cannot glue branches back onto the

1474
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:24,909
plant and keep in mind the plant grows

1475
00:53:22,809 --> 00:53:26,559
out of the top so the [ __ ] you take off

1476
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:27,429
the bottom will not replace itself

1477
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,409
you're cleaning up the

1478
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:32,049
that is gone it's going to grow out of

1479
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:33,639
the top keep that in mind now let's talk

1480
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,019
a little bit about nutrients I always

1481
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:37,089
recommend starting off with light

1482
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:38,650
nutrients if your plants are showing any

1483
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:40,480
yellow or if they're not growing as

1484
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:42,940
quickly as you would like them to you

1485
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,889
may need to increase the overall amount

1486
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,510
of nutrients we are giving the plants I

1487
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:48,759
always recommend starting low and

1488
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:50,080
increasing as time goes on if your

1489
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,850
plants are a little bit pale or

1490
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,170
yellowish if they're not as green as we

1491
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:55,059
would hope it would be at this point it

1492
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:57,700
is probably time to increase our

1493
00:53:55,059 --> 00:54:00,070
nutrients also it may be time to add

1494
00:53:57,699 --> 00:54:01,599
some cal-mag to the mix if your plants

1495
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,610
are growing properly if they're nice and

1496
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,469
robust if they've got a nice root system

1497
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:07,900
in this small pot I would recommend

1498
00:54:05,469 --> 00:54:10,809
adding a small dose of cal-mag once a

1499
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:12,430
week to your feeding regimen if you feel

1500
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:13,869
like you're feeding your plants properly

1501
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:15,250
you're giving them a proper amount of

1502
00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:17,440
nitrogen you're giving them the proper

1503
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:19,150
amount of Calem AG you're also giving

1504
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,530
them some beneficials for the roots and

1505
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:22,539
you're not seeing the growth you would

1506
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:25,870
like to see I would suspect that it's

1507
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:27,610
probably a pH issue check the pH of the

1508
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:29,920
solution you are feeding your plants if

1509
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:31,690
your pH is off your plants won't be able

1510
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,059
to uptake nutrients which means they

1511
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:36,519
will not grow so once you have mixed up

1512
00:54:34,059 --> 00:54:39,429
your nutrients put your pH pin in there

1513
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:41,769
and see what the pH of that solution is

1514
00:54:39,429 --> 00:54:44,109
before you feed it to your plants if

1515
00:54:41,769 --> 00:54:47,440
it's not in the appropriate range adjust

1516
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,940
it this is such an overlooked step most

1517
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,980
of the time when people send me pictures

1518
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,760
of their plants they say what is wrong

1519
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,280
with my plant

1520
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,260
I asked them what was the pH of your

1521
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,269
last feeding solution you know what most

1522
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,580
of their answers are I don't know

1523
00:54:58,269 --> 00:55:02,259
so I usually tell them check the pH and

1524
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:04,119
get back to me because I would assume if

1525
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,620
you're not checking the pH that is

1526
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:07,839
probably the issue you didn't even

1527
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:09,849
bother to check how do I know if you've

1528
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,350
got another nutritional problem how do I

1529
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:13,599
know if you're overfeeding or under

1530
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:15,579
feeding a specific nutrient if I don't

1531
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,159
know what the pH of your solution is

1532
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:20,289
you've got to dial in the pH I've done

1533
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:23,409
an entire episode on the importance of

1534
00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:25,420
pH for these small plants I really think

1535
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:28,509
they would be happiest with a pH right

1536
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:30,250
around 6 1 or 6 - you can go 5 8 2 6 3

1537
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:33,400
if you really want to have a wide range

1538
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:35,409
but I think 61 or 62 in cocoa or

1539
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,349
soilless mix is going to be ideal for

1540
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:40,509
these small plants we may increase that

1541
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:40,750
pH as we go along the growth process as

1542
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,130
we

1543
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:44,380
pay attention to the plants and see how

1544
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,539
they react to certain things but for now

1545
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:48,640
I think this six point two is right

1546
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:50,170
about where we need to be all right so

1547
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:51,549
we've got clean healthy plants we don't

1548
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:53,650
have any bugs we don't have any powdery

1549
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:55,090
mildew we have increased our nutrients

1550
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,639
to increase our vigor and increase

1551
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:59,829
growth speed it is probably time to

1552
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:01,239
spread your plants out if they are too

1553
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:03,670
pressed together if they're too crowded

1554
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:04,899
they're not going to branch out properly

1555
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:06,849
so if you've got them crushed in there

1556
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:08,769
real tight it's time to spread them out

1557
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:10,839
if it looks like your plants are getting

1558
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:13,210
too tall and too skinny and too stretchy

1559
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,829
it's one of two things they either want

1560
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:16,720
more light or they are too close

1561
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:18,670
together which probably just means they

1562
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,589
want more light if you've got branches

1563
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,360
pressed together if you've got leaves

1564
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,280
pressed together if you've got plants

1565
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,260
overlapping each other if you've got one

1566
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,850
plant pressed up against the wall they

1567
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,440
know they're too tight together and

1568
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:31,539
instead of branching out they're gonna

1569
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,220
go straight up and try to get some light

1570
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:35,050
they are all competing for light space

1571
00:56:33,219 --> 00:56:37,359
and you're probably running your small

1572
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:39,220
veg under smaller lights which means

1573
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,650
they're really competing for that space

1574
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:43,779
if we crowd them in spread them out let

1575
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:46,210
them get some light light is the number

1576
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:48,400
one desired nutrient and source of

1577
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:50,679
energy for our plants over their entire

1578
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,900
life cycles they want light more than

1579
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:54,789
anything light is the key

1580
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,680
these plants think they're going to get

1581
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:58,989
the Sun and we brought them indoors and

1582
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:00,669
wired up little t5 bulbs and we're

1583
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:02,379
trying to make them grow with that so

1584
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:04,840
spoil them and give them as much of that

1585
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:06,760
t5 lighting as they can get give them as

1586
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,010
much space as they can handle so that

1587
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,320
you can get maximum performance from our

1588
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:13,240
small plants so now I feel like we've

1589
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,460
got healthy plants that are pest free

1590
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:16,869
they're probably about eight to ten

1591
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,820
inches tall we're starting to get nice

1592
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:20,259
branching on the bottom we've cleaned up

1593
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,180
those crappy branches on the bottom

1594
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,650
we've pulled off any funky leaves we've

1595
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:25,599
spread them out so that they're not too

1596
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:27,670
crowded we are probably going to

1597
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,679
transplant these plants into their

1598
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:31,840
forever homes within the next week or

1599
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:33,519
two that's going to be the next grow

1600
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,829
lesson that I provide will be

1601
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:38,110
transplanting into our forever homes

1602
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:40,929
I think one thing we should really focus

1603
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:43,240
on until we transplant is fat root

1604
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:45,250
development I like my plants to be

1605
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:47,559
nearly root bound in these small pots

1606
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:49,179
before I transplant them I like to have

1607
00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:51,670
to kind of break that root ball up at

1608
00:57:49,179 --> 00:57:53,889
transplant to make it explode it sounds

1609
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,220
crazy but if you get that root ball kind

1610
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:56,589
of

1611
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:58,899
in a small pot when we transplanted into

1612
00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:01,210
the next pot it will really take off we

1613
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,490
will really see explosive growth we will

1614
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:05,199
have a really robust and healthy plant

1615
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:07,209
from the very beginning with a solid

1616
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:09,159
foundation so let's let these plants

1617
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:11,349
grow and get kind of tight in their pots

1618
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:13,089
you may see some roots coming out of the

1619
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:14,589
bottom of your container that is a good

1620
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:16,180
thing if those roots are nice and white

1621
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:17,710
that means you were feeding those roots

1622
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:19,599
very well that your plants are very

1623
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:21,220
happy if they are getting a nice amount

1624
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,989
of moisture that they're getting a nice

1625
00:58:21,219 --> 00:58:23,439
amount of dry thyme that everything is

1626
00:58:22,989 --> 00:58:26,409
going well

1627
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,030
inside here rhizosphere now if you want

1628
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:29,230
to take a look at your roots and see

1629
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:32,080
what kind of root development you're

1630
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:35,530
working with don't be afraid to grab a

1631
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,480
cup or a pot with a plant in it and put

1632
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,980
your finger over the pot and kind of

1633
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,150
make a spa Kent where you're spreading

1634
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:42,400
your ring finger and your middle finger

1635
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:44,200
apart put the stalk of the plant right

1636
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,940
between those two fingers and then just

1637
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:47,500
flick that pot upside down and give it a

1638
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:49,869
little bit of a shake if you're

1639
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,789
confident you can pull that pot off and

1640
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:53,829
you can look directly at the root

1641
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:55,449
development if you start lifting that

1642
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:57,039
pot off and the dirt starts falling out

1643
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,929
like crazy and it's not compact and

1644
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:59,860
pressed together push it back in there

1645
00:58:58,929 --> 00:59:01,299
and just leave it alone

1646
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,400
the roots are not developed enough to

1647
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,680
try this experiment if you start lifting

1648
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,510
that pot off and all the dirt stays in

1649
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:09,399
one piece and you can see those roots

1650
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,510
you can just lift that pot right off and

1651
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,400
you can take a look at the root

1652
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,930
development if you can see those roots

1653
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,190
wrapped around inside of there and all

1654
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:16,929
the dirt and all the roots are tight

1655
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,150
into one piece that is what we're aiming

1656
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:22,210
for you are almost ready for transplant

1657
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:23,889
I like to let those get almost rootbound

1658
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:25,690
where the plant is almost filling that

1659
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:27,909
container with roots to where it is

1660
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:30,519
almost panicking time to put that into a

1661
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:32,379
new pot I feel like if we wait that long

1662
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:34,719
to put it into our next pot we get

1663
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:36,730
explosive root growth when we transplant

1664
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:38,859
it into the next container I also feel

1665
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:40,269
like we get less transplant shock and I

1666
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,490
feel like the plant is more developed

1667
00:59:40,269 --> 00:59:45,219
and more prepared to go into its larger

1668
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:47,649
container so if you are experienced or a

1669
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:49,179
confident grab a plant flip it upside

1670
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:51,309
down and knock the container off of it

1671
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:52,809
and see what comes out if all the dirt

1672
00:59:51,309 --> 00:59:54,789
goes flying and the roots come on

1673
00:59:52,809 --> 00:59:56,440
ravelin and hanging out just plant that

1674
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:57,250
back in there really carefully and it

1675
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,929
will be okay

1676
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,369
if you're careful about it do your best

1677
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:02,139
not to break any of the roots don't

1678
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:03,579
disturb the roots you can get them back

1679
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:05,049
in there while you've got it out

1680
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:06,549
sprinkle a little bit of root or knock

1681
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,850
youlet powder on there sprinkle some

1682
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,500
plus life or some

1683
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:11,539
right right onto the roots and put it

1684
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,730
back in there and that inoculant will

1685
01:00:11,539 --> 01:00:16,279
encourage those roots to grow even more

1686
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:17,900
quickly than they already were all right

1687
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,670
podcast rolled I'm going to press pause

1688
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,440
for a moment I need to take a drink I'll

1689
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:23,329
probably take a couple of dabs while I'm

1690
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,250
at it when I get back we will talk more

1691
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:26,929
about developing healthy roots and we

1692
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:28,940
will also talk about Michael Raizel

1693
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:31,250
fungus so take a dab with me and I will

1694
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:33,260
be right back all right podcast rolled I

1695
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:35,719
am back I am well medicated I am well

1696
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:38,960
hydrated let's talk more about healthy

1697
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:40,609
roots and mycorrhizal fungus before we

1698
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,389
transfer our small plants into their

1699
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:43,970
forever homes

1700
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:46,429
we want to develop thick healthy white

1701
01:00:43,969 --> 01:00:47,989
roots we want a big fat root system so

1702
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:50,899
that we've got a well-established plant

1703
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:53,269
to go into a larger pot a good microbe

1704
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:55,070
product will encourage explosive root

1705
01:00:53,269 --> 01:00:57,349
growth let's talk about some of the

1706
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:59,840
other advantages of our Michael Raizel

1707
01:00:57,349 --> 01:01:02,119
fungus the first obvious advantage is

1708
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,680
more roots more roots means our plants

1709
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:05,179
can eat more which means our plants can

1710
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:07,369
drink more which means our plants will

1711
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:09,469
grow more quickly which means we will

1712
01:01:07,369 --> 01:01:11,389
produce more branching which means we

1713
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:13,939
will produce more buds which is our main

1714
01:01:11,389 --> 01:01:16,279
goal so the first benefit more roots

1715
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:18,650
which means more productivity overall

1716
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,019
from our plants another great function

1717
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:23,300
of our beneficial fungus is they work as

1718
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:25,820
a protective layer or a security guard

1719
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:28,010
for our root zone they protect against

1720
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:30,110
pathogen problems and illness in our

1721
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:31,760
plants there's already a colony of

1722
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:33,710
beneficial fungus gathered around the

1723
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,900
roots if anything else tries to get near

1724
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:37,670
it those colonies say hey this is our

1725
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,860
turf bro and they fight off any

1726
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:42,289
potential pathogens that want to get to

1727
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:44,539
your root zone some of our beneficial

1728
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:46,670
bacteria work in a similar function as

1729
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:48,739
an enzyme it will break down decaying

1730
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:50,570
matter it will break down nutrients and

1731
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:52,579
it will make it more bioavailable to our

1732
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:54,289
plants so our plants can take that waste

1733
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:56,989
and actually turn it into food and

1734
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:58,759
consume it and use it to its benefit now

1735
01:01:56,989 --> 01:02:00,829
if you are using a microbe product I

1736
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:02,450
don't recommend that you stop using your

1737
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:04,699
enzymes I recommend you use them

1738
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:06,619
together let them team up and create a

1739
01:02:04,699 --> 01:02:08,839
beautiful environment in your raizo

1740
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:10,489
sphere that will also create a lot of

1741
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,840
diversity you will have multiple things

1742
01:02:10,489 --> 01:02:13,759
in there breaking down the decaying

1743
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,490
matter that should really encourage a

1744
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,050
clean healthy raizou sphere another

1745
01:02:16,489 --> 01:02:20,669
function of some of our beneficial

1746
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:24,028
bacteria is the aid and the processes

1747
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:25,440
that encouraged branching and bud set so

1748
01:02:24,028 --> 01:02:27,960
by introducing these beneficial bacteria

1749
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,720
you may see more branching and you may

1750
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,798
see more bud sites in your plants now

1751
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:33,778
another great thing that these

1752
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:37,079
beneficial bacteria is do is they were

1753
01:02:33,778 --> 01:02:39,389
to increase essential oil production now

1754
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:42,359
what are essential oils essential oils

1755
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:44,219
are our terpenes and cannabinoids you

1756
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:46,288
can increase the overall production of

1757
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:48,959
your plants you can increase the overall

1758
01:02:46,289 --> 01:02:51,900
flavor aroma and potency of your plants

1759
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,539
by using the correct mycorrhizal fungus

1760
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:57,358
now I try to avoid recommending brand

1761
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:59,369
names there are several great micro

1762
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:01,469
Raizel products available at your local

1763
01:02:59,369 --> 01:03:03,838
grocer or there are tons available

1764
01:03:01,469 --> 01:03:06,179
online I will list a few products that I

1765
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:08,429
have had great experience with of course

1766
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:10,618
I have to recommend recharge I really

1767
01:03:08,429 --> 01:03:12,268
like recharge recharge made my plants go

1768
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:15,088
crazy one of the good things about

1769
01:03:12,268 --> 01:03:16,858
recharge is it contains dried molasses

1770
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:18,960
which is constantly feeding the microbes

1771
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:21,619
the microbes do need some sort of feel

1772
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,210
it's already got feel in that container

1773
01:03:21,619 --> 01:03:26,490
another acceptable myko product is

1774
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:29,009
called extreme mykos and they spell

1775
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:31,078
mykos with a k' it's a great product it

1776
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:34,019
is very affordable you don't have to buy

1777
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:35,548
a very expensive micro product if you

1778
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:36,808
want something that's affordable if

1779
01:03:35,548 --> 01:03:39,028
you're just gonna try it out

1780
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:41,400
extreme mykos is probably one of the

1781
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:43,858
most affordable microbe products on the

1782
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,230
market if you want a liquid microbe

1783
01:03:43,858 --> 01:03:49,139
product you can get hydro guard from

1784
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:51,000
botanic care I really like great white

1785
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:52,528
great white is a powdered microbe

1786
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,239
product I like the powders because you

1787
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:55,380
can sprinkle them directly onto the

1788
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:57,538
roots we're gonna talk more about that

1789
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:59,490
when we get to the transplanting episode

1790
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:01,769
but during transplant I like to sprinkle

1791
01:03:59,489 --> 01:04:03,659
the powders directly onto the roots and

1792
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:04,048
into the hole where I'm transplanting my

1793
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:06,118
plant

1794
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:08,309
I also trance prinkle some right around

1795
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:10,650
the outside where it's gonna grow these

1796
01:04:08,309 --> 01:04:12,839
beneficial fungus do not work unless

1797
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:14,338
they actually touch the roots of the

1798
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:16,318
plant so they have to touch the plant

1799
01:04:14,338 --> 01:04:18,210
that triggers them to germinate and

1800
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:20,369
become alive so they have to come in

1801
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:22,380
contact so sprinkle those powders right

1802
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:23,548
onto the roots I really like that if you

1803
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,869
want to stick with liquid and use

1804
01:04:23,548 --> 01:04:27,449
something similar to the great white

1805
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:28,890
they make a product called orca orcas is

1806
01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:30,989
very similar to the great white they

1807
01:04:28,889 --> 01:04:32,699
took out two specific beneficial

1808
01:04:30,989 --> 01:04:33,929
funguses but I don't think you'll ever

1809
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:35,848
notice they're miss

1810
01:04:33,929 --> 01:04:38,088
is just easier to keep them in a liquid

1811
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:40,650
solution without that fungus in their

1812
01:04:38,088 --> 01:04:42,568
great white also makes a product called

1813
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:44,460
my coach um I spoke earlier that I like

1814
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:46,170
recharge because it's got a product that

1815
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:48,449
feeds their beneficials that comes in

1816
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:50,400
one package the folks that make great

1817
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:53,159
white and Orca have put out a product

1818
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,230
called my coach um that product will

1819
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:56,639
feed your beneficials that also contains

1820
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:59,548
unearth other things that will encourage

1821
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:01,650
root growth and healthy plants the folks

1822
01:04:59,548 --> 01:05:03,599
that make great white and Orca and my

1823
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:05,760
coach um also make a time-release

1824
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,980
granule if I'm working in a large

1825
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,510
container I like to start that pot with

1826
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,940
some of the time-release granules

1827
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:13,770
already in the soil I'll mix up a large

1828
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:15,659
batch of soil with my amendments with my

1829
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:17,838
perlite with my purse alight and then I

1830
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:20,368
will just pour a big bag of the dried

1831
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:22,199
granules from great white right across

1832
01:05:20,369 --> 01:05:23,730
the top of that makes it right in put

1833
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:26,038
that into the pot and plant right into

1834
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:27,539
that the plants go crazy I feel like

1835
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:30,119
giving them plenty of that beneficial

1836
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:32,880
bacteria really reduces transplant shock

1837
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:33,450
and it really encourages explosive root

1838
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,088
growth

1839
01:05:33,449 --> 01:05:38,429
another powdered root inoculant i can

1840
01:05:36,088 --> 01:05:40,769
recommend is the plus life from our

1841
01:05:38,429 --> 01:05:42,929
friends at veg bloom many of the

1842
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:45,210
commercial grows in colorado are running

1843
01:05:42,929 --> 01:05:47,460
veg bloom so i would encourage them just

1844
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:50,699
to add the plus life product right along

1845
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:52,920
the veg bloom base mix i have had great

1846
01:05:50,699 --> 01:05:55,710
success using the veg bloom product line

1847
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,869
and adding the plus life root inoculant

1848
01:05:55,710 --> 01:06:00,119
powder along with that mix and i've used

1849
01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:02,309
that and grows of all different sizes

1850
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:04,890
I've used it in for light grows and I've

1851
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:07,980
used it in 400 light grows and I like

1852
01:06:04,889 --> 01:06:09,269
the way it works in all conditions all

1853
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:11,880
right I've got one more product to talk

1854
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:14,489
about another great liquid microbe

1855
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,858
product is mammoth pea mammoth pea is a

1856
01:06:14,489 --> 01:06:18,659
great product one of the great things

1857
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:20,670
about mammoth pea is it is highly

1858
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:23,009
concentrated another great thing is you

1859
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:25,619
do not have to add anything to feed the

1860
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:27,480
microbes mammoth pea uses microbes that

1861
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:29,400
can sustain themselves off of the carbon

1862
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:31,858
in the breakdown happening within the

1863
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,019
rhizosphere so that is a list of great

1864
01:06:31,858 --> 01:06:37,078
microbe products I would recommend they

1865
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:39,900
vary in application rates they vary in

1866
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:42,599
amount of microbes per container and

1867
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:45,389
they are going to vary widely in prices

1868
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:47,460
find what works best for you and your

1869
01:06:45,389 --> 01:06:49,799
garden some of you are going to Anne

1870
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:51,360
the dried powdered forms more some of

1871
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,789
you are going to like the liquid forms

1872
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:56,010
more some of you simply cannot get the

1873
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:57,929
overpriced expensive products some of

1874
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:59,970
you will only buy the overpriced

1875
01:06:57,929 --> 01:07:02,039
expensive products I get it everybody's

1876
01:06:59,969 --> 01:07:04,619
got their style that's why I recommended

1877
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:06,210
several products I have used each of

1878
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:07,829
those products I've had great experience

1879
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:09,809
with those products and I feel like I

1880
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:11,549
can recommend those products to you with

1881
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:14,250
confidence that they're going to work in

1882
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:16,019
your garden under just about any type of

1883
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:18,269
conditions or any type of environment

1884
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:20,250
now keep in mind that you may need to

1885
01:07:18,269 --> 01:07:21,960
feed your microbes I mentioned earlier

1886
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:23,579
that some of the microbes do contain

1887
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,190
other additives it will feed themselves

1888
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:29,190
I will still encourage you to feed the

1889
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:31,679
microbes the microbes want to eat carbs

1890
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:33,480
the plants want to eat carbs add a

1891
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:34,919
little bit of carbohydrates the

1892
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,869
carbohydrates will give your plants

1893
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,690
energy and the carbohydrates will feed

1894
01:07:36,869 --> 01:07:41,369
your microbes it's a win-win situation

1895
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,000
don't overdose the carbs trying to feed

1896
01:07:41,369 --> 01:07:44,339
them both

1897
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,199
I generally suggest starting off with

1898
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:48,240
half of the recommended dose if you buy

1899
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:50,429
a bottle of a carbohydrate product and

1900
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:53,250
it says feed 40 I recommend you start

1901
01:07:50,429 --> 01:07:54,750
off with 20 pay attention if the plants

1902
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:56,909
seem happy you don't need to increase

1903
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:58,710
the dosage if you want to you can

1904
01:07:56,909 --> 01:08:00,359
increase the dosage until you see the

1905
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:02,130
plants react poorly that's what a lot of

1906
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,780
growers like to do push it as hard as we

1907
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,550
can and then back off that's how you

1908
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,780
learn the limits of a plant but if

1909
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:08,820
you're a newer grower if you're not

1910
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,769
super experienced just feed it half of

1911
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:12,870
that recommended dosage and the plants

1912
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:14,940
will be receiving that nutrition even if

1913
01:08:12,869 --> 01:08:16,680
you don't see anything happening be

1914
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,170
careful overdoing it with a carbohydrate

1915
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:21,630
product late and flower because it will

1916
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:23,250
make your buds burn like a rock they'll

1917
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:25,529
just turn into a charcoal briquette and

1918
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:27,449
they won't burn very well if you overdo

1919
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:30,149
it with the molasses or a carbohydrate

1920
01:08:27,449 --> 01:08:32,099
product late in bloom now earlier I

1921
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:34,170
mentioned my coach um if you want a

1922
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,030
quality product to feed your microbes

1923
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:37,980
and encourage micro growth and encourage

1924
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:40,199
root growth and overall plant health

1925
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:42,119
check out my coach um from the same

1926
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:44,039
folks that make the great white product

1927
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:44,760
line now when it comes to feeding your

1928
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:48,239
microbes

1929
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:50,789
I recommend more frequent smaller doses

1930
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:52,679
now the first time I introduced microbes

1931
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:54,750
to my feeding regimen I usually give it

1932
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:58,200
what the bottle says if the container

1933
01:08:54,750 --> 01:09:00,300
says one gram or 25 milliliters I will

1934
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:01,399
add that to my nutrient solution and I

1935
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,220
will water that right

1936
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:06,109
my goal is to get a good start of a

1937
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:07,760
colonization of microbes I just want to

1938
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:08,839
give it a good head start just put them

1939
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:11,270
in there and get them going

1940
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:13,310
then my subsequent waterings I will

1941
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:16,760
probably give it half of the recommended

1942
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:19,640
dosage but those products usually say to

1943
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:22,100
water it in once a week instead of doing

1944
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:25,130
it once a week I'll reduce the dosage to

1945
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:28,190
half and water it every time I water for

1946
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:30,590
a couple of weeks to build a nice solid

1947
01:09:28,189 --> 01:09:33,259
colony of beneficial fungus in my raizo

1948
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:34,789
sphere now after I transplant into my 3

1949
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:36,380
gallon pots and I get the roots on

1950
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:38,180
crankin and I've got a nice fat root

1951
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:42,319
ball in that pot I will start reducing

1952
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:44,240
my frequency of inoculant feedings in a

1953
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:47,090
commercial grow when I'm in flour I

1954
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:48,679
generally feed plus life once a week and

1955
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:50,420
that's enough through the flowering

1956
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,159
cycle once I've got the roots nice and

1957
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:54,560
healthy and everything is developed I

1958
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:56,059
will generally use the plus life to keep

1959
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,580
problems away it keeps the root zone

1960
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:00,860
nice and clean a nice enzymatic product

1961
01:09:58,579 --> 01:10:02,630
and a nice micro Raizel product again

1962
01:10:00,859 --> 01:10:05,119
will work to keep the roots clean and

1963
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:06,920
healthy and happy and pathogen free so

1964
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:09,109
I'll just continue the once a week

1965
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:11,060
feeding just to keep everybody clean and

1966
01:10:09,109 --> 01:10:12,799
happy and kind of it's sort of like

1967
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:14,720
plant probiotics it's like giving

1968
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,699
probiotics to a plant if you take

1969
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,380
probiotics for your gut health it just

1970
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:21,289
has it good you've got a good gut biome

1971
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:23,900
we're making a good gut biome for our

1972
01:10:21,289 --> 01:10:26,390
plants by feeding them probiotics which

1973
01:10:23,899 --> 01:10:27,619
are actually Michael Raizel fungus when

1974
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:29,480
it comes to the plant world

1975
01:10:27,619 --> 01:10:30,829
all right podcast world I've got one

1976
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:32,089
more thing to talk about and then we

1977
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:34,309
were going to start wrapping up this

1978
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:36,860
episode when you were listening or

1979
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:39,410
reading or learning about mycorrhizal

1980
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:41,869
fungus you will hear three words quite

1981
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:44,809
frequently that basically mean the same

1982
01:10:41,869 --> 01:10:46,819
thing you will hear the word inoculated

1983
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:48,950
you will hear the word of vaccinated and

1984
01:10:46,819 --> 01:10:51,739
you will also hear the word infected

1985
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:54,170
these words all basically mean that the

1986
01:10:51,739 --> 01:10:57,800
root zone shows the presence of a

1987
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:59,600
mycorrhizal fungus we inoculate our root

1988
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:02,180
zone with a fungus by adding it

1989
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,970
ourselves we have now inoculated it once

1990
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:06,619
that takes hold it is basically

1991
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:08,750
vaccinated once it travels across the

1992
01:11:06,619 --> 01:11:10,460
root zone it is infected that is a

1993
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:12,949
positive thing I know they sound like

1994
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:15,469
scary words but in this situation all

1995
01:11:12,949 --> 01:11:17,688
three of those words are positive thing

1996
01:11:15,469 --> 01:11:19,279
that we want happening within our raizo

1997
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:22,340
sphere so when you hear the word

1998
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:24,469
inoculated vaccinated or infected keep

1999
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:26,840
in mind it just means basically the

2000
01:11:24,469 --> 01:11:29,208
presence of mycorrhizal fungus within

2001
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,069
our root zone all right podcast world

2002
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:33,559
that is my talk about continuing small

2003
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:35,779
healthy feds that is also my lesson on

2004
01:11:33,559 --> 01:11:37,550
micro Raizel fungus i want to thank you

2005
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:39,259

2006

you were interested in learning a lot

2007
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:43,579
more about michael Raizel fungi I highly

2008
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,859
recommend a podcast called cannabis

2009
01:11:43,578 --> 01:11:48,228
cultivation and sciences by tad Hussey

2010
01:11:45,859 --> 01:11:51,438
tad recently had Jim Egan on the show

2011
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:53,630
and they do a deep dive into Michael

2012
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:55,519
Raizel fungus and I highly recommend the

2013
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:57,078
episode it was great timing I had

2014
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:59,090
already planned this episode to come out

2015
01:11:57,078 --> 01:12:01,549
this week I was writing this episode and

2016
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:02,989

2018

01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:09,229
takes it really deep if you're going to

2020
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:11,748
listen to Dad's podcast I highly

2021
01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:14,389
recommend a notebook and a pen you are

2022
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:16,158
going to learn a lot about cultivation

2023
01:12:14,389 --> 01:12:17,208
you will learn a lot about organic

2024
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:19,238
cultivation you'll learn about

2025
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:21,438
sustainability you will learn about

2026
01:12:19,238 --> 01:12:24,678
permaculture and he will certainly learn

2027
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:26,599
about Michael Raizel fungi again the

2028
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:28,639

funky fruit and if you dab it in a nice

2100
01:15:02,609 --> 01:15:06,299
low temperature it tastes like

2101
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:08,670
strawberries and cream with a hint of

2102
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:10,619
skunky gas enos in the background it is

2103
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,600
very delicious it's almost like eating

2104
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:14,010
some strawberry shortcake at the gas

2105
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,110
station that's what it kind of smells

2106
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:18,270
like to me the lab tests on the front

2107
01:15:16,109 --> 01:15:20,488
here says seventy two point three

2108
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:23,760
percent THC with a total cannabinoid

2109
01:15:20,488 --> 01:15:25,979
content of 83.9% I really like this

2110
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,780
concentrate it tastes delicious the high

2111
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:30,209
is great and the texture and consistency

2112
01:15:27,779 --> 01:15:31,920
are beautiful there's just enough Terp

2113
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:34,140
sauce in here and it's got some nice

2114
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,149
chunky crystals I am really happy with

2115
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:38,760
that purchase great concentrate from our

2116
01:15:36,149 --> 01:15:40,289
friends and apothecary farms all right

2117
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,449
my next order of business is to give a

2118
01:15:40,289 --> 01:15:44,159
couple of people some shout outs on

2119
01:15:42,449 --> 01:15:46,409

thank you guys for the continued patreon

2125
01:15:54,779 --> 01:15:58,889
support all right podcast world this is

2126
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:00,450
going to be another grow lesson if

2127
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:02,190
you've been following along you know

2128
01:16:00,449 --> 01:16:04,619
I've been doing a long series of grow

2129
01:16:02,189 --> 01:16:07,769
lessons that series starts at episode

2130
01:16:04,619 --> 01:16:09,869
351 in this series of lessons we started

2131
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:11,850
by setting a goal for our grow then we

2132
01:16:09,869 --> 01:16:13,500
decided a good place for our growth then

2133
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:16,079
we acquired the appropriate equipment

2134
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:18,359
and set it up then we either acquired

2135
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:21,029
seeds or clones and we got those growing

2136
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:22,949
at this point in my grow lessons we

2137
01:16:21,029 --> 01:16:25,109
should have small plants that are

2138
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:27,179
approximately 8 to 12 inches tall and

2139
01:16:25,109 --> 01:16:29,819
they are in small pots they are probably

2140
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:31,829
in either beer cups or 4 inch pots or

2141
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:33,659
maybe six or eight inch net pots but

2142
01:16:31,829 --> 01:16:35,010
we've got small plants they should be

2143
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:36,569
nice and healthy at this point they

2144
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:38,760
should have nice branching coming out of

2145
01:16:36,569 --> 01:16:40,920
them they should not have any bugs or

2146
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,930
any powdery mildew hopefully at this

2147
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,659
point we don't have any burned leaves or

2148
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:48,810
any signs of deficiencies hopefully we

2149
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:51,389
have got a nice developed thriving root

2150
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:52,860
system to work with now if most of those

2151
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:54,390
things are accurate we've got a nice

2152
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:56,130
healthy plant that is growing it's

2153
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:57,930
branching it looks healthy its thriving

2154
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:59,970
it's not struggling and we've got a nice

2155
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:01,890
healthy root system it is time to

2156
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:04,440
transplant our small plants into our

2157
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:06,360
larger pot our finishing pot and start

2158
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:08,309
the large veg phase now these plants

2159
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:10,049
will probably finish out in these pots

2160
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:12,300
unless you want to transplant one more

2161
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:14,460
time into an even larger pot I like to

2162
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:16,829
go from the small pot into my finishing

2163
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:19,710
pot I'm generally going to go into a 3

2164
01:17:16,829 --> 01:17:21,779
gallon or a 5 gallon or a 7 gallon in an

2165
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:24,029
indoor garden you guys may choose to go

2166
01:17:21,779 --> 01:17:26,880
larger you may want to go from the small

2167
01:17:24,029 --> 01:17:28,979
6 Internet pot maybe to a 1 gallon then

2168
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,449
maybe into your 20 or 30 gallon if

2169
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:33,089
you're gonna do something like that I

2170
01:17:30,449 --> 01:17:34,649
talked in a previous episode about why

2171
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:36,720
it's a good idea to use a smaller

2172
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:39,119
container for smaller plants we don't

2173
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:41,010
need to water this giant area when we've

2174
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:42,569
got a tiny plant right in the middle so

2175
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:44,369
if you're gonna go to like a 20 or 30

2176
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:46,590
gallon pot you may want to go from the

2177
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:48,899
cup to maybe a 1 gallon maybe a 3 gallon

2178
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:51,360
bin later on transplant that into your

2179
01:17:48,899 --> 01:17:52,889
20 or 30 but it gets challenging when

2180
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:54,149
you go to transplant larger plants if

2181
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:55,590
you're not experienced with it

2182
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:56,339
you can cause damage you need to lay

2183
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:58,409
that larger

2184
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:00,840
on its side you need to remove that pot

2185
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:02,729
Benini Department a much larger plant it

2186
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,470
does get difficult but I have faith in

2187
01:18:02,729 --> 01:18:06,959
you that you can do it if you choose to

2188
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:08,220
transplant twice just be careful in this

2189
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,930
lesson we're gonna focus on

2190
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,640
transplanting one time we're gonna go

2191
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:13,890
from this small beer cup or our four

2192
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,510
inch or our six inch net pot or maybe an

2193
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:18,329
eight inch pot and we're going to pot

2194
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:20,579
into a three or a five or a seven gallon

2195
01:18:18,329 --> 01:18:23,189
pot for my example alright let's talk a

2196
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:25,319
little bit about pots and soil I did a

2197
01:18:23,189 --> 01:18:28,349
long episode about choosing pots and

2198
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:30,899
soil but let's do a brief recap I like

2199
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:33,030
to use the plastic nursery pots in a

2200
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:35,579
home grow in a commercial facility I

2201
01:18:33,029 --> 01:18:38,729
like to use a root pot one of the fabric

2202
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:41,369
pots in most applications I am using a

2203
01:18:38,729 --> 01:18:43,709
three gallon pot you can use whatever

2204
01:18:41,369 --> 01:18:46,170
kind of pots make you happy as long as

2205
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:48,449
it's going to get you to your goal the

2206
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:50,369
thing I find most important is to make

2207
01:18:48,449 --> 01:18:53,099
sure that whatever container you use

2208
01:18:50,369 --> 01:18:55,140
that it has plenty of holes for drainage

2209
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:57,420
make sure that when you water this plant

2210
01:18:55,140 --> 01:19:00,450
the excess water has some way to escape

2211
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:01,859
from the bottom of that pot the nursery

2212
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:02,489
pots have plenty of holes in them

2213
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:04,589
already

2214
01:19:02,489 --> 01:19:06,389
the fabric pots will drain naturally

2215
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:08,310
just because they're match those work

2216
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:10,200
perfectly if you're going to use a home

2217
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:12,630
depot bucket or something like that

2218
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:14,970
make sure you drill plenty of drainage

2219
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:17,789
holes in your container now let's talk

2220
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:19,740
briefly about soil or soilless mix you

2221
01:19:17,789 --> 01:19:22,019
don't have to buy a really expensive

2222
01:19:19,739 --> 01:19:24,929
soil if you're going to feed your plants

2223
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:26,520
with bottled nutrients you can buy an

2224
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:29,039
inert medium

2225
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:31,590
you don't need a soil or soilless mix

2226
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:33,600
with a lot of nutrients any lot of stuff

2227
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:35,130
in there you're going to be on top of

2228
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,200
fertilizing these plants with your

2229
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:39,569
bottled nutrient so we don't need to pay

2230
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:41,250
extra money for a soil or a soilless mix

2231
01:19:39,569 --> 01:19:43,409
it's got a bunch of stuff in there that

2232
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:45,060
will give us the opportunity to burn our

2233
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:47,340
plants because we are going to add them

2234
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,570
to a soil that's got nutrients in it

2235
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:50,730
then we're going to add bottled

2236
01:19:48,569 --> 01:19:52,739
nutrients on top of that we do run the

2237
01:19:50,729 --> 01:19:54,989
risk of over fertilizing the plants in

2238
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:57,659
that situation so we don't really need

2239
01:19:54,989 --> 01:19:59,550
an over fertilized soil or soilless mix

2240
01:19:57,659 --> 01:20:01,079
we need something more inert maybe

2241
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:03,000
something with some mykos or some

2242
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:04,890
beneficial fungus in there that would be

2243
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,649
advantageous but we don't really need a

2244
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:09,360
lot of nutrients whatever medium you

2245
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:11,819
choose to purchase I reckon

2246
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:13,979
you get something with a lot of aeration

2247
01:20:11,819 --> 01:20:15,960
in it either a lot of perlite or a lot

2248
01:20:13,979 --> 01:20:18,238
of personal light and if it doesn't come

2249
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:21,118
with plenty of aeration product already

2250
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:23,669
in it buy a bag of perlite and amend it

2251
01:20:21,118 --> 01:20:25,170
yourself now the amount of perlite or

2252
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:27,359
personal light you're going to need to

2253
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:30,149
add to your soil or soilless mix will

2254
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:32,250
depend on the fluffiness and the amount

2255
01:20:30,149 --> 01:20:33,509
of aeration in that medium when you

2256
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:35,219
purchase it I'm not sure what you're

2257
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:37,440
going to purchase so I'm not sure what

2258
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:39,989
to recommend as a ratio of how much

2259
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:42,868
perlite I like it fluffy when I'm

2260
01:20:39,988 --> 01:20:46,439
working with Coco I mix three bags of

2261
01:20:42,868 --> 01:20:49,109
cocoa and one 5-gallon bucket of perlite

2262
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:52,109
and one 5-gallon bucket of personal

2263
01:20:49,109 --> 01:20:53,969
light now that gives me about 25 to 33

2264
01:20:52,109 --> 01:20:56,399
gallon pots worth of material to work

2265
01:20:53,969 --> 01:20:58,710
with you guys can reduce that recipe as

2266
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:00,779
needed for your garden now if I were

2267
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:02,850
working with soil or a soilless mix I

2268
01:21:00,779 --> 01:21:05,340
might not use as much perlite I may

2269
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:07,650
reduce that perlite by about half you

2270
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:10,500
don't need in my opinion I don't need as

2271
01:21:07,649 --> 01:21:12,719
much aeration in soil and soilless mix

2272
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:15,090
as I do in the cocoa I feel like the

2273
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:17,730
cocoa holds a lot more water so it also

2274
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:19,289
pushes out a lot more air and it kind of

2275
01:21:17,729 --> 01:21:20,849
crushes the plants a little more it gets

2276
01:21:19,289 --> 01:21:22,769
heavier because it's got so much water

2277
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:24,630
in there the soil and soilless mix

2278
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:26,730
doesn't hold as much water so it doesn't

2279
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:28,829
get is heavy and it doesn't crush the

2280
01:21:26,729 --> 01:21:31,169
roots as much so you don't need as much

2281
01:21:28,829 --> 01:21:33,600
perlite maybe go half as much maybe if

2282
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:35,579
you're doing three bags of soil do half

2283
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,350
of a 5-gallon bucket of personal light

2284
01:21:35,579 --> 01:21:39,029
and a half of a 5-gallon bucket of

2285
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:40,770
perlite if you guys aren't going to buy

2286
01:21:39,029 --> 01:21:42,300
the personal I understand it's more

2287
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:44,550
expensive it's another product to buy

2288
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:46,529
you will get by with just using perlite

2289
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:48,090
perlite is just fine for this situation

2290
01:21:46,529 --> 01:21:50,488
if you only want to buy the one product

2291
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:53,010
that will be fine so three bags of soil

2292
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:55,138
and maybe one bag of perlite for this

2293
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:56,639
application and I know I work in larger

2294
01:21:55,139 --> 01:21:58,139
batches than a lot of people if you want

2295
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,239
to reduce this recipe for a smaller

2296
01:21:58,139 --> 01:22:03,539
garden I think they sell the bags of

2297
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,399
soil in 1.75 cubic yards is what I think

2298
01:22:03,539 --> 01:22:06,960
most of those bags if there are or at

2299
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:11,158
least the bags of cocoa I was buying her

2300
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:13,109
1.7 7 cubic yards if you buy a 1.7 7

2301
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:16,920
cubic yards of dirt makes that with a

2302
01:22:13,109 --> 01:22:18,509
third of a five-gallon bucket of perlite

2303
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,368
so just fill the bucket up about a third

2304
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:22,770
maybe half way if you want to go hard

2305
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:23,130
then mix that in really well with your

2306
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:25,260
soil

2307
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:26,789
so that it's nicely even evenly mixed in

2308
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,960
there with everything else so that you

2309
01:22:26,789 --> 01:22:29,429
just see the little white spots

2310
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,170
everywhere then you know you've got

2311
01:22:29,429 --> 01:22:33,420
plenty of aeration throughout your

2312
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:36,000
entire root zone now while we're mixing

2313
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:38,880
up perlite into our soil why not mix in

2314
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,698
some sort of root inoculant powder in a

2315
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,500
previous episode I talked all about

2316
01:22:40,698 --> 01:22:46,138
Michel Raizel fungi let's add a

2317
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:48,149
mycorrhizae product to our mix right now

2318
01:22:46,139 --> 01:22:49,920
and get it distributed all throughout

2319
01:22:48,149 --> 01:22:52,500
the soil something like the great white

2320
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,480
granulars would work perfectly you can

2321
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:56,100
use great white shark on its own just

2322
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:58,859
sprinkle it in there right now you can

2323
01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:00,960
use plus life right now any sort of

2324
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:03,179
powdered myko product would work

2325
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:05,698
wonderfully right now sprinkle it right

2326
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:07,199
into the dirt as you're mixing it up so

2327
01:23:05,698 --> 01:23:09,149
I feel like that's a great way to segue

2328
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:11,939
into actually starting to do the

2329
01:23:09,149 --> 01:23:14,069
transplanting process we've got healthy

2330
01:23:11,939 --> 01:23:16,469
plants we've got a container we've got a

2331
01:23:14,069 --> 01:23:18,960
good soil or soilless mix it's well

2332
01:23:16,469 --> 01:23:20,908
aerated we've put a myko product in

2333
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,789
there now let's actually get to work

2334
01:23:20,908 --> 01:23:25,920
step number one you guys is always find

2335
01:23:23,789 --> 01:23:28,019
the Bluetooth speaker and put on the

2336
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,000
growth from your heart podcast it helps

2337
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:31,949
you grow it makes the plants happy and

2338
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,260
it puts you in a good mood to create a

2339
01:23:31,948 --> 01:23:36,479
positive garden environment so step

2340
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:38,550
number one find the Bluetooth speaker or

2341
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:40,138
find your earbuds get your earbuds in

2342
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:41,850
get hooked up with the growth from your

2343
01:23:40,139 --> 01:23:45,389
heart podcast that is going to make your

2344
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:47,070
garden grow so much more rapidly it's

2345
01:23:45,389 --> 01:23:48,569
gonna make you grow more rapidly it's

2346
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:50,399
gonna make everything go better so step

2347
01:23:48,569 --> 01:23:52,198
number one find the growth from your

2348
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:53,969
heart podcast get it at an acceptable

2349
01:23:52,198 --> 01:23:56,399
volume and get that going in the growth

2350
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:58,859
step number two get some rubber gloves I

2351
01:23:56,399 --> 01:24:01,170
often overlook this step we should

2352
01:23:58,859 --> 01:24:03,329
always be wearing gloves if we're coming

2353
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:05,100
in contact with mykos if we're coming in

2354
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:06,929
contact with the roots if we're coming

2355
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:09,300
in contact with bottled nutrients we

2356
01:24:06,929 --> 01:24:11,158
should be wearing gloves also if you're

2357
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:12,690
gonna be sprinkling those myko products

2358
01:24:11,158 --> 01:24:14,638
over your topsoil just all willy-nilly

2359
01:24:12,689 --> 01:24:16,589
maybe you might want to consider some

2360
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:19,260
sort of a mask we don't really want to

2361
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:21,029
breathe in microbe products so we've got

2362
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:22,409
the pod cast on we're gloved up we've

2363
01:24:21,029 --> 01:24:24,630
got a face mask on you got your

2364
01:24:22,408 --> 01:24:26,579
dreadlocks tied up hopefully your nicely

2365
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:28,500
medicated if that's appropriate wherever

2366
01:24:26,579 --> 01:24:30,510
you work or whatever you're growing now

2367
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:32,670
let's actually get to business here we

2368
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:34,800
need to fill our container whatever size

2369
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:35,960
container we chose we need to fill it

2370
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,850
with our well

2371
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:39,890
next medium we've got our soilless mix

2372
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:41,780
we've got our cocoa hopefully we've got

2373
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:43,789
a bunch of perlite in there hopefully we

2374
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:45,109
added a myko product to there we've got

2375
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:47,510
it all mixed up now it's ready to go

2376
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:49,339
into a container I like to fill my

2377
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:51,560
containers by using a smaller container

2378
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:53,300
just a scoop dirt out of the bag or

2379
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,800
whatever container it's in and just dump

2380
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:57,350
it right into the pot that it's going

2381
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,180
into just fill it up fill it up most of

2382
01:24:57,350 --> 01:25:00,770
the way if you're filling up a three

2383
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:02,750
gallon five-gallon or seven gallon pot

2384
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:05,540
fill it up most of the way believe

2385
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:07,880
yourself about an inch and a half or

2386
01:25:05,539 --> 01:25:10,039
maybe two inches at the top or you don't

2387
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:12,469
fill it all the way up all the way to

2388
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:14,029
the brim leave yourself about inch and a

2389
01:25:12,469 --> 01:25:16,579
half two inches so that when we water

2390
01:25:14,029 --> 01:25:17,929
we've got some room to put water in the

2391
01:25:16,579 --> 01:25:19,699
pot you don't want to pour water on the

2392
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:21,110
pot and watch it run right off the top

2393
01:25:19,699 --> 01:25:23,090
you don't want to have to stand there

2394
01:25:21,109 --> 01:25:24,439
and pour water really slowly to where

2395
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:26,600
you can get that whole quarter or half

2396
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:28,339
or gallon of water into the pot so you

2397
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,320
can water it appropriately I like to be

2398
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:31,940
able to just splash a gallon of water on

2399
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:34,279
top of a seven gallon pot and just watch

2400
01:25:31,939 --> 01:25:35,449
it saturate that whole top area and then

2401
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:38,238
you can just walk away and do the next

2402
01:25:35,449 --> 01:25:39,349
pot if you fill it up too far you got to

2403
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:41,179
just stand there and pour it slowly

2404
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:42,800
toward the water saturates into the

2405
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:44,900
medium and drains down a little bit then

2406
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,119
you can pour a little more leave

2407
01:25:44,899 --> 01:25:49,488
yourself some space also in the future

2408
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:51,199
we may choose to top dress these plants

2409
01:25:49,488 --> 01:25:53,269
we may want to add some worm castings

2410
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:55,219
you may want to add some bat guano you

2411
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:57,140
may just add some fresh soil with some

2412
01:25:55,219 --> 01:25:59,270
charged up nutrients in it to the top

2413
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:01,010
layer so leave yourself in the room so

2414
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:03,500
that you've got options and you've got

2415
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:05,390
watering space now as you are filling

2416
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:07,399
your container pack your medium in there

2417
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:09,410
slightly tight you don't want it packed

2418
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:11,599
real snug but you don't want it fluffy

2419
01:26:09,409 --> 01:26:13,699
and loops we want to make the roots work

2420
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,440
to dig down into the dirt and have some

2421
01:26:13,699 --> 01:26:17,329
more to grow and kind of do a little

2422
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:19,099
exercise to get in there but we also

2423
01:26:17,329 --> 01:26:20,930
don't want to suffocate them and make it

2424
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:23,120
so hard that the roots simply can't grow

2425
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:25,610
into the medium so you have to pack it a

2426
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:27,890
little bit but don't crush it so tight

2427
01:26:25,609 --> 01:26:29,569
to where the roots can't even grow now

2428
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:31,280
if you packed it too loosely you will

2429
01:26:29,569 --> 01:26:32,750
notice on the first couple of waterings

2430
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:34,219
you'll just get a giant hole in the

2431
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,569
center all the dirt will just cave in

2432
01:26:34,219 --> 01:26:36,949
you'll create a hole in the middle

2433
01:26:35,569 --> 01:26:38,569
and then you'll have to repack it put

2434
01:26:36,949 --> 01:26:39,439
more dirt in there then rhe water it

2435
01:26:38,569 --> 01:26:41,090
that's okay

2436
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:42,649
you didn't mess up you just should have

2437
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:45,110
gone a little harder in the first place

2438
01:26:42,649 --> 01:26:46,789
you will learn if you go too hard the

2439
01:26:45,109 --> 01:26:48,380
roots just aren't gonna grow if you go

2440
01:26:46,789 --> 01:26:49,430
too soft the water is just gonna fall

2441
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:51,739
right through and you

2442
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:54,079
we'll definitely get indicators so fill

2443
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:55,609
your container pack it slightly tight I

2444
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:57,350
usually just use the palm of my hand and

2445
01:26:55,609 --> 01:26:59,029
I give it just a few Pat's I throw in

2446
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:00,470
just a few scoops of dirt just to give

2447
01:26:59,029 --> 01:27:01,939
myself a few inches of dirt and then I

2448
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:03,470
just Pat it in and then I throw in some

2449
01:27:01,939 --> 01:27:04,609
order and then I just Pat it in you can

2450
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:06,199
hear me just happen on the table here

2451
01:27:04,609 --> 01:27:08,119
it's not that hard just patting it down

2452
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:09,710
just getting the dirt nice and even in

2453
01:27:08,119 --> 01:27:11,689
there then I just pour more dirt on top

2454
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:13,039
of it just Pat it down I'd rather pour

2455
01:27:11,689 --> 01:27:14,750
some in and then pack it down and then

2456
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:16,250
pour some in and pack it down instead of

2457
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:18,050
fill it up and then try to pack all that

2458
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:20,210
down I feel like that's kind of it's not

2459
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:22,100
really as productive as packing each

2460
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:23,689
little layer so pour some dirt in there

2461
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:25,430
pack it down pour some dirt pack it down

2462
01:27:23,689 --> 01:27:27,919
get yourself up to about an inch and a

2463
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:30,560
half or two inches to the top now here's

2464
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,930
where it gets fun we have got our three

2465
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,060
our five or seven gallon pot filled with

2466
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:37,070
our appropriate mix and it is leveled

2467
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:38,780
off and we've got about an inch and a

2468
01:27:37,069 --> 01:27:40,729
half or two inches of space so that we

2469
01:27:38,779 --> 01:27:42,829
can add water or top dress later in the

2470
01:27:40,729 --> 01:27:45,709
future now in the very center of that

2471
01:27:42,829 --> 01:27:47,840
pot we need to create a space for our

2472
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:50,359
transplanted plant we need to create a

2473
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:52,970
little hole in which to place our small

2474
01:27:50,359 --> 01:27:55,039
root ball the way I like to do it is

2475
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:57,140
find the middle that top soil and just

2476
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:59,000
dig out about a fist-sized worth of dirt

2477
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:00,619
just take out about just a fist I've got

2478
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,939
a pretty big fist so just take out about

2479
01:28:00,619 --> 01:28:04,309
a fist-sized worth of dirt right in the

2480
01:28:01,939 --> 01:28:07,729
center of that top soil then whatever

2481
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:09,620
size pot my plant is already in say I'm

2482
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:11,929
in a beer cup or maybe I'm in a six-inch

2483
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:14,659
net pot I will take a beer cup or a

2484
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:17,180
six-inch net pot and I will dig a hole

2485
01:28:14,659 --> 01:28:18,920
in my new pot soil right at the top

2486
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:21,140
right in the center and I will actually

2487
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:23,329
plant the cup in that hole I will dig a

2488
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:25,700
hole perfectly to where that cup will

2489
01:28:23,329 --> 01:28:29,149
fit then it will backfill dirt around

2490
01:28:25,699 --> 01:28:31,550
that cup kind of snug then I will pull

2491
01:28:29,149 --> 01:28:33,889
the cup or the six-inch net pot out of

2492
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:36,980
that made hole now I have got a perfect

2493
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:39,170
template that is the exact shape of the

2494
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:39,739
incoming root ball from my small veg

2495
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:42,050
plant

2496
01:28:39,739 --> 01:28:44,929
so I basically leveled off the dirt I

2497
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:47,090
dug out a hole I put the previous pot in

2498
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:49,100
that hole I back filled it then I just

2499
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:51,440
pulled that pot right out so I made an

2500
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:53,840
impression a template just a little gap

2501
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:55,579
for the next plant to fit perfectly into

2502
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,829
so you've got a top layer of soil with

2503
01:28:55,579 --> 01:28:59,420
this little round hole perfectly waiting

2504
01:28:57,829 --> 01:29:02,510
just chill and wait for a pot to go in

2505
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:03,380
it now our next step is to pot our small

2506
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:06,320
veg plant

2507
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:07,850
into that hole but before we do that you

2508
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:10,309
know what I'm gonna recommend let's

2509
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:12,770
sprinkle a little mica powder right into

2510
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:14,659
that hole our fresh exposed roots are

2511
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:16,460
gonna go right there let's just sprinkle

2512
01:29:14,658 --> 01:29:18,289
some mica powder right there let's just

2513
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:19,100
give it some love give it a boost give

2514
01:29:18,289 --> 01:29:20,869
it a head start

2515
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:22,789
that's just like laying out some cookies

2516
01:29:20,869 --> 01:29:24,198
for Santa just get it nice and ready put

2517
01:29:22,789 --> 01:29:26,539
some micro powder right in the hole

2518
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:29,988
now our next challenge will be to get

2519
01:29:26,539 --> 01:29:32,719
the small plant out of that small pot

2520
01:29:29,988 --> 01:29:34,729
hopefully it is grown really tight into

2521
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:37,010
your beer Cup or really tight into your

2522
01:29:34,729 --> 01:29:39,079
six-inch net pot it is nicely rootbound

2523
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:40,460
there's a lot of root mass in that

2524
01:29:39,079 --> 01:29:43,460
container so it's gonna take a little

2525
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:47,270
effort to get it out the way I do it as

2526
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:48,800
I make a Spock hand I've got my first

2527
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:50,420
finger in my middle finger together I've

2528
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,000
got my ring finger and my pinky finger

2529
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:55,730
together I place the stick of the plant

2530
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,630
between in between my middle finger and

2531
01:29:55,729 --> 01:30:02,388
my ring finger sticking up the root ball

2532
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:04,250
the soil is in my palm then I flip it

2533
01:30:02,389 --> 01:30:06,020
upside down so now the plant is hanging

2534
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:08,270
upside down and I'm holding on to the

2535
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:10,280
root ball with my Spock hand I'll take

2536
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:11,510
my I do that in my left hand cuz it did

2537
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:13,189
I don't need as much coordination it can

2538
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:15,739
just stay there then I take my right

2539
01:30:13,189 --> 01:30:17,658
hand and I kind of just squeeze the cup

2540
01:30:15,738 --> 01:30:19,339
or the beer or the beer cup or the

2541
01:30:17,658 --> 01:30:21,289
six-inch net pot just squeeze it all

2542
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:23,179
around just squeeze it

2543
01:30:21,289 --> 01:30:24,529
if you've ever rolled a joint too tight

2544
01:30:23,179 --> 01:30:25,940
and you're trying to loosen the joint

2545
01:30:24,529 --> 01:30:28,219
it's the same idea we're just trying to

2546
01:30:25,939 --> 01:30:30,408
loosen the dirt out of that cup so just

2547
01:30:28,219 --> 01:30:31,279
squeeze all around it just squeeze it

2548
01:30:30,408 --> 01:30:32,539
that's all you really got to do and

2549
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:34,189
you'll feel it loosening up maybe

2550
01:30:32,539 --> 01:30:35,929
squeeze it and work it to the left and

2551
01:30:34,189 --> 01:30:37,399
right just a little bit you'll feel how

2552
01:30:35,929 --> 01:30:38,539
to loosen the dirt inside of that pot

2553
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:39,920
once you start doing it all you're

2554
01:30:38,539 --> 01:30:41,750
trying to do is loosen the dirt so that

2555
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,949
it will fall out give it a little shake

2556
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:45,800
and it's gonna fall out you're gonna

2557
01:30:42,948 --> 01:30:47,119
have an exposed root zone in your hand

2558
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:49,340
now it's okay

2559
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:51,019
hopefully when it came out it all stayed

2560
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:52,100
together in one big chunk hopefully

2561
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:53,810
you've taken good care of it you've

2562
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:55,130
properly watered it you've given a

2563
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:57,080
proper dry time and the roots have

2564
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:59,179
developed nice and fat in there so it's

2565
01:30:57,079 --> 01:31:01,069
all just one chunk if it came out as a

2566
01:30:59,179 --> 01:31:02,869
mess that's okay we're just gonna pop

2567
01:31:01,069 --> 01:31:04,960
that whole mess into that hole that we

2568
01:31:02,869 --> 01:31:08,750
already made and it will be just fine

2569
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:10,399
once you get the root ball out of the

2570
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:13,069
container you already know what I'm

2571
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:13,759
gonna say sprinkle a little mykos on it

2572
01:31:13,069 --> 01:31:16,130
why not

2573
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,179
we've got exposed roots those roots love

2574
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:18,889
mykos those

2575
01:31:17,179 --> 01:31:20,929
those are activated by touching roots

2576
01:31:18,889 --> 01:31:22,519
sprinkle them on there give it as much

2577
01:31:20,929 --> 01:31:24,229
mica powder as you can afford to

2578
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:25,849
sprinkle on there at this time just give

2579
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:29,179
it a nice little coating just in fact it

2580
01:31:25,849 --> 01:31:31,069
was brute an ocular outer van we want to

2581
01:31:29,179 --> 01:31:33,050
if it came out in a mess

2582
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:35,179
you need to gently place it in that hole

2583
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:37,639
get as much of that original dirt as you

2584
01:31:35,179 --> 01:31:39,679
can in there set the root ball down put

2585
01:31:37,639 --> 01:31:41,840
some soap maybe put the if there are

2586
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:43,458
dangling long roots set the dangling

2587
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,170
roots in there put a little dirt on top

2588
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:46,938
of it loader the plant in a little bar

2589
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:48,679
put some dirt on top of it lower it in a

2590
01:31:46,939 --> 01:31:50,179
little bit more so that you don't bind

2591
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:51,739
to those roots up we're trying to give

2592
01:31:50,179 --> 01:31:54,078
those roots space we don't want to just

2593
01:31:51,738 --> 01:31:55,399
drop them right in there and smother

2594
01:31:54,078 --> 01:31:57,139
them with fresh dirt so if they came

2595
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:59,328
apart keep them apart when you're

2596
01:31:57,139 --> 01:32:00,529
putting them in there then backfill it

2597
01:31:59,328 --> 01:32:02,719
with all the dirt from that container

2598
01:32:00,529 --> 01:32:05,059
and you should have enough dirt there to

2599
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:06,948
level everything off if you lost some

2600
01:32:05,059 --> 01:32:08,599
dirt during the movement just grab some

2601
01:32:06,948 --> 01:32:10,669
more dirt out of your mix and just top

2602
01:32:08,599 --> 01:32:12,498
it or you have a nice even layer kind of

2603
01:32:10,670 --> 01:32:14,179
pack it in not super tight just tight

2604
01:32:12,498 --> 01:32:16,609
enough to keep that plant staying

2605
01:32:14,179 --> 01:32:19,279
straight upright now if it came out nice

2606
01:32:16,609 --> 01:32:22,578
and smooth now we've got another option

2607
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:24,708
if it came out nice and smooth and you

2608
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:26,149
feel like those roots are perfect and

2609
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:28,158
they aren't super bound but they're

2610
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:30,379
growing well you can just set still

2611
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:32,658
sprinkle some Aiko's on it then you can

2612
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:34,429
set that perfect root ball right into

2613
01:32:32,658 --> 01:32:35,929
that perfect hole maybe sprinkle a

2614
01:32:34,429 --> 01:32:37,729
little bit of dirt on top of it and Pat

2615
01:32:35,929 --> 01:32:39,559
it in and you've got a beautifully

2616
01:32:37,729 --> 01:32:42,079
transplanted plant it didn't get any

2617
01:32:39,559 --> 01:32:44,239
shock or any stress whatsoever during

2618
01:32:42,078 --> 01:32:46,458
the transplanting process our other

2619
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:48,708
option when you take it out of the small

2620
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:50,538
container if it is really bound up in

2621
01:32:48,708 --> 01:32:52,849
there if you see a lot of white roots

2622
01:32:50,538 --> 01:32:54,920
and it is growing in a circle and it's

2623
01:32:52,849 --> 01:32:57,739
getting spiraled you do have the option

2624
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:59,658
to kind of break those roots up just a

2625
01:32:57,738 --> 01:33:01,428
little bit the way I do it is I hold it

2626
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:03,259
with my left hand and I take my middle

2627
01:33:01,429 --> 01:33:05,059
finger and my ring finger on my right

2628
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:07,340
hand and I come straight up from the

2629
01:33:05,059 --> 01:33:08,809
bottom of that root ball and I just plow

2630
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:10,670
my fingers through it and just pull it

2631
01:33:08,809 --> 01:33:12,380
apart just spread it right in half

2632
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:14,538
you're gonna tear some roots up you're

2633
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:16,429
gonna mess some stuff up if you've got a

2634
01:33:14,538 --> 01:33:18,349
nice healthy root system that is only

2635
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:20,389
going to encourage growth you're

2636
01:33:18,349 --> 01:33:21,889
spreading it out a little bit then when

2637
01:33:20,389 --> 01:33:23,569
you set it in that template hole that

2638
01:33:21,889 --> 01:33:25,099
you've got the roots will spread out a

2639
01:33:23,569 --> 01:33:26,958
little bit and instead of drawing in a

2640
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:29,208
perfect spiral they're gonna take off a

2641
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:30,920
little bit for you and fill that pot so

2642
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:32,869
either way

2643
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:34,489
my cows on the roots on that root ball

2644
01:33:32,869 --> 01:33:36,500
that you pull out of the pot sprinkle

2645
01:33:34,488 --> 01:33:39,139
mykos on there always sprinkle some

2646
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:41,270
Aiko's into the hole then gently place

2647
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:43,340
that small root ball into that fresh

2648
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:46,040
hole and just cover it with dirt gently

2649
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:47,690
again don't pack it down too tightly but

2650
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:49,399
pack it down tight enough tore you know

2651
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:51,049
it's not gonna cave in when we water it

2652
01:33:49,399 --> 01:33:53,569
and then it's tight enough to give that

2653
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:55,730
plant enough support to stay upright you

2654
01:33:53,569 --> 01:33:57,829
will know on the first watering if you

2655
01:33:55,729 --> 01:33:59,269
did not do it tightly enough if you

2656
01:33:57,829 --> 01:34:02,119
didn't do it tight enough you're just

2657
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:03,980
gonna need to add more media now that

2658
01:34:02,119 --> 01:34:06,140
plan is basically transplanted I

2659
01:34:03,979 --> 01:34:09,049
recommend you label that plant at this

2660
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:11,179
time before you forget the next step is

2661
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:13,520
to move that plant under the appropriate

2662
01:34:11,179 --> 01:34:15,710
light I should also mention you may need

2663
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,270
a saucer or some sort of a catch tray

2664
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:18,649
underneath your plants when we water

2665
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:20,540
these plants we expect to have some

2666
01:34:18,649 --> 01:34:22,579
runoff so now it was a good time to

2667
01:34:20,539 --> 01:34:24,829
consider placing your plant on a saucer

2668
01:34:22,579 --> 01:34:26,659
or some sort of a catch tray so we've

2669
01:34:24,829 --> 01:34:28,340
got the trays down let's talk about the

2670
01:34:26,659 --> 01:34:31,279
lighting in which we are going to place

2671
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:33,560
these plants under you can use tee fives

2672
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:34,369
for your fresh transplants you can get

2673
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,980
the tee fives

2674
01:34:34,369 --> 01:34:39,050
really close you can get those t5 lights

2675
01:34:36,979 --> 01:34:41,269
three maybe four inches away from your

2676
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:43,190
canopy just make sure that you adjust

2677
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:44,989
them every day because the plants are

2678
01:34:43,189 --> 01:34:46,579
going to grow rapidly and they will grow

2679
01:34:44,988 --> 01:34:49,609
into those lights if you don't pay

2680
01:34:46,579 --> 01:34:51,800
attention you can also use ceramic metal

2681
01:34:49,609 --> 01:34:54,559
halide for your fresh transplants I like

2682
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:56,510
the 315 s or the 630 s you need to keep

2683
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,489
those a little bit further away than the

2684
01:34:56,510 --> 01:35:02,869
t5 is probably about a foot maybe 18

2685
01:34:58,488 --> 01:35:05,959
inches away led's are very brand and

2686
01:35:02,869 --> 01:35:08,210
power specific I would follow the

2687
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:10,819
recommendation from the manufacturer on

2688
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:13,010
your LED I don't have enough experience

2689
01:35:10,819 --> 01:35:14,569
with your LED to know what it's going to

2690
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:16,400
do to the plants there are so many

2691
01:35:14,569 --> 01:35:18,799
vendors so many different makes and

2692
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:21,379
models that it is hard to give advice

2693
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:24,500
for LED lighting but you certainly can

2694
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:26,119
use LEDs through the entire cycle and

2695
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:28,698
you can absolutely use them right now

2696
01:35:26,119 --> 01:35:31,069
for your fresh transplants you can also

2697
01:35:28,698 --> 01:35:33,289
use metal halide or high pressure sodium

2698
01:35:31,069 --> 01:35:35,779
also known as high-intensity discharge

2699
01:35:33,289 --> 01:35:37,789
lighting if you are going to use

2700
01:35:35,779 --> 01:35:39,619
high-intensity discharge lighting pay

2701
01:35:37,789 --> 01:35:42,439
close attention to how the plants are

2702
01:35:39,619 --> 01:35:44,899
reacting if you're using a 400 you can

2703
01:35:42,439 --> 01:35:47,089
probably get 12 to 18 inches away

2704
01:35:44,899 --> 01:35:49,729
and not have any problems if you were

2705
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:51,980
using a 600 you could probably get 18

2706
01:35:49,729 --> 01:35:53,929
inches away and not have any problems if

2707
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:55,879
you're using a thousand watt light you

2708
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:58,250
may want to start off about two feet

2709
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:01,010
away from the canopy maybe even more as

2710
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:02,899
you start introducing these plants to

2711
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:04,850
that larger light as time goes on you

2712
01:36:02,899 --> 01:36:06,739
can get closer they will grow closer to

2713
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:09,350
the light but when you were introducing

2714
01:36:06,739 --> 01:36:11,300
young plants to large lights pay

2715
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:12,770
attention to how they react we don't

2716
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:14,300
want to burn these lights we don't want

2717
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:15,770
to stress them I said lights we don't

2718
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:17,029
want to burn the plants we don't want to

2719
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,830
stress the plants we don't want to put

2720
01:36:17,029 --> 01:36:20,300
them into any kind of shock right as we

2721
01:36:18,829 --> 01:36:22,250
transplant them this is a critical time

2722
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:23,600
we were trying to put them into turbo

2723
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:25,220
mode right now we don't want to slow

2724
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:26,990
them down we don't want to punish them

2725
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:28,699
and put them on timeout we want to give

2726
01:36:26,989 --> 01:36:30,380
them encouragement to take off right now

2727
01:36:28,699 --> 01:36:32,269
so we have our plants under the

2728
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:34,190
appropriate light we've got our light

2729
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:36,560
the appropriate distance away from our

2730
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:39,049
canopy let's talk about the amount of

2731
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,880
light hours we are going to give these

2732
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:43,250
plants I've talked earlier about

2733
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,470
lighting schedules and apparently in a

2734
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:48,140
previous episode I did make a mistake at

2735
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:49,730
some point I said something about 18 on

2736
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:51,800
and 16 off or something like that

2737
01:36:49,729 --> 01:36:54,349
somebody said your light cycle will

2738
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:56,600
always add up to 24 hours if my light

2739
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:59,180
cycle I said didn't add up to 24 hours I

2740
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:02,120
was too high to be doing a podcast and I

2741
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:03,590
do apologize honestly when you talk as

2742
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:06,019
much as I do I think you're gonna make a

2743
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:07,909
few mistakes and I encourage you guys to

2744
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:09,140
let me know when I make a mistake so

2745
01:37:07,909 --> 01:37:11,269
that I can't correct it and I do

2746
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:13,880
apologize somebody said I did make a

2747
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:16,370
light cycle mistake I apologize for that

2748
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:19,520
allow me to correct myself in this part

2749
01:37:16,369 --> 01:37:22,609
there are several cycles that work very

2750
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:25,460
well for our veg plants one common cycle

2751
01:37:22,609 --> 01:37:28,009
is 24 hours on and zero hours off I

2752
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:30,199
mainly recommend this if you have mother

2753
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:33,140
plants they tend to auto flower on you

2754
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:36,289
or when you were cutting clones our next

2755
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:38,210
option is 20 hours on and 4 hours off I

2756
01:37:36,289 --> 01:37:40,640
like to give the plants a few hours to

2757
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:42,710
sleep this also gives my equipment 4

2758
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:45,530
hours to rest when you're running a

2759
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:47,930
bedroom with 25 lights that is a hundred

2760
01:37:45,529 --> 01:37:49,579
hours of lights that you don't have to

2761
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:51,380
run that's a lot of electricity that you

2762
01:37:49,579 --> 01:37:53,840
save you're also not paying for as much

2763
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:56,900
cooling and humidity control it makes a

2764
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,449
big difference so the 20 on and 4 off is

2765
01:37:56,899 --> 01:38:00,279
good for your equipment all

2766
01:37:58,449 --> 01:38:02,800
so the plants get to take a nap who

2767
01:38:00,279 --> 01:38:04,809
doesn't want to take a nap I feel like

2768
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,880
the roots do a lot of activity in the

2769
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:09,039
dark cycle I feel like the plants grow a

2770
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:12,130
lot in the dark cycle sugars are

2771
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:14,949
processed in the dark cycle so 20 on 4

2772
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:16,600
off is great that will make any plants

2773
01:38:14,949 --> 01:38:18,789
that may want to Otto flower and a

2774
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:20,920
lesser cycle that will prevent them from

2775
01:38:18,789 --> 01:38:23,170
autoflowering and it will also give you

2776
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:25,840
maximum growth and will keep your mother

2777
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:26,739
plants really happy another very common

2778
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:30,550
veg

2779
01:38:26,739 --> 01:38:33,429
on and 6 off this is very common because

2780
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:34,989
it very closely mimics the outdoor cycle

2781
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:39,520
of the natural light

2782
01:38:34,989 --> 01:38:41,710
another option is 16 on and 8 off this

2783
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:43,750
is very similar to outdoors as well the

2784
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:47,710
reason people will adjust between the 16

2785
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:49,989
and 8 and the 18 and 6 is because some

2786
01:38:47,710 --> 01:38:53,289
plants will try to flower on their own

2787
01:38:49,989 --> 01:38:55,569
with the 16 hours of daylight once they

2788
01:38:53,289 --> 01:38:57,909
get large enough and once they get root

2789
01:38:55,569 --> 01:39:00,670
bound also I feel like more light is

2790
01:38:57,909 --> 01:39:03,550
more energy light is the number one

2791
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:06,909
desired source of energy and nutrient

2792
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:08,560
for our plants so why not maximize the

2793
01:39:06,909 --> 01:39:10,659
light input of course some plants will

2794
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,430
only take so much light per day and

2795
01:39:10,659 --> 01:39:14,319
they'll just shut themselves down but I

2796
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:16,450
don't think you're going to overload

2797
01:39:14,319 --> 01:39:18,969
them with light in a small grow room

2798
01:39:16,449 --> 01:39:21,699
with a grow light so again our options

2799
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:23,500
are 24 hours on and 0 hours off I

2800
01:39:21,699 --> 01:39:26,139
wouldn't really recommend that for these

2801
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:28,569
large batch plants the next option is 20

2802
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:30,190
hours on and four hours off in a

2803
01:39:28,569 --> 01:39:32,979
commercial environment that is what I

2804
01:39:30,189 --> 01:39:35,619
would do in another environment you can

2805
01:39:32,979 --> 01:39:36,489
go 18 on and 6 off that is very

2806
01:39:35,619 --> 01:39:39,819
acceptable

2807
01:39:36,489 --> 01:39:42,130
another option is 16 on and 8 off that

2808
01:39:39,819 --> 01:39:45,099
is very acceptable another thing I found

2809
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:48,159
advantageous of the 20 on and 4 off is

2810
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:50,470
when I do induce that 1212 flowering

2811
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:53,109
cycle those plants really notice a

2812
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:55,539
change in photo period and they really

2813
01:39:53,109 --> 01:39:57,250
go into flower really quickly so that's

2814
01:39:55,539 --> 01:39:57,640
something that I found has helped quite

2815
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,979
a bit

2816
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:02,410
any of those light cycles will work for

2817
01:39:59,979 --> 01:40:03,250
your veg plant find what works best for

2818
01:40:02,409 --> 01:40:05,739
you

2819
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:07,449
you will find pros and cons to each of

2820
01:40:05,739 --> 01:40:10,149
those options based on your environment

2821
01:40:07,449 --> 01:40:12,670
your location your setup and your

2822
01:40:10,149 --> 01:40:14,619
overall grow you're going to have to

2823
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:17,020
things through trial and error when it

2824
01:40:14,619 --> 01:40:19,300
comes to growing try some things out see

2825
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:20,890
what works best for you and your plants

2826
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:23,440
ultimately it's going to come down to

2827
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:26,500
what works best for your plants they are

2828
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:28,629
the boss alright at this point our small

2829
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:31,060
veg plants have been up potted they are

2830
01:40:28,630 --> 01:40:32,739
now large veg plants we've got them in

2831
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:34,539
there forever pots we've got them

2832
01:40:32,739 --> 01:40:36,729
underneath a good light we have got that

2833
01:40:34,539 --> 01:40:39,189
light on a solid schedule we've got our

2834
01:40:36,729 --> 01:40:41,979
pots sitting on a saucer or some sort of

2835
01:40:39,189 --> 01:40:43,869
a catch tray it is now time to water our

2836
01:40:41,979 --> 01:40:46,209
new transplants

2837
01:40:43,869 --> 01:40:48,909
I recommend feeding these transplants

2838
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:50,739
with a strong vegetative nutrient if

2839
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:52,720
you've got a bottle that says veg that's

2840
01:40:50,739 --> 01:40:55,329
the one you need right now you need

2841
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:57,490
something with a good NPK ratio you need

2842
01:40:55,329 --> 01:41:00,909
more n then you do P and K you need a

2843
01:40:57,489 --> 01:41:03,099
high end ratio for this time also I

2844
01:41:00,909 --> 01:41:04,899
would recommend a Mico product if you

2845
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:07,300
haven't put plenty of powdered mykos in

2846
01:41:04,899 --> 01:41:09,399
there I recommend a micro Raizel fungal

2847
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:11,409
product that is in liquid form that you

2848
01:41:09,399 --> 01:41:14,769
can feed right in your nutrient solution

2849
01:41:11,409 --> 01:41:16,930
right now mix that in also a small dash

2850
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:19,360
of carbs a little bit of carbohydrates

2851
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:21,700
will help feed those mykos also it will

2852
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:23,799
give the plants a little bit of energy

2853
01:41:21,699 --> 01:41:25,449
I also recommend a little bit of cal-mag

2854
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:27,400
at this time the plants are big enough

2855
01:41:25,449 --> 01:41:29,590
to take cal-mag give them a little bit

2856
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:31,779
of a boost I would also recommend a

2857
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:33,579
little bit of enzymes at this time that

2858
01:41:31,779 --> 01:41:35,559
will speed everything up it'll help keep

2859
01:41:33,579 --> 01:41:36,939
the root zone nice and clean the micro

2860
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:38,380
products and the enzymes will work

2861
01:41:36,939 --> 01:41:39,309
together they will make a happy

2862
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:41,500
rhizosphere

2863
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:44,140
your plants will thrive you may also

2864
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:46,569
want to add a little bit of potassium

2865
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:49,270
silicates at this time potassium

2866
01:41:46,569 --> 01:41:51,279
silicates make for robust plants and it

2867
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:52,930
will also help with any stress if you

2868
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:55,000
have any environmental stressors that

2869
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:57,010
potassium silicon will make the plants

2870
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,779
just a little more resilient and a

2871
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:01,270
little tougher for the mistakes that you

2872
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:03,489
may make now I recommend you adjust the

2873
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:07,510
pH of your feed solution to somewhere

2874
01:42:03,489 --> 01:42:09,369
between 62 and 64 if we were in cocoa in

2875
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:12,670
a commercial facility I would tell the

2876
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:14,470
guys to adjust the pH to 63 if we were

2877
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:16,630
in a soilless mix in a commercial

2878
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:19,180
facility I would tell them to go six

2879
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:21,520
three two six four so mix up your

2880
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:23,619
nutrient solution put your pH meter in

2881
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:25,659
there see what the value is and adjust

2882
01:42:23,619 --> 01:42:28,059
up or down as necessary right

2883
01:42:25,658 --> 01:42:30,188
that down then water the plants with

2884
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:32,498
that solution since we're talking about

2885
01:42:30,189 --> 01:42:35,469
watering plants I highly recommend you

2886
01:42:32,498 --> 01:42:37,269
go back and take a listen to episode 337

2887
01:42:35,469 --> 01:42:39,819
which is titled one through five

2888
01:42:37,269 --> 01:42:42,159
watering tech one through five watering

2889
01:42:39,819 --> 01:42:44,018
tech will help all growers if you're a

2890
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:45,759
new grower if you're an experienced

2891
01:42:44,019 --> 01:42:47,708
grower if you're a professional grower

2892
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,229
you will learn something from the one

2893
01:42:47,708 --> 01:42:52,359
through five water tech episode if you

2894
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:54,400
are an experienced grower and you're

2895
01:42:52,359 --> 01:42:56,978
trying to teach a new grower how to

2896
01:42:54,399 --> 01:43:00,009
water your garden one through five water

2897
01:42:56,979 --> 01:43:02,909
tech is a great training exercise so I

2898
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:05,229
recommend everybody listen to episode

2899
01:43:02,908 --> 01:43:07,839
337 and learn about one through five

2900
01:43:05,229 --> 01:43:09,969
watering tech now before you water your

2901
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,069
plants we talked about the pH I did not

2902
01:43:09,969 --> 01:43:14,769
talk about the temperature of the water

2903
01:43:12,069 --> 01:43:16,599
it's winter time in Colorado and it is

2904
01:43:14,769 --> 01:43:18,458
really cold if you're pulling water

2905
01:43:16,599 --> 01:43:20,439
right out of the tap it's coming out of

2906
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:22,899
the tap way too cold to apply to the

2907
01:43:20,439 --> 01:43:25,439
plants we need the water that we feed

2908
01:43:22,899 --> 01:43:28,808
our plants to be right around 70 degrees

2909
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:31,389
maybe 65 would be acceptable but I

2910
01:43:28,809 --> 01:43:33,309
wouldn't go much lower than 65 imagine

2911
01:43:31,389 --> 01:43:35,439
sticking your feet and some 65 degree

2912
01:43:33,309 --> 01:43:37,090
water first thing in the morning that's

2913
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:39,489
what it's like when you water the plants

2914
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:41,439
with 65 degree water so I wouldn't go

2915
01:43:39,488 --> 01:43:44,498
any lower than 65 I would stay closer to

2916
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:46,780
70 maybe up in the 75 not much warmer

2917
01:43:44,498 --> 01:43:48,998
than that right around 70 degrees is

2918
01:43:46,779 --> 01:43:51,009
just about ideal for watering the plants

2919
01:43:48,998 --> 01:43:52,478
in a home grow you can always just turn

2920
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:54,668
the hot water on as you're filling up

2921
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:56,918
your container in some environments we

2922
01:43:54,668 --> 01:43:59,168
don't have the option for hot water if

2923
01:43:56,918 --> 01:44:01,090
your water is coming out too cold you

2924
01:43:59,168 --> 01:44:03,429
can either get a bucket heater from your

2925
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:05,078
local tractor or farm supply store they

2926
01:44:03,429 --> 01:44:06,639
just sell bucket heaters they also saw

2927
01:44:05,078 --> 01:44:08,259
them at the farm supply store for

2928
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:09,729
troughs so that you can warm up the pig

2929
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:12,070
and horse water so they don't have to

2930
01:44:09,729 --> 01:44:13,958
drink ice water in the morning or if a

2931
01:44:12,069 --> 01:44:15,488
bucket heater is not an option for you

2932
01:44:13,958 --> 01:44:17,109
you can always fill up containers of

2933
01:44:15,488 --> 01:44:18,968
water you can take them into the

2934
01:44:17,109 --> 01:44:21,130
flowering rooms or the bedrooms the day

2935
01:44:18,969 --> 01:44:22,868
before and let that light and that grow

2936
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:24,668
room environment warm up the water for

2937
01:44:22,868 --> 01:44:27,639
you of course that's only if you

2938
01:44:24,668 --> 01:44:29,529
remember to do that the day before so my

2939
01:44:27,639 --> 01:44:31,179
point is don't feed the plants water

2940
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:34,630
that is really cold we want that water

2941
01:44:31,179 --> 01:44:36,429
to be right around 70 degrees now in

2942
01:44:34,630 --> 01:44:38,529
this first watering make sure you really

2943
01:44:36,429 --> 01:44:39,578
saturate the medium make sure you have

2944
01:44:38,529 --> 01:44:41,439
plenty of water

2945
01:44:39,578 --> 01:44:44,049
coming out of those drainage holes we

2946
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:46,210
want to make sure to soak every spot of

2947
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:48,340
the container we don't want a dry spot

2948
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:50,380
because roots will not grow into dry

2949
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:52,659
areas nutrients aren't getting into

2950
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:55,059
those dry areas so make sure you fully

2951
01:44:52,658 --> 01:44:57,308
saturate the pot I like to soak it every

2952
01:44:55,059 --> 01:44:59,829
time I water but it's mostly important

2953
01:44:57,309 --> 01:45:01,710
this very first time water until you get

2954
01:44:59,828 --> 01:45:05,229
a lot of water coming out of those holes

2955
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:07,539
also don't leave the plant ever standing

2956
01:45:05,229 --> 01:45:08,859
in stagnant water if that water in the

2957
01:45:07,539 --> 01:45:10,840
bottom of your trailer doesn't

2958
01:45:08,859 --> 01:45:12,219
evaporates sucked up by that plant

2959
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:14,170
within a few hours

2960
01:45:12,219 --> 01:45:16,179
get a shot back and suck that out of

2961
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:18,130
there all right so now our plants are

2962
01:45:16,179 --> 01:45:19,929
all successfully transplanted they have

2963
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:21,429
now been fed they're big-kid nutrients

2964
01:45:19,929 --> 01:45:22,989
let's talk a little bit about the

2965
01:45:21,429 --> 01:45:24,429
environment in which to keep these

2966
01:45:22,988 --> 01:45:26,259
plants we know where to keep the lights

2967
01:45:24,429 --> 01:45:29,199
we know what cycled I have the lights on

2968
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:30,940
let's talk about the temperature during

2969
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:34,448
the day I try to keep the temperature

2970
01:45:30,939 --> 01:45:37,988
between 70 and 80 degrees then I try to

2971
01:45:34,448 --> 01:45:40,779
keep the night around 65 to 75 I really

2972
01:45:37,988 --> 01:45:43,479
try to have no more than a 10 degree

2973
01:45:40,779 --> 01:45:43,960
swing in my temperature between day and

2974
01:45:43,479 --> 01:45:46,598
night

2975
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:49,510
meaning if it's 70 during the day I want

2976
01:45:46,599 --> 01:45:51,279
it no lower than 60 during the night I

2977
01:45:49,510 --> 01:45:53,020
honestly try to keep about five to seven

2978
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:54,849
degrees in that swing I know it's

2979
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:56,290
difficult on a home grow sometimes we

2980
01:45:54,849 --> 01:45:57,880
don't have the appropriate equipment to

2981
01:45:56,289 --> 01:46:00,039
monitor and/or adjust things all the

2982
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:02,139
time but do your best to keep it within

2983
01:46:00,039 --> 01:46:04,689
a ten degree differential between night

2984
01:46:02,139 --> 01:46:06,550
and day now at this point in the large

2985
01:46:04,689 --> 01:46:10,328
veg phase I try to keep the humidity

2986
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:12,429
between 40 and 60% right around 50 is

2987
01:46:10,328 --> 01:46:14,408
ideal if you want to understand more

2988
01:46:12,429 --> 01:46:16,690
about why I keep the humidity and the

2989
01:46:14,408 --> 01:46:19,149
temperature the way I do I recommend you

2990
01:46:16,689 --> 01:46:21,250
check out episode 314 and it's called

2991
01:46:19,149 --> 01:46:23,799
vapor pressure deficit and you can learn

2992
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:25,658
about VPD and why it's important to keep

2993
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:28,510
the temperature and humidity in the

2994
01:46:25,658 --> 01:46:30,609
appropriate range for our plants another

2995
01:46:28,510 --> 01:46:33,579
thing I like to add to our large veg is

2996
01:46:30,609 --> 01:46:35,408
a fan I like to have wall fans or those

2997
01:46:33,578 --> 01:46:36,698
fans on stands depending on your setup

2998
01:46:35,408 --> 01:46:38,979
but I like to have a fan just

2999
01:46:36,698 --> 01:46:39,129
oscillating in the room circulating the

3000
01:46:38,979 --> 01:46:41,169
air

3001
01:46:39,130 --> 01:46:43,029
the idea is to circulate the air I want

3002
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:44,739
to move the stale air around and move

3003
01:46:43,029 --> 01:46:46,779
that fresh air around so the plants have

3004
01:46:44,738 --> 01:46:48,189
fresh air constantly you don't need to

3005
01:46:46,779 --> 01:46:50,170
beat the [ __ ] out of the plants with a

3006
01:46:48,189 --> 01:46:51,939
fan I go in some grows and they're just

3007
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:53,359
terrorizing plants with fans and just

3008
01:46:51,939 --> 01:46:54,769
beating them to death and

3009
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:56,779
wondering why the plants look like [ __ ]

3010
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:58,730
we just want to rustle the leaves we

3011
01:46:56,779 --> 01:47:01,009
just want to move the air around so I

3012
01:46:58,729 --> 01:47:02,899
like to put a fan about one fan every

3013
01:47:01,010 --> 01:47:04,610
one or two lights depending on the size

3014
01:47:02,899 --> 01:47:06,409
of the room and the environment but make

3015
01:47:04,609 --> 01:47:08,960
sure that every area is getting fresh

3016
01:47:06,409 --> 01:47:11,059
air in that room at this point I feel

3017
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:14,840
like we have officially entered the

3018
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:16,580
large veg phase our main goals in focus

3019
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:19,369
now are to keep the plants pests and

3020
01:47:16,579 --> 01:47:22,159
pathogens free we need to avoid nutrient

3021
01:47:19,369 --> 01:47:25,099
and pH mistakes make sure not to over

3022
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:27,319
feed our plants at this time also pay

3023
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:29,600
very close attention to the pH of your

3024
01:47:27,319 --> 01:47:31,279
feeding solutions we need to keep these

3025
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,720
plants healthy and vigorous we need to

3026
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:34,460
work on the top part of the plants now

3027
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:36,260
we'll be focused on the bottom for the

3028
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:38,840
first half now we're gonna focus more on

3029
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:41,090
the top half that means in the upcoming

3030
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:43,220
episodes we're going to work on shaping

3031
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:45,079
and structuring these plants we're also

3032
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:47,210
going to talk about popping and twisting

3033
01:47:45,079 --> 01:47:49,399
then we'll talk about bottoming and

3034
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:51,859
topping and lolli popping our plants but

3035
01:47:49,399 --> 01:47:53,839
that is all in upcoming episodes I've

3036
01:47:51,859 --> 01:47:55,369
got two quick things to cover before we

3037
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:57,050
start wrapping up this episode and then

3038
01:47:55,369 --> 01:47:58,909
we are out of here for this week you

3039
01:47:57,050 --> 01:48:01,940
guys one thing I should talk about is

3040
01:47:58,909 --> 01:48:04,309
pest management now is a good time if

3041
01:48:01,939 --> 01:48:08,329
you are going to apply pesticide sprays

3042
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:10,880
today is a good day to start that IPM

3043
01:48:08,329 --> 01:48:12,979
program those plants are moving into the

3044
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:14,659
bedroom they're in their big pots let's

3045
01:48:12,979 --> 01:48:17,029
go ahead and hit them with a light

3046
01:48:14,659 --> 01:48:19,099
pesticide spray turn off the lights

3047
01:48:17,029 --> 01:48:21,139
douse the plants give them a couple

3048
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:22,910
hours to dry off turn the lights back on

3049
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:24,950
to their regularly scheduled program and

3050
01:48:22,909 --> 01:48:25,670
pay attention to those plants see how

3051
01:48:24,949 --> 01:48:27,979
they react

3052
01:48:25,670 --> 01:48:29,359
hopefully you wrote down exactly what

3053
01:48:27,979 --> 01:48:31,189
you sprayed on those plants you wrote

3054
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:33,259
down the product and you wrote how much

3055
01:48:31,189 --> 01:48:34,909
per gallon you applied you wrote down

3056
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:36,619
what time you applied it and now you

3057
01:48:34,909 --> 01:48:38,329
have a good frame of reference so you

3058
01:48:36,619 --> 01:48:40,789
can go in and look you can see how the

3059
01:48:38,329 --> 01:48:42,829
plants reacted if they look angry you

3060
01:48:40,789 --> 01:48:44,510
need to reduce the application next time

3061
01:48:42,829 --> 01:48:46,399
if they look happy about it you can do

3062
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:49,460
the same thing or consider increasing

3063
01:48:46,399 --> 01:48:51,460
the application rate if necessary so I

3064
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:53,659
generally start my heavy pest management

3065
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:54,770
application right when I move them into

3066
01:48:53,659 --> 01:48:56,779
the large pots

3067
01:48:54,770 --> 01:48:59,480
another thing that will be important to

3068
01:48:56,779 --> 01:49:01,399
think about is flip time how long are

3069
01:48:59,479 --> 01:49:03,549
these plants going to veg in this

3070
01:49:01,399 --> 01:49:06,170
environment how much space do you have

3071
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:07,130
depending on your genetics depending on

3072
01:49:06,170 --> 01:49:08,630
your lighting

3073
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:12,020
depending on your overall environment

3074
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:14,510
these plants could double in size if you

3075
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:16,580
were working within a rise cross there

3076
01:49:14,510 --> 01:49:18,710
is a good likelihood that by the time

3077
01:49:16,579 --> 01:49:20,988
you finish that plant it will be twice

3078
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:23,869
the size it was when you started the

3079
01:49:20,988 --> 01:49:25,309
flowering process so if that plant is 24

3080
01:49:23,869 --> 01:49:27,649
inches tall when you induce flowering

3081
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:30,500
there's a good chance that plant will

3082
01:49:27,649 --> 01:49:32,809
end up 48 inches tall before it is done

3083
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:34,789
so as a grower you need to plan ahead

3084
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:36,679
you need to make sure that plant does

3085
01:49:34,789 --> 01:49:38,929
not grow up into your lights and burn

3086
01:49:36,679 --> 01:49:40,550
itself you need to save depending on the

3087
01:49:38,929 --> 01:49:42,529
type of light you're using you need to

3088
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:45,949
save some space between the bulb and

3089
01:49:42,529 --> 01:49:47,389
your top cola so plan ahead now is the

3090
01:49:45,948 --> 01:49:49,579
time to start thinking about how long

3091
01:49:47,389 --> 01:49:51,500
we're going to veg if you veg to long

3092
01:49:49,579 --> 01:49:53,899
the plants will get too tall you'll have

3093
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:55,639
problems we're also going to do things

3094
01:49:53,899 --> 01:49:57,408
like topping and bottoming and Lolly

3095
01:49:55,639 --> 01:49:59,600
popping and twisting and cracking and

3096
01:49:57,408 --> 01:50:01,250
trellising and manipulating these plants

3097
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:03,170
so we're going to need to give them a

3098
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:05,149
little bit of time to recover from some

3099
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:07,279
of these techniques before we initiate

3100
01:50:05,149 --> 01:50:09,738
the flowering process so if we plan

3101
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:12,800
ahead and know how long we anticipate to

3102
01:50:09,738 --> 01:50:15,138
veg we can predict when to do these

3103
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:17,329
steps to increase production and flower

3104
01:50:15,139 --> 01:50:19,369
at the ideal time and fill our grow

3105
01:50:17,329 --> 01:50:21,469
space perfectly we can end up with our

3106
01:50:19,369 --> 01:50:23,179
canopy right about eight inches below

3107
01:50:21,469 --> 01:50:24,560
that light and it'll be nice and even

3108
01:50:23,179 --> 01:50:26,658
and look beautiful you won't have any

3109
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:28,520
wasted space in there once you're an

3110
01:50:26,658 --> 01:50:31,099
experienced grower your goal will be to

3111
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:34,280
fill your grow space if you've got a 5

3112
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:35,840
by 5 grow tent you want a 5 by 5 canopy

3113
01:50:34,279 --> 01:50:37,399
or at least a four and a half by four

3114
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,960
and a half canopy because when it when

3115
01:50:37,399 --> 01:50:40,908
the air flows it sucks in a little bit

3116
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:43,489
but you want to fill most of that space

3117
01:50:40,908 --> 01:50:45,888
a very experienced grower an older guy

3118
01:50:43,488 --> 01:50:47,329
he said one day if you had a cooler and

3119
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:48,679
you could fill it with beer would you

3120
01:50:47,329 --> 01:50:50,119
fill it most of the way to the top with

3121
01:50:48,679 --> 01:50:52,039
beer or would you fill that cooler all

3122
01:50:50,119 --> 01:50:53,658
the way with beer I'm not even a beer

3123
01:50:52,039 --> 01:50:55,219
drinker and that makes sense to me I

3124
01:50:53,658 --> 01:50:57,079
want as many beers fit in that cooler

3125
01:50:55,219 --> 01:50:58,670
that's just the way you do it so do you

3126
01:50:57,079 --> 01:51:00,289
want your grow room to be halfway filled

3127
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:02,719
with buds or do you want to fill that

3128
01:51:00,289 --> 01:51:05,658
[ __ ] up with buds the goal will be to

3129
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:07,550
maximize that canopy space so in future

3130
01:51:05,658 --> 01:51:09,829
episodes we will talk about trellising

3131
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:11,690
lolli popping will talk about sticks and

3132
01:51:09,829 --> 01:51:13,488
cages and cracking stems we will go in

3133
01:51:11,689 --> 01:51:15,919
depth and a lot of techniques like that

3134
01:51:13,488 --> 01:51:16,908
on ways to fill up your cooler for

3135
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,770
maximum production

3136
01:51:16,908 --> 01:51:20,719

[Music]

3192
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:39,560
my head spin makes my eyes vibrate makes

3193
01:53:36,859 --> 01:53:40,880
it hard to think the banana OG is kind

3194
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:42,470
of more of a mellow thing it's got me

3195
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,329
kind of chilled out it's kind of slow

3196
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:45,800
motion it's got my highs nice and heavy

3197
01:53:44,329 --> 01:53:48,529
it's got my shoulders nice and chilled

3198
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:51,230
out and I really dig the flavor of the

3199
01:53:48,529 --> 01:53:52,759
banana OG so that's what I'm dad and on

3200
01:53:51,229 --> 01:53:54,500
today I hope you guys are taking dads or

3201
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:56,090
something delicious I'm not sure if you

3202
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:57,619
can tell but I still have a little bit

3203
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:59,390
of that head cold hanging around I'm

3204
01:53:57,619 --> 01:54:00,949
trying to get rid of that I'm not gonna

3205
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:03,800
let it slow me down I am going to

3206
01:54:00,949 --> 01:54:05,569
deliver a quality podcast and this

3207
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:07,670
episode I plan to bring you another grow

3208
01:54:05,569 --> 01:54:09,319
lesson before we get to the grow lesson

3209
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:12,079
I've got a couple of quick things to

3210
01:54:09,319 --> 01:54:14,090
cover I am working on the website of

3211
01:54:12,079 --> 01:54:16,760
course I am I read genetics Colorado my

3212
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:18,680
website is I read genetics Colorado calm

3213
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:20,600
we are currently doing some updates

3214
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:21,950
during the process of updating the

3215
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:24,920
website something went completely

3216
01:54:21,949 --> 01:54:27,500
freakin wrong and the podcast does not

3217
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:29,000
work from the website anymore all of the

3218
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:31,130
episodes that were up before the update

3219
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,960
are still accessible none of the new

3220
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:35,960
things add to the website are posting to

3221
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:37,730
the RSS feed my web guy is working on it

3222
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:39,350
it is the holiday weekend so he has

3223
01:54:37,729 --> 01:54:40,699
taken a few days off but I'm sure he

3224
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:43,070
will get back on it as soon as the

3225
01:54:40,699 --> 01:54:45,199
weekend is over my point is I know the

3226
01:54:43,069 --> 01:54:47,539
website is messed up and I apologize for

3227
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:49,909
not having the episodes out on iTunes

3228
01:54:47,539 --> 01:54:51,619
and stitcher as regularly scheduled I

3229
01:54:49,909 --> 01:54:53,930
was just recently bragging about not

3230
01:54:51,619 --> 01:54:55,579
missing a Monday in five years and now

3231
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:57,230
here I am I've missed the least one

3232
01:54:55,579 --> 01:54:59,989
Monday it looks like I may potentially

3233
01:54:57,229 --> 01:55:02,479
miss two mondays in a row I do apologize

3234
01:54:59,989 --> 01:55:04,519
however the episodes are recorded and

3235
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:06,109
the shows are posted on YouTube so I

3236
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:08,450
have not stopped recording I haven't

3237
01:55:06,109 --> 01:55:10,219
stopped doing the shows I'm just unable

3238
01:55:08,449 --> 01:55:12,529
to post them to iTunes and stitcher

3239
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:14,300
because of a glitch with my website so

3240

3268
01:56:14,389 --> 01:56:18,618
support all right podcast world I said

3269
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:21,920
earlier this was going to be another

3270
01:56:18,618 --> 01:56:23,988
grow lesson so far in my series of grow

3271
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:26,989
lessons we should have plants that are

3272
01:56:23,988 --> 01:56:29,509
probably 12 to 14 maybe 16 or 18 inches

3273
01:56:26,988 --> 01:56:32,089
tall they are probably in three or five

3274
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:33,979
or maybe seven gallon pots hopefully

3275
01:56:32,090 --> 01:56:36,288
they are nice and healthy they have got

3276
01:56:33,979 --> 01:56:38,150
a fat root system hopefully their pest

3277
01:56:36,288 --> 01:56:40,609
free at this time hopefully you haven't

3278
01:56:38,149 --> 01:56:41,748
over or under fertilized them we've

3279
01:56:40,609 --> 01:56:43,578
talked a lot about the proper

3280
01:56:41,748 --> 01:56:45,349
environment and conditions and feeding

3281
01:56:43,578 --> 01:56:47,359
for these plants so I think we know how

3282
01:56:45,349 --> 01:56:49,489
to take care of them by now let's talk

3283
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:52,248
about a few ways to improve our

3284
01:56:49,488 --> 01:56:55,488
productivity and the vigor of our large

3285
01:56:52,248 --> 01:56:57,618
veg plants now none of this stuff is

3286
01:56:55,488 --> 01:56:59,899
required none of this stuff is mandatory

3287
01:56:57,618 --> 01:57:02,268
these are the little tips and tricks and

3288
01:56:59,899 --> 01:57:05,268
bonus things that I do to boost

3289
01:57:02,269 --> 01:57:07,489
productivity and boost vigor to kind of

3290
01:57:05,269 --> 01:57:10,670
turbocharged the overall performance of

3291
01:57:07,488 --> 01:57:12,859
my garden one really easy thing I like

3292
01:57:10,670 --> 01:57:15,349
to do to all of my plants to increase

3293
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:17,328
performance is just clean off the crap

3294
01:57:15,349 --> 01:57:19,279
on the bottoms of the plants you've got

3295
01:57:17,328 --> 01:57:20,899
a stalk coming out of the dirt and then

3296
01:57:19,279 --> 01:57:22,399
you've got a few crappy branches coming

3297
01:57:20,899 --> 01:57:24,049
off the bottom and then the next couple

3298
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:25,998
of branches will be more substantial and

3299
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:28,579
then you'll have some solid branches if

3300
01:57:25,998 --> 01:57:30,978
those very bottom branches are crappy

3301
01:57:28,578 --> 01:57:32,630
don't be afraid to remove them if you

3302
01:57:30,979 --> 01:57:34,969
feel like they are a waste of growth on

3303
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:37,489
the plant feel free to take them off we

3304
01:57:34,969 --> 01:57:39,708
are going to lollipop heavily once we go

3305
01:57:37,488 --> 01:57:42,049
into flower so don't be afraid to move

3306
01:57:39,708 --> 01:57:44,029
some of the crappy bottom branches if

3307
01:57:42,050 --> 01:57:46,550
it's a long healthy branch that has the

3308
01:57:44,029 --> 01:57:48,469
potential to reach the canopy level you

3309
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:50,779
can leave it but if it's ugly if it's

3310
01:57:48,469 --> 01:57:52,578
droopy if it's sucking up energy and not

3311
01:57:50,779 --> 01:57:54,948
going to produce anything that would be

3312
01:57:52,578 --> 01:57:57,018
worthwhile feel free to take it off then

3313
01:57:54,948 --> 01:57:58,759
that plant can focus its energy moving

3314
01:57:57,019 --> 01:58:00,389
up toward the top of the plant where we

3315
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:02,190
want to build that lush

3316
01:58:00,389 --> 01:58:04,409
so feel free to take crap off of the

3317
01:58:02,189 --> 01:58:06,118
bottom so now we've removed the crappy

3318
01:58:04,408 --> 01:58:08,129
bottom branches there are kind of a

3319
01:58:06,118 --> 01:58:09,868
waste of energy here is another thing we

3320
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:11,849
can do to the bottom section of our

3321
01:58:09,868 --> 01:58:13,649
plant to improve the performance and

3322
01:58:11,849 --> 01:58:15,869
move the energy up toward the top

3323
01:58:13,649 --> 01:58:17,429
we've still got bottom branches because

3324
01:58:15,868 --> 01:58:20,460
we left some of those bottom branches on

3325
01:58:17,429 --> 01:58:23,099
the plant the inside bottom branching is

3326
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:25,769
not going to receive much light so what

3327
01:58:23,099 --> 01:58:27,900
I like to do is find that branch and

3328
01:58:25,769 --> 01:58:29,909
just follow it up and remove any shoots

3329
01:58:27,899 --> 01:58:31,920
that I feel like are a waste of space

3330
01:58:29,908 --> 01:58:33,569
so you'll having a thick arm coming off

3331
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:35,550
and then off of that you'll have like a

3332
01:58:33,569 --> 01:58:37,828
little tiny sub arm coming off those are

3333
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:38,998
the shoots those are on the bottom of

3334
01:58:37,828 --> 01:58:41,698
the plant those are a waste of space

3335
01:58:38,998 --> 01:58:44,340
those are gonna turn into buds we do not

3336
01:58:41,698 --> 01:58:46,919
want to trim that is gonna be fluffy lar

3337
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:49,229
fee useless little crap it is a trimmers

3338
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:51,300
nightmare by removing that crap from the

3339
01:58:49,229 --> 01:58:53,219
bottom we direct the energy up toward

3340
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:55,349
the top we can make bigger top chunky

3341
01:58:53,219 --> 01:58:56,849
buds those are better for trimmers those

3342
01:58:55,349 --> 01:58:57,869
are better for the market those are

3343
01:58:56,849 --> 01:59:00,269
better for the consumer

3344
01:58:57,868 --> 01:59:01,978
everybody wants those big fat buds so

3345
01:59:00,269 --> 01:59:03,840
let's clean off that crap off the bottom

3346
01:59:01,979 --> 01:59:05,460
so you've got the main stock coming out

3347
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:07,529
then you've got your bottom to your

3348
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:09,328
bottom four branches follow those

3349
01:59:07,529 --> 01:59:11,309
branches up and where you don't see any

3350
01:59:09,328 --> 01:59:12,779
light touching those little shoots feel

3351
01:59:11,309 --> 01:59:14,639
free to just pinch them or cut them

3352
01:59:12,779 --> 01:59:16,768
right off while you're cutting or

3353
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:19,170
pinching or cleaning stuff off of plants

3354
01:59:16,769 --> 01:59:21,659
always keep this in mind you can go back

3355
01:59:19,170 --> 01:59:24,359
later and take more off but you cannot

3356
01:59:21,658 --> 01:59:26,368
glue the leaves and the shoots back on

3357
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:28,498
to the plant so pay attention to what

3358
01:59:26,368 --> 01:59:30,359
you're doing but on that bottom section

3359
01:59:28,498 --> 01:59:32,429
just pull that crap at the inside right

3360
01:59:30,359 --> 01:59:34,529
off of there I go fairly hard on the

3361
01:59:32,429 --> 01:59:36,690
bottom parts of the plants I plan on

3362
01:59:34,529 --> 01:59:39,149
lolli popping heavily early in flower

3363
01:59:36,689 --> 01:59:41,518
anyway so why not pull off a lot of that

3364
01:59:39,149 --> 01:59:43,379
crap now and send the energy up toward

3365
01:59:41,519 --> 01:59:44,820
the top of the plant now while you're

3366
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:47,219
cleaning the bottoms of the plants keep

3367
01:59:44,819 --> 01:59:49,380
in mind that it may be wise to take some

3368
01:59:47,219 --> 01:59:51,769
clones before we put these plants into

3369
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:54,300
flower what are you going to grow next

3370
01:59:51,769 --> 01:59:56,309
are you growing from seed that you spent

3371
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:58,199
a lot of money on if you paid a lot of

3372
01:59:56,309 --> 02:00:00,360
money for those seeds I definitely

3373
01:59:58,198 --> 02:00:02,339
recommend you take a clone off of each

3374
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:03,689
seedling and market we're gonna talk

3375
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:06,449
about this in depth in a future episode

3376
02:00:03,689 --> 02:00:09,178
but if you've got a plant from seed I

3377
02:00:06,448 --> 02:00:12,089
recommend you take a clone from it mark

3378
02:00:09,179 --> 02:00:13,350
that plant plant a mark your clone clone

3379
02:00:12,090 --> 02:00:15,119
a

3380
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:17,310
go on down the line with every seedling

3381
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:18,840
plant that you've got then grow them out

3382
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:20,700
either grow out the clone or grow out

3383
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:22,650
the original plant and if you've got

3384
02:00:20,699 --> 02:00:24,479
something amazing now you have got a

3385
02:00:22,649 --> 02:00:26,009
keeper clone of that to keep around

3386
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:27,869
we're gonna talk about Fino hunting

3387
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:29,190
we'll talk about mother plants we're

3388
02:00:27,869 --> 02:00:30,899
gonna talk about that sort of stuff in a

3389
02:00:29,189 --> 02:00:32,729
future episode but this is something to

3390
02:00:30,899 --> 02:00:34,409
think about while we are cleaning the

3391
02:00:32,729 --> 02:00:36,539
bottoms of our plants do you want to use

3392
02:00:34,409 --> 02:00:38,760
those two bottom branches may make

3393
02:00:36,539 --> 02:00:40,560
excellent clones some of those shoots

3394
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:42,630
may have grown big enough to turn into a

3395
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:44,370
clone keep that in mind while you're

3396
02:00:42,630 --> 02:00:46,289
cleaning up the bottoms of your plants

3397
02:00:44,369 --> 02:00:48,569
now let's talk about another way to

3398
02:00:46,289 --> 02:00:51,060
improve the productivity of our plant

3399
02:00:48,569 --> 02:00:53,729
and also a great way to score a great

3400
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:56,190
clone from a healthy plant and of course

3401
02:00:53,729 --> 02:00:58,349
I'm talking about topping topping our

3402
02:00:56,189 --> 02:01:00,419
plant can greatly improve the

3403
02:00:58,350 --> 02:01:02,789
performance of our plant if it is done

3404
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:05,010
at the appropriate time and at the

3405
02:01:02,789 --> 02:01:07,380
appropriate place in the plant

3406
02:01:05,010 --> 02:01:09,600
now when I say appropriate time we can

3407
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:11,310
do this at just about any point in veg

3408
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:12,390
once the plant is large enough the

3409
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:13,800
plants we are talking about are

3410
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:16,230
certainly large enough if we are in

3411
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:19,079
large veg this is prime time for topping

3412
02:01:16,229 --> 02:01:21,750
we have to top approximately ten to

3413
02:01:19,079 --> 02:01:24,899
fourteen days before we enter the

3414
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:28,829
flowering phase when we top a cannabis

3415
02:01:24,899 --> 02:01:31,170
plant our mission is to remove that top

3416
02:01:28,829 --> 02:01:32,550
node out of the plant that giant one

3417
02:01:31,170 --> 02:01:34,409
that's sticking out of the top making it

3418
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:37,289
look like a Christmas tree we want to

3419
02:01:34,409 --> 02:01:40,289
remove that and our goal is to make the

3420
02:01:37,289 --> 02:01:42,810
next set of branches become two tops and

3421
02:01:40,289 --> 02:01:44,729
that will create competition within the

3422
02:01:42,810 --> 02:01:46,800
branches of the plant it will make all

3423
02:01:44,729 --> 02:01:49,919
of the branches try to reach up and

3424
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:51,989
become the next top basically somebody

3425
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:54,569
killed the king and now all of those

3426
02:01:51,989 --> 02:01:56,550
next soldiers are trying to be the next

3427
02:01:54,569 --> 02:01:58,529
king the hormones in the plant will

3428
02:01:56,550 --> 02:02:01,619
indicate we're missing a top somebody

3429
02:01:58,529 --> 02:02:04,019
needs to take over cannabis has a trait

3430
02:02:01,619 --> 02:02:07,019
that is called apical dominance it

3431
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:09,210
really wants one dominant top when you

3432
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:11,520
remove that dominant top the rest of the

3433
02:02:09,210 --> 02:02:14,159
tops no there's an opportunity for them

3434
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:16,470
to become that main top so you can top

3435
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:18,569
the plants at various ages and at

3436
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:20,100
various stages let's talk about the

3437
02:02:18,569 --> 02:02:22,229
process of doing it let me back up and

3438
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:24,990
talk about doing it find that top branch

3439
02:02:22,229 --> 02:02:26,729
where it's too tall trace it down the

3440
02:02:24,989 --> 02:02:27,329
way I like to do it I kind of find a

3441
02:02:26,729 --> 02:02:28,709
spot where I'm

3442
02:02:27,329 --> 02:02:30,600
thinking about cutting it and I bend it

3443
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:32,130
over and I look at the plant I say what

3444
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:34,470
would the plant look like without that

3445
02:02:32,130 --> 02:02:36,720
section is that too much to cut off is

3446
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:39,570
that going to be beneficial what is my

3447
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:42,300
goal in topping right now mainly my goal

3448
02:02:39,569 --> 02:02:44,219
instead of having one giant top I want

3449
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:46,920
to create sort of a bush so that I can

3450
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:48,780
grow space and not have one giant bud

3451
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:50,699
hitting the light but instead I can have

3452
02:02:48,779 --> 02:02:52,529
a four by four section of a bunch of

3453
02:02:50,699 --> 02:02:55,380
buds growing in the light instead of

3454
02:02:52,529 --> 02:02:58,079
just one by taking out that main top you

3455
02:02:55,380 --> 02:03:00,090
create that whole section into a bush so

3456
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:02,699
see which one is gonna cut out and make

3457
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:04,140
the others look like a nice even canopy

3458
02:03:02,699 --> 02:03:05,849
you will see it you'll get good at it

3459
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:08,250
it'll take a little bit of trial and

3460
02:03:05,850 --> 02:03:12,000
error it'll take some confidence it is

3461
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:13,380
also very strain specific topping an OG

3462
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Kush or something like that can be a

3463
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:16,680
real [ __ ] because the nodes are so far

3464
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,750
apart that you just make it look like a

3465
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:20,610
Charlie Brown Christmas tree but once it

3466
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:23,159
grows out of that it is going to be

3467
02:03:20,609 --> 02:03:26,159
amazing the more sativa dominant stuff

3468
02:03:23,159 --> 02:03:28,590
if you top scarlet begonias if you top

3469
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:30,779
storm shadow it makes a beautiful bush

3470
02:03:28,590 --> 02:03:33,329
and they go crazy so kind of grab the

3471
02:03:30,779 --> 02:03:34,800
top and follow work your way down with

3472
02:03:33,329 --> 02:03:36,149
your hand and just kind of look and see

3473
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:37,949
what it would it look like if I took

3474
02:03:36,149 --> 02:03:39,989
this off and you'll come to a point

3475
02:03:37,949 --> 02:03:42,029
you'll take off one and you'll see two

3476
02:03:39,989 --> 02:03:43,649
branches that stick up evenly toward the

3477
02:03:42,029 --> 02:03:45,689
top and the two branches and underneath

3478
02:03:43,649 --> 02:03:47,729
that almost come right up to that top

3479
02:03:45,689 --> 02:03:49,619
section as well you'll have four nice

3480
02:03:47,729 --> 02:03:51,059
new tops and you'll say that's what

3481
02:03:49,619 --> 02:03:53,430
Rasta Jeff is talking about I want to

3482
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:54,930
make these four tops the tops then just

3483
02:03:53,430 --> 02:03:57,329
cut that one out and you'll see exactly

3484
02:03:54,930 --> 02:03:59,610
what I've got you're probably gonna

3485
02:03:57,329 --> 02:04:01,559
screw up a couple of plants that's how

3486
02:03:59,609 --> 02:04:04,079
you learn stuff musicians have to [ __ ]

3487
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:05,070
up songs to learn BMX racers have to

3488
02:04:04,079 --> 02:04:06,659
fall on their face to learn

3489
02:04:05,069 --> 02:04:09,389
skateboarders get stitches and break

3490
02:04:06,659 --> 02:04:10,949
bones to learn luckily we mess up plants

3491
02:04:09,390 --> 02:04:13,170
we can grow more plants

3492
02:04:10,949 --> 02:04:14,760
it doesn't hurt us that bad when we cut

3493
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:16,380
up a plant the wrong way hopefully

3494
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:18,690
you've got a couple more and you're

3495
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:20,369
gonna learn the cost of cutting that one

3496
02:04:18,689 --> 02:04:22,259
plant from what you learn from it is

3497
02:04:20,369 --> 02:04:24,000
invaluable so get in there and just play

3498
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:26,190
around with the scissors top some of

3499
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,350
them bottom some of them up see what

3500
02:04:26,189 --> 02:04:31,289
they do finish them that way you have

3501
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:34,200
some data now keep in mind that data is

3502
02:04:31,289 --> 02:04:36,149
very strain specific like I said earlier

3503
02:04:34,199 --> 02:04:37,289
if you're topping an OG Kush plant

3504
02:04:36,149 --> 02:04:39,269
you're gonna have totally different

3505
02:04:37,289 --> 02:04:40,229
results than if you're topping something

3506
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:42,360
like a haze or

3507
02:04:40,229 --> 02:04:44,189
more sativa dominant like a golden goat

3508
02:04:42,359 --> 02:04:46,399
kind of a thing the growth structure is

3509
02:04:44,189 --> 02:04:49,349
just naturally different in those plants

3510
02:04:46,399 --> 02:04:51,059
now when you're topping your plant do it

3511
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:53,550
at the intersection where it's going to

3512
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:56,250
encourage that plant the most expansive

3513
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:57,510
growth so if you've got two branches cut

3514
02:04:56,250 --> 02:04:59,100
you've got the main stock coming up

3515
02:04:57,510 --> 02:05:00,690
you've got a branch coming out and then

3516
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:03,030
maybe an inch up you've got a branch

3517
02:05:00,689 --> 02:05:04,439
coming out cut right above that top

3518
02:05:03,029 --> 02:05:07,019
branch you don't need to leave anything

3519
02:05:04,439 --> 02:05:08,849
hanging off or anything extra cut it

3520
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:11,340
right at the intersection where you want

3521
02:05:08,850 --> 02:05:13,470
to encourage the spread you basically

3522
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:15,600
want to take an upside down peace sign

3523
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:18,119
and you want to turn it into a Wye and

3524
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:20,160
those new tops of the Y are going to be

3525
02:05:18,119 --> 02:05:22,109
the new two tops of the plant and then

3526
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:24,119
the next two branches hopefully they'll

3527
02:05:22,109 --> 02:05:26,639
catch up now that puts me back to why I

3528
02:05:24,119 --> 02:05:29,488
said we want to do this at least 10 to

3529
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:31,440
14 days before we go into flower or much

3530
02:05:29,488 --> 02:05:34,049
sooner than that if it's an opportunity

3531
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:35,849
when we make that cut we've just cut out

3532
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:37,980
the king like I said earlier we need

3533
02:05:35,850 --> 02:05:40,110
time for those hormones to move around

3534
02:05:37,979 --> 02:05:42,329
into the plant and that helps us when we

3535
02:05:40,109 --> 02:05:45,119
go into flower we get much larger bud

3536
02:05:42,329 --> 02:05:46,979
sets if you if you flower too soon after

3537
02:05:45,119 --> 02:05:48,750
topping your plants just create little

3538
02:05:46,979 --> 02:05:50,879
popcorn buds the hormones haven't moved

3539
02:05:48,750 --> 02:05:52,619
around they're not exactly sure what to

3540
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:54,539
do they're not sure where the top should

3541
02:05:52,619 --> 02:05:56,789
go so you just get a bunch of little

3542
02:05:54,539 --> 02:05:58,590
popcorns so give the plant plenty of

3543
02:05:56,789 --> 02:06:00,359
time to recover plenty of time to move

3544
02:05:58,590 --> 02:06:02,130
the hormones and plenty of time for it

3545
02:06:00,359 --> 02:06:04,920
to decide where the tops are going to be

3546
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:07,350
after topping and before moving your

3547
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:08,970
plants into flower earlier I mentioned

3548
02:06:07,350 --> 02:06:11,940
that this would be a good opportunity

3549
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:14,610
for a clone that top you just cut off

3550
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:16,769
should be the most robust hardiest part

3551
02:06:14,609 --> 02:06:19,769
of your plant that will make a great

3552
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:22,350
candidate for a clone so why not snag

3553
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:24,390
that up now you've got a big fat healthy

3554
02:06:22,350 --> 02:06:26,280
clone for the next crop while you're

3555
02:06:24,390 --> 02:06:28,680
increasing the productivity of the

3556
02:06:26,279 --> 02:06:31,229
current crop all right so we've covered

3557
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:33,210
two great ways to increase the vigor and

3558
02:06:31,229 --> 02:06:35,339
productivity of our plants we've figured

3559
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:37,230
out how to properly move the energy to

3560
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:39,270
the part of the plant we want to grow

3561
02:06:37,229 --> 02:06:41,039
you can move it up to the top by taking

3562
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:42,840
stuff off the bottom you can spread it

3563
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:45,779
out by completely eliminating the top

3564
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:48,630
and that process we've also created the

3565
02:06:45,779 --> 02:06:50,189
opportunity to create clones now let's

3566
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:52,590
talk about another great technique that

3567
02:06:50,189 --> 02:06:53,019
I use in a personal garden I use this in

3568
02:06:52,590 --> 02:06:54,760
a breed

3569
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:56,920
program I use this in a large commercial

3570
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:59,739
grow this is something I implement in

3571
02:06:56,920 --> 02:07:02,050
almost any grow I get to play in I call

3572
02:06:59,739 --> 02:07:04,000
it the pop and twist technique you may

3573
02:07:02,050 --> 02:07:06,579
also know it as super cropping it has

3574
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,920
got a lot of names it is the same thing

3575
02:07:06,579 --> 02:07:11,079
no matter what we call it I like to pop

3576
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:13,270
the stems of the plant I like to kind of

3577
02:07:11,079 --> 02:07:14,590
pop their knuckles I don't know if you

3578
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:16,330
can hear that on the microphone I tried

3579
02:07:14,590 --> 02:07:18,970
to get it in there that's basically the

3580
02:07:16,329 --> 02:07:20,739
sound I am looking for once the plants

3581
02:07:18,970 --> 02:07:23,409
are a little bit thicker than a pen or a

3582
02:07:20,739 --> 02:07:24,909
pencil maybe a sharpie I like to grab

3583
02:07:23,409 --> 02:07:25,359
them right where they come out of the

3584
02:07:24,909 --> 02:07:27,399
dirt

3585
02:07:25,359 --> 02:07:29,380
I grab the stock kind of firmly with one

3586
02:07:27,399 --> 02:07:32,049
hand then I grab it with another hand

3587
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:33,579
right above it and I twist my top hand I

3588
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:34,840
don't twist that hand that's coming out

3589
02:07:33,579 --> 02:07:37,720
of the dirt I don't want to twist that

3590
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:40,510
dirt I twist the top hand tour I break

3591
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:42,130
the cellulose of the plant break that

3592
02:07:40,510 --> 02:07:44,140
outer structure toward you hear it pop a

3593
02:07:42,130 --> 02:07:46,180
little bit it'll go crunch just like my

3594
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:47,860
knuckle did and it'll make a little pop

3595
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:49,960
sound and you'll feel it and you'll be

3596
02:07:47,859 --> 02:07:52,269
freaked out the first time it's okay

3597
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:54,609
don't freak out you're doing exactly

3598
02:07:52,270 --> 02:07:57,070
what I recommend this will increase

3599
02:07:54,609 --> 02:07:59,319
vigor and productivity in a couple of

3600
02:07:57,069 --> 02:08:01,090
ways this will be beneficial in a couple

3601
02:07:59,319 --> 02:08:02,679
of ways let's talk about that real quick

3602
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:05,079
and we'll talk more about how to do this

3603
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:06,340
throughout the entire plant the first

3604
02:08:05,079 --> 02:08:07,960
thing you'll notice when you're popping

3605
02:08:06,340 --> 02:08:09,789
the knuckles on these plants is they

3606
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:12,010
will start to make little knuckles on

3607
02:08:09,789 --> 02:08:15,609
the branches I feel like these make the

3608
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:17,289
plants more stout more robust so that

3609
02:08:15,609 --> 02:08:20,319
when they start to grow buds those

3610
02:08:17,289 --> 02:08:22,090
branches can hold up bigger buds bigger

3611
02:08:20,319 --> 02:08:24,399
branches bigger buds right that makes

3612
02:08:22,090 --> 02:08:26,500
sense you want more support bigger legs

3613
02:08:24,399 --> 02:08:28,449
you can lift more right you're stronger

3614
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:29,949
I don't know if that mats out I'm not

3615
02:08:28,449 --> 02:08:31,479
kind of a weight lifter guy but if you

3616
02:08:29,949 --> 02:08:32,920
got more you can lift more right so you

3617
02:08:31,479 --> 02:08:35,769
want something able to support bigger

3618
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:37,779
buds also those bigger stems can

3619
02:08:35,770 --> 02:08:39,430
probably feed those bigger flowers

3620
02:08:37,779 --> 02:08:41,859
better so you've got more movement

3621
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:44,170
another way this is beneficial is it

3622
02:08:41,859 --> 02:08:46,299
will slow down the vertical growth of

3623
02:08:44,170 --> 02:08:48,550
the plants they won't get so tall so

3624
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:50,380
quickly because they will be spending a

3625
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:52,779
little bit of their energy on getting

3626
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:55,690
fatter and more robust they'll be short

3627
02:08:52,779 --> 02:08:57,969
and stocky which is way beneficial to

3628
02:08:55,689 --> 02:09:00,279
almost any grower where most of us are

3629
02:08:57,970 --> 02:09:01,869
limited by height in a home grow in a

3630
02:09:00,279 --> 02:09:04,210
commercial grow in a giant warehouse

3631
02:09:01,869 --> 02:09:05,220
grow most of us are still limited by

3632
02:09:04,210 --> 02:09:07,020
height so

3633
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:08,730
having this one tip to control the

3634
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:11,820
height of our plants just a little bit

3635
02:09:08,729 --> 02:09:13,409
can be very advantageous later on we're

3636
02:09:11,819 --> 02:09:15,539
gonna talk about trellising if you can

3637
02:09:13,409 --> 02:09:16,949
use cracking and trellising together you

3638
02:09:15,539 --> 02:09:18,359
can really control the height of your

3639
02:09:16,949 --> 02:09:20,670
plants and you can really maximize

3640
02:09:18,359 --> 02:09:22,829
productivity so those are a few reasons

3641
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:24,600
why I like to track the stems now let's

3642
02:09:22,829 --> 02:09:26,010
talk a little bit more about actually

3643
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:28,560
doing it now that I've given you a good

3644
02:09:26,010 --> 02:09:30,750
reason why to do this like I said I

3645
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:32,400
grabbed the stick with one hand I

3646
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:34,890
grabbed a stick with another and I just

3647
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:37,409
twist opposite directions and you'll

3648
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:39,720
hear it it will go pop and crunch then

3649
02:09:37,409 --> 02:09:42,590
just move up I start with the main stalk

3650
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:45,690
of the plant and I work my way almost

3651
02:09:42,590 --> 02:09:47,369
almost 90% of the way of the plant as

3652
02:09:45,689 --> 02:09:48,899
long as I can feel it's still crunching

3653
02:09:47,369 --> 02:09:50,519
as long as I'm not feeling like I'm

3654
02:09:48,899 --> 02:09:52,500
about to rip the top off the plant when

3655
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:54,840
I give it a twist I'll work my way right

3656
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:56,489
up then I go to the bottom branch and

3657
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:59,010
work my way right up the bottom branch

3658
02:09:56,489 --> 02:10:01,139
then the next branch and give it a crack

3659
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:02,489
I'll give it a crack I'm looking at the

3660
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:04,020
microphone stand here trying to think

3661
02:10:02,489 --> 02:10:07,319
about the distance of cracks I go one

3662
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:09,000
and then it's only four to six inches

3663
02:10:07,319 --> 02:10:10,949
apart depending on the size of the plant

3664
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,630
I will crack it maybe if it's a tiny

3665
02:10:10,949 --> 02:10:14,159
plant if they're short and squat I would

3666
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:15,989
go every three inches if I feel like

3667
02:10:14,159 --> 02:10:17,309
that plant could take it most of them

3668
02:10:15,989 --> 02:10:19,829
will take it about every four to six

3669
02:10:17,310 --> 02:10:21,630
inches without any problems give it a

3670
02:10:19,829 --> 02:10:23,489
little crack move up give it a little

3671
02:10:21,630 --> 02:10:25,650
crack move up give it a little crack

3672
02:10:23,489 --> 02:10:27,239
just do that to every plant in the

3673
02:10:25,649 --> 02:10:29,339
garden it will slow down their growth

3674
02:10:27,239 --> 02:10:31,949
it'll make them more robust they'll be

3675
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:33,900
more vigorous and you can continue to do

3676
02:10:31,949 --> 02:10:36,479
this all the way in to about week three

3677
02:10:33,899 --> 02:10:38,879
of flower so if you start it early in

3678
02:10:36,479 --> 02:10:40,979
veg you can get a good cracking in there

3679
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:42,750
give them about seven maybe ten days to

3680
02:10:40,979 --> 02:10:45,119
heal up go back give them another good

3681
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:46,500
crack throw them into flower as they get

3682
02:10:45,119 --> 02:10:48,869
bigger they will recover more quickly

3683
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:50,130
from being busted on so go in there and

3684
02:10:48,869 --> 02:10:51,689
give them a good crack on day one a

3685
02:10:50,130 --> 02:10:53,609
flower right at the start of the

3686
02:10:51,689 --> 02:10:55,529
flowering cycle slow down that stretch a

3687
02:10:53,609 --> 02:10:58,380
little bit and then think about it this

3688
02:10:55,529 --> 02:11:00,960
way if you crack spot one and then spot

3689
02:10:58,380 --> 02:11:02,819
two there's a spot in the middle of that

3690
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:04,649
that you can crack next time so you can

3691
02:11:02,819 --> 02:11:05,969
go back in a week and even if they

3692
02:11:04,649 --> 02:11:07,619
haven't healed up from all of their

3693
02:11:05,970 --> 02:11:09,630
cracking you can crack those middle

3694
02:11:07,619 --> 02:11:11,819
spots and make even another little

3695
02:11:09,630 --> 02:11:13,920
knuckle another little knurled spot on

3696
02:11:11,819 --> 02:11:15,569
your plants don't be afraid to get in

3697
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:17,310
there and do some work on them and bust

3698
02:11:15,569 --> 02:11:18,609
them up a little bit they will recover

3699
02:11:17,310 --> 02:11:21,460
and they will

3700
02:11:18,609 --> 02:11:23,049
really show progress from this I know I

3701
02:11:21,460 --> 02:11:24,189
probably sound like I'm crazy because

3702
02:11:23,050 --> 02:11:25,449
for the past ten minutes I've been

3703
02:11:24,189 --> 02:11:27,579
telling you to cut stuff off of your

3704
02:11:25,448 --> 02:11:29,019
plants and break them and bend them and

3705
02:11:27,579 --> 02:11:31,899
that's going to increase productivity

3706
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:34,210
but how do you get stronger through

3707
02:11:31,899 --> 02:11:35,229
stress through proper training and

3708
02:11:34,210 --> 02:11:36,520
that's what we're gonna do to these

3709
02:11:35,229 --> 02:11:38,109
plants we're gonna tell them what we

3710
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:39,790
want from them and we're gonna show them

3711
02:11:38,109 --> 02:11:41,639
what we expect and they're gonna give it

3712
02:11:39,789 --> 02:11:44,139
to us with the proper guidance

3713
02:11:41,639 --> 02:11:46,659
speaking of guidance let's work our way

3714
02:11:44,139 --> 02:11:48,819
into talking about canopy control

3715
02:11:46,658 --> 02:11:50,679
earlier I mentioned that our plants are

3716
02:11:48,819 --> 02:11:53,979
apical dominant meaning they want to

3717
02:11:50,679 --> 02:11:55,899
grow straight up unfortunately for us as

3718
02:11:53,979 --> 02:11:57,368
growers it does not benefit us for the

3719
02:11:55,899 --> 02:11:59,920
plants to grow straight up

3720
02:11:57,368 --> 02:12:01,809
we need to fill horizontal space we need

3721
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:03,699
to spread them out a little bit we have

3722
02:12:01,810 --> 02:12:06,340
several options for encouraging our

3723
02:12:03,698 --> 02:12:08,469
plants to spread out our earlier work of

3724
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:11,050
topping them was a great start but we

3725
02:12:08,469 --> 02:12:13,448
can go much further than that a very

3726
02:12:11,050 --> 02:12:15,909
easy affordable and effective way to

3727
02:12:13,448 --> 02:12:18,099
spread out our plants a little bit is by

3728
02:12:15,908 --> 02:12:19,988
using sticks you can get bamboo sticks

3729
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:23,440
at the local gross store for very cheap

3730
02:12:19,988 --> 02:12:25,329
I like to put about four sticks per pot

3731
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:27,368
and I like to put them toward the outer

3732
02:12:25,329 --> 02:12:28,448
edge of the pot don't go too far in

3733
02:12:27,368 --> 02:12:30,009
because you've got a lot of root

3734
02:12:28,448 --> 02:12:31,719
development there you don't want to go

3735
02:12:30,010 --> 02:12:33,550
shoving a bamboo stick right through a

3736
02:12:31,719 --> 02:12:35,618
bunch of roots so go out toward the edge

3737
02:12:33,550 --> 02:12:38,020
of the pot put the stick in there if

3738
02:12:35,618 --> 02:12:40,089
your plants are gonna grow six feet tall

3739
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:41,800
get a six-foot stick if your plants are

3740
02:12:40,090 --> 02:12:43,960
only gonna grow three feet tall get a

3741
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:45,760
three-foot stick you don't want a stick

3742
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:47,859
too big tor you can't lower the light

3743
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:49,840
close enough to the canopy so get the

3744
02:12:47,859 --> 02:12:51,488
appropriate sized stick put three or

3745
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:52,960
four five or six of them in the pot

3746
02:12:51,488 --> 02:12:55,388
depending on how many giant floppy

3747
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:57,819
branch branches you've got then you can

3748
02:12:55,389 --> 02:12:59,469
just pull those big branches down just a

3749
02:12:57,819 --> 02:13:01,149
little bit and attach them to the sticks

3750
02:12:59,469 --> 02:13:02,800
now instead of just having them going

3751
02:13:01,149 --> 02:13:04,479
straight up you've kind of pulled them

3752
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:06,699
down a little bit now they're probably

3753
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:07,988
one or two maybe three inches shorter

3754
02:13:06,698 --> 02:13:10,029
depending on how far you pull them down

3755
02:13:07,988 --> 02:13:11,799
pull them down and a fix them to those

3756
02:13:10,029 --> 02:13:13,329
sticks now you're doing a couple of

3757
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:15,639
things you're making the plant overall

3758
02:13:13,329 --> 02:13:17,439
shorter and you're also widening the

3759
02:13:15,639 --> 02:13:19,029
plant up to let some light get into that

3760
02:13:17,439 --> 02:13:20,500
inner part of the plant where you don't

3761
02:13:19,029 --> 02:13:22,118
have to clean off as much of that crap

3762
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:23,529
in the inside more of the light can

3763
02:13:22,118 --> 02:13:25,899
penetrate in there and you will get more

3764
02:13:23,529 --> 02:13:26,289
production from the inside part of the

3765
02:13:25,899 --> 02:13:28,179
plant

3766
02:13:26,289 --> 02:13:29,859
now these sticks will also work for

3767
02:13:28,179 --> 02:13:31,819
another purpose when those buds start to

3768
02:13:29,859 --> 02:13:33,679
develop and get fat and big those

3769
02:13:31,819 --> 02:13:35,328
dicks will support your buds you're

3770
02:13:33,679 --> 02:13:37,158
going to need something to hold up the

3771
02:13:35,328 --> 02:13:39,289
big buds so now is the time to think

3772
02:13:37,158 --> 02:13:41,299
about it let's work that into our canopy

3773
02:13:39,289 --> 02:13:44,300
control and also our plan for supporting

3774
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:46,010
our buds so sticks is the easiest most

3775
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:48,110
affordable option if you've got a small

3776
02:13:46,010 --> 02:13:50,090
grow if you've got a homegrown sticks

3777
02:13:48,109 --> 02:13:52,609
are probably the most economical if

3778
02:13:50,090 --> 02:13:55,130
you've got several plants a bunch of

3779
02:13:52,609 --> 02:13:56,779
sticks can become a pain in the ass in a

3780
02:13:55,130 --> 02:13:58,699
commercial environment I wouldn't even

3781
02:13:56,779 --> 02:14:00,050
mess with sticks in a commercial

3782
02:13:58,698 --> 02:14:02,328
environment you may want to start

3783
02:14:00,050 --> 02:14:03,889
working with tomato cages you need to

3784
02:14:02,328 --> 02:14:06,859
get the tomato cages on the plants

3785
02:14:03,889 --> 02:14:08,980
before they get too big I usually like a

3786
02:14:06,859 --> 02:14:11,389
tomato cage with about a 16 inch top

3787
02:14:08,979 --> 02:14:13,549
sometimes I will cut the very bottom

3788
02:14:11,389 --> 02:14:15,050
ring off of the tomato cage right flip

3789
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:16,880
it upside down right where that bottom

3790
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:18,230
ring is cut it off you've just made it a

3791
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:20,389
little bit shorter but it's also a

3792
02:14:18,229 --> 02:14:23,598
little bit wider you can customize them

3793
02:14:20,389 --> 02:14:24,770
for your situation so slide the tomato

3794
02:14:23,599 --> 02:14:26,869
cage over the plant

3795
02:14:24,770 --> 02:14:28,400
spread the plant out nice and wide let

3796
02:14:26,868 --> 02:14:30,738
it spread is why it is it will go

3797
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:32,509
encourage it to spread out if you need

3798
02:14:30,738 --> 02:14:34,848
to pull some of the branches out of the

3799
02:14:32,510 --> 02:14:36,860
cage pull it out of the cage and as it

3800
02:14:34,849 --> 02:14:38,960
grows it'll work itself up and when it

3801
02:14:36,859 --> 02:14:41,179
gets real tall put the branch back into

3802
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:43,189
the cage or use those runners up the

3803
02:14:41,179 --> 02:14:43,940
side the side supports and you can

3804
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:46,279
always a fix

3805
02:14:43,939 --> 02:14:49,609
the branches to those side supports by

3806
02:14:46,279 --> 02:14:51,710
using a bread tie or a twisty tie or

3807
02:14:49,609 --> 02:14:53,210
some sort of garden supply twist I there

3808
02:14:51,710 --> 02:14:55,189
are thousands of options for that get

3809
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:56,239
creative I've used a bunch of different

3810
02:14:55,189 --> 02:14:58,578
things we don't need to be too specific

3811
02:14:56,238 --> 02:15:00,408
I use zip ties in most cases but don't

3812
02:14:58,578 --> 02:15:02,299
go too tight so if you got your tomato

3813
02:15:00,408 --> 02:15:03,979
cage on your plant the branches are

3814
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:06,529
falling out and gaining support from the

3815
02:15:03,979 --> 02:15:07,819
outer perimeter of the tomato cage maybe

3816
02:15:06,529 --> 02:15:09,889
you've worked some of the branches up

3817
02:15:07,819 --> 02:15:11,389
the side of that tomato cage maybe you

3818
02:15:09,889 --> 02:15:13,489
pulled some of the branches down and

3819
02:15:11,389 --> 02:15:16,099
spread them out by using those outer

3820
02:15:13,488 --> 02:15:18,678
rings of the tomato cage the tomato cage

3821
02:15:16,099 --> 02:15:20,389
give us a lot of creative options for

3822
02:15:18,679 --> 02:15:23,000
controlling the canopy of our plant

3823
02:15:20,389 --> 02:15:26,750
while at the same time providing support

3824
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:29,029
for our tall heavy buds now if you're

3825
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:30,618
using a tomato cage and you did not top

3826
02:15:29,029 --> 02:15:32,420
your plant which is just fine that is

3827
02:15:30,618 --> 02:15:34,039
always an option you do not have to top

3828
02:15:32,420 --> 02:15:36,380
the plants a lot of people like that one

3829
02:15:34,039 --> 02:15:38,238
big glory but at the top if you're going

3830
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:41,270
for that glory bud and you were using a

3831
02:15:38,238 --> 02:15:43,968
tomato cage you still may need a stick

3832
02:15:41,270 --> 02:15:45,150
to support that giant bud if you grow a

3833
02:15:43,969 --> 02:15:47,250
big fat

3834
02:15:45,149 --> 02:15:49,199
so don't be afraid to make them work

3835
02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:51,270
together you can have a tomato cage with

3836
02:15:49,199 --> 02:15:53,039
a stick holding up that giant bud in the

3837
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:55,530
middle again if you're gonna put a stick

3838
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:57,029
in a giant pot I would kind of recommend

3839
02:15:55,529 --> 02:15:58,649
putting it toward the outer edge and

3840
02:15:57,029 --> 02:16:00,420
then angling it toward the center if you

3841
02:15:58,649 --> 02:16:03,000
need support in the center I don't like

3842
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:04,829
to Ram a bamboo stake right into the

3843
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:06,000
root zone that just feels rude to me if

3844
02:16:04,829 --> 02:16:07,559
you want it to be right in the middle

3845
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,420
because you've got some kind of OCD or

3846
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:11,430
that's where you need to do it you can

3847
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:13,079
do it but just you'll feel it when you

3848
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:16,020
go through those roots and it won't feel

3849
02:16:13,079 --> 02:16:18,210
right so those are two very effective

3850
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:20,160
methods of controlling your canopy and

3851
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:22,350
also supporting the large branches and

3852
02:16:20,159 --> 02:16:24,090
being prepared for having large buds I

3853
02:16:22,350 --> 02:16:25,920
know I kind of glazed over those two

3854
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:28,140
methods those are things you're going to

3855
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:29,609
have to perfect and work on it's going

3856
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:31,410
to be things you have to put your hands

3857
02:16:29,609 --> 02:16:33,000
on to learn how to do it it's kind of an

3858
02:16:31,409 --> 02:16:34,079
art there will be things that you learn

3859
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,329
when you're doing it it will work

3860
02:16:34,079 --> 02:16:38,638
perfectly for your situation it would

3861
02:16:36,329 --> 02:16:40,110
not work for the next guy the sticks are

3862
02:16:38,638 --> 02:16:42,089
really easy because you can just stick

3863
02:16:40,110 --> 02:16:43,469
as many sticks into a pot as you need I

3864
02:16:42,090 --> 02:16:45,899
mean I've seen people go completely

3865
02:16:43,468 --> 02:16:47,519
excessive try not to be too crazy but

3866
02:16:45,899 --> 02:16:49,199
you can stick as many sticks into a pot

3867
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:51,510
of soil as you need to support as many

3868
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:54,210
branches branches as you need and you

3869
02:16:51,510 --> 02:16:56,040
can use fuzzy sticks or bread ties or

3870
02:16:54,209 --> 02:16:58,500
zip ties whatever you need to fix those

3871
02:16:56,040 --> 02:17:00,510
branches to those sticks however you

3872
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:02,159
need it's a little harder to lower the

3873
02:17:00,510 --> 02:17:03,870
canopy that way but you can get big

3874
02:17:02,159 --> 02:17:05,190
branch support that way really easily

3875
02:17:03,870 --> 02:17:07,740
the tomato cages

3876
02:17:05,190 --> 02:17:10,020
you can use the zip ties or the twisty

3877
02:17:07,739 --> 02:17:11,520
ties and you've got round circles to

3878
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:13,170
work with you can use those to keep the

3879
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:16,020
plants down you can bend the branches

3880
02:17:13,170 --> 02:17:18,690
underneath the rings of the tomato cage

3881
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:20,280
or you can use those to support the big

3882
02:17:18,690 --> 02:17:21,899
buds you've got a lot of options there

3883
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:23,429
to work with but you're gonna have to

3884
02:17:21,899 --> 02:17:25,319
play with it to figure it out I can walk

3885
02:17:23,429 --> 02:17:27,569
you so far through it but it's going to

3886
02:17:25,319 --> 02:17:29,250
be strain dependent situational

3887
02:17:27,569 --> 02:17:30,779
dependent but those are very versatile

3888
02:17:29,250 --> 02:17:33,360
tools to work with and I'm sure you'll

3889
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:34,920
find some use now let me quit rambling

3890
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:37,590
and talk about one of my favorite

3891
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:40,829
methods of canopy control which is using

3892
02:17:37,590 --> 02:17:44,340
trellis netting also known as scrog

3893
02:17:40,829 --> 02:17:46,020
netting and of course strog SC ROG just

3894
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:48,600
means screen of green we're using a

3895
02:17:46,020 --> 02:17:51,630
screen to create a nice green canopy

3896
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:55,079
let's talk about creating a screen of

3897
02:17:51,629 --> 02:17:57,239
green the number one most common mistake

3898
02:17:55,079 --> 02:17:58,309
I see people make when they are setting

3899
02:17:57,239 --> 02:18:00,440
up their screen

3900
02:17:58,309 --> 02:18:02,359
or their trellis netting for their

3901
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:05,450
screen of green or for their canopy

3902
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:08,239
control as they put the netting way too

3903
02:18:05,450 --> 02:18:10,100
loose it needs to be tighter you want

3904
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:11,600
that stuff really tight you want it

3905
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:13,280
almost scary tight you want a wide

3906
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:15,380
attention on there you don't want those

3907
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:17,150
squares you don't want the net to move

3908
02:18:15,379 --> 02:18:19,219
at all you want those squares to stay

3909
02:18:17,149 --> 02:18:21,529
right in place because that is what is

3910
02:18:19,219 --> 02:18:23,479
going to control the shape of your plant

3911
02:18:21,530 --> 02:18:26,239
if those things move the plant moves I

3912
02:18:23,479 --> 02:18:28,309
like them tight nice and firm like a

3913
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:29,510
guitar string so let's talk more about

3914
02:18:28,309 --> 02:18:31,639
the netting now that I've already

3915
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:33,889
pointed out the number one mistake let's

3916
02:18:31,639 --> 02:18:35,569
say we're setting up a net in a five by

3917
02:18:33,889 --> 02:18:36,889
five 10 it's really easy to set them up

3918
02:18:35,569 --> 02:18:38,959
in a tent they've already got the poles

3919
02:18:36,889 --> 02:18:40,909
if you don't have poles or something to

3920
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:42,919
fix it to you're going to need to design

3921
02:18:40,909 --> 02:18:44,869
some sort of system you can attach it to

3922
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:47,059
the wall a lot of people will get a

3923
02:18:44,870 --> 02:18:49,250
five-gallon bucket from Lowe's or Home

3924
02:18:47,059 --> 02:18:51,109
Depot they will fill it up with quikrete

3925
02:18:49,250 --> 02:18:53,780
and then they will stick a six foot tall

3926
02:18:51,110 --> 02:18:56,540
PVC pole into their sticking straight up

3927
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:58,010
now you've got a nice vertical pole that

3928
02:18:56,540 --> 02:19:00,050
you can work with to attach your net to

3929
02:18:58,010 --> 02:19:01,850
and that will hold a lot of weight you

3930
02:19:00,049 --> 02:19:03,289
can probably get it tight enough with

3931
02:19:01,850 --> 02:19:04,909
that five-gallon bucket filled with

3932
02:19:03,290 --> 02:19:06,710
cement that'll be enough weight to be

3933
02:19:04,909 --> 02:19:09,200
able to pull those screens super tight

3934
02:19:06,709 --> 02:19:10,879
so get yourself four buckets fill them

3935
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:12,770
up with the quikrete put a six-foot pole

3936
02:19:10,879 --> 02:19:14,779
in each one now you make a little square

3937
02:19:12,770 --> 02:19:17,239
now you can make just about any type of

3938
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:18,140
length or width of shape you need to put

3939
02:19:17,239 --> 02:19:20,149
your trellis netting

3940
02:19:18,139 --> 02:19:22,729
I think they sell it in five by five

3941
02:19:20,149 --> 02:19:24,319
squares five by ten squares if you want

3942
02:19:22,729 --> 02:19:27,739
to go commercial-grade you can get it in

3943
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:29,239
much larger segments sections whatever

3944
02:19:27,739 --> 02:19:31,639
the word you want to use right there you

3945
02:19:29,239 --> 02:19:34,639
can get it in a commercial environment

3946
02:19:31,639 --> 02:19:37,189
I recommend the six-foot wide commercial

3947
02:19:34,639 --> 02:19:40,399
greenhouse tables I have found a six

3948
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:42,680
foot wide roll of plastic trellis

3949
02:19:40,399 --> 02:19:45,109
netting it works beautifully for that

3950
02:19:42,680 --> 02:19:48,530
application at a six feet wide and it is

3951
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:51,200
I think 75 or 120 feet long and it is

3952
02:19:48,530 --> 02:19:53,181
one roll so you just put it up on top of

3953
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:54,980
the trellis you got one guy on one side

3954
02:19:53,181 --> 02:19:57,681
one guy on the other and it's on a roll

3955
02:19:54,979 --> 02:19:59,149
so you just walk and it you zip tie one

3956
02:19:57,681 --> 02:20:00,771
end of it down one and if it down and

3957
02:19:59,149 --> 02:20:01,970
you walk the length you need to be he's

3958
02:20:00,771 --> 02:20:03,530
hip tie the other end a zip tie the

3959
02:20:01,970 --> 02:20:05,299
other end and he cut it off and now the

3960
02:20:03,530 --> 02:20:06,500
trellis net is up yeah of course you got

3961
02:20:05,299 --> 02:20:08,510
to go back through and tighten it by

3962
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:10,129
using more zip ties but that's almost

3963
02:20:08,511 --> 02:20:12,120
kind of fun once you've got it put up

3964
02:20:10,129 --> 02:20:14,429
that easily so the long roll

3965
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:17,100
are amazing they get a little bit heavy

3966
02:20:14,430 --> 02:20:19,139
but if you've got two big dudes I'm 65

3967
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:21,600
my buddy Brian he was six-foot something

3968
02:20:19,139 --> 02:20:24,000
we just grab it lift it just above plant

3969
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:25,409
height walk right down the rows stretch

3970
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,689
out a long enough piece to cover that

3971
02:20:25,409 --> 02:20:28,950
whole row zip tie it at the end and cut

3972
02:20:27,689 --> 02:20:30,510
our section off we'd have another guy

3973
02:20:28,950 --> 02:20:32,220
following behind us and he would put zip

3974
02:20:30,510 --> 02:20:33,809
ties in place to keep it real tight and

3975
02:20:32,219 --> 02:20:35,849
it would take us just a few minutes to

3976
02:20:33,809 --> 02:20:37,590
get each row done so you've got to start

3977
02:20:35,850 --> 02:20:39,329
by spreading out your trellis netting

3978
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:41,370
that's always fun if it comes folded up

3979
02:20:39,329 --> 02:20:43,500
in that little baggy it is such a [ __ ]

3980
02:20:41,370 --> 02:20:44,970
to get that undone good luck you look

3981
02:20:43,500 --> 02:20:46,439
like Spiderman attacked you in [ __ ]

3982
02:20:44,969 --> 02:20:48,329
one you're gonna be there for a few

3983
02:20:46,439 --> 02:20:50,340
minutes getting that unfolded the bigger

3984
02:20:48,329 --> 02:20:52,260
than that the longer it takes don't get

3985
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:53,520
frustrated go smoke a dad and no you

3986
02:20:52,260 --> 02:20:54,809
know what don't smoke a dad because when

3987
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:57,000
you get all stone and you're trying to

3988
02:20:54,809 --> 02:20:59,250
look at that netting that [ __ ] doesn't

3989
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,629
work for your face so just unfold that

3990
02:20:59,250 --> 02:21:02,430
and then once we get it put up we'll go

3991
02:21:00,629 --> 02:21:03,809
take some tabs so unfold the trellis

3992
02:21:02,430 --> 02:21:05,430
netting the best you can it's gonna take

3993
02:21:03,809 --> 02:21:06,959
you a few minutes get it put up on

3994
02:21:05,430 --> 02:21:08,790
whatever poles you've got available I

3995
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:11,398
said we're gonna work in a 5x5 ten

3996
02:21:08,790 --> 02:21:13,920
hopefully you bought a 5x5 section of

3997
02:21:11,398 --> 02:21:16,260
netting it may be too big you may need

3998
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:18,030
to go in a square you may not need to

3999
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:20,639
use that outer square you may need to go

4000
02:21:18,030 --> 02:21:22,649
one or two squares into that grid to

4001
02:21:20,639 --> 02:21:24,930
make it fit tight enough you don't have

4002
02:21:22,648 --> 02:21:26,849
to necessarily use every square of that

4003
02:21:24,930 --> 02:21:28,979
netting we want it tight more than we

4004
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:30,809
want the amount of squares so get that

4005
02:21:28,978 --> 02:21:32,670
net up there tight use a bunch of zip

4006
02:21:30,809 --> 02:21:35,219
ties go excessive if you need it too we

4007
02:21:32,670 --> 02:21:37,500
want that thing fairly tight then lower

4008
02:21:35,219 --> 02:21:39,629
it down onto the plant canopy you'll

4009
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:41,069
watch the plants kind of Bend you want

4010
02:21:39,629 --> 02:21:42,839
to just keep going just kind of bend

4011
02:21:41,069 --> 02:21:44,369
them down just a little bit not too far

4012
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:45,809
maybe like three or four inches they'll

4013
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:47,010
Bend they'll be okay if you see

4014
02:21:45,809 --> 02:21:48,719
something that's about to crack of

4015
02:21:47,010 --> 02:21:50,520
course grab it and give it a hand the

4016
02:21:48,719 --> 02:21:51,989
idea here is to actually lower the

4017
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:53,909
height of all of the plants and we were

4018
02:21:51,989 --> 02:21:55,770
going to use that net to control the

4019
02:21:53,909 --> 02:21:57,450
height of the plants don't worry because

4020
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:59,760
we're gonna go back and manually adjust

4021
02:21:57,450 --> 02:22:01,950
each branch by hand and work it into

4022
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:03,780
this net correctly but right now we just

4023
02:22:01,950 --> 02:22:06,510
kind of want to lower it down and watch

4024
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:08,909
that canopy just become even now you can

4025
02:22:06,510 --> 02:22:11,398
see how this works we have instead of

4026
02:22:08,909 --> 02:22:13,530
one giant bud here one long branch here

4027
02:22:11,398 --> 02:22:15,779
one giant but on a long branch over here

4028
02:22:13,530 --> 02:22:18,180
now we've got a nice even space to work

4029
02:22:15,780 --> 02:22:21,479
with we want to fill all that five by

4030
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:23,489
five net with a bunch of small bud sites

4031
02:22:21,478 --> 02:22:25,889
that will actually turn into more

4032
02:22:23,489 --> 02:22:27,989
productivity than one giant bud

4033
02:22:25,889 --> 02:22:29,279
one giant butt here that are trying to

4034
02:22:27,989 --> 02:22:30,689
touch the light we're fighting those

4035
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:32,220
from getting too hot getting burnt

4036
02:22:30,689 --> 02:22:33,479
getting crispy and then we've got a

4037
02:22:32,219 --> 02:22:35,129
bunch of buds down here that aren't

4038
02:22:33,478 --> 02:22:38,369
getting enough light instead we've got a

4039
02:22:35,129 --> 02:22:40,438
nice five by five screen of green of his

4040
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:42,569
beautiful even buds so let's talk about

4041
02:22:40,439 --> 02:22:45,630
how to work these branches into this net

4042
02:22:42,568 --> 02:22:47,939
to create this desired canopy working a

4043
02:22:45,629 --> 02:22:50,909
section of plants into a trellis net is

4044
02:22:47,939 --> 02:22:53,398
a bit of an art and it will take some

4045
02:22:50,909 --> 02:22:55,170
experience to perfect it think of it

4046
02:22:53,398 --> 02:22:57,898
sort of like weaving we want to weave

4047
02:22:55,170 --> 02:22:59,579
these plants that want to go vertical we

4048
02:22:57,898 --> 02:23:03,059
want to weave them into the net to

4049
02:22:59,579 --> 02:23:04,648
encourage them to go horizontally now

4050
02:23:03,059 --> 02:23:06,269
almost no matter what we do to these

4051
02:23:04,648 --> 02:23:08,369
plants other than kill them they're

4052
02:23:06,270 --> 02:23:10,620
going to try to grow up because earlier

4053
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:13,229
we spoke of that hormone that gives them

4054
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:16,079
apical dominance so we are going to need

4055
02:23:13,228 --> 02:23:16,978
to stay on top of canopy control in this

4056
02:23:16,079 --> 02:23:20,100
trellis system

4057
02:23:16,978 --> 02:23:22,260
the idea is to fill each square of that

4058
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:24,930
trellis net with a branch that will

4059
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:26,850
develop into a substantial bud sight the

4060
02:23:24,930 --> 02:23:29,340
way to start that process is to train

4061
02:23:26,850 --> 02:23:31,439
these plants to spread wide instead of

4062
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:34,020
tall so we use this first layer of

4063
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:36,270
netting to actually spread the plants

4064
02:23:34,020 --> 02:23:38,159
out now what we have to do as the plants

4065
02:23:36,270 --> 02:23:40,140
grow is they will try to pop up out of

4066
02:23:38,159 --> 02:23:42,090
the net we need to go in there everyday

4067
02:23:40,139 --> 02:23:44,309
and grab those branches that tried to

4068
02:23:42,090 --> 02:23:46,350
get away and just push them back under

4069
02:23:44,309 --> 02:23:47,579
that next piece of net so as soon as

4070
02:23:46,350 --> 02:23:49,229
they're long enough to go under net

4071
02:23:47,579 --> 02:23:50,909
underneath the next section just weave

4072
02:23:49,228 --> 02:23:52,559
them right underneath there and what

4073
02:23:50,909 --> 02:23:55,020
will happen is you will develop long

4074
02:23:52,559 --> 02:23:57,329
arms that fill up the entire space and

4075
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:59,370
when we flip it to flower all of those

4076
02:23:57,329 --> 02:24:01,620
branches will develop bud sites that

4077
02:23:59,370 --> 02:24:03,899
will fill up each square of that trellis

4078
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:05,670
netting now instead of having plants

4079
02:24:03,898 --> 02:24:07,049
that just grow big giant buds and grow

4080
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:09,510
up into the light and are really good

4081
02:24:07,049 --> 02:24:11,789
for pictures we are actually producing a

4082
02:24:09,510 --> 02:24:14,969
large crop by utilizing the entire five

4083
02:24:11,790 --> 02:24:16,859
by five canopy space now this will take

4084
02:24:14,969 --> 02:24:18,779
some practice to figure out exactly what

4085
02:24:16,859 --> 02:24:20,729
I'm saying some of you are going to try

4086
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:23,280
to force those plants down too much

4087
02:24:20,728 --> 02:24:25,500
somebody that taught me a lot of tips on

4088
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:27,390
trellis work will tell you give it a

4089
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:29,670
[ __ ] chance you've got to give it

4090
02:24:27,389 --> 02:24:31,590
some more to grow up and win the tips of

4091
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:34,228
the branches like to go up give them a

4092
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:35,818
chance to win but don't be scared to get

4093
02:24:34,228 --> 02:24:38,010
in there and bend them down now

4094
02:24:35,818 --> 02:24:40,228
something that is hard to convey

4095
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:42,989
you just audio without any sort of

4096
02:24:40,228 --> 02:24:45,269
visual is you may think that to get this

4097
02:24:42,989 --> 02:24:47,579
branch the tip of this branch under this

4098
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:49,560
net that you may need to bend it at risk

4099
02:24:47,579 --> 02:24:51,539
type I'm showing myself I'm comparing

4100
02:24:49,559 --> 02:24:53,159
the microphone stand to my wrist the

4101
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:54,359
microphone stand is horizontal my wrist

4102
02:24:53,159 --> 02:24:56,879
is growing up like a plant

4103
02:24:54,359 --> 02:24:59,640
I want to tuck this my wrist underneath

4104
02:24:56,879 --> 02:25:01,619
this piece of trellising instead of

4105
02:24:59,639 --> 02:25:03,148
grabbing at my wrist and bending there

4106
02:25:01,620 --> 02:25:05,579
and tucking that part under I would

4107
02:25:03,148 --> 02:25:07,590
actually go down to elbow height to my

4108
02:25:05,579 --> 02:25:09,329
elbow joint and pop it down there and

4109
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:11,579
bend it underneath the trellis at that

4110
02:25:09,329 --> 02:25:12,779
height that gives me a lot more room for

4111
02:25:11,579 --> 02:25:14,219
when that plant starts growing

4112
02:25:12,779 --> 02:25:16,200
vertically it's gonna grow out

4113
02:25:14,219 --> 02:25:17,489
horizontally because of gravity for a

4114
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:19,140
little while the tip will start growing

4115
02:25:17,489 --> 02:25:21,389
up and it's gonna take it a little bit

4116
02:25:19,139 --> 02:25:24,148
longer to grow up out of that net again

4117
02:25:21,389 --> 02:25:26,219
don't be afraid to crack it lower than

4118
02:25:24,148 --> 02:25:27,840
you think you need to is what I'm trying

4119
02:25:26,219 --> 02:25:29,699
to say hopefully that gave you enough

4120
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:31,469
different explanations to try to catch

4121
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:33,180
on to what I'm saying but if you think

4122
02:25:31,469 --> 02:25:35,159
you need to crack it here to get it

4123
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:36,540
underneath the net that's right here go

4124
02:25:35,159 --> 02:25:38,879
a little lower so you've got more

4125
02:25:36,540 --> 02:25:41,790
bending room to work with and you've

4126
02:25:38,879 --> 02:25:44,250
also got more room for future growth you

4127
02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:46,260
guys trellising and canopy work is an

4128
02:25:44,250 --> 02:25:49,109
art but when you get good at it it will

4129
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:51,029
drastically improve productivity and

4130
02:25:49,109 --> 02:25:52,829
will also make the garden much easier to

4131
02:25:51,029 --> 02:25:54,989
work in because it's much more organized

4132
02:25:52,829 --> 02:25:56,520
and you don't have that one giant bud

4133
02:25:54,989 --> 02:25:58,350
that's trying to grow into the light

4134
02:25:56,520 --> 02:26:00,270
which is so photogenic and it's so

4135
02:25:58,350 --> 02:26:01,950
beautiful to have but it's also such a

4136
02:26:00,270 --> 02:26:04,290
pain in the ass because that's the one

4137
02:26:01,950 --> 02:26:06,569
bud you were working your whole garden

4138
02:26:04,290 --> 02:26:07,950
setup around so you will learn how to

4139
02:26:06,568 --> 02:26:10,049
weave your plants into this nap

4140
02:26:07,950 --> 02:26:11,460
perfectly you will adapt your own style

4141
02:26:10,049 --> 02:26:12,809
you'll I'm sure you're going to the

4142
02:26:11,459 --> 02:26:14,759
Internet to look at pictures of how to

4143
02:26:12,809 --> 02:26:16,799
do it already you'll see a lot of great

4144
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:18,870
stuff on there you will also see a lot

4145
02:26:16,799 --> 02:26:20,818
of trellis nets that were not filled

4146
02:26:18,870 --> 02:26:22,800
sufficiently before the plants were

4147
02:26:20,818 --> 02:26:24,629
flipped into flower fill that [ __ ] out

4148
02:26:22,799 --> 02:26:27,629
it takes a little bit of time it takes

4149
02:26:24,629 --> 02:26:30,778
more work but it is much more rewarding

4150
02:26:27,629 --> 02:26:32,188
than just growing that one glory bud so

4151
02:26:30,779 --> 02:26:33,930
if you're going to use the screen to

4152
02:26:32,189 --> 02:26:37,109
spread them out make sure you fill up

4153
02:26:33,930 --> 02:26:39,389
that canopy before you flip now I also

4154
02:26:37,109 --> 02:26:41,399
recommend a second layer of trellis

4155
02:26:39,389 --> 02:26:43,139
netting I probably would put that one

4156
02:26:41,398 --> 02:26:45,090
depending on the power of your light

4157
02:26:43,139 --> 02:26:47,099
depending on your genetics I would

4158
02:26:45,090 --> 02:26:50,049
probably put my second net somewhere

4159
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:53,140
between 6 and 12 inches above that first

4160
02:26:50,049 --> 02:26:55,118
now the bottom net will fill up you'll

4161
02:26:53,139 --> 02:26:56,948
leave it all in and it will get full now

4162
02:26:55,119 --> 02:26:59,590
you want to let those branches start

4163
02:26:56,949 --> 02:27:01,658
drawing up into that second net you want

4164
02:26:59,590 --> 02:27:03,760
to fill it up Tori you've got one branch

4165
02:27:01,658 --> 02:27:06,219
coming out of each of those bottom

4166
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:07,930
squares and those will grow up into the

4167
02:27:06,219 --> 02:27:10,059
top squares as soon as they hit the top

4168
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:12,908
squares you want a flower now you've got

4169
02:27:10,059 --> 02:27:15,939
a nice six to twelve inch section of

4170
02:27:12,908 --> 02:27:18,180
just rows of buds just rows of branches

4171
02:27:15,939 --> 02:27:21,850
sticking straight up I would almost

4172
02:27:18,180 --> 02:27:24,068
lollipop and bottom and D foliate almost

4173
02:27:21,850 --> 02:27:25,988
everything underneath that first net

4174
02:27:24,068 --> 02:27:28,299
that all gets cleaned off all that Laura

4175
02:27:25,988 --> 02:27:30,038
fee stuff the canopy is the lights not

4176
02:27:28,299 --> 02:27:31,028
gonna penetrate the canopy far enough to

4177
02:27:30,039 --> 02:27:33,369
make that worth anything

4178
02:27:31,029 --> 02:27:35,289
I generally clean all that off so that

4179
02:27:33,369 --> 02:27:37,180
bottom net is there to spread them out

4180
02:27:35,289 --> 02:27:39,130
and give them control you want to spread

4181
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:41,260
the plant that would be growing five

4182
02:27:39,129 --> 02:27:43,448
feet tall straight up we've got it three

4183
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:45,520
feet tall but it's also spread five by

4184
02:27:43,449 --> 02:27:47,229
five feet wide so we're trying to fill

4185
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:49,210
in all that net space then we're gonna

4186
02:27:47,228 --> 02:27:51,129
let it grow a little bit vertically out

4187
02:27:49,209 --> 02:27:53,049
of that until it kind of gets close to

4188
02:27:51,129 --> 02:27:54,849
that next net then we're gonna flower

4189
02:27:53,049 --> 02:27:56,828
all those branches that are sticking

4190
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:59,020
straight up are going to turn into big

4191
02:27:56,828 --> 02:28:01,119
fat buds that will grow into that second

4192
02:27:59,020 --> 02:28:03,460
net that second net at that point is

4193
02:28:01,119 --> 02:28:05,590
going to work as a support it's only

4194
02:28:03,459 --> 02:28:09,038
going to be there to hold up all of your

4195
02:28:05,590 --> 02:28:10,750
giant buds quite often in a commercial

4196
02:28:09,039 --> 02:28:13,090
environment I've had to use a triple

4197
02:28:10,750 --> 02:28:15,520
trellis and sometimes we have considered

4198
02:28:13,090 --> 02:28:17,170
a fourth that's all going to pinned on

4199
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:18,609
your genetics and what kind of lights

4200
02:28:17,170 --> 02:28:20,738
you're using of course we're using

4201
02:28:18,609 --> 02:28:22,809
things like a rise underneath Gavita

4202
02:28:20,738 --> 02:28:25,000
lighting in a commercial environment we

4203
02:28:22,809 --> 02:28:26,648
were getting serious growth if you're in

4204
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:28,779
a tent you're only going to need the

4205
02:28:26,648 --> 02:28:30,908
spread net and then the one net up top

4206
02:28:28,779 --> 02:28:32,260
for support now if you want to use the

4207
02:28:30,908 --> 02:28:34,180
trellis netting and you don't want to

4208
02:28:32,260 --> 02:28:36,309
work it into the net as far if you just

4209
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:38,408
want to use it more for a spread and not

4210
02:28:36,309 --> 02:28:40,988
kind of create the scrog you can do that

4211
02:28:38,408 --> 02:28:42,879
you don't have to work them as far you

4212
02:28:40,988 --> 02:28:45,189
can just put the net on and spread them

4213
02:28:42,879 --> 02:28:47,259
out try to get one stick per branch if

4214
02:28:45,189 --> 02:28:49,510
you can try not to overcrowd anything

4215
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:50,920
the idea is just to spread it out you

4216
02:28:49,510 --> 02:28:52,568
kind of want to spread them make them

4217
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:55,898
shorter than they were tall you want to

4218
02:28:52,568 --> 02:28:57,609
use more of that vertical space somebody

4219
02:28:55,898 --> 02:28:59,408
taught us a long time ago if you've got

4220
02:28:57,609 --> 02:29:01,210
a cooler do you just want to put one

4221
02:28:59,408 --> 02:29:03,380
layer of beer in that cooler or do you

4222
02:29:01,209 --> 02:29:04,850
want to fill that whole cooler up with

4223
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:06,439
year that's kind of what we're trying to

4224
02:29:04,851 --> 02:29:07,881
do with our canopy we don't just want a

4225
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:09,771
couple of beers touching the white we

4226
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:11,149
don't want to make a beer tower we want

4227
02:29:09,771 --> 02:29:13,070
to knock all those beers down and put

4228
02:29:11,149 --> 02:29:14,360
them in one nice a case just like they

4229
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:15,950
were sold in because that's how they

4230
02:29:14,361 --> 02:29:17,121
stack the best that's how you can fill

4231
02:29:15,950 --> 02:29:19,070
it the best I'm not even a beer drinker

4232
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:21,110
and I still want to fit as many beers as

4233
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:23,001
we can in a cooler also I should

4234
02:29:21,111 --> 02:29:25,400
recommend an article I read a long time

4235
02:29:23,001 --> 02:29:27,229
ago by an author named Eric Bix ax the

4236
02:29:25,399 --> 02:29:29,960
article was called growing on the grid

4237
02:29:27,229 --> 02:29:31,911
and it was exactly on this subject it

4238
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:34,399
talked about maximizing your growth

4239
02:29:31,911 --> 02:29:36,531
potential by utilizing the horizontal

4240
02:29:34,399 --> 02:29:38,931
space not just the vertical space that

4241
02:29:36,531 --> 02:29:40,371
our plants try to create so one thing I

4242
02:29:38,931 --> 02:29:42,051
should mention is that you will not be

4243
02:29:40,370 --> 02:29:44,450
able to move these plants once you put

4244
02:29:42,050 --> 02:29:46,399
the trellis net on so you've got to do

4245
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:48,800
this in whatever room these plants will

4246
02:29:46,399 --> 02:29:51,081
be flowering in I started the example by

4247
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:52,939
using a five by five grow tent so in

4248
02:29:51,081 --> 02:29:55,640
most cases we would vention that five by

4249
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:57,621
five put up the sprog then flowered in

4250
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:59,751
that five by five not a big deal if you

4251
02:29:57,620 --> 02:30:01,700
are vegging and flowering in a different

4252
02:29:59,751 --> 02:30:03,951
environment you will have to veg them

4253
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:06,590
drag them to the flowering room try to

4254
02:30:03,950 --> 02:30:08,060
put that trellis up on day one spread

4255
02:30:06,591 --> 02:30:09,890
them out nice and wide you're not going

4256
02:30:08,060 --> 02:30:11,540
to be able to work them in too much but

4257
02:30:09,890 --> 02:30:13,490
you can kind of bend and manipulate the

4258
02:30:11,540 --> 02:30:16,070
plants a little bit without causing any

4259
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:18,171
problems use the cracking technique I

4260
02:30:16,070 --> 02:30:19,940
talked about earlier grab the branch

4261
02:30:18,171 --> 02:30:21,591
give it a little bit of a twist and bend

4262
02:30:19,940 --> 02:30:23,451
it over just a little bit you'll be able

4263
02:30:21,591 --> 02:30:25,070
to create a little knuckle there also

4264
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:27,530
create a nice smooth bed you can control

4265
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:28,970
the plant aim it any direction you want

4266
02:30:27,531 --> 02:30:31,071
move it over to the section of the

4267
02:30:28,970 --> 02:30:33,050
trellis you need it just be very gentle

4268
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:34,761
with them give them several days to

4269
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:36,950
recover before you go back in and crack

4270
02:30:34,761 --> 02:30:38,211
them again this is pretty much how we're

4271
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:39,590
forced to do it in a commercial

4272
02:30:38,210 --> 02:30:41,840
environment because we don't veg and

4273
02:30:39,591 --> 02:30:43,761
flower in the same room we usually have

4274
02:30:41,841 --> 02:30:45,560
one large veg area and multiple

4275
02:30:43,761 --> 02:30:47,720
flowering rooms so that we can keep our

4276
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:50,181
petrol cycles going in a commercial

4277
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:52,100
environment one of my major goals is to

4278
02:30:50,181 --> 02:30:54,560
harvest and refill a room in the same

4279
02:30:52,101 --> 02:30:57,381
day I know that doesn't sound like a big

4280
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:59,540
challenge but imagine if you've got 300

4281
02:30:57,380 --> 02:31:01,671
plants in one room you've got a bunch of

4282
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:03,740
trellis netting it takes half of the day

4283
02:31:01,671 --> 02:31:05,781
to get it cut down then you got to clean

4284
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:07,040
the room spotless then try to refill it

4285
02:31:05,781 --> 02:31:09,230
that's always fun

4286
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:11,000
then we throw the net on then we spend

4287
02:31:09,229 --> 02:31:13,011
the rest of the day just spreading those

4288
02:31:11,001 --> 02:31:15,649
plants out and adjusting that net tore

4289
02:31:13,011 --> 02:31:17,060
those plants aren't too angry with us so

4290
02:31:15,649 --> 02:31:20,000
that is my long sigh

4291
02:31:17,059 --> 02:31:22,129
Trek rambley talk on sticks cages and

4292
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,930
trellis netting and canopy control I've

4293
02:31:22,129 --> 02:31:25,969
got a couple more quick things to cover

4294
02:31:23,930 --> 02:31:29,090
on this list of ways to improve our

4295
02:31:25,969 --> 02:31:31,250
productivity while in veg the next thing

4296
02:31:29,090 --> 02:31:34,309
on my list is integrated pest management

4297
02:31:31,250 --> 02:31:37,430
and scouting we should probably be

4298
02:31:34,309 --> 02:31:39,439
applying a preventive pesticide regimen

4299
02:31:37,430 --> 02:31:41,779
to our plants at this time if you're

4300
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:43,488
going to use a spray application now is

4301
02:31:41,779 --> 02:31:45,800
the time to get started if you're going

4302
02:31:43,488 --> 02:31:47,510
to use predator bugs now is the time to

4303
02:31:45,799 --> 02:31:50,269
order them and get them prepared so that

4304
02:31:47,510 --> 02:31:52,880
we have a nice colony before we go into

4305
02:31:50,270 --> 02:31:54,920
flower one thing a lot of growers

4306
02:31:52,879 --> 02:31:58,219
overlook at this stage of the game is

4307
02:31:54,920 --> 02:32:00,350
manually scouting for pests one of your

4308
02:31:58,219 --> 02:32:03,019
best tools and finding bugs in your grow

4309
02:32:00,350 --> 02:32:04,970
is your own eyes spend a little time

4310
02:32:03,020 --> 02:32:07,600
walking through the garden and just

4311
02:32:04,969 --> 02:32:10,188
looking for pests or signs of pests

4312
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:12,140
nature really likes to give us hints

4313
02:32:10,189 --> 02:32:15,078
that there are problems in our garden

4314
02:32:12,139 --> 02:32:17,238
every pest that comes in gives us some

4315
02:32:15,078 --> 02:32:19,010
kind of a warning if you were on top of

4316
02:32:17,238 --> 02:32:20,539
your game you've got some yellow sticky

4317
02:32:19,010 --> 02:32:23,270
traps hanging up and you were checking

4318
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:25,369
those on a daily basis they will give

4319
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:27,529
you a fair warning that you've got bugs

4320
02:32:25,369 --> 02:32:29,779
coming in you know how they'll tell you

4321
02:32:27,529 --> 02:32:32,270
there will be bugs stuck to the yellow

4322
02:32:29,779 --> 02:32:35,238
card how much more obvious can it get so

4323
02:32:32,270 --> 02:32:38,600
check the yellow sticky traps then walk

4324
02:32:35,238 --> 02:32:40,430
every row every few feet reach into the

4325
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:43,369
canopy and grab a leaf pull it right off

4326
02:32:40,430 --> 02:32:45,229
flip it upside down look at it do you

4327
02:32:43,369 --> 02:32:47,449
see any bugs on the underside of the

4328
02:32:45,228 --> 02:32:49,488
leaf do you see any eggs on the

4329
02:32:47,449 --> 02:32:51,199
underside of the leaf look at the top

4330
02:32:49,488 --> 02:32:53,448
side of the leaf do you see any

4331
02:32:51,199 --> 02:32:55,100
stippling that is spider mite damage do

4332
02:32:53,449 --> 02:32:57,050
you see any honeydew that is thrip

4333
02:32:55,100 --> 02:32:59,090
damage do you see anything that just

4334
02:32:57,049 --> 02:33:01,250
doesn't look right that could be a sign

4335
02:32:59,090 --> 02:33:03,619
of over feeding under feeding or pH

4336
02:33:01,250 --> 02:33:05,449
problems pay attention to the plants and

4337
02:33:03,619 --> 02:33:07,279
they will tell you when something is

4338
02:33:05,449 --> 02:33:07,908
starting to go wrong and you won't need

4339
02:33:07,279 --> 02:33:11,210
to panic

4340
02:33:07,908 --> 02:33:13,639
so scout on a daily basis walk through

4341
02:33:11,209 --> 02:33:16,188
the grow look at the plants look for

4342
02:33:13,639 --> 02:33:18,228
might damage look for thrip damage go

4343
02:33:16,189 --> 02:33:20,479
smack the pots just give a couple pots

4344
02:33:18,228 --> 02:33:22,908
of good smack does anything fly out if

4345
02:33:20,478 --> 02:33:25,039
so you've got fungus gnats those are

4346
02:33:22,908 --> 02:33:28,250
really easy to treat if you find them

4347
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:30,240
early scout for bugs teach all of your

4348
02:33:28,250 --> 02:33:32,879
helpers to scout for bugs

4349
02:33:30,239 --> 02:33:35,159
look for spider mite webbing also look

4350
02:33:32,879 --> 02:33:37,229
for powdery mildew look for anything

4351
02:33:35,159 --> 02:33:40,110
that just doesn't look right if you were

4352
02:33:37,229 --> 02:33:42,090
a crew leader teach people how to

4353
02:33:40,110 --> 02:33:44,310
properly report the things that they see

4354
02:33:42,090 --> 02:33:45,870
so they know when to come to you some

4355
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:48,299
people say how doesn't look like a big

4356
02:33:45,870 --> 02:33:49,920
deal teach them what is a big deal and

4357
02:33:48,299 --> 02:33:51,899
what is not a big deal

4358
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:53,760
so always be on the lookout for bugs

4359
02:33:51,899 --> 02:33:55,470
always be scouting and know what you're

4360
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:57,690
looking for you're looking for mites and

4361
02:33:55,470 --> 02:33:59,579
mite damage which is webbing stippling

4362
02:33:57,690 --> 02:34:01,170
while you're looking for thrip [ __ ]

4363
02:33:59,579 --> 02:34:03,060
you're looking for thrip honeydew that

4364
02:34:01,170 --> 02:34:05,129
glazy stuff on the lower leaves that's

4365
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:06,899
from your thrips when you tap the pots

4366
02:34:05,129 --> 02:34:08,879
those little black things that fly up

4367
02:34:06,899 --> 02:34:10,470
those are fungus gnats when you shake

4368
02:34:08,879 --> 02:34:12,869
the leaves those little white bugs that

4369
02:34:10,470 --> 02:34:14,129
fly out those are white flies be aware

4370
02:34:12,870 --> 02:34:16,710
of what you're looking for and

4371
02:34:14,129 --> 02:34:18,720
constantly be looking for them healthy

4372
02:34:16,709 --> 02:34:20,879
plants will be much more vigorous and

4373
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:24,000
much more productive than plants that

4374
02:34:20,879 --> 02:34:25,829
are fighting off insects also scouting

4375
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,601
is free it doesn't cost you anything to

4376
02:34:25,829 --> 02:34:30,479
walk through your grow and look for bugs

4377
02:34:27,601 --> 02:34:31,739
you should enjoy it put on a podcast put

4378
02:34:30,479 --> 02:34:33,810
on the grill from your heart podcast

4379
02:34:31,739 --> 02:34:35,879
there on the dude grows put on some Joe

4380
02:34:33,810 --> 02:34:37,920
Rogan and just stroll through the garden

4381
02:34:35,879 --> 02:34:39,930
and go see what you can find a day go

4382
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:41,760
find the problem chances are there's

4383
02:34:39,931 --> 02:34:42,120
something wrong you just need to go find

4384
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:43,829
it

4385
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:45,540
alright I'll quit ranting about IPM

4386
02:34:43,829 --> 02:34:47,159
hopefully I have inspired you to go look

4387
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:49,290
for bugs in your garden you know what

4388
02:34:47,159 --> 02:34:50,819
else is free it will really improve the

4389
02:34:49,290 --> 02:34:53,490
quality of your garden overall is

4390
02:34:50,819 --> 02:34:55,649
note-taking write down everything you do

4391
02:34:53,489 --> 02:34:57,149
that way when something goes wrong you

4392
02:34:55,649 --> 02:34:59,039
know what to blame it on and you know

4393
02:34:57,149 --> 02:35:00,931
what not to do next time I've done an

4394
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:02,190
entire episode on journaling I'm not

4395
02:35:00,931 --> 02:35:04,230
gonna rant too much on that right now

4396
02:35:02,190 --> 02:35:05,310
I've got one more thing to talk about

4397
02:35:04,229 --> 02:35:07,199
and then we're gonna wrap up this

4398
02:35:05,310 --> 02:35:09,390
podcast because my throw is starting to

4399
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:11,851
burn out another way we can increase

4400
02:35:09,390 --> 02:35:15,239
productivity and vigor of our veg plants

4401
02:35:11,851 --> 02:35:18,090
is to augment the co2 levels in our grow

4402
02:35:15,239 --> 02:35:19,709
room the ambient co2 level in your

4403
02:35:18,090 --> 02:35:22,799
environment is probably hovering

4404
02:35:19,709 --> 02:35:24,299
somewhere between 300 and 400 particles

4405
02:35:22,799 --> 02:35:26,340
per million that is just about the

4406
02:35:24,299 --> 02:35:28,259
standard on earth and my last research

4407
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:30,360
depends on where you are your elevation

4408
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:32,880
what kind of city you're in but it's

4409
02:35:30,360 --> 02:35:36,300
somewhere between 300 and 400 particles

4410
02:35:32,879 --> 02:35:38,879
per million our plants would prefer

4411
02:35:36,299 --> 02:35:41,819
somewhere around a thousand particles

4412
02:35:38,879 --> 02:35:43,739
per million vacant take up to 1,200

4413
02:35:41,819 --> 02:35:45,959
maybe 1500 I've even seen

4414
02:35:43,739 --> 02:35:48,360
I'll push them closer to 2,000 particles

4415
02:35:45,959 --> 02:35:51,419
per million of co2 and the plants just

4416
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:53,069
explode with vigorous growth now there

4417
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:55,620
are several ways that you can increase

4418
02:35:53,069 --> 02:35:57,840
the co2 in your room one thing I need to

4419
02:35:55,620 --> 02:35:59,370
mention once you start increasing the

4420
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:02,310
amount of co2 in your grow room

4421
02:35:59,370 --> 02:36:05,579
environment it is very unhealthy for the

4422
02:36:02,310 --> 02:36:07,860
plants to let the co2 levels decline

4423
02:36:05,579 --> 02:36:09,510
past what you have now increased it too

4424
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:11,550
so if you start boosting it to a

4425
02:36:09,510 --> 02:36:14,550
thousand you either need to keep it at a

4426
02:36:11,549 --> 02:36:16,859
thousand or increase through flower your

4427
02:36:14,549 --> 02:36:19,470
plant is expecting this co2 as a new

4428
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:21,329
food source it is now feeding itself

4429
02:36:19,470 --> 02:36:23,279
like it's got another food source you

4430
02:36:21,329 --> 02:36:25,709
have now put your plant into another

4431
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:27,420
level of high performance it's expecting

4432
02:36:25,709 --> 02:36:30,000
to get that high performance fuel it's

4433
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:33,690
adjusted its diet accordingly if you cut

4434
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,489
off that co2 that extra co2 it will not

4435
02:36:33,690 --> 02:36:38,101
be feeding itself properly you will

4436
02:36:35,489 --> 02:36:40,229
start seeing nutrient burn so make sure

4437
02:36:38,101 --> 02:36:42,391
you keep up on your co2 habit if you

4438
02:36:40,229 --> 02:36:44,010
start that habit and also if you run out

4439
02:36:42,390 --> 02:36:46,319
and the plants start acting a little

4440
02:36:44,010 --> 02:36:47,790
funny that is probably what is causing

4441
02:36:46,319 --> 02:36:49,860
it as they're still craving that co2

4442
02:36:47,790 --> 02:36:51,420
they're still trying to readjust their

4443
02:36:49,860 --> 02:36:53,159
metabolism because they're still on that

4444
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:55,260
high performance mode and they're not

4445
02:36:53,159 --> 02:36:57,720
sure what to do yet so that was my last

4446
02:36:55,260 --> 02:37:00,540
tip for increasing performance and

4447
02:36:57,720 --> 02:37:02,970
productivity and vigor of our veg plants

4448
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:04,471
I shared a lot of my dirty secrets a lot

4449
02:37:02,970 --> 02:37:05,909
of the things that I use in my personal

4450
02:37:04,470 --> 02:37:07,619
grows a lot of things that I use in the

4451

4487
02:38:17,789 --> 02:38:21,539
show cannabis community it's time for

4488
02:38:19,469 --> 02:38:23,760
episode 374 of the girl from your heart

4489
02:38:21,539 --> 02:38:25,260
podcast this episode of the show is

4490
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:27,238
brought to you by the hella dank seed

4491
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:28,978
company if you need new seeds for your

4492
02:38:27,238 --> 02:38:31,139
garden I highly recommend the hell a

4493
02:38:28,978 --> 02:38:39,568
dank seed company and you can find them

4494
02:38:31,139 --> 02:38:42,269
at www.ge.com I know what I'm smoking I

4495
02:38:39,568 --> 02:38:45,359
just took a gigantic dab of sour Klem

4496
02:38:42,270 --> 02:38:48,029
ambrosia the label says it has 71 point

4497
02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:50,430
1 percent THC and a total of eighty five

4498
02:38:48,029 --> 02:38:52,140
point seven percent cannabinoids it does

4499
02:38:50,430 --> 02:38:54,090
not have much more information on the

4500
02:38:52,139 --> 02:38:56,608
label here this came from our friends at

4501
02:38:54,090 --> 02:38:58,469
apothecary farms in Pueblo that's right

4502
02:38:56,609 --> 02:39:00,328
apothecary has recently opened a Pueblo

4503
02:38:58,469 --> 02:39:02,549
location so make sure you check that out

4504
02:39:00,328 --> 02:39:05,068
but today I picked up the sour clam

4505
02:39:02,549 --> 02:39:07,318
ambrosia I think it is Sour Diesel and

4506
02:39:05,068 --> 02:39:10,439
clementine it's got a really sweet

4507
02:39:07,318 --> 02:39:14,129
delicious orange e citrusy Clementine

4508
02:39:10,439 --> 02:39:17,248
aroma followed by a funky Sour Diesel

4509
02:39:14,129 --> 02:39:18,868
lis just nasty aroma in the background

4510
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:20,850
and I say nasty but I mean it in the

4511
02:39:18,869 --> 02:39:22,649
best way it is delicious it is pungent

4512
02:39:20,850 --> 02:39:24,479
so it's a little sweet it's a little

4513
02:39:22,648 --> 02:39:25,948
sour and then when you dab it it goes

4514
02:39:24,478 --> 02:39:27,809
straight to the brain and makes your

4515
02:39:25,949 --> 02:39:29,430
eyes open wide up it makes you talk a

4516
02:39:27,809 --> 02:39:32,578
lot it makes you real rambly so I think

4517
02:39:29,430 --> 02:39:34,229
this will be great podcast dabs shout

4518
02:39:32,578 --> 02:39:35,818
out to our friends and Apothecary farms

4519
02:39:34,228 --> 02:39:38,038
and an extra big shout out to the pueblo

4520
02:39:35,818 --> 02:39:40,498
crew i'm really digging this batch of

4521
02:39:38,039 --> 02:39:42,449
sour Klem ambrosia all right you guys

4522
02:39:40,498 --> 02:39:44,488
let's jump into a podcast I want to do

4523
02:39:42,449 --> 02:39:46,408
another grow lesson I've been doing a

4524
02:39:44,488 --> 02:39:48,629
long series of grow lessons if you're a

4525
02:39:46,408 --> 02:39:51,118
new listener I suggest you go back to at

4526
02:39:48,629 --> 02:39:53,009
least episode 351 and start on the grow

4527
02:39:51,119 --> 02:39:54,869
lesson series if you feel like you're

4528
02:39:53,010 --> 02:39:58,199
caught up welcome to the grow lessons

4529
02:39:54,869 --> 02:40:00,720
today we are going to do a before flower

4530
02:39:58,199 --> 02:40:02,699
checkup so far in my grow lessons we

4531
02:40:00,719 --> 02:40:04,708
should have healthy happy veg plants

4532
02:40:02,699 --> 02:40:07,408
that are in their final finishing pots I

4533
02:40:04,709 --> 02:40:09,359
suggested 3 5 or 7 gallon pots if you

4534
02:40:07,408 --> 02:40:10,529
want to go larger you do it your way it

4535
02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:12,059
is your grow

4536
02:40:10,530 --> 02:40:13,680
hopefully you've topped these plants

4537
02:40:12,059 --> 02:40:15,090
you've got a nice canopy going hopefully

4538
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:17,489
you've got a big fat healthy root system

4539
02:40:15,090 --> 02:40:19,590
going we're aiming for healthy happy

4540
02:40:17,489 --> 02:40:21,329
plants that are thriving hopefully we

4541
02:40:19,590 --> 02:40:23,130
don't have any bugs hopefully you

4542
02:40:21,329 --> 02:40:25,709
haven't over fertilized hopefully you

4543
02:40:23,129 --> 02:40:27,779
haven't had any pH issues hopefully we

4544
02:40:25,709 --> 02:40:29,039
haven't had any environmental problems

4545
02:40:27,780 --> 02:40:30,720
that we didn't expect hopefully

4546
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:32,940
everything's going well and you've got

4547
02:40:30,719 --> 02:40:34,679
big fat healthy plants that are almost

4548
02:40:32,940 --> 02:40:36,390
ready to flower they're probably about

4549
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:38,100
knee-high at this point maybe a little

4550
02:40:36,389 --> 02:40:39,539
bit taller depending on what kind of

4551
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:41,309
lights you're using what kind of

4552
02:40:39,540 --> 02:40:43,050
genetics you're working with how often

4553
02:40:41,309 --> 02:40:44,549
you've been feeding them what kind of

4554
02:40:43,049 --> 02:40:46,559
treatment you've been giving them our

4555
02:40:44,549 --> 02:40:48,209
plants are probably getting large enough

4556
02:40:46,559 --> 02:40:49,559
to consider putting them into flower

4557
02:40:48,209 --> 02:40:51,299
very soon

4558
02:40:49,559 --> 02:40:53,039
before we go into flower I feel like

4559
02:40:51,299 --> 02:40:55,319
there are a few important points we

4560
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:58,500
should cover so let's go over my before

4561
02:40:55,319 --> 02:41:00,209
flower checkup as it gets close to

4562
02:40:58,500 --> 02:41:02,909
flower time one of the first things I

4563
02:41:00,209 --> 02:41:05,009
think about is do I have clones

4564
02:41:02,909 --> 02:41:07,319
do you have clones for the next run do

4565
02:41:05,010 --> 02:41:09,899
you want to be self-sufficient if so you

4566
02:41:07,319 --> 02:41:11,819
need to create clones for your next run

4567
02:41:09,899 --> 02:41:14,489
before you put your plants in the flower

4568
02:41:11,819 --> 02:41:16,590
I don't recommend taking clones from

4569
02:41:14,489 --> 02:41:18,030
flowering plants some people will do it

4570
02:41:16,590 --> 02:41:20,370
some people will teach you how to do it

4571
02:41:18,030 --> 02:41:22,200
that is not my style I highly recommend

4572
02:41:20,370 --> 02:41:24,510
that you get your clones from your

4573
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:25,320
vegging plants so before you put your

4574
02:41:24,510 --> 02:41:27,210
plants into flower

4575
02:41:25,319 --> 02:41:29,789
do you have clones do you have a way to

4576
02:41:27,209 --> 02:41:31,679
supply plants for your next cycle if you

4577
02:41:29,790 --> 02:41:33,720
plan on growing from seed again or if

4578
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:35,489
you plan on purchasing new clones from a

4579
02:41:33,719 --> 02:41:37,199
friend or a dispensary or however you

4580
02:41:35,489 --> 02:41:38,340
get your clones that's cool

4581
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:40,710
if you're trying to be self-sufficient

4582
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:43,620
now is the time to think about making

4583
02:41:40,709 --> 02:41:44,819
clones from your current plants now if

4584
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:46,920
you decide that you want to be

4585
02:41:44,819 --> 02:41:48,779
self-sufficient you've got a couple of

4586
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:50,819
options you may want to designate one of

4587
02:41:48,780 --> 02:41:53,220
your clones as a mother plant

4588
02:41:50,819 --> 02:41:55,709
here's the idea behind a mother plant a

4589
02:41:53,219 --> 02:41:57,929
mother plant is a clone of a plant that

4590
02:41:55,709 --> 02:42:00,059
we have grown and tested and we know is

4591
02:41:57,930 --> 02:42:01,800
reliable we know that that plant is a

4592
02:42:00,059 --> 02:42:03,479
female we know that it puts off a good

4593
02:42:01,799 --> 02:42:05,069
harvest weight we know that it is potent

4594
02:42:03,479 --> 02:42:06,510
we know that it tastes good and we

4595
02:42:05,069 --> 02:42:09,119
hopefully have learned that it is

4596
02:42:06,510 --> 02:42:11,250
pathogen and pest resistant so we've got

4597
02:42:09,120 --> 02:42:12,990
a reliable strain that we want to keep

4598
02:42:11,250 --> 02:42:14,399
around in the garden and the way we do

4599
02:42:12,989 --> 02:42:16,739
that is just by keeping it in a

4600
02:42:14,399 --> 02:42:18,989
vegetative stage perpetually and then we

4601
02:42:16,739 --> 02:42:20,399
can take clones from it as needed the

4602
02:42:18,989 --> 02:42:22,739
way you keep that mother plant in a

4603
02:42:20,399 --> 02:42:23,739
vegetative stage is by leaving it under

4604
02:42:22,739 --> 02:42:25,181
at least 18

4605
02:42:23,739 --> 02:42:27,310
hours of light everyday for mother

4606
02:42:25,181 --> 02:42:29,471
plants sometimes I would recommend 20 on

4607
02:42:27,310 --> 02:42:31,270
and for off maybe for stubborn mother

4608
02:42:29,470 --> 02:42:33,489
plants I may even go all the way up to

4609
02:42:31,271 --> 02:42:36,040
24 hours on we've talked a little bit

4610
02:42:33,489 --> 02:42:37,869
about that in previous episodes I've

4611
02:42:36,040 --> 02:42:39,811
also done a full episode about mother

4612
02:42:37,870 --> 02:42:42,880
plants I suggest you check out episode

4613
02:42:39,810 --> 02:42:45,190
315 for a full breakdown of mother

4614
02:42:42,879 --> 02:42:47,170
plants now if you don't have room in

4615
02:42:45,190 --> 02:42:48,819
space for an extra plant maybe you just

4616
02:42:47,170 --> 02:42:50,290
can't have that extra plant because of

4617
02:42:48,819 --> 02:42:53,470
your plant count because of state laws

4618
02:42:50,290 --> 02:42:56,200
another option is to clone off of your

4619
02:42:53,470 --> 02:42:58,270
veg plants perpetually a lot of people

4620
02:42:56,200 --> 02:43:00,070
will say that will create something we

4621
02:42:58,271 --> 02:43:01,391
used to call genetic drift I do not

4622
02:43:00,069 --> 02:43:03,399
believe in that if the plants are

4623
02:43:01,390 --> 02:43:05,949
healthy I've done a full Episode on that

4624
02:43:03,399 --> 02:43:08,199
as well let's get back on track the idea

4625
02:43:05,950 --> 02:43:10,300
of taking clones from your veg plants is

4626
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:12,221
very simple you've got veg plants

4627
02:43:10,299 --> 02:43:13,449
they're about to go into flower right

4628
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:15,850
before you take them into the flower

4629
02:43:13,450 --> 02:43:18,311
room take a couple of clones off of each

4630
02:43:15,851 --> 02:43:20,141
of your veg plants if you have faith in

4631
02:43:18,310 --> 02:43:21,970
your clone taking skills and you don't

4632
02:43:20,140 --> 02:43:24,670
have room for an extra mother plant this

4633
02:43:21,970 --> 02:43:26,500
is an ideal way to do things again some

4634
02:43:24,670 --> 02:43:28,870
people may claim that this will result

4635
02:43:26,500 --> 02:43:30,879
in genetic drift I do not believe in

4636
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:33,250
genetic drift I don't believe in it so

4637
02:43:30,879 --> 02:43:35,560
much that I have changed my vocabulary

4638
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:38,351
to where I call what is known as genetic

4639
02:43:35,560 --> 02:43:40,510
drift to regenerative mutation I've done

4640
02:43:38,351 --> 02:43:42,130
a full Episode on genetic drift if you'd

4641
02:43:40,510 --> 02:43:43,931
like to learn more about it I recommend

4642
02:43:42,129 --> 02:43:46,180
you listen to the episode and that's

4643
02:43:43,931 --> 02:43:48,190
episode number 343 and it's actually

4644
02:43:46,181 --> 02:43:50,021
titled genetic drift I suggest you give

4645
02:43:48,190 --> 02:43:53,170
it a listen and understand why we now

4646
02:43:50,021 --> 02:43:54,700
call it regenerative mutation so the

4647
02:43:53,170 --> 02:43:57,340
point of that rant is to make sure that

4648
02:43:54,700 --> 02:43:59,290
you have got clones for your next run if

4649
02:43:57,340 --> 02:44:00,940
you don't have a supplier a provider or

4650
02:43:59,290 --> 02:44:03,250
a source for your next batch of clones

4651
02:44:00,940 --> 02:44:05,530
it may be really advantageous to take a

4652
02:44:03,250 --> 02:44:07,181
few clones start vegging them out so

4653
02:44:05,530 --> 02:44:08,920
that way you've got another crop lined

4654
02:44:07,181 --> 02:44:10,721
up before you even have this one

4655
02:44:08,920 --> 02:44:12,700
finished if you really want to max

4656
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:14,079
productivity of your grow you'll start

4657
02:44:12,700 --> 02:44:16,120
running what is known as a perpetual

4658
02:44:14,079 --> 02:44:17,860
grow where you use two spaces you've got

4659
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:20,110
a veg space you've got a flowering space

4660
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:22,540
as soon as that flowering crop is done

4661
02:44:20,110 --> 02:44:24,579
you cut it down you clean the room you

4662
02:44:22,540 --> 02:44:26,380
reset the room and you drag a set of

4663
02:44:24,579 --> 02:44:28,450
flowering plants right back in there and

4664
02:44:26,379 --> 02:44:30,520
you never miss a beat that room never

4665
02:44:28,450 --> 02:44:32,021
gets a break so you're always on top of

4666
02:44:30,521 --> 02:44:33,971
production which means you always have

4667
02:44:32,021 --> 02:44:35,800
to have a supply of clones so you'll

4668
02:44:33,970 --> 02:44:36,920
have veg plants you'll cut a few clones

4669
02:44:35,799 --> 02:44:38,779
off of them

4670
02:44:36,920 --> 02:44:40,879
cut down your flowering plants you clean

4671
02:44:38,780 --> 02:44:42,320
up that room drag those veg plants right

4672
02:44:40,879 --> 02:44:43,789
into there and then you'll start growing

4673
02:44:42,319 --> 02:44:45,889
those little clones up into the next

4674
02:44:43,790 --> 02:44:47,390
batch there'll be your veg plants you

4675
02:44:45,889 --> 02:44:49,699
have to top them you have to train them

4676
02:44:47,389 --> 02:44:51,379
you've got a full nine weeks to get them

4677
02:44:49,700 --> 02:44:53,270
as big as you need them and get them

4678
02:44:51,379 --> 02:44:55,009
prepared for the next run so when that

4679
02:44:53,270 --> 02:44:56,899
flowering crop gets done that you've got

4680
02:44:55,010 --> 02:44:59,270
in the flowering room you cut it down

4681
02:44:56,899 --> 02:45:01,579
clean it up drag those veg plants right

4682
02:44:59,270 --> 02:45:03,350
in there but before you do that you take

4683
02:45:01,579 --> 02:45:05,000
a few clones so that you can keep the

4684
02:45:03,350 --> 02:45:07,520
cycle going the idea is to create a

4685
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:09,170
perpetual cycle for yourself so you're

4686
02:45:07,520 --> 02:45:11,329
always self-sufficient you never have to

4687
02:45:09,170 --> 02:45:13,069
bring anything in from outside that way

4688
02:45:11,329 --> 02:45:14,659
you can keep the grow clean that way you

4689
02:45:13,069 --> 02:45:16,219
know if you get any bugs or any pests

4690
02:45:14,659 --> 02:45:18,379
it's your fault you can't blame anybody

4691
02:45:16,219 --> 02:45:20,329
else but it really limits the

4692
02:45:18,379 --> 02:45:21,589
opportunities to bring in problems and

4693
02:45:20,329 --> 02:45:24,590
it also helps you develop a relationship

4694
02:45:21,590 --> 02:45:26,569
with one strain if you run a perpetual

4695
02:45:24,590 --> 02:45:28,639
grow with just one maybe two strains max

4696
02:45:26,569 --> 02:45:30,170
you can really dial those strains in you

4697
02:45:28,639 --> 02:45:31,699
can build a relationship with them and

4698
02:45:30,170 --> 02:45:33,920
then you can get them to reach their

4699
02:45:31,700 --> 02:45:36,409
full potential there are several ways to

4700
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:38,360
do perpetual grows you can do it by

4701
02:45:36,409 --> 02:45:39,950
swapping the whole room you can do it by

4702
02:45:38,360 --> 02:45:41,540
having part of the room harvest every

4703
02:45:39,950 --> 02:45:44,329
couple of weeks I've done a full Episode

4704
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:46,729
on that but I do plan to read to it in

4705
02:45:44,329 --> 02:45:48,860
the future for a six plant count because

4706
02:45:46,728 --> 02:45:51,319
Colorado is now limited to six plants

4707
02:45:48,860 --> 02:45:53,810
for recreational or medical patients so

4708
02:45:51,319 --> 02:45:56,389
I will do a revised perpetual grow

4709
02:45:53,809 --> 02:45:58,100
episode based on a six plant count if

4710
02:45:56,389 --> 02:46:00,379
you're interested in listening to the

4711
02:45:58,100 --> 02:46:02,630
current or maybe the old scheduling a

4712
02:46:00,379 --> 02:46:05,119
perpetual grow episode that is episode

4713
02:46:02,629 --> 02:46:07,459
number 73 I think it is a great episode

4714
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:10,430
I put a lot of time and effort into

4715
02:46:07,459 --> 02:46:13,279
creating that episode so episode 73 all

4716
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:15,050
about creating a perpetual grow alright

4717
02:46:13,280 --> 02:46:16,939
let me get myself back on track my point

4718
02:46:15,049 --> 02:46:19,009
is to make sure you have got either a

4719
02:46:16,939 --> 02:46:21,350
source for clones or clones for your

4720
02:46:19,010 --> 02:46:23,180
next run and also it is always a good

4721
02:46:21,350 --> 02:46:25,010
idea to think about becoming more

4722
02:46:23,180 --> 02:46:28,760
self-sufficient and you can do so by

4723
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:30,680
creating a perpetual grow now the next

4724
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:32,420
thing on my checklist that I would think

4725
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:34,909
about in this brand new grow room that

4726
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:37,309
we just recently built is do we have any

4727
02:46:34,909 --> 02:46:39,649
light leaks do we have grow lights

4728
02:46:37,309 --> 02:46:41,869
leaking out into the outside and do we

4729
02:46:39,649 --> 02:46:43,819
have outside lights leaking into the

4730
02:46:41,870 --> 02:46:45,860
inside this is very important to find

4731
02:46:43,819 --> 02:46:48,680
out before we go into the flower phase

4732
02:46:45,860 --> 02:46:50,110
we need to go in that grow room and turn

4733
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:52,329
off the grow lights and

4734
02:46:50,110 --> 02:46:54,551
sit in there for fifteen or twenty

4735
02:46:52,329 --> 02:46:57,190
minutes and let your eyes adjust to the

4736
02:46:54,550 --> 02:47:00,310
total darkness and see if you see any

4737
02:46:57,190 --> 02:47:02,890
light at all in your flowering room if

4738
02:47:00,310 --> 02:47:04,720
you can see any light that is too much

4739
02:47:02,890 --> 02:47:07,029
you should not be able to see your hand

4740
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:08,709
in front of your own face it needs to be

4741
02:47:07,030 --> 02:47:10,811
completely dark I've done an episode

4742
02:47:08,709 --> 02:47:13,300
called total darkness check that one out

4743
02:47:10,810 --> 02:47:15,069
also any light leaks in the flowering

4744
02:47:13,300 --> 02:47:17,050
phase are going to cause your plants

4745
02:47:15,069 --> 02:47:18,819
problems you're either going to get no

4746
02:47:17,050 --> 02:47:20,709
flowering at all you're going to get

4747
02:47:18,819 --> 02:47:22,181
slow flowering or you're going to get

4748
02:47:20,709 --> 02:47:23,529
hermaphrodites you'll get plants that

4749
02:47:22,181 --> 02:47:25,841
will start to flower and they'll never

4750
02:47:23,530 --> 02:47:28,120
finish or you just may get crazy weird

4751
02:47:25,841 --> 02:47:30,460
mutated plants because of an odd light

4752
02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:32,141
leaked so go in the grow room turn off

4753
02:47:30,459 --> 02:47:33,579
all the grow lights and just sit there

4754
02:47:32,140 --> 02:47:35,770
for a few minutes put your phone away

4755
02:47:33,579 --> 02:47:37,720
don't have any light making your eyes do

4756
02:47:35,771 --> 02:47:39,940
weird things just let there be total

4757
02:47:37,720 --> 02:47:42,011
darkness let your eyes adjust and if you

4758
02:47:39,940 --> 02:47:44,051
see any light you need to correct it you

4759
02:47:42,011 --> 02:47:45,220
need some of that silver foil tape or

4760
02:47:44,050 --> 02:47:46,510
maybe you need to fill the gaps with

4761
02:47:45,220 --> 02:47:48,640
some caulk and cover it up with some

4762
02:47:46,511 --> 02:47:51,431
duct tape just seal up all of those

4763
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:54,431
light leaks now if your grow room is on

4764
02:47:51,431 --> 02:47:57,190
an exterior wall meaning that wall is

4765
02:47:54,431 --> 02:47:59,500
next to the outside or if there is a lot

4766
02:47:57,190 --> 02:48:02,110
of activity on the opposite side of the

4767
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:04,360
wall of what you are growing I suggest

4768
02:48:02,110 --> 02:48:06,370
you go in your grow room and turn off

4769
02:48:04,360 --> 02:48:08,860
the grow lights during either the

4770
02:48:06,370 --> 02:48:11,261
sunshine hours or the busy hours of that

4771
02:48:08,860 --> 02:48:13,540
room and see if any of the light from

4772
02:48:11,261 --> 02:48:15,521
either the Sun or that adjacent room are

4773
02:48:13,540 --> 02:48:18,011
leaking into your grow room during their

4774
02:48:15,521 --> 02:48:19,870
busy hours if your grow room has a

4775
02:48:18,011 --> 02:48:21,190
window and the sun is shining on that

4776
02:48:19,870 --> 02:48:22,960
window and the curtains aren't thick

4777
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:24,971
enough to block out that Sun or whatever

4778
02:48:22,959 --> 02:48:26,919
you've put over that window is not thick

4779
02:48:24,970 --> 02:48:28,750
enough to block out that sunlight we

4780
02:48:26,920 --> 02:48:31,870
need to know that before we go into the

4781
02:48:28,750 --> 02:48:33,610
flowering phase the Sun may come up an

4782
02:48:31,870 --> 02:48:36,070
hour before your grow lights come on

4783
02:48:33,610 --> 02:48:38,110
they may start getting a full hour of

4784
02:48:36,069 --> 02:48:39,819
sunlight coming through that window that

4785
02:48:38,110 --> 02:48:42,400
you're unaware of and that's going to

4786
02:48:39,819 --> 02:48:44,619
disrupt their flowering cycle so go in

4787
02:48:42,399 --> 02:48:46,029
there and check it all hours and see if

4788
02:48:44,620 --> 02:48:48,670
you are getting total darkness

4789
02:48:46,030 --> 02:48:50,620
especially the hours you plan on putting

4790
02:48:48,670 --> 02:48:53,229
your plants in their night cycle make

4791
02:48:50,620 --> 02:48:55,690
sure that room is actually dark and if

4792
02:48:53,229 --> 02:48:57,819
it's not correct it now the next thing

4793
02:48:55,690 --> 02:48:59,710
we need to do is the opposite we need to

4794
02:48:57,819 --> 02:49:01,659
go outside and make sure that none of

4795
02:48:59,709 --> 02:49:04,148
our grow room lights are leaking to the

4796
02:49:01,659 --> 02:49:05,978
outside especially if you're running

4797
02:49:04,148 --> 02:49:07,748
your grow lights during the outside

4798
02:49:05,978 --> 02:49:09,188
night cycle you were lighting up the

4799
02:49:07,748 --> 02:49:10,988
outside neighborhood with your grow

4800
02:49:09,189 --> 02:49:12,668
lights those grow lights are going to

4801
02:49:10,988 --> 02:49:14,738
bring unwanted attention you will bring

4802
02:49:12,668 --> 02:49:17,318
thieves and law enforcement so make sure

4803
02:49:14,738 --> 02:49:19,689
you're not leaking any light out of your

4804
02:49:17,318 --> 02:49:21,788
grow room now is also a good time to

4805
02:49:19,689 --> 02:49:23,979
start thinking about when am I going to

4806
02:49:21,789 --> 02:49:26,770
run my flowering cycle do you want the

4807
02:49:23,978 --> 02:49:28,148
lights on when it's dark outside do you

4808
02:49:26,770 --> 02:49:31,449
want the lights on when it's light

4809
02:49:28,148 --> 02:49:33,189
outside electricity is cheaper during

4810
02:49:31,449 --> 02:49:34,689
off-peak hours which means when all the

4811
02:49:33,189 --> 02:49:37,209
business is closed and everybody goes

4812
02:49:34,689 --> 02:49:39,430
home electricity gets cheaper you can

4813
02:49:37,209 --> 02:49:42,729
look on your bill and find out when peak

4814
02:49:39,430 --> 02:49:44,470
and off-peak hours are since electricity

4815
02:49:42,728 --> 02:49:46,629
is more affordable at off-peak hours

4816
02:49:44,469 --> 02:49:49,510
many growers will choose to run their

4817
02:49:46,629 --> 02:49:51,668
lights during those hours also when the

4818
02:49:49,510 --> 02:49:53,800
Sun is not up we don't have to try to

4819
02:49:51,668 --> 02:49:56,228
keep the room cool with the grow lights

4820
02:49:53,799 --> 02:49:58,299
and the Sun competing against us when

4821
02:49:56,228 --> 02:50:00,278
the Sun Goes Down it automatically gets

4822
02:49:58,299 --> 02:50:01,929
a little bit cooler outside you can fire

4823
02:50:00,279 --> 02:50:04,238
up your grow lights and you don't have

4824
02:50:01,930 --> 02:50:06,100
as much heat to deal with if you're in a

4825
02:50:04,238 --> 02:50:07,719
place that gets really cold you can run

4826
02:50:06,100 --> 02:50:09,369
those grow lights at night and it will

4827
02:50:07,719 --> 02:50:10,988
really help keep your house warm if

4828
02:50:09,369 --> 02:50:13,209
you've got a small house and you run the

4829
02:50:10,988 --> 02:50:15,219
ducting right and you plan properly I

4830
02:50:13,209 --> 02:50:16,899
know several East Coast growers that

4831
02:50:15,219 --> 02:50:18,728
used to keep their apartments warm by

4832
02:50:16,898 --> 02:50:20,618
setting up a four or six hundred watt

4833
02:50:18,728 --> 02:50:22,778
light in the winter it would kick out a

4834
02:50:20,619 --> 02:50:24,310
small winter crop of super potent

4835
02:50:22,779 --> 02:50:25,810
cannabis out of their very small

4836
02:50:24,309 --> 02:50:28,118
apartment and they would also use that

4837
02:50:25,809 --> 02:50:29,648
same light to keep themselves warm so

4838
02:50:28,119 --> 02:50:31,810
there's a very efficient way to do

4839
02:50:29,648 --> 02:50:33,340
things back in the day so now is a good

4840
02:50:31,809 --> 02:50:34,748
time to start thinking about when you're

4841
02:50:33,340 --> 02:50:36,908
going to run your lights in your

4842
02:50:34,748 --> 02:50:38,590
flowering room you probably have to go

4843
02:50:36,908 --> 02:50:40,270
to work part of the day do you want

4844
02:50:38,590 --> 02:50:42,010
those lights to come on right when you

4845
02:50:40,270 --> 02:50:43,479
get home from work do you want those

4846
02:50:42,010 --> 02:50:45,219
lights to come on so you can work on the

4847
02:50:43,478 --> 02:50:46,958
plants before you go to work you've got

4848
02:50:45,219 --> 02:50:49,059
a lot of things to plan and think about

4849
02:50:46,959 --> 02:50:50,680
now I suggest you work on the plants

4850
02:50:49,059 --> 02:50:53,168
after work because you don't want to go

4851
02:50:50,680 --> 02:50:55,359
to work smelling like dank most people

4852
02:50:53,168 --> 02:50:56,889
work a day job nowadays so you're gonna

4853
02:50:55,359 --> 02:50:59,260
go to work and then you'll get off

4854
02:50:56,889 --> 02:51:00,939
hopefully in the evening come home work

4855
02:50:59,260 --> 02:51:02,318
on the plants that works out really well

4856
02:51:00,939 --> 02:51:04,988
because you are now on off-peak

4857
02:51:02,318 --> 02:51:06,189
electricity hours and it is nighttime so

4858
02:51:04,988 --> 02:51:08,168
you're not fighting that heat you don't

4859
02:51:06,189 --> 02:51:09,908
have to run as much electricity so you

4860
02:51:08,168 --> 02:51:11,559
get off work come home work on the

4861
02:51:09,908 --> 02:51:13,418
plants then you can take a nice shower

4862
02:51:11,559 --> 02:51:14,590
then you don't stink for work next day

4863
02:51:13,418 --> 02:51:16,478
and nobody knows if you're growing

4864
02:51:14,590 --> 02:51:17,950
cannabis if you were in a place you need

4865
02:51:16,478 --> 02:51:19,149
to keep it on the down-low

4866
02:51:17,950 --> 02:51:20,560
all right and since I'm talking about

4867
02:51:19,149 --> 02:51:23,709
being careful and keeping it on the

4868
02:51:20,559 --> 02:51:25,719
down-low do you have a carbon filter set

4869
02:51:23,709 --> 02:51:28,419
up as your filtration in place are you

4870
02:51:25,719 --> 02:51:30,459
ready for a stinky crop of flowers in

4871
02:51:28,420 --> 02:51:32,978
just a few weeks these plants are going

4872
02:51:30,459 --> 02:51:35,469
to start stinking very heavily you may

4873
02:51:32,978 --> 02:51:37,539
get a nice aroma around 20 days in

4874
02:51:35,469 --> 02:51:39,129
depending on your genetics and what

4875
02:51:37,540 --> 02:51:41,530
you're using for nutrients and the

4876
02:51:39,129 --> 02:51:43,449
airflow in your room now is the time to

4877
02:51:41,530 --> 02:51:45,220
order a carbon filter if you haven't

4878
02:51:43,450 --> 02:51:46,870
already you need to get that set up you

4879
02:51:45,219 --> 02:51:48,969
need to get it in place and you need to

4880
02:51:46,870 --> 02:51:51,640
start controlling the aroma leaving your

4881
02:51:48,969 --> 02:51:53,409
grow space now I need to back up and

4882
02:51:51,639 --> 02:51:55,809
cover one thing that I overlooked when I

4883
02:51:53,409 --> 02:51:58,329
was talking about light leaks when you

4884
02:51:55,809 --> 02:52:01,299
were using vented lights which means you

4885
02:51:58,329 --> 02:52:03,579
have got a light with glass between the

4886
02:52:01,299 --> 02:52:05,409
bulb and the plant canopy and that's all

4887
02:52:03,579 --> 02:52:07,270
sealed up in there and it's got a duct

4888
02:52:05,409 --> 02:52:09,129
coming off of one end and off of the

4889
02:52:07,270 --> 02:52:10,600
other and you're blowing a blower over

4890
02:52:09,129 --> 02:52:13,029
it to get that heat from the light out

4891
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:15,159
of the grow space a lot of people will

4892
02:52:13,030 --> 02:52:17,050
run that ducting to the outside of the

4893
02:52:15,159 --> 02:52:18,939
house they'll run it out of a window

4894
02:52:17,049 --> 02:52:22,779
just to make it go outside of the house

4895
02:52:18,939 --> 02:52:25,239
somehow a lot of times the sunshine will

4896
02:52:22,780 --> 02:52:26,890
reflect write down that ducting and come

4897
02:52:25,239 --> 02:52:29,799
into your light reflector and work just

4898
02:52:26,889 --> 02:52:31,569
like a light you were channeling that

4899
02:52:29,799 --> 02:52:33,819
light down that ducting right into your

4900
02:52:31,569 --> 02:52:35,978
grow space if you are not doing that

4901
02:52:33,819 --> 02:52:38,110
while the lights are on you were

4902
02:52:35,978 --> 02:52:40,209
lighting up the plants and disrupting

4903
02:52:38,110 --> 02:52:43,180
your night cycle if you were using

4904
02:52:40,209 --> 02:52:45,639
ducted hoods and you were running that

4905
02:52:43,180 --> 02:52:48,670
to the outside of the house you may need

4906
02:52:45,639 --> 02:52:51,119
to adjust the duct to where the light

4907
02:52:48,670 --> 02:52:53,649
does not make it into your grow room

4908
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:55,620
unfortunately the inside of that ducting

4909
02:52:53,649 --> 02:52:58,209
is quite often made with a very

4910
02:52:55,620 --> 02:53:00,910
reflective material you're probably

4911
02:52:58,209 --> 02:53:03,099
going to have to give it a lot of bends

4912
02:53:00,909 --> 02:53:04,569
or you'll have to create a baffle at the

4913
02:53:03,100 --> 02:53:07,420
end of it to where the light is not

4914
02:53:04,569 --> 02:53:10,930
allowed to even enter down that ducting

4915
02:53:07,420 --> 02:53:13,809
another option is to get a can of flat

4916
02:53:10,930 --> 02:53:16,389
black spray paint and spray paint the

4917
02:53:13,809 --> 02:53:18,250
inside as far as you can make that spray

4918
02:53:16,389 --> 02:53:20,109
paint go just put a nice little black

4919
02:53:18,250 --> 02:53:21,850
layer in there and take that reflective

4920
02:53:20,110 --> 02:53:24,250
layer off and that will prevent the

4921
02:53:21,850 --> 02:53:26,170
light from getting in there as much you

4922
02:53:24,250 --> 02:53:27,790
still may need to make a bend you may

4923
02:53:26,170 --> 02:53:30,640
need to put some sort of light baffle

4924
02:53:27,790 --> 02:53:32,650
over it but please check

4925
02:53:30,640 --> 02:53:35,560
and see if the light is coming through

4926
02:53:32,649 --> 02:53:38,350
your ducted hoods and disrupting your

4927
02:53:35,560 --> 02:53:41,050
night cycle the sunshine will make it so

4928
02:53:38,351 --> 02:53:44,351
far down that ducting you will be amazed

4929
02:53:41,050 --> 02:53:46,540
and just one little speckle of sunlight

4930
02:53:44,351 --> 02:53:48,431
will completely disrupt your flowering

4931
02:53:46,540 --> 02:53:50,170
cycle if you think the plants are in the

4932
02:53:48,431 --> 02:53:52,181
dark and they're getting that one little

4933
02:53:50,171 --> 02:53:54,431
pinprick of sunlight they're not in the

4934
02:53:52,181 --> 02:53:56,140
dark and also take a quick look at all

4935
02:53:54,431 --> 02:53:57,730
of the equipment in your grow room does

4936
02:53:56,140 --> 02:53:59,470
your air conditioner have blue and red

4937
02:53:57,729 --> 02:54:01,001
lights on it is there something in the

4938
02:53:59,470 --> 02:54:03,130
grow room that's illuminating a blue

4939
02:54:01,001 --> 02:54:04,989
display if you have any lights in there

4940
02:54:03,130 --> 02:54:06,909
you need to put some tape or some sort

4941
02:54:04,989 --> 02:54:09,761
of a flap over it so that light does not

4942
02:54:06,909 --> 02:54:12,159
disrupt your flowering cycle the only

4943
02:54:09,761 --> 02:54:14,319
color of light that is acceptable during

4944
02:54:12,159 --> 02:54:16,390
the night cycle is a green light and

4945
02:54:14,319 --> 02:54:18,940
there are still situations where I have

4946
02:54:16,390 --> 02:54:20,979
seen those green lights cause problems

4947
02:54:18,940 --> 02:54:23,739
with people's plants by running that

4948
02:54:20,979 --> 02:54:26,591
green light too much during a dark cycle

4949
02:54:23,739 --> 02:54:28,511
I would prefer it be completely dark in

4950
02:54:26,591 --> 02:54:30,671
your grow room there's nobody in there

4951
02:54:28,511 --> 02:54:33,190
the plants are sleeping we don't want

4952
02:54:30,671 --> 02:54:35,229
any light make it as dark as you can get

4953
02:54:33,190 --> 02:54:37,390
it you want it scary dark and then a

4954
02:54:35,229 --> 02:54:39,069
little bit darker you don't want to be

4955
02:54:37,390 --> 02:54:40,390
able to see your hand in front of your

4956
02:54:39,069 --> 02:54:42,130
face when you're touching your nose

4957
02:54:40,390 --> 02:54:43,960
that's how dark we need it

4958
02:54:42,130 --> 02:54:45,880
again I've done an episode called total

4959
02:54:43,960 --> 02:54:47,739
darkness so give that one a listen if

4960
02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:49,659
you don't understand why total darkness

4961
02:54:47,739 --> 02:54:51,851
is so important in our indoor grow

4962
02:54:49,659 --> 02:54:55,120
environment all right the next thing on

4963
02:54:51,851 --> 02:54:57,851
my pre flower checklist is can you

4964
02:54:55,120 --> 02:55:00,550
correctly identify females males and

4965
02:54:57,851 --> 02:55:02,621
hermaphrodites if you are running from

4966
02:55:00,550 --> 02:55:05,831
seed especially you have got the option

4967
02:55:02,620 --> 02:55:08,920
to run into females males or

4968
02:55:05,831 --> 02:55:12,159
hermaphrodites you need to be able to

4969
02:55:08,921 --> 02:55:15,001
identify these very early if you find a

4970
02:55:12,159 --> 02:55:17,591
male in the garden it needs to be cold

4971
02:55:15,001 --> 02:55:19,871
immediately if you come across a

4972
02:55:17,591 --> 02:55:21,700
hermaphroditic plant early in flower you

4973
02:55:19,870 --> 02:55:23,409
need to know what that looks like so you

4974
02:55:21,700 --> 02:55:26,561
can get it out of the grow room before

4975
02:55:23,409 --> 02:55:28,720
it causes you problems your plants are

4976
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:31,989
going to start showing sex somewhere

4977
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:34,149
around 10 days into flower by day 12 or

4978
02:55:31,989 --> 02:55:37,569
14 it will be really obvious if you've

4979
02:55:34,149 --> 02:55:40,181
got male or female plants by day 12 or

4980
02:55:37,569 --> 02:55:42,761
14 your female plants will be able to

4981
02:55:40,181 --> 02:55:44,230
receive pollen from the male plants if

4982
02:55:42,761 --> 02:55:47,649
you're not paying attention

4983
02:55:44,229 --> 02:55:49,779
sometimes by day 10 or 12 a male plant

4984
02:55:47,649 --> 02:55:51,699
can open up and start dropping pollen

4985
02:55:49,780 --> 02:55:53,409
now your whole crop is pollinated

4986
02:55:51,700 --> 02:55:55,120
everything is going to have seeds in it

4987
02:55:53,409 --> 02:55:57,640
and you didn't even know because you

4988
02:55:55,120 --> 02:56:00,400
weren't paying attention so before we

4989
02:55:57,640 --> 02:56:02,710
get to this risky phase open up some

4990
02:56:00,399 --> 02:56:05,109
books do some Google searches and learn

4991
02:56:02,710 --> 02:56:07,779
to identify a female cannabis plant

4992
02:56:05,110 --> 02:56:09,851
learn to confidently identify a male

4993
02:56:07,780 --> 02:56:13,120
cannabis plant and learn how to identify

4994
02:56:09,851 --> 02:56:15,761
a plant this shows both sexes in the

4995
02:56:13,120 --> 02:56:17,829
same plant in the next episode I plan to

4996
02:56:15,761 --> 02:56:20,051
talk about Fino hunting and selecting a

4997
02:56:17,829 --> 02:56:22,271
mother plant from that Fino hunt in that

4998
02:56:20,050 --> 02:56:24,579
episode I will also include a talk about

4999
02:56:22,271 --> 02:56:26,620
sexing our cannabis plants it is very

5000
02:56:24,579 --> 02:56:28,511
important at this phase in this stage of

5001
02:56:26,620 --> 02:56:31,511
the game so we need to know how to

5002
02:56:28,511 --> 02:56:33,671
confidently identify males and females I

5003
02:56:31,511 --> 02:56:35,771
will be able to provide you detailed

5004
02:56:33,671 --> 02:56:38,140
descriptions but I recommend you look

5005
02:56:35,771 --> 02:56:40,931
online for pictures of males and females

5006
02:56:38,140 --> 02:56:43,029
of cannabis plants they are very easy to

5007
02:56:40,931 --> 02:56:45,131
spot once you looked a few times it will

5008
02:56:43,030 --> 02:56:47,620
become very obvious you just need to

5009
02:56:45,130 --> 02:56:49,569
develop the confidence so I will include

5010
02:56:47,620 --> 02:56:51,940
a talk about it on the next episode but

5011
02:56:49,569 --> 02:56:54,390
you will still need to go look in a book

5012
02:56:51,940 --> 02:56:56,319
or look online and get a good visual

5013
02:56:54,390 --> 02:56:58,359
understanding of what you are looking

5014
02:56:56,319 --> 02:57:00,341
for so you can spot it right away if

5015
02:56:58,360 --> 02:57:02,110
something should pop up in your garden

5016
02:57:00,341 --> 02:57:03,671
now another thing you should think about

5017
02:57:02,110 --> 02:57:06,221
before you put your plants in to flower

5018
02:57:03,671 --> 02:57:07,961
is are they healthy have you burned them

5019
02:57:06,220 --> 02:57:09,819
with nutrients are they nutrient

5020
02:57:07,960 --> 02:57:11,470
deficient we may want to get them a

5021
02:57:09,819 --> 02:57:13,029
little healthier before you put them

5022
02:57:11,470 --> 02:57:14,859
into flour we want these plants as

5023
02:57:13,030 --> 02:57:16,931
healthy as we can get them before they

5024
02:57:14,860 --> 02:57:19,150
go into the flowering phase another

5025
02:57:16,931 --> 02:57:22,631
important thing to think about is do you

5026
02:57:19,149 --> 02:57:24,310
have any pest infestations we aren't

5027
02:57:22,630 --> 02:57:26,800
able to spray the plants with as many

5028
02:57:24,310 --> 02:57:30,279
products once we get bud set so we want

5029
02:57:26,800 --> 02:57:33,310
to eradicate any pest problems before we

5030
02:57:30,280 --> 02:57:35,409
go into the flowering phase if you do

5031
02:57:33,310 --> 02:57:37,210
have a pest problem at this time it is

5032
02:57:35,409 --> 02:57:39,550
time to step up the frequency of the

5033
02:57:37,210 --> 02:57:41,470
sprays and quite possibly increase the

5034
02:57:39,550 --> 02:57:44,680
potency of your sprays if not start

5035
02:57:41,470 --> 02:57:46,300
introducing new products we do not want

5036
02:57:44,681 --> 02:57:49,000
to enter the flowering phase with a

5037
02:57:46,300 --> 02:57:52,239
known pest problem it is much easier to

5038
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:53,771
combat a pest problem while in veg so

5039
02:57:52,239 --> 02:57:56,050
let's focus on getting rid of any

5040
02:57:53,771 --> 02:57:58,120
problems now and then we can move to

5041
02:57:56,050 --> 02:57:59,978
flower a week late if that's what we

5042
02:57:58,120 --> 02:58:02,350
to do or we can adjust our plans

5043
02:57:59,978 --> 02:58:04,510
accordingly but let's make sure to get

5044
02:58:02,350 --> 02:58:06,550
rid of every bug before we move to

5045
02:58:04,510 --> 02:58:08,680
flower so at this point we should have

5046
02:58:06,549 --> 02:58:10,599
some backup clones for the next run we

5047
02:58:08,680 --> 02:58:12,010
know that the room is dark we know there

5048
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:13,479
are no light leaks there's no light

5049
02:58:12,010 --> 02:58:16,090
getting in there's no light getting out

5050
02:58:13,478 --> 02:58:17,739
we've got our aroma control there's no

5051
02:58:16,090 --> 02:58:20,020
stinky air getting out of the grow room

5052
02:58:17,739 --> 02:58:21,969
you guys the number one way people get

5053
02:58:20,020 --> 02:58:23,859
in trouble is by having stinky air

5054
02:58:21,969 --> 02:58:25,959
coming out of the house control that

5055
02:58:23,859 --> 02:58:27,579
aroma make sure you take care of that

5056
02:58:25,959 --> 02:58:29,529
we're allowed to grow cannabis in

5057
02:58:27,579 --> 02:58:31,629
Colorado you were just fine until

5058
02:58:29,530 --> 02:58:33,670
somebody complains and says they can

5059
02:58:31,629 --> 02:58:35,648
smell your garden at that point they

5060
02:58:33,670 --> 02:58:37,420
send out an investigator and they come

5061
02:58:35,648 --> 02:58:39,430
knock on your door and ask to look and

5062
02:58:37,420 --> 02:58:41,170
see how many plants you've got if you've

5063
02:58:39,430 --> 02:58:43,239
got too many plants you do get in

5064
02:58:41,170 --> 02:58:45,460
trouble so no matter how many plants

5065
02:58:43,239 --> 02:58:47,260
you've got I recommend you've got some

5066
02:58:45,459 --> 02:58:48,159
sort of odor control so none of your

5067
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:49,989
neighbors get mad

5068
02:58:48,159 --> 02:58:51,969
nobody snitches on you nobody comes

5069
02:58:49,989 --> 02:58:53,978
knocking on your door even if you are

5070
02:58:51,969 --> 02:58:55,809
within your legal amount of plants it is

5071
02:58:53,978 --> 02:58:57,219
still nerve-racking and stressful to

5072
02:58:55,809 --> 02:58:59,680
have to deal with law enforcement

5073
02:58:57,219 --> 02:59:02,019
because of your cannabis so simply

5074
02:58:59,680 --> 02:59:03,850
control the odor so again we've got

5075
02:59:02,020 --> 02:59:05,739
clones for the next round we've got a

5076
02:59:03,850 --> 02:59:08,079
nice dark room we are controlling the

5077
02:59:05,739 --> 02:59:10,299
odor that is leaving our room we know

5078
02:59:08,079 --> 02:59:12,250
how to identify males females and

5079
02:59:10,299 --> 02:59:13,659
hermaphrodites we know what to call so

5080
02:59:12,250 --> 02:59:15,189
that we don't cause any problems in the

5081
02:59:13,659 --> 02:59:17,889
grow so that we don't seed up our whole

5082
02:59:15,189 --> 02:59:19,898
grow we know there are no pests we know

5083
02:59:17,889 --> 02:59:22,750
we haven't overfed the plants we are

5084
02:59:19,898 --> 02:59:24,699
almost ready to flower now how do we

5085
02:59:22,750 --> 02:59:26,350
know when to flower these plants there

5086
02:59:24,700 --> 02:59:28,780
are a couple of things that will help us

5087
02:59:26,350 --> 02:59:31,329
determine when to initiate the flowering

5088
02:59:28,780 --> 02:59:33,790
phase for our plants one of the main

5089
02:59:31,329 --> 02:59:35,950
factors will be the height how much

5090
02:59:33,790 --> 02:59:38,710
ceiling space do you have in your grow

5091
02:59:35,950 --> 02:59:40,870
most of us are in a residential area a

5092
02:59:38,709 --> 02:59:43,389
lot of us are going to be modifying a

5093
02:59:40,870 --> 02:59:46,000
bedroom or something similar a lot of us

5094
02:59:43,389 --> 02:59:47,500
may be using grow tents you're going to

5095
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:49,450
have to flower your plants at a height

5096
02:59:47,500 --> 02:59:51,430
where they have plenty of rooms to grow

5097
02:59:49,450 --> 02:59:53,770
to where they don't work themselves into

5098
02:59:51,430 --> 02:59:55,689
the lights and you run out of space you

5099
02:59:53,770 --> 02:59:57,550
need to plan to leave depending on what

5100
02:59:55,689 --> 02:59:59,530
type of light you were using you need to

5101
02:59:57,549 --> 03:00:01,449
plan to leave an appropriate gap between

5102
02:59:59,530 --> 03:00:04,270
the top of your plants and your light

5103
03:00:01,450 --> 03:00:06,310
source if you're using LEDs you can get

5104
03:00:04,270 --> 03:00:07,960
much closer if you're using the ceramic

5105
03:00:06,309 --> 03:00:09,728
metal halides you can get kind of close

5106
03:00:07,959 --> 03:00:11,739
if you're using a high pressure sodium

5107
03:00:09,728 --> 03:00:13,569
light you need to stay kind of a disc

5108
03:00:11,739 --> 03:00:15,431
it's away if you're using a double-ended

5109
03:00:13,569 --> 03:00:18,069
Gavita you need to stay even further

5110
03:00:15,431 --> 03:00:20,800
away so plan for that when you're

5111
03:00:18,069 --> 03:00:22,479
planning your flowering time now a good

5112
03:00:20,799 --> 03:00:24,039
thing to think of when you were new at

5113
03:00:22,479 --> 03:00:25,359
growing and you haven't grown a lot of

5114
03:00:24,040 --> 03:00:27,431
crops and you want to prepare for

5115
03:00:25,360 --> 03:00:30,521
flowering time and have enough space is

5116
03:00:27,431 --> 03:00:32,890
prepare for your plants to double in

5117
03:00:30,521 --> 03:00:35,320
height if you were growing a sativa

5118
03:00:32,890 --> 03:00:37,270
strain or something a sativa hybrid with

5119
03:00:35,319 --> 03:00:39,789
a lot of sativa genetics in there it

5120
03:00:37,271 --> 03:00:41,950
could double in height throughout the

5121
03:00:39,790 --> 03:00:43,780
flowering phase so if you veg your plant

5122
03:00:41,950 --> 03:00:46,030
and the plant is 3 feet tall you

5123
03:00:43,780 --> 03:00:48,820
initiate flower by the time it is done

5124
03:00:46,030 --> 03:00:51,159
you can expect a six foot tall plant if

5125
03:00:48,819 --> 03:00:54,190
you're not doing anything to control

5126
03:00:51,159 --> 03:00:56,170
that vertical growth so in that case I

5127
03:00:54,190 --> 03:00:58,390
would plant a flower that plant if you

5128
03:00:56,170 --> 03:01:00,159
have got if your light is 6 feet tall

5129
03:00:58,390 --> 03:01:02,649
we're gonna say if your light is 7 feet

5130
03:01:00,159 --> 03:01:04,390
tall because we need some space if your

5131
03:01:02,649 --> 03:01:06,340
light is 7 feet off the ground

5132
03:01:04,390 --> 03:01:08,229
I would veg those plants the first time

5133
03:01:06,340 --> 03:01:10,630
I grow them I would veg them until they

5134
03:01:08,229 --> 03:01:12,879
are 3 feet tall once they are 3 feet

5135
03:01:10,629 --> 03:01:14,500
tall initiate the flower phase they're

5136
03:01:12,879 --> 03:01:15,489
gonna double in height they'll end about

5137
03:01:14,500 --> 03:01:17,079
6 feet tall

5138
03:01:15,489 --> 03:01:19,420
you'll still have that 1 foot of space

5139
03:01:17,079 --> 03:01:21,760
between the white and the canopy now

5140
03:01:19,420 --> 03:01:24,220
this is not a rule this is just a guide

5141
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:25,690
if you have not grown your strain before

5142
03:01:24,220 --> 03:01:28,270
if you don't know what these genetics

5143
03:01:25,690 --> 03:01:30,250
are going to do allow yourself room for

5144
03:01:28,271 --> 03:01:32,110
these plants to double of course if

5145
03:01:30,250 --> 03:01:34,329
you've got plants with big obvious fat

5146
03:01:32,110 --> 03:01:36,370
white indica leaves you may not get that

5147
03:01:34,329 --> 03:01:37,780
doubled growth you may only get a little

5148
03:01:36,370 --> 03:01:39,971
bit of growth you're going to get

5149
03:01:37,780 --> 03:01:41,440
stretch for about three weeks and then

5150
03:01:39,970 --> 03:01:44,409
they'll slow down on the stretching and

5151
03:01:41,440 --> 03:01:46,829
the bud sets will really set in but try

5152
03:01:44,409 --> 03:01:49,601
to plan ahead for too much head space

5153
03:01:46,829 --> 03:01:52,539
there's nothing worse than having a big

5154
03:01:49,601 --> 03:01:54,700
giant beautiful top Cola that is just

5155
03:01:52,540 --> 03:01:56,380
beefy and covered in trichomes and then

5156
03:01:54,700 --> 03:01:58,510
it starts murdering itself by growing

5157
03:01:56,379 --> 03:01:59,829
directly into your lights it starts

5158
03:01:58,510 --> 03:02:02,079
touching the light it starts burning

5159
03:01:59,829 --> 03:02:03,310
itself it starts getting ugly colors you

5160
03:02:02,079 --> 03:02:04,959
have to think about do I want to bend

5161
03:02:03,310 --> 03:02:06,670
that butt over do I actually want to cut

5162
03:02:04,959 --> 03:02:08,890
part of that off what do I do at this

5163
03:02:06,670 --> 03:02:10,720
point that is really heartbreaking so

5164
03:02:08,890 --> 03:02:13,440
plan ahead and try to give yourself

5165
03:02:10,720 --> 03:02:15,430
plenty of headspace also keep in mind

5166
03:02:13,440 --> 03:02:17,739
spacing you don't want the plants

5167
03:02:15,431 --> 03:02:19,480
touching each other too much just think

5168
03:02:17,739 --> 03:02:21,101
about if you and I and another couple of

5169
03:02:19,479 --> 03:02:22,770
dudes we're hanging out in a room if we

5170
03:02:21,101 --> 03:02:24,091
all just started spreading our arms

5171
03:02:22,771 --> 03:02:25,501
just touching each other all weird

5172
03:02:24,091 --> 03:02:27,360
you're gonna get kind of weirded out

5173
03:02:25,501 --> 03:02:28,979
you're like bro why you touching me and

5174
03:02:27,360 --> 03:02:31,351
you're gonna want your own space the

5175
03:02:28,979 --> 03:02:32,909
plants are very similar when one plant

5176
03:02:31,351 --> 03:02:33,961
feels another plant touch it it

5177
03:02:32,909 --> 03:02:35,130
indicates to itself

5178
03:02:33,960 --> 03:02:36,989
I probably shouldn't grow much further

5179
03:02:35,130 --> 03:02:38,729
that way because I'm already touching a

5180
03:02:36,989 --> 03:02:40,289
limit and the other plant says the same

5181
03:02:38,729 --> 03:02:41,850
thing so now you've got two plants that

5182
03:02:40,290 --> 03:02:43,740
have just stopped out branching and

5183
03:02:41,851 --> 03:02:46,501
they're gonna start growing up so allow

5184
03:02:43,739 --> 03:02:48,479
your plants plenty of space spread them

5185
03:02:46,501 --> 03:02:50,700
out a little bit yes we do want to

5186
03:02:48,479 --> 03:02:53,220
maximize canopy space we do want to

5187
03:02:50,700 --> 03:02:54,990
maximize the space of our grow but we

5188
03:02:53,220 --> 03:02:56,850
don't want to crush them in so much we

5189
03:02:54,989 --> 03:02:57,899
can't get airflow we don't want to crush

5190
03:02:56,851 --> 03:02:59,761
them in so much that they're

5191
03:02:57,899 --> 03:03:01,229
uncomfortable we need a little bit of

5192
03:02:59,761 --> 03:03:03,239
airflow and we don't want leaves

5193
03:03:01,229 --> 03:03:04,829
stacking on top of each other because

5194
03:03:03,239 --> 03:03:07,021
that's where you start causing problems

5195
03:03:04,829 --> 03:03:08,610
so give them some space space your

5196
03:03:07,021 --> 03:03:10,980
plants out give them some breathing room

5197
03:03:08,610 --> 03:03:12,480
give them some growing room and keep in

5198
03:03:10,979 --> 03:03:14,011
mind that when you put your plants into

5199
03:03:12,479 --> 03:03:15,899
the flowering phase they are only

5200
03:03:14,011 --> 03:03:17,431
halfway through their lifecycle they

5201
03:03:15,899 --> 03:03:18,869
still need to Bush out a little bit

5202
03:03:17,431 --> 03:03:21,569
they're gonna grow much taller you're

5203
03:03:18,870 --> 03:03:24,061
only halfway there so allow that extra

5204
03:03:21,569 --> 03:03:25,770
space for flowering now if you're

5205
03:03:24,060 --> 03:03:28,079
running a screen of green or a trellis

5206
03:03:25,771 --> 03:03:29,730
system I suggest you veg until you kind

5207
03:03:28,079 --> 03:03:32,460
of fill out most of that screen system

5208
03:03:29,729 --> 03:03:34,140
the idea is to try to get one little

5209
03:03:32,460 --> 03:03:35,850
branch coming through each of those

5210
03:03:34,140 --> 03:03:38,190
squares in your trellis system if you

5211
03:03:35,851 --> 03:03:40,230
can maximize that that's when you really

5212
03:03:38,190 --> 03:03:43,351
start cranking out as much but as you

5213
03:03:40,229 --> 03:03:45,390
can produce in your space so I suggest

5214
03:03:43,351 --> 03:03:47,610
you fill that canopy up and fill that

5215
03:03:45,390 --> 03:03:48,869
screen up before you flower because

5216
03:03:47,610 --> 03:03:50,521
you're spreading it out nice and white

5217
03:03:48,870 --> 03:03:52,110
it's not going straight up like the guys

5218
03:03:50,521 --> 03:03:53,851
without the screen if you're spreading

5219
03:03:52,110 --> 03:03:55,829
it out you've still got all that

5220
03:03:53,851 --> 03:03:57,329
vertical growth left for you so you can

5221
03:03:55,829 --> 03:03:58,829
spread it out then put it into flower

5222
03:03:57,329 --> 03:04:00,960
and it's gonna grow vertically for you

5223
03:03:58,829 --> 03:04:03,060
so I recommend you use all of that

5224
03:04:00,960 --> 03:04:04,590
screen space to the best of your ability

5225
03:04:03,060 --> 03:04:06,511
all right I feel like that is a good

5226
03:04:04,591 --> 03:04:08,970
explanation of when to flower the plants

5227
03:04:06,511 --> 03:04:10,591
you want to give yourself about double

5228
03:04:08,970 --> 03:04:13,171
the space you want to allow some space

5229
03:04:10,591 --> 03:04:14,521
between the whites and the plants and

5230
03:04:13,171 --> 03:04:16,290
you also want to give the plants some

5231
03:04:14,521 --> 03:04:18,239
space so they can breathe and so they

5232
03:04:16,290 --> 03:04:20,400
can stretch out now if you've done any

5233
03:04:18,239 --> 03:04:23,069
topping I would definitely recommend 10

5234
03:04:20,399 --> 03:04:24,931
to 14 days of recovery time before you

5235
03:04:23,069 --> 03:04:27,360
move the plants into flower so plan

5236
03:04:24,931 --> 03:04:29,221
ahead do all of your topping plenty of

5237
03:04:27,360 --> 03:04:31,051
time in advance so the plants can heal

5238
03:04:29,220 --> 03:04:33,239
so they can redistribute the hormones

5239
03:04:31,050 --> 03:04:35,671
that way the plant can produce big fat

5240
03:04:33,239 --> 03:04:36,600
chunky top buds if you top a plant and

5241
03:04:35,671 --> 03:04:38,639
move it into flower

5242
03:04:36,600 --> 03:04:40,318
soon you'll notice those top buds don't

5243
03:04:38,639 --> 03:04:42,209
really produce the colas that we were

5244
03:04:40,318 --> 03:04:44,129
expecting so give your plant time to

5245
03:04:42,209 --> 03:04:45,448
recover from topping let those hormones

5246
03:04:44,129 --> 03:04:47,219
move around and it will make a huge

5247
03:04:45,449 --> 03:04:49,319
difference in the productivity of your

5248
03:04:47,219 --> 03:04:52,289
plant so I feel like that is a pretty

5249
03:04:49,318 --> 03:04:53,879
good before flower checklist make sure

5250
03:04:52,290 --> 03:04:55,949
the plants are healthy make sure you

5251
03:04:53,879 --> 03:04:58,108
understand how to find males females and

5252
03:04:55,949 --> 03:04:59,880
hermaphrodites make sure your pest free

5253
03:04:58,109 --> 03:05:02,340
and make sure you've got a good idea of

5254
03:04:59,879 --> 03:05:04,528
when to flower those plants try to set a

5255
03:05:02,340 --> 03:05:07,380
schedule try to stick to it as long as

5256
03:05:04,529 --> 03:05:09,300
you are pest free I would suggest that

5257
03:05:07,379 --> 03:05:11,039
you keep twisting and popping the stems

5258
03:05:09,299 --> 03:05:12,358
making those stocks nice and robust

5259
03:05:11,040 --> 03:05:14,460
until it's time to flower

5260
03:05:12,359 --> 03:05:16,260
keep pulling off any yellow or funky

5261
03:05:14,459 --> 03:05:16,769
leaves keep the plants looking nice and

5262
03:05:16,260 --> 03:05:19,109
healthy

5263
03:05:16,770 --> 03:05:21,449
keep them thriving and when it's time to

5264
03:05:19,109 --> 03:05:23,279
flower flip that timer to 1212

5265
03:05:21,449 --> 03:05:25,550
make a note of what day you did it and

5266
03:05:23,279 --> 03:05:27,988
now you were in the flowering phase

5267
03:05:25,549 --> 03:05:29,938
several people have asked me when

5268
03:05:27,988 --> 03:05:32,340
flowering starts does flowering start

5269
03:05:29,939 --> 03:05:34,050
the day you change the timer to 1212 or

5270
03:05:32,340 --> 03:05:36,180
does flowering start the day you start

5271
03:05:34,049 --> 03:05:38,250
seeing buds set if you were looking at a

5272
03:05:36,180 --> 03:05:41,279
package of seeds and it says these seeds

5273
03:05:38,250 --> 03:05:44,279
will take 8 to 10 weeks to flower that 8

5274
03:05:41,279 --> 03:05:46,890
to 10 weeks starts the day you change

5275
03:05:44,279 --> 03:05:48,960
your timer to 1212 the day you do the

5276
03:05:46,889 --> 03:05:51,478
flip is the beginning of your flowering

5277
03:05:48,959 --> 03:05:53,728
phase that's when that new schedule that

5278
03:05:51,478 --> 03:05:56,129
new calendars the new countdown that is

5279
03:05:53,728 --> 03:05:59,938
when that begins so if you were running

5280
03:05:56,129 --> 03:06:01,948
24 hours or 20 on and 4 off or 18 and 6

5281
03:05:59,939 --> 03:06:04,350
in veg you just go in and you change

5282
03:06:01,949 --> 03:06:06,569
that timer to 12 hours on and 12 hours

5283
03:06:04,350 --> 03:06:09,449
off and that is day one of your

5284
03:06:06,568 --> 03:06:11,039
flowering phase in about 10 to 12 days

5285
03:06:09,449 --> 03:06:12,600
you'll start seeing pre flower the

5286
03:06:11,040 --> 03:06:13,979
plants will start showing you sex you

5287
03:06:12,600 --> 03:06:16,979
need to go through and start pulling out

5288
03:06:13,978 --> 03:06:19,170
all of the boys by this point by day 14

5289
03:06:16,978 --> 03:06:21,448
the boys will be very obvious they will

5290
03:06:19,170 --> 03:06:23,699
be getting ready to pollinate if they

5291
03:06:21,449 --> 03:06:25,439
have not already dropped pollen pay

5292
03:06:23,699 --> 03:06:28,020
close attention to the boys and get them

5293
03:06:25,439 --> 03:06:29,760
out of there for the first two or three

5294
03:06:28,020 --> 03:06:32,220
weeks of flowering you're going to focus

5295
03:06:29,760 --> 03:06:34,529
heavily on looking for male plants and

5296
03:06:32,219 --> 03:06:37,228
plants with hermaphrodite traits and

5297
03:06:34,529 --> 03:06:39,689
removing them from the garden safely so

5298
03:06:37,228 --> 03:06:41,398
again I suggest that you start now doing

5299
03:06:39,689 --> 03:06:42,930
some research on understanding what a

5300
03:06:41,398 --> 03:06:45,238
male and a female and a hermaphrodite

5301
03:06:42,930 --> 03:06:47,790
cannabis plant look like so that when

5302
03:06:45,238 --> 03:06:49,449
you're 8 10 12 or 14 days into flower

5303
03:06:47,790 --> 03:06:51,190
you were a certain

5304
03:06:49,450 --> 03:06:52,931
you see and you were confident so that

5305
03:06:51,190 --> 03:06:55,271
you can make the correct decision to

5306
03:06:52,931 --> 03:06:56,590
keep your garden in top shape all right

5307
03:06:55,271 --> 03:06:58,540
I feel like that is a great place to

5308
03:06:56,590 --> 03:07:00,521
stop because my next lesson is going to

5309
03:06:58,540 --> 03:07:02,530
be about Fino hunting and sexing the

5310
03:07:00,521 --> 03:07:04,960
plants and selecting a mother plant from

5311
03:07:02,530 --> 03:07:07,360
that Fino hunt process then we are going

5312
03:07:04,959 --> 03:07:09,310
to work our way into the flowering stage

5313
03:07:07,360 --> 03:07:11,530
of the grow lesson that's right it is

5314
03:07:09,310 --> 03:07:13,299
almost time to flower the hypothetical

5315
03:07:11,530 --> 03:07:16,450
plants in the grow lesson so that is

5316
03:07:13,299 --> 03:07:19,569
coming up very soon I will talk in depth

5317
03:07:16,450 --> 03:07:21,280
about probably three week chunks of the

5318
03:07:19,569 --> 03:07:23,049
flowering phase will probably do week

5319
03:07:21,280 --> 03:07:25,480
one through three and then we'll do four

5320
03:07:23,049 --> 03:07:26,859
through six and then we'll to seven

5321
03:07:25,479 --> 03:07:29,020
through nine that was hard for my brain

5322
03:07:26,860 --> 03:07:30,790
to process that quickly but that is my

5323
03:07:29,021 --> 03:07:32,650
idea for the flowering phase I'm going

5324
03:07:30,790 --> 03:07:33,760
to break it down into three three week

5325
03:07:32,649 --> 03:07:35,770
chunks and then we'll talk about

5326
03:07:33,760 --> 03:07:37,329
finishing the plants up so that is

5327
03:07:35,771 --> 03:07:38,950
coming up very soon so I feel like this

5328
03:07:37,329 --> 03:07:41,140
is a great place to wrap up this episode

5329
03:07:38,950 --> 03:07:42,610

I am smoking I just took a dab of some

5392
03:09:43,328 --> 03:09:48,850
strawberry diesel batter from apothecary

5393
03:09:46,148 --> 03:09:52,208
farms the label says it is 60 1.9

percent THC with a total of 70 3.7%

5395
03:09:52,209 --> 03:09:56,739
cannabinoids this stuff has a really

5396
03:09:54,430 --> 03:09:58,359
funky sort of a sour strawberry smell to

5397
03:09:56,738 --> 03:09:59,918
it it's definitely got the strawberries

5398
03:09:58,359 --> 03:10:00,550
with a hint of diesel coming through the

5399
03:09:59,918 --> 03:10:03,010
background

5400
03:10:00,549 --> 03:10:04,840
it tasted like strawberry incense and I

5401
03:10:03,010 --> 03:10:06,279
really like the flavor the flavor is

5402
03:10:04,840 --> 03:10:07,658
just hanging out on my tongue I could

5403
03:10:06,279 --> 03:10:09,850
use a drink but I don't want to drink

5404
03:10:07,658 --> 03:10:11,109
anything to wipe that strawberry flavor

5405
03:10:09,850 --> 03:10:12,939
off of my tongue I want to let that

5406
03:10:11,109 --> 03:10:14,918
linger as long as it can so I'm really

5407
03:10:12,939 --> 03:10:16,600
digging the flavor and the high is nice

5408
03:10:14,918 --> 03:10:18,760
it goes straight to the brain it's a

5409
03:10:16,600 --> 03:10:20,680
nice high-energy sort of a buzz I really

5410
03:10:18,760 --> 03:10:23,680
like the strawberry diesel batter from

5411
03:10:20,680 --> 03:10:25,328
apothecary farms alright let's get right

5412
03:10:23,680 --> 03:10:27,279
into the podcast you guys this is going

5413
03:10:25,328 --> 03:10:28,689
to be another grow lesson if you've been

5414
03:10:27,279 --> 03:10:30,998
following along you know I've been doing

5415
03:10:28,689 --> 03:10:32,800
a long series of grow lessons this

5416
03:10:30,998 --> 03:10:35,199
episode is going to be about Fino

5417
03:10:32,799 --> 03:10:36,698
hunting so far in my series of grow

5418
03:10:35,199 --> 03:10:38,619
lessons we have talked about setting a

5419
03:10:36,699 --> 03:10:40,359
goal for our grow we have chosen a white

5420
03:10:38,619 --> 03:10:42,248
spot for the grow we have selected and

5421
03:10:40,359 --> 03:10:44,020
purchased the proper equipment we have

5422
03:10:42,248 --> 03:10:45,699
set it up we've tested it we have

5423
03:10:44,020 --> 03:10:47,529
actually sprouted seeds we've acquired

5424
03:10:45,699 --> 03:10:49,359
clones we've got little baby plants

5425
03:10:47,529 --> 03:10:51,459
going we potted those into our three or

5426
03:10:49,359 --> 03:10:53,318
five maybe seven gallon pots we are

5427
03:10:51,459 --> 03:10:55,300
currently in the veg phase and my grow

5428
03:10:53,318 --> 03:10:56,680
lessons we have topped our plants we've

5429
03:10:55,299 --> 03:10:58,028
been doing lolli popping we've been

5430
03:10:56,680 --> 03:10:59,800
doing copying and twisting we've got

5431
03:10:58,029 --> 03:11:02,408
some canopy control techniques happening

5432
03:10:59,799 --> 03:11:04,599
we are almost ready to flower in my grow

5433
03:11:02,408 --> 03:11:06,309
lessons before we get to the flowering

5434
03:11:04,600 --> 03:11:08,559
phase I feel like there are a few things

5435
03:11:06,309 --> 03:11:10,658
we should understand we need to know how

5436
03:11:08,559 --> 03:11:12,578
to sex our appliance if you are growing

5437
03:11:10,658 --> 03:11:13,988
from seed you've got the opportunity to

5438
03:11:12,578 --> 03:11:15,759
find males those

5439
03:11:13,988 --> 03:11:17,738
ants won't reveal their sex until we are

5440
03:11:15,759 --> 03:11:19,658
early and flower we need to be able to

5441
03:11:17,738 --> 03:11:21,430
identify the male plants so that we can

5442
03:11:19,658 --> 03:11:23,738
remove them from the garden before they

5443
03:11:21,430 --> 03:11:25,180
pollinate our females another thing

5444
03:11:23,738 --> 03:11:26,798
we're going to talk about is selecting

5445
03:11:25,180 --> 03:11:29,379
mother plants and we're going to do that

5446
03:11:26,799 --> 03:11:31,509
through a Fino hunt let's jump right in

5447
03:11:29,379 --> 03:11:33,879
to talking about a Fino hunt and what a

5448
03:11:31,509 --> 03:11:36,609
Fino hunt is and what is the purpose of

5449
03:11:33,879 --> 03:11:39,549
Fino hunting now what do I mean by a

5450
03:11:36,609 --> 03:11:42,488
Fino hunt when I say a Fino hunt I am

5451
03:11:39,549 --> 03:11:45,339
referring to finding a desired phenotype

5452
03:11:42,488 --> 03:11:47,618
from a package of seeds now let's say

5453
03:11:45,338 --> 03:11:49,418
you acquired a package of seeds from the

5454
03:11:47,619 --> 03:11:51,789
hella dank seed company I would

5455
03:11:49,418 --> 03:11:53,020
recommend 10 seeds for a Fino hunt I do

5456
03:11:51,789 --> 03:11:54,459
sell packs of 5

5457
03:11:53,020 --> 03:11:55,988
I sell packs of 5 to make them

5458
03:11:54,459 --> 03:11:58,029
attainable so that everybody can afford

5459
03:11:55,988 --> 03:12:00,158
them I understand not everybody can buy

5460
03:11:58,029 --> 03:12:01,959
a 10 pack of seeds I would recommend 10

5461
03:12:00,158 --> 03:12:04,238
seeds for a fee no hunt so in this

5462
03:12:01,959 --> 03:12:05,979
situation we're going to run 10 seeds

5463
03:12:04,238 --> 03:12:08,139
you just got a fresh 10 pack of a rise

5464
03:12:05,978 --> 03:12:10,599
you don't know what's in there we need

5465
03:12:08,139 --> 03:12:13,538
to find that phenotype that works best

5466
03:12:10,600 --> 03:12:15,818
for you and your garden so sifting

5467
03:12:13,539 --> 03:12:17,259
through those seeds is a Fino hunt we

5468
03:12:15,818 --> 03:12:19,088
are going to grow them out and you were

5469
03:12:17,259 --> 03:12:21,189
going to find the phenotype that works

5470
03:12:19,088 --> 03:12:22,988
best for you the phenotype that works

5471
03:12:21,189 --> 03:12:24,729
best for your patients or your customers

5472
03:12:22,988 --> 03:12:26,918
and also you need the phenotype that

5473
03:12:24,728 --> 03:12:28,648
works best for your garden so the goal

5474
03:12:26,918 --> 03:12:31,180
here is to find a custom-tailored

5475
03:12:28,648 --> 03:12:32,918
phenotype out of this pack of seeds so

5476
03:12:31,180 --> 03:12:33,398
let's talk about a little bit how to do

5477
03:12:32,918 --> 03:12:35,738
that

5478
03:12:33,398 --> 03:12:38,019
doing a Fino hunt is one of my favorite

5479
03:12:35,738 --> 03:12:39,969
things to do in a grow environment I get

5480
03:12:38,020 --> 03:12:42,430
to do a lot of observation I get to find

5481
03:12:39,969 --> 03:12:44,708
surprises I may find the next best thing

5482
03:12:42,430 --> 03:12:46,479
I may find that next ken-dog I may find

5483
03:12:44,709 --> 03:12:48,729
the next golden coat I may find the next

5484
03:12:46,478 --> 03:12:50,798
Gorilla Glue I may find the next Girl

5485
03:12:48,728 --> 03:12:52,628
Scout cookies you never know what you

5486
03:12:50,799 --> 03:12:54,459
could come up with in a Fino hunt that

5487
03:12:52,629 --> 03:12:56,049
is one of my favorite parts it's like

5488
03:12:54,459 --> 03:12:57,879
opening Christmas presents you never

5489
03:12:56,049 --> 03:12:59,949
know what is in that box

5490
03:12:57,879 --> 03:13:01,779
suddenly I want to make a Forrest Gump

5491
03:12:59,949 --> 03:13:03,850
reference because you never know what

5492
03:13:01,779 --> 03:13:05,949
you're gonna get so this is how I would

5493
03:13:03,850 --> 03:13:06,459
do a Fino hunt I would get a ten pack of

5494
03:13:05,949 --> 03:13:08,739
seeds

5495
03:13:06,459 --> 03:13:11,560
I would germinate those ten seeds I

5496
03:13:08,738 --> 03:13:13,779
would carefully make sure that every one

5497
03:13:11,559 --> 03:13:15,548
of those plants is treated the exact

5498
03:13:13,779 --> 03:13:17,680
same I would put them all in the same

5499
03:13:15,549 --> 03:13:19,089
medium the same pot I would feed them

5500
03:13:17,680 --> 03:13:21,009
the same thing that would go under the

5501
03:13:19,088 --> 03:13:22,930
same light and it would be all in the

5502
03:13:21,009 --> 03:13:25,180
same environment because I don't want

5503
03:13:22,930 --> 03:13:27,279
any variation I want all of these

5504
03:13:25,180 --> 03:13:27,909
seedlings to get the same opportunity to

5505
03:13:27,279 --> 03:13:29,950
show me this

5506
03:13:27,909 --> 03:13:32,379
same potential so I germinate these

5507
03:13:29,950 --> 03:13:32,800
seeds I get them into pots I get them

5508
03:13:32,379 --> 03:13:35,409
going

5509
03:13:32,799 --> 03:13:37,840
I've edged them I start taking notes on

5510
03:13:35,409 --> 03:13:39,640
these plants very early I label them one

5511
03:13:37,840 --> 03:13:41,530
through ten so I've got whatever the

5512
03:13:39,640 --> 03:13:43,690
strain is we're gonna say a rise one a

5513
03:13:41,530 --> 03:13:45,400
rise to all the way up to number ten I'm

5514
03:13:43,690 --> 03:13:47,680
going to pay attention to these plants

5515
03:13:45,399 --> 03:13:49,180
and take a lot of notes if I see

5516
03:13:47,680 --> 03:13:51,280
anything weird I'm going to document

5517
03:13:49,180 --> 03:13:53,079
that if I get a plant that's just

5518
03:13:51,280 --> 03:13:54,851
growing like [ __ ] it's not keeping up

5519
03:13:53,079 --> 03:13:56,920
it's having problems it gets pulled out

5520
03:13:54,851 --> 03:13:58,930
of there I don't want to keep a shitty

5521
03:13:56,920 --> 03:14:00,489
plant around there's no reason to have a

5522
03:13:58,930 --> 03:14:01,930
shitty plant when you can Fino hunt

5523
03:14:00,489 --> 03:14:04,030
seeds and find a keeper

5524
03:14:01,930 --> 03:14:05,739
so I'll pay close attention to my plants

5525
03:14:04,030 --> 03:14:08,470
as they grow I'll take a lot of notes in

5526
03:14:05,739 --> 03:14:10,629
veg if I top the plants if I lollipop

5527
03:14:08,469 --> 03:14:12,969
the plants I make sure to do it equally

5528
03:14:10,629 --> 03:14:14,469
across the board I want all 10 of these

5529
03:14:12,969 --> 03:14:16,449
seedlings to get the same treatment

5530
03:14:14,469 --> 03:14:18,640
again we want them all to have the same

5531
03:14:16,450 --> 03:14:20,710
potential we were trying to audition

5532
03:14:18,640 --> 03:14:22,869
these two find the best one for our

5533
03:14:20,709 --> 03:14:24,069
situation so if you give them different

5534
03:14:22,870 --> 03:14:25,690
treatment they're going to come out

5535
03:14:24,069 --> 03:14:28,000
differently how do you know what the

5536
03:14:25,690 --> 03:14:30,730
best one is they all need to be treated

5537
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:32,500
equally in my opinion so I grow these

5538
03:14:30,729 --> 03:14:35,109
plants out as soon as they're big enough

5539
03:14:32,500 --> 03:14:38,620
I take a clone I am confident in my

5540
03:14:35,110 --> 03:14:40,690
cloning skills 99.9% of my clones will

5541
03:14:38,620 --> 03:14:43,090
survive if you were not confident in

5542
03:14:40,690 --> 03:14:45,579
your clone skills I suggest you take two

5543
03:14:43,090 --> 03:14:47,500
maybe three maybe five clones from each

5544
03:14:45,579 --> 03:14:49,180
plant so let them get large enough to

5545
03:14:47,500 --> 03:14:52,090
provide the amount of clones you need

5546
03:14:49,180 --> 03:14:53,950
get a clone from each plant carefully

5547
03:14:52,090 --> 03:14:56,260
label your clones you will have a rise

5548
03:14:53,950 --> 03:14:59,909
number one a rise number two you should

5549
03:14:56,260 --> 03:15:02,079
have clone a rise one clone arise to

5550
03:14:59,909 --> 03:15:04,060
carefully label them this will be very

5551
03:15:02,079 --> 03:15:06,340
important in the future this is your

5552
03:15:04,060 --> 03:15:08,560
reserve this is how you are going to

5553
03:15:06,340 --> 03:15:10,601
keep your plants around this is going to

5554
03:15:08,560 --> 03:15:11,680
segue into selecting a mother plant this

5555
03:15:10,601 --> 03:15:13,569
is how we're going to have a mother

5556
03:15:11,680 --> 03:15:15,280
plant to keep these genetics around

5557
03:15:13,569 --> 03:15:17,890
forever so you can continue to produce

5558
03:15:15,280 --> 03:15:20,260
this select phenotype until the end of

5559
03:15:17,890 --> 03:15:22,329
time that clone that we labeled is going

5560
03:15:20,260 --> 03:15:24,521
to become your future mother plants so

5561
03:15:22,329 --> 03:15:26,799
make sure it is labeled accurately so

5562
03:15:24,521 --> 03:15:28,870
again we label them arise one arise two

5563
03:15:26,799 --> 03:15:32,079
all the way up to a rise number ten then

5564
03:15:28,870 --> 03:15:33,700
we also label the clones a1 a2 a all the

5565
03:15:32,079 --> 03:15:35,260
way up to number 10 so we've got the

5566
03:15:33,700 --> 03:15:36,730
cloned owner and the corresponding

5567
03:15:35,260 --> 03:15:38,180
clones properly labeled there's no

5568
03:15:36,729 --> 03:15:39,770
confusion there

5569
03:15:38,180 --> 03:15:41,148
as I've done a complete episode on

5570
03:15:39,770 --> 03:15:43,488
cutting clones so if you need help

5571
03:15:41,148 --> 03:15:46,430
cutting your clones I recommend episode

5572
03:15:43,488 --> 03:15:48,500
number 346 for an in-depth lesson on

5573
03:15:46,430 --> 03:15:50,449
cutting clones and if you want a really

5574
03:15:48,500 --> 03:15:52,939
in-depth talk about mother plants check

5575
03:15:50,449 --> 03:15:54,710
out episode 315 that one will teach you

5576
03:15:52,939 --> 03:15:57,350
all about healthy and happy mother

5577
03:15:54,709 --> 03:15:59,688
plants the goal here is to get a clone

5578
03:15:57,350 --> 03:16:00,680
off of each of these seedlings before we

5579
03:15:59,689 --> 03:16:03,529
put them into flour

5580
03:16:00,680 --> 03:16:05,329
that way when we find the champion out

5581
03:16:03,529 --> 03:16:07,250
of this batch we've got a clone of that

5582
03:16:05,329 --> 03:16:09,738
so that we can continue to grow that

5583
03:16:07,250 --> 03:16:11,568
clone forever you keep that one clone

5584
03:16:09,738 --> 03:16:13,279
wife as a mother plant you never flower

5585
03:16:11,568 --> 03:16:15,409
it out and you can cut clones from that

5586
03:16:13,279 --> 03:16:17,210
as long as you keep it healthy so it's

5587
03:16:15,409 --> 03:16:19,520
always there to give you clones you have

5588
03:16:17,209 --> 03:16:22,188
now got a mother plant from your Fino

5589
03:16:19,520 --> 03:16:24,979
hunt that is your custom phenotype that

5590
03:16:22,189 --> 03:16:27,109
is for you maybe you like the more

5591
03:16:24,978 --> 03:16:28,818
sativa dominant phenotype maybe you like

5592
03:16:27,109 --> 03:16:30,710
the phenotype that smells more like

5593
03:16:28,818 --> 03:16:32,750
golden goat maybe you like the phenotype

5594
03:16:30,709 --> 03:16:34,219
that smells more like dirty feet maybe

5595
03:16:32,750 --> 03:16:35,779
you need the one that finishes quicker

5596
03:16:34,219 --> 03:16:37,398
maybe you're the kind of person that

5597
03:16:35,779 --> 03:16:38,000
likes to let them flower for a really

5598
03:16:37,398 --> 03:16:40,398
long time

5599
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:43,129
that's up to you you get to find that

5600
03:16:40,398 --> 03:16:45,170
one it works best for you in your grow

5601
03:16:43,129 --> 03:16:46,688
if you get a clone you've got a clone

5602
03:16:45,170 --> 03:16:48,738
that all of your other friends have

5603
03:16:46,689 --> 03:16:50,420
everybody's grown it everybody in the

5604
03:16:48,738 --> 03:16:52,039
neighborhood has it everybody has smoked

5605
03:16:50,420 --> 03:16:54,290
it there's nothing setting you apart

5606
03:16:52,040 --> 03:16:57,020
from the competition if you were growing

5607
03:16:54,290 --> 03:16:59,270
for a retail market purpose so growing

5608
03:16:57,020 --> 03:17:01,399
from seed you could find gold growing

5609
03:16:59,270 --> 03:17:03,409
from seed you can also find that custom

5610
03:17:01,398 --> 03:17:05,299
phenotype that works for you that works

5611
03:17:03,409 --> 03:17:07,309
for your garden and that works for the

5612
03:17:05,299 --> 03:17:09,619
market and honestly when you're growing

5613
03:17:07,309 --> 03:17:11,148
from seed I always recommend taking a

5614
03:17:09,620 --> 03:17:13,370
clone because who knows what you've got

5615
03:17:11,148 --> 03:17:15,379
what if you grow from seed and you find

5616
03:17:13,370 --> 03:17:17,090
the most amazing product you've ever

5617
03:17:15,379 --> 03:17:18,528
found and you don't have a clone you're

5618
03:17:17,090 --> 03:17:19,790
gonna be heartbroken you're gonna try to

5619
03:17:18,529 --> 03:17:22,670
revenge it which is a whole another

5620
03:17:19,790 --> 03:17:24,710
podcast that's a pain in the ass but if

5621
03:17:22,670 --> 03:17:27,199
you have got a clone it's already ready

5622
03:17:24,709 --> 03:17:29,599
to go if you cut a clone before you put

5623
03:17:27,199 --> 03:17:31,399
your plants in to flower that clone is

5624
03:17:29,600 --> 03:17:33,409
gonna go into a pot about two weeks

5625
03:17:31,398 --> 03:17:35,568
later then it'll be ready to go into

5626
03:17:33,409 --> 03:17:37,488
another pot a couple of weeks later you

5627
03:17:35,568 --> 03:17:39,559
can cut a bunch more clones off of that

5628
03:17:37,488 --> 03:17:42,228
and have that ready to go by the time

5629
03:17:39,559 --> 03:17:43,789
that first crop is finished so you will

5630
03:17:42,228 --> 03:17:45,619
have decided which one is the keeper

5631
03:17:43,790 --> 03:17:47,540
probably around week seven or eight and

5632
03:17:45,620 --> 03:17:49,970
you can take a bunch of clones and have

5633
03:17:47,540 --> 03:17:51,700
them ready almost on time to fill that

5634
03:17:49,969 --> 03:17:53,079
room when you cut down from the

5635
03:17:51,700 --> 03:17:55,150
you know hunt you don't have to skip

5636
03:17:53,079 --> 03:17:57,370
anytime it helps you move along quite

5637
03:17:55,149 --> 03:17:59,229
quickly so now our original plants have

5638
03:17:57,370 --> 03:18:01,150
grown out nice and large we have got

5639
03:17:59,229 --> 03:18:03,219
clones from everything they are properly

5640
03:18:01,149 --> 03:18:04,840
labeled we are confident that will at

5641
03:18:03,219 --> 03:18:07,390
least one of those clones from each

5642
03:18:04,840 --> 03:18:10,271
phenotype is going to root then it is

5643
03:18:07,390 --> 03:18:11,440
time to flower my Fino hunt that's when

5644
03:18:10,271 --> 03:18:13,811
the fun begins

5645
03:18:11,440 --> 03:18:15,880
we can tell a lot about our plants

5646
03:18:13,810 --> 03:18:17,590
during the veg cycle we can tell if you

5647
03:18:15,879 --> 03:18:19,479
like the growth structure if you like

5648
03:18:17,590 --> 03:18:21,310
the node spacing if you like the leaf

5649
03:18:19,479 --> 03:18:23,529
size that's going to indicate a lot of

5650
03:18:21,310 --> 03:18:25,329
things the real things we want to see

5651
03:18:23,530 --> 03:18:27,760
will not reveal themselves until they

5652
03:18:25,329 --> 03:18:29,319
are in flower so early and flower the

5653
03:18:27,760 --> 03:18:31,659
first things we need to pay attention to

5654
03:18:29,319 --> 03:18:33,101
we need to look for males if you're

5655
03:18:31,659 --> 03:18:35,560
growing from seed you've got the

5656
03:18:33,101 --> 03:18:37,960
opportunity to have males pop up in your

5657
03:18:35,560 --> 03:18:41,140
garden even if you are running feminized

5658
03:18:37,959 --> 03:18:43,750
seeds not all feminized seed makers make

5659
03:18:41,140 --> 03:18:46,449
seeds the same way some feminized seeds

5660
03:18:43,750 --> 03:18:47,890
were made with poor practices some

5661
03:18:46,450 --> 03:18:50,079
feminized seeds were made without

5662
03:18:47,890 --> 03:18:52,779
auditioning the parrot plants properly

5663
03:18:50,079 --> 03:18:55,840
before breeding with them you still may

5664
03:18:52,780 --> 03:18:58,450
find males or intersex traits in

5665
03:18:55,840 --> 03:19:00,431
feminized seeds just because the package

5666
03:18:58,450 --> 03:19:03,311
says feminized doesn't mean you can get

5667
03:19:00,431 --> 03:19:05,800
lazy and stop paying attention so we

5668
03:19:03,310 --> 03:19:08,649
need to look for males or hermaphrodites

5669
03:19:05,799 --> 03:19:11,170
in our garden early in flower I would

5670
03:19:08,649 --> 03:19:13,420
start looking day three day four day

5671
03:19:11,170 --> 03:19:15,431
five you're gonna start seeing signs of

5672
03:19:13,420 --> 03:19:17,229
male pre flower as soon as you are

5673
03:19:15,431 --> 03:19:19,720
certain that that plant is a male it

5674
03:19:17,229 --> 03:19:21,879
needs to come out of the garden we do

5675
03:19:19,719 --> 03:19:23,229
not want boys in there the girls are

5676
03:19:21,879 --> 03:19:25,180
going to start developing pistols

5677
03:19:23,229 --> 03:19:26,920
they'll be able to receive pollen when

5678
03:19:25,181 --> 03:19:28,810
those males drop pollen are gonna seed

5679
03:19:26,920 --> 03:19:32,021
your plant we need to get the boys out

5680
03:19:28,810 --> 03:19:33,909
as soon as possible I do plan to talk

5681
03:19:32,021 --> 03:19:35,409
more in depth about sexing our plants in

5682
03:19:33,909 --> 03:19:37,719
a future episode when we get into the

5683
03:19:35,409 --> 03:19:39,729
flowering phase but quickly let's talk

5684
03:19:37,719 --> 03:19:42,819
about identifying a male and a female

5685
03:19:39,729 --> 03:19:44,739
cannabis plant early in flower when I am

5686
03:19:42,819 --> 03:19:46,690
trying to identify the sex of a cannabis

5687
03:19:44,739 --> 03:19:49,420
plant there are two spots I like to look

5688
03:19:46,690 --> 03:19:52,239
and I find those spots very reliable the

5689
03:19:49,420 --> 03:19:53,979
very tip-top bud will be the first spot

5690
03:19:52,239 --> 03:19:56,619
to show you sex when you throw those

5691
03:19:53,979 --> 03:19:58,569
plants into flower also lower on the

5692
03:19:56,620 --> 03:20:00,280
plant where you've got an intersection

5693
03:19:58,569 --> 03:20:01,601
you've got the little peace sign you've

5694
03:20:00,280 --> 03:20:03,610
got two branches coming off and you've

5695
03:20:01,601 --> 03:20:05,141
got the main stock coming up right there

5696
03:20:03,610 --> 03:20:07,150
at that intersection it

5697
03:20:05,140 --> 03:20:09,279
to tell you if it is a boy or a girl so

5698
03:20:07,149 --> 03:20:11,560
a few days into flower our plants will

5699
03:20:09,280 --> 03:20:13,961
start giving us signs of male or female

5700
03:20:11,560 --> 03:20:15,761
sex if you grab a branch and look

5701
03:20:13,960 --> 03:20:17,350
closely there will be the main branch

5702
03:20:15,761 --> 03:20:19,601
coming up then there will be a little

5703
03:20:17,351 --> 03:20:22,541
chute coming off of that where that

5704
03:20:19,601 --> 03:20:24,431
chute splits off there will be signs of

5705
03:20:22,540 --> 03:20:26,140
sex right at that intersection right

5706
03:20:24,431 --> 03:20:27,190
inside of that little V there will be

5707
03:20:26,140 --> 03:20:30,130
signs of sex

5708
03:20:27,190 --> 03:20:30,671
if you see a wart like thing popping up

5709
03:20:30,130 --> 03:20:32,501
right there

5710
03:20:30,671 --> 03:20:34,479
if you see a little tiny acorn popping

5711
03:20:32,501 --> 03:20:36,610
up right there if it's got a ball coming

5712
03:20:34,479 --> 03:20:39,100
out of there that is probably a male

5713
03:20:36,610 --> 03:20:41,200
plant if it looks like it's got a hair

5714
03:20:39,101 --> 03:20:42,971
coming out just one little pistol maybe

5715
03:20:41,200 --> 03:20:45,791
two little pistol hairs doing a peace

5716
03:20:42,970 --> 03:20:47,979
sign that is a female so at the

5717
03:20:45,790 --> 03:20:50,319
intersections at the nodes you will see

5718
03:20:47,979 --> 03:20:52,630
either little hairs coming out or you

5719
03:20:50,319 --> 03:20:54,101
may see what looks like balls now be

5720
03:20:52,630 --> 03:20:55,569
careful in early flower because

5721
03:20:54,101 --> 03:20:57,371
sometimes those little balls are

5722
03:20:55,569 --> 03:20:59,831
actually calyxes and it can be confusing

5723
03:20:57,370 --> 03:21:02,710
so if you've identified something that

5724
03:20:59,831 --> 03:21:05,710
you think may be a male flower mark that

5725
03:21:02,710 --> 03:21:07,479
plant say arise number seven looks like

5726
03:21:05,710 --> 03:21:09,520
it could be a boy write that down

5727
03:21:07,479 --> 03:21:11,319
somewhere and then every day when you go

5728
03:21:09,521 --> 03:21:14,021
in that garden head right over to number

5729
03:21:11,319 --> 03:21:15,970
seven and look at the progress if those

5730
03:21:14,021 --> 03:21:17,650
balls that are on the plant start

5731
03:21:15,970 --> 03:21:19,511
drooping and hanging down that is

5732
03:21:17,649 --> 03:21:21,159
definitely a male it's growing a set of

5733
03:21:19,511 --> 03:21:24,190
balls you need to get that boy out of

5734
03:21:21,159 --> 03:21:26,620
there if that ball starts putting out a

5735
03:21:24,190 --> 03:21:29,021
long hair that is a calyx and you've got

5736
03:21:26,620 --> 03:21:30,340
a female plant up toward the top of the

5737
03:21:29,021 --> 03:21:32,739
plant we should see a little bit of

5738
03:21:30,341 --> 03:21:34,720
production you will either see buds that

5739
03:21:32,739 --> 03:21:36,610
look like dandelions those are your

5740
03:21:34,720 --> 03:21:38,649
girls if they're getting hairs the white

5741
03:21:36,610 --> 03:21:40,871
furry pistols are popping out those are

5742
03:21:38,649 --> 03:21:42,310
females that's what you want if it looks

5743
03:21:40,870 --> 03:21:43,569
like you're making little sets of

5744
03:21:42,310 --> 03:21:45,489
bananas up at the top

5745
03:21:43,569 --> 03:21:47,501
those are your boy plants we need to get

5746
03:21:45,489 --> 03:21:49,601
rid of those it may look like you've got

5747
03:21:47,501 --> 03:21:51,610
a little bud that is already loaded up

5748
03:21:49,601 --> 03:21:54,131
with seeds those are not seeds

5749
03:21:51,610 --> 03:21:56,860
those are pollen sacks we need to get

5750
03:21:54,130 --> 03:21:59,590
that boy out of the room immediately I

5751
03:21:56,860 --> 03:22:02,021
can only describe males and females so

5752
03:21:59,591 --> 03:22:04,899
much through words with the podcast it

5753
03:22:02,021 --> 03:22:06,641
is your responsibility as a ganja farmer

5754
03:22:04,899 --> 03:22:08,591
to Google what a male and female

5755
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:11,290
cannabis plant look like you need some

5756
03:22:08,591 --> 03:22:13,479
images get ahead of yourself go look

5757
03:22:11,290 --> 03:22:16,000
before you put your plants in to flower

5758
03:22:13,479 --> 03:22:18,069
do not make the mistake of thinking I

5759
03:22:16,001 --> 03:22:19,059
can identify a male plant and then let

5760
03:22:18,069 --> 03:22:22,389
that male go

5761
03:22:19,059 --> 03:22:23,829
by day 10 day 14 he's gonna be dropping

5762
03:22:22,389 --> 03:22:25,898
pollen and you're going to have a

5763
03:22:23,829 --> 03:22:28,029
pollinated crop if you're a new grower

5764
03:22:25,898 --> 03:22:30,039
that is very discouraging everything

5765
03:22:28,029 --> 03:22:31,899
just went to [ __ ] your main goal is to

5766
03:22:30,040 --> 03:22:34,120
produce a crop with no seeds you just

5767
03:22:31,898 --> 03:22:36,010
reduce potency you just reduced harvest

5768
03:22:34,120 --> 03:22:38,290
weight you definitely reduced retail

5769
03:22:36,010 --> 03:22:40,270
value everything is not how you want it

5770
03:22:38,290 --> 03:22:43,450
if you've got seeds in there so be very

5771
03:22:40,270 --> 03:22:45,550
careful to get the boys out very very

5772
03:22:43,450 --> 03:22:47,649
early now if you were observing your

5773
03:22:45,549 --> 03:22:49,778
plants and your plants show ballsacks

5774
03:22:47,648 --> 03:22:52,000
and they show hairs they need to go

5775
03:22:49,779 --> 03:22:52,600
immediately those are hermaphrodite

5776
03:22:52,000 --> 03:22:54,670
plants

5777
03:22:52,600 --> 03:22:56,439
I know it's 2018 and we're supposed to

5778
03:22:54,670 --> 03:22:57,939
be acceptable I do not accept

5779
03:22:56,439 --> 03:23:00,729
hermaphroditic plants in my garden for

5780
03:22:57,939 --> 03:23:02,920
any reason they must go we're trying to

5781
03:23:00,728 --> 03:23:04,959
produce high-grade seedless cannabis and

5782
03:23:02,920 --> 03:23:07,359
a hermaphrodite plant is going to ruin

5783
03:23:04,959 --> 03:23:08,978
our whole goal of a seedless garden so

5784
03:23:07,359 --> 03:23:10,809
get rid of the males and get rid of the

5785
03:23:08,978 --> 03:23:12,250
hermaphrodites if you were not sure if

5786
03:23:10,809 --> 03:23:14,829
that plant is a male or hermaphrodite

5787
03:23:12,250 --> 03:23:17,109
pay very close attention to it keep an

5788
03:23:14,829 --> 03:23:19,239
eye on that part you think may be a male

5789
03:23:17,109 --> 03:23:21,309
part it will start to open up it will

5790
03:23:19,239 --> 03:23:23,170
start to hang it will give you plenty of

5791
03:23:21,309 --> 03:23:25,449
warning that it wants to release pollen

5792
03:23:23,170 --> 03:23:26,978
pay close attention now once you've

5793
03:23:25,450 --> 03:23:28,630
called your boys and you think you are

5794
03:23:26,978 --> 03:23:30,760
past the part of the plants revealing

5795
03:23:28,629 --> 03:23:32,318
sex if you were growing from seed you

5796
03:23:30,760 --> 03:23:35,170
still need to pay attention for

5797
03:23:32,318 --> 03:23:37,989
hermaphrodites it is not uncommon for

5798
03:23:35,170 --> 03:23:40,809
things to reveal intersex traits late in

5799
03:23:37,989 --> 03:23:43,209
flower sometime around week 7 or week 8

5800
03:23:40,809 --> 03:23:45,100
or especially week 9 and if you push

5801
03:23:43,209 --> 03:23:47,709
them real hard its way likely to see

5802
03:23:45,100 --> 03:23:50,050
them toward week 10 so pay attention to

5803
03:23:47,709 --> 03:23:53,079
the hermaphrodite traits in your plants

5804
03:23:50,049 --> 03:23:55,179
if a plant shows herm late in flower

5805
03:23:53,079 --> 03:23:57,700
you've got some considerations to make

5806
03:23:55,180 --> 03:24:00,279
if it didn't pop up until week 9 that

5807
03:23:57,700 --> 03:24:02,290
may be okay if that weed is fire if you

5808
03:24:00,279 --> 03:24:03,220
just produce some amazing product and

5809
03:24:02,290 --> 03:24:05,590
that plant Herms

5810
03:24:03,219 --> 03:24:07,420
late in the bloom cycle that may be okay

5811
03:24:05,590 --> 03:24:09,040
we're gonna cut the plants down before

5812
03:24:07,420 --> 03:24:11,500
that hermaphrodite is able to cause us

5813
03:24:09,040 --> 03:24:13,750
any problems also a lot of their

5814
03:24:11,500 --> 03:24:16,930
hermaphrodite plants that show intersex

5815
03:24:13,750 --> 03:24:18,579
traits late in flower produce sterile

5816
03:24:16,930 --> 03:24:20,500
male flowers they won't even produce

5817
03:24:18,579 --> 03:24:22,359
pollen that can pollinate a room it'll

5818
03:24:20,500 --> 03:24:23,920
pop out a couple nanners and they'll dry

5819
03:24:22,359 --> 03:24:26,200
up immediately they won't ever produce

5820
03:24:23,920 --> 03:24:27,909
pollen so that is up to you if you get a

5821
03:24:26,200 --> 03:24:29,560
plant that does hermaphrodite late and

5822
03:24:27,909 --> 03:24:31,898
flower if it's not going to cause

5823
03:24:29,559 --> 03:24:32,329
problems and it produces amazing product

5824
03:24:31,898 --> 03:24:33,949
it

5825
03:24:32,329 --> 03:24:36,110
maybe worth keeping around that is

5826
03:24:33,950 --> 03:24:37,940
something for you to consider also if

5827
03:24:36,110 --> 03:24:40,220
you ever share that clone with people

5828
03:24:37,940 --> 03:24:42,021
maybe let them know hey bro at the end

5829
03:24:40,219 --> 03:24:44,329
of week 9 this one might throw a couple

5830
03:24:42,021 --> 03:24:45,620
of nanners on you as an experienced

5831
03:24:44,329 --> 03:24:46,129
grower that's something I'm familiar

5832
03:24:45,620 --> 03:24:47,570
with

5833
03:24:46,129 --> 03:24:49,819
that's something I'm comfortable with

5834
03:24:47,569 --> 03:24:52,579
that's something I can deal with very

5835
03:24:49,819 --> 03:24:54,619
many of the chem dog derived strains

5836
03:24:52,579 --> 03:24:56,989
will Herm on you if you let them go past

5837
03:24:54,620 --> 03:24:58,579
nine weeks that is not rare if you let

5838
03:24:56,989 --> 03:25:00,799
it go too long it'll throw out a couple

5839
03:24:58,579 --> 03:25:02,510
nanners but those nanners

5840
03:25:00,799 --> 03:25:04,099
don't contain any pollen they will not

5841
03:25:02,510 --> 03:25:05,630
pollinate anything they'll just pop up a

5842
03:25:04,100 --> 03:25:07,610
couple of male bananas right at the end

5843
03:25:05,629 --> 03:25:09,229
so the way to solve that either cut it

5844
03:25:07,610 --> 03:25:11,210
down right before that happens because I

5845
03:25:09,229 --> 03:25:13,069
know when it happens it happens at day

5846
03:25:11,209 --> 03:25:15,139
70 so cut them down about day 68

5847
03:25:13,069 --> 03:25:16,760
everything should be cool and I've also

5848
03:25:15,139 --> 03:25:18,829
grown that plant enough to know that

5849
03:25:16,760 --> 03:25:20,630
those male flowers don't produce any

5850
03:25:18,829 --> 03:25:22,940
pollen so even if I do let it finish if

5851
03:25:20,629 --> 03:25:24,589
I let it go 70 72 days it's still not

5852
03:25:22,940 --> 03:25:26,810
going to cause a problem and even if

5853
03:25:24,590 --> 03:25:28,280
they did spit out pollen I'm 72 days in

5854
03:25:26,810 --> 03:25:29,719
the flower there's no time for anything

5855
03:25:28,280 --> 03:25:31,550
to happen all of my pistols have been

5856
03:25:29,719 --> 03:25:33,500
shriveled up by then there's nowhere for

5857
03:25:31,549 --> 03:25:35,239
that pollen to be received so you have

5858
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:37,729
things to consider if your plants are

5859
03:25:35,239 --> 03:25:39,649
hermaphroditic late in flower if it's

5860
03:25:37,729 --> 03:25:41,420
early in flower call them get rid of

5861
03:25:39,649 --> 03:25:43,549
them if it's an obvious from Aphrodite

5862
03:25:41,420 --> 03:25:45,979
toss it if you've just got one flower

5863
03:25:43,549 --> 03:25:47,599
laid in I would think about it now if

5864
03:25:45,979 --> 03:25:49,789
you've got one hermaphrodite flower late

5865
03:25:47,600 --> 03:25:51,950
in and that plant is only a six on a

5866
03:25:49,790 --> 03:25:53,480
scale of 10 you still call it if you've

5867
03:25:51,950 --> 03:25:55,190
got a 9 or a 10 and a hermaphrodite

5868
03:25:53,479 --> 03:25:56,899
flower that's when you kind of consider

5869
03:25:55,190 --> 03:25:58,970
your like is it worth that one herm or

5870
03:25:56,899 --> 03:25:59,420
not but that is a growers decision to

5871
03:25:58,969 --> 03:26:01,729
make

5872
03:25:59,420 --> 03:26:03,200
so that is a quick rant on sexing your

5873
03:26:01,729 --> 03:26:05,270
plants I do plan on going into more

5874
03:26:03,200 --> 03:26:07,579
depth on that in a future episode you

5875
03:26:05,271 --> 03:26:09,680
are looking for the little hairs or the

5876
03:26:07,579 --> 03:26:11,510
balls if it's got balls it's got to go

5877
03:26:09,680 --> 03:26:14,420
if it's got hairs and balls it

5878
03:26:11,510 --> 03:26:15,590
definitely has to go now once we call

5879
03:26:14,420 --> 03:26:18,110
the males and the potential

5880
03:26:15,590 --> 03:26:21,021
hermaphrodites you have probably got 40

5881
03:26:18,110 --> 03:26:23,420
to 60% of your remaining stock cannabis

5882
03:26:21,021 --> 03:26:25,489
plants average about 50% male and 50%

5883
03:26:23,420 --> 03:26:27,560
female so by day 14

5884
03:26:25,489 --> 03:26:29,510
you have probably eliminated forty to

5885
03:26:27,560 --> 03:26:31,369
sixty percent of the room if you started

5886
03:26:29,510 --> 03:26:33,500
with ten seeds you were probably down to

5887
03:26:31,370 --> 03:26:35,750
about five you may have six you may have

5888
03:26:33,500 --> 03:26:38,209
four I'm gonna go with five for the rest

5889
03:26:35,750 --> 03:26:39,560
of this lesson so we've got five plants

5890
03:26:38,209 --> 03:26:41,479
there in there finishing pots they're

5891
03:26:39,560 --> 03:26:42,829
about two weeks into flower we've pulled

5892
03:26:41,479 --> 03:26:44,420
out all the males we've pulled out all

5893
03:26:42,829 --> 03:26:45,148
the hermaphrodites we are still paying

5894
03:26:44,420 --> 03:26:47,578
attention

5895
03:26:45,148 --> 03:26:50,488
for intersex traits we're also keeping a

5896
03:26:47,578 --> 03:26:52,228
lot of notes write down everything you

5897
03:26:50,488 --> 03:26:54,270
feed these plants write down everything

5898
03:26:52,228 --> 03:26:56,219
you spray on these plants right down the

5899
03:26:54,270 --> 03:26:58,408
reactions of the plants to those

5900
03:26:56,219 --> 03:26:59,728
procedures if you see one plant do

5901
03:26:58,408 --> 03:27:01,590
something different than all of the

5902
03:26:59,728 --> 03:27:04,288
others as a reaction to something you

5903
03:27:01,590 --> 03:27:06,270
did document that that may mean a lot to

5904
03:27:04,289 --> 03:27:08,369
you in the future let's say that plant

5905
03:27:06,270 --> 03:27:10,319
one and plant five become the two best

5906
03:27:08,369 --> 03:27:12,510
keepers out of this phenol hunt and you

5907
03:27:10,318 --> 03:27:14,368
need to narrow it down to one maybe

5908
03:27:12,510 --> 03:27:16,318
that weird note you wrote about plant

5909
03:27:14,369 --> 03:27:17,909
number one will be the reason you call

5910
03:27:16,318 --> 03:27:21,328
that one and the reason you keep number

5911
03:27:17,908 --> 03:27:23,578
five so keep a lot of notes so I do plan

5912
03:27:21,328 --> 03:27:25,260
to do in-depth lessons on each week of

5913
03:27:23,578 --> 03:27:27,208
the bloom cycle I'm going to break it

5914
03:27:25,260 --> 03:27:29,550
down in two trimesters will do weeks one

5915
03:27:27,209 --> 03:27:31,409
through three four through six and seven

5916
03:27:29,549 --> 03:27:33,509
through nine and we'll talk about that

5917
03:27:31,408 --> 03:27:35,578
in depth we're gonna fast-forward a

5918
03:27:33,510 --> 03:27:37,168
little bit through the grow cycle here

5919
03:27:35,578 --> 03:27:39,600
in the phenotype talk and we're gonna

5920
03:27:37,168 --> 03:27:41,158
get toward the end of the harvest during

5921
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:43,078
the grow phase during the bloom phase

5922
03:27:41,158 --> 03:27:44,879
our plants got the same exact treatment

5923
03:27:43,078 --> 03:27:46,559
we've only got five of them it should

5924
03:27:44,879 --> 03:27:48,208
have been fairly easy to treat them all

5925
03:27:46,559 --> 03:27:49,708
the same they got the same amount of

5926
03:27:48,209 --> 03:27:51,569
light they got the same amount of

5927
03:27:49,709 --> 03:27:53,579
lollipop being the same type of pruning

5928
03:27:51,568 --> 03:27:55,618
the same type of topping the exact same

5929
03:27:53,578 --> 03:27:58,168
feedings the exact same pest management

5930
03:27:55,619 --> 03:28:00,060
the exact same foliar feeding 's you get

5931
03:27:58,168 --> 03:28:02,430
my point we treated them all the same so

5932
03:28:00,059 --> 03:28:04,708
that we can see reliable outcomes from

5933
03:28:02,430 --> 03:28:07,109
each seedling now just like any crop

5934
03:28:04,709 --> 03:28:10,739
make sure you flush for ten to fourteen

5935
03:28:07,109 --> 03:28:13,078
days before harvest then harvest I have

5936
03:28:10,738 --> 03:28:14,939
done a long and in-depth episode on

5937
03:28:13,078 --> 03:28:17,369
harvesting and drying and curing our

5938
03:28:14,939 --> 03:28:18,988
plants if you need tips on drying and

5939
03:28:17,369 --> 03:28:21,498
curing your freshly harvested cannabis

5940
03:28:18,988 --> 03:28:24,840
plants I recommend you listen to episode

5941
03:28:21,498 --> 03:28:27,238
326 titled drying and curing I will give

5942
03:28:24,840 --> 03:28:29,248
you a detailed step-by-step lesson on

5943
03:28:27,238 --> 03:28:31,680
drying and curing your freshly harvested

5944
03:28:29,248 --> 03:28:33,029
cannabis so you've got to grow it you've

5945
03:28:31,680 --> 03:28:35,279
got to flower it then you've got to

5946
03:28:33,029 --> 03:28:37,289
flush it then harvest it then dry it and

5947
03:28:35,279 --> 03:28:40,319
cure it and trim it guess what you get

5948
03:28:37,289 --> 03:28:42,180
to do next you get to have a smoke party

5949
03:28:40,318 --> 03:28:43,559
depending on how much you grew depending

5950
03:28:42,180 --> 03:28:45,359
on how many people you trust and how

5951
03:28:43,559 --> 03:28:47,728
many friends you've got you get to have

5952
03:28:45,359 --> 03:28:50,459
a few people come over and test your

5953
03:28:47,728 --> 03:28:52,260
pinot hunt this is one of the most fun

5954
03:28:50,459 --> 03:28:54,600
and rewarding parts of growing cannabis

5955
03:28:52,260 --> 03:28:56,581
you started with ten seeds about a

5956
03:28:54,600 --> 03:28:58,021
hundred and twenty days ago and now

5957
03:28:56,581 --> 03:28:59,521
you've got a small group of close

5958
03:28:58,021 --> 03:29:02,161
friends at your house helping you narrow

5959
03:28:59,521 --> 03:29:04,771
it down to decide what plant is going to

5960
03:29:02,161 --> 03:29:05,880
be part of your future grow now when you

5961
03:29:04,771 --> 03:29:08,431
and your friends are narrowing down

5962
03:29:05,880 --> 03:29:09,870
which phenotype to select you get to

5963
03:29:08,431 --> 03:29:11,701
make the final decision don't let

5964
03:29:09,870 --> 03:29:13,740
anybody sway you on the final decision

5965
03:29:11,700 --> 03:29:16,350
because you are the grower you are the

5966
03:29:13,740 --> 03:29:18,990
one doing the work this is your art you

5967
03:29:16,351 --> 03:29:20,791
get to decide but what I like to do is

5968
03:29:18,990 --> 03:29:22,890
after everything is dried and cured and

5969
03:29:20,790 --> 03:29:24,479
we're ready to smoke it I get Mike over

5970
03:29:22,890 --> 03:29:26,880
I get Kevin over I bring a couple other

5971
03:29:24,479 --> 03:29:28,740
folks over and I give them five little

5972
03:29:26,880 --> 03:29:30,210
buds and if we've got time to do it

5973
03:29:28,740 --> 03:29:31,921
we'll smoke them all right here we'll

5974
03:29:30,210 --> 03:29:33,270
just take a couple bong rips of each or

5975
03:29:31,921 --> 03:29:35,281
whatever and see what it all tastes like

5976
03:29:33,271 --> 03:29:37,141
see what it smells like and look for

5977
03:29:35,281 --> 03:29:38,490
what you're looking for are you looking

5978
03:29:37,140 --> 03:29:40,261
for flavor are you looking for a

5979
03:29:38,490 --> 03:29:42,479
specific aroma are you looking for a

5980
03:29:40,261 --> 03:29:44,490
specific effect are you looking for a

5981
03:29:42,479 --> 03:29:46,200
bag appeal if you're growing like I said

5982
03:29:44,490 --> 03:29:48,120
earlier if you are a retail market

5983
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:49,979
grower you're probably going for some

5984
03:29:48,120 --> 03:29:52,170
bag appeal you're going to need the buds

5985
03:29:49,979 --> 03:29:54,180
that look the best also you may want

5986
03:29:52,171 --> 03:29:56,041
something that is unique if you've got

5987
03:29:54,181 --> 03:29:58,261
something that smells like oranges or

5988
03:29:56,040 --> 03:29:59,729
strawberries or blueberries we've all

5989
03:29:58,261 --> 03:30:02,190
got that if you've got something that

5990
03:29:59,729 --> 03:30:04,350
smells like oranges and gas and cherries

5991
03:30:02,190 --> 03:30:06,631
and dirty feet and gets you high as [ __ ]

5992
03:30:04,351 --> 03:30:08,881
and finishes in 60 days you just found

5993
03:30:06,630 --> 03:30:11,010
gold that is probably the one you want

5994
03:30:08,880 --> 03:30:12,780
to keep so find the one that works best

5995
03:30:11,011 --> 03:30:14,729
for you let your friends do a little

5996
03:30:12,781 --> 03:30:17,431
tasting and let them kind of vote on it

5997
03:30:14,729 --> 03:30:19,290
they may agree they may not decide what

5998
03:30:17,431 --> 03:30:20,819
works best for you it's just great to

5999
03:30:19,290 --> 03:30:22,350
have input from your friends and it's

6000
03:30:20,819 --> 03:30:25,649
always a good time to have a little

6001
03:30:22,351 --> 03:30:27,810
phyno hunt party with the crew so here's

6002
03:30:25,649 --> 03:30:30,841
a quick breakdown of a phyno hunt the

6003
03:30:27,810 --> 03:30:33,440
main point is to find the outlier in a

6004
03:30:30,841 --> 03:30:36,001
population of seeds we do so by

6005
03:30:33,440 --> 03:30:38,551
germinating a batch of seeds in that

6006
03:30:36,001 --> 03:30:40,470
process we remove the problematic plants

6007
03:30:38,550 --> 03:30:41,069
which may be males hermaphrodites or

6008
03:30:40,470 --> 03:30:43,800
mutants

6009
03:30:41,069 --> 03:30:45,661
then we take clones before we flower our

6010
03:30:43,800 --> 03:30:47,609
plants we carefully label those plants

6011
03:30:45,661 --> 03:30:49,560
to match the clones so we've got plant

6012
03:30:47,610 --> 03:30:51,690
one and clone one plant two and clone

6013
03:30:49,560 --> 03:30:52,770
two that way when we're done we've got

6014
03:30:51,690 --> 03:30:54,961
mother plants we're gonna talk about

6015
03:30:52,771 --> 03:30:56,701
that a little more in just a second so

6016
03:30:54,960 --> 03:30:58,140
we've pop seeds we've removed the

6017
03:30:56,700 --> 03:31:00,660
problems we've got clones

6018
03:30:58,140 --> 03:31:02,970
now we flower out our plants in that

6019
03:31:00,661 --> 03:31:05,581
process take a lot of notes

6020
03:31:02,970 --> 03:31:08,251
so you know what you did we are cannabis

6021
03:31:05,581 --> 03:31:10,318
consumers week may have fuzzy memories I

6022
03:31:08,251 --> 03:31:12,119
like to smoke before I work in the

6023
03:31:10,318 --> 03:31:15,148
sometimes I may forget some details

6024
03:31:12,119 --> 03:31:17,069
that's why I write down everything that

6025
03:31:15,148 --> 03:31:19,648
notepad isn't gonna forget anything that

6026
03:31:17,068 --> 03:31:21,629
Google document won't forget anything my

6027
03:31:19,648 --> 03:31:24,448
high ass will probably forget a couple

6028
03:31:21,629 --> 03:31:26,278
of details write your [ __ ] down so

6029
03:31:24,449 --> 03:31:26,908
finish the crop get it all the way to

6030
03:31:26,279 --> 03:31:29,640
the end

6031
03:31:26,908 --> 03:31:31,049
flush it harvest dry and cure do a

6032
03:31:29,639 --> 03:31:33,599
little smoke test with your friends

6033
03:31:31,049 --> 03:31:35,458
decide which one you like the best what

6034
03:31:33,600 --> 03:31:37,350
works for your garden what works for you

6035
03:31:35,459 --> 03:31:39,180
what works for your clientele are you

6036
03:31:37,350 --> 03:31:41,309
growing for a medical patient what works

6037
03:31:39,180 --> 03:31:43,889
best for them when I get the opportunity

6038
03:31:41,309 --> 03:31:44,969
I like to send my finished products to a

6039
03:31:43,889 --> 03:31:47,010
lab for testing

6040
03:31:44,969 --> 03:31:49,168
you would be surprised at how many

6041
03:31:47,010 --> 03:31:50,850
plants we select as the keeper that are

6042
03:31:49,168 --> 03:31:53,039
not the highest tester in the batch

6043
03:31:50,850 --> 03:31:54,930
sometimes the highest tester isn't the

6044
03:31:53,039 --> 03:31:56,819
one with the best flavor sometimes the

6045
03:31:54,930 --> 03:31:58,680
one with the highest test does not bring

6046
03:31:56,818 --> 03:32:00,418
the best high when you smoke it

6047
03:31:58,680 --> 03:32:03,180
sometimes those lab results are

6048
03:32:00,418 --> 03:32:05,430
impressive but we did not choose the one

6049
03:32:03,180 --> 03:32:07,918
that gave us the best results based on

6050
03:32:05,430 --> 03:32:09,630
our smoke test sometimes we did choose

6051
03:32:07,918 --> 03:32:11,908
the one that matches up with the test

6052
03:32:09,629 --> 03:32:13,679
but not always and if it's more common

6053
03:32:11,908 --> 03:32:15,748
that we don't agree with the lab test is

6054
03:32:13,680 --> 03:32:17,100
which one is our keeper another thing

6055
03:32:15,748 --> 03:32:19,289
you're gonna find when you do a phenol

6056
03:32:17,100 --> 03:32:21,180
hunt you will find two that you really

6057
03:32:19,289 --> 03:32:23,189
really want to keep it'll be one that

6058
03:32:21,180 --> 03:32:24,748
smells real well and smokes real well

6059
03:32:23,189 --> 03:32:26,488
and gets you super-high and there will

6060
03:32:24,748 --> 03:32:28,469
be one that does all of that pretty well

6061
03:32:26,488 --> 03:32:30,299
but it harvests way better being a

6062
03:32:28,469 --> 03:32:31,889
grower that's always hard to decide I

6063
03:32:30,299 --> 03:32:33,538
always keep the one that smokes better

6064
03:32:31,889 --> 03:32:35,698
we can just grow more next month

6065
03:32:33,539 --> 03:32:37,168
try not select because it's pretty try

6066
03:32:35,699 --> 03:32:40,350
not to select because it harvests the

6067
03:32:37,168 --> 03:32:43,498
most try to select based on effect based

6068
03:32:40,350 --> 03:32:46,109
on potency based on desirability based

6069
03:32:43,498 --> 03:32:47,520
on marketability there's enough [ __ ]

6070
03:32:46,109 --> 03:32:49,709
out there that looks really good on

6071
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:51,418
Instagram and doesn't smoke worth a [ __ ]

6072
03:32:49,709 --> 03:32:53,850
so even if your plants aren't super

6073
03:32:51,418 --> 03:32:55,828
photogenic if they do what you need when

6074
03:32:53,850 --> 03:32:57,779
you smoke them when you and your market

6075
03:32:55,828 --> 03:32:59,728
consume them that's exactly what you're

6076
03:32:57,779 --> 03:33:01,020
aiming for so that is the phenotype you

6077
03:32:59,728 --> 03:33:03,898
want to find find the one that works

6078
03:33:01,020 --> 03:33:06,359
best for you that is a custom phenotype

6079
03:33:03,898 --> 03:33:09,299
for you your clientele and your garden

6080
03:33:06,359 --> 03:33:10,770
now earlier I mentioned mother plants we

6081
03:33:09,299 --> 03:33:12,389
took clones off of these plants before

6082
03:33:10,770 --> 03:33:14,668
we flowered them so in a grow room

6083
03:33:12,389 --> 03:33:16,708
somewhere we've got five plants just

6084
03:33:14,668 --> 03:33:18,748
hanging out there in veg maybe you were

6085
03:33:16,709 --> 03:33:20,249
proactive maybe you decided around week

6086
03:33:18,748 --> 03:33:21,898
seven that you really like to rise

6087
03:33:20,248 --> 03:33:22,760
number three so you went in there and he

6088
03:33:21,898 --> 03:33:24,079
found that arrived

6089
03:33:22,760 --> 03:33:25,939
mother plant number three and you took

6090
03:33:24,079 --> 03:33:27,139
ten clones they're already vegging

6091
03:33:25,939 --> 03:33:28,939
they're getting big so that as soon as

6092
03:33:27,139 --> 03:33:30,289
you harvest you can throw those plants

6093
03:33:28,939 --> 03:33:32,930
in there and you can run a rise number

6094
03:33:30,290 --> 03:33:34,700
three again maybe you were waiting for

6095
03:33:32,930 --> 03:33:37,430
this smoke test to find out which one to

6096
03:33:34,700 --> 03:33:39,290
run again either way you have got that

6097
03:33:37,430 --> 03:33:41,000
number that you decide that plant is

6098
03:33:39,290 --> 03:33:42,500
hanging out in the bedroom it's in there

6099
03:33:41,000 --> 03:33:44,148
you just got to go get it and take a

6100
03:33:42,500 --> 03:33:46,250
bunch of clones off of it and run it

6101
03:33:44,148 --> 03:33:48,318
again if you narrowed it down to two

6102
03:33:46,250 --> 03:33:50,600
that you like cut a few clones off of

6103
03:33:48,318 --> 03:33:52,369
each one run them again side by side now

6104
03:33:50,600 --> 03:33:54,800
you've got a larger batch of each one to

6105
03:33:52,370 --> 03:33:56,390
decide from you can run it again maybe

6106
03:33:54,799 --> 03:33:58,068
change the nutrients maybe change

6107
03:33:56,389 --> 03:33:59,629
something in the room and see if the two

6108
03:33:58,068 --> 03:34:01,278
phenotypes do something different with

6109
03:33:59,629 --> 03:34:02,778
different environments maybe that will

6110
03:34:01,279 --> 03:34:04,729
help you decide on which one to keep

6111
03:34:02,779 --> 03:34:05,840
either way you choose to do it after

6112
03:34:04,728 --> 03:34:08,209
your tasting party with your friends

6113
03:34:05,840 --> 03:34:09,950
you've got that backup plant in the

6114
03:34:08,209 --> 03:34:11,539
bedroom you've got a rise number three

6115
03:34:09,950 --> 03:34:12,950
just over there waiting to take a bunch

6116
03:34:11,540 --> 03:34:15,770
of clones so you can grow it again

6117
03:34:12,950 --> 03:34:17,329
forever the thing is keep that plant

6118
03:34:15,770 --> 03:34:19,159
alive listen to that episode about

6119
03:34:17,329 --> 03:34:20,779
mother plants then you can keep that

6120
03:34:19,159 --> 03:34:22,579
arise number three around forever you

6121
03:34:20,779 --> 03:34:24,140
can have a reliable consistent medicine

6122
03:34:22,579 --> 03:34:26,359
that works for you that works for your

6123
03:34:24,139 --> 03:34:28,818
garden and your people learn to rely on

6124
03:34:26,359 --> 03:34:30,710
you for that product ladies and

6125
03:34:28,818 --> 03:34:32,359
gentlemen that is my quick talk on Fino

6126
03:34:30,709 --> 03:34:34,009
hunting I hope I made that nice and

6127
03:34:32,359 --> 03:34:35,510
clear for you phenol hunting is one of

6128
03:34:34,010 --> 03:34:37,309
my favorite things to do in a grow

6129
03:34:35,510 --> 03:34:38,689
that's always a great time you get some

6130
03:34:37,309 --> 03:34:40,728
seeds you get to find out what's in

6131
03:34:38,689 --> 03:34:42,170
there you narrow it down to one and then

6132
03:34:40,728 --> 03:34:43,818
a guy like me as soon as you're down to

6133
03:34:42,170 --> 03:34:46,068
that one you start another phenol hunt

6134
03:34:43,818 --> 03:34:47,389
and then I'm always adding a new one and

6135
03:34:46,068 --> 03:34:48,648
pulling an old one out of the garden

6136
03:34:47,389 --> 03:34:49,969
there's always something coming in and

6137
03:34:48,648 --> 03:34:52,670
something going out so that I've always

6138
03:34:49,969 --> 03:34:53,898
