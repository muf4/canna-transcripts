the iPad here I've got it up on the high

146
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:55,299
pads screen this email takes a little

147
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:56,740
different approach it's not what we

148
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,939
always think about and talk about when

149
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,310
it comes to growing but it's something

150
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:01,329
that should always be in the back of

151
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,259
your mind it's something you should

152
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:03,848
always think about when you're

153
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,860
constructing designing or building a

154
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:08,319
grow room and of course what I'm talking

155
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,250
about is fire safety so I'm gonna open

156
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:14,139
and read this email

157
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:15,310
let me see whose name do I use I'm gonna

158
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,598
have to press pause and see whose name

159
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,519
I'm supposed to use on this we did have

160
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:19,718
a brief conversation but I'm going to

161
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,069
read the email it goes like this

162
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:22,599

name and he said I can read it on the

166
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,170
show so I'm gonna go ahead and say it my

167
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,030
name is Alex Robles and I discovered the

168
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,890
podcast about six weeks ago and I really

169
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:34,839
enjoy listening to you hang out and talk

170
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:37,120

175
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,230
catching up with the past episodes and

176
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,490
appreciating the block of older ones

177
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,650
they helped me get through the

178
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,420
mind-numbing parts of the day and so

179

00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,899
those long episodes I wasn't sure how

185
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,219

186
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,449

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,840
to say I do fire suppression system like

190
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,819
fire sprinklers and such in California

191
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,769
for a living if I can ever help you in

192
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,540
this realm please let me know I heard

193
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:15,129
you talk about fire safety and an indoor

194
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,620
grow and I wanted to share with you what

195
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:19,719
I wrote about a product I used in my

196
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,860
closet and then he sends me a link and

197
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,420
he also says you can find me on

198
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,550
Instagram and he gives his Instagram

199
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,650
handle I'm not sure if he wants me to

200
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,720
give that out or not so I'm not going to

201
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:30,099
if you want me to bro send me another

202
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,390
message and I'll put it out there I just

210
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,070
Instagram if you search for grow learn

211
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:49,839
teach now I'm gonna click the link and

212
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:51,579
it takes me to an article that our

213
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,500
friend Alex Rowe and I'm gonna read you

214
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:55,120
this article and this will be very

215
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,800
beneficial for you he does talk about a

216
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
product I'm not paid to pitch a product

217
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,829
or anything I just agree with what's

218
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,629
written here and he happens to pitch

219
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:03,759
this product that is very useful to

220
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,019
almost any grower this may be helpful to

221
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,889
a lot of people in a lot of situations

222
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:10,899
so I'm going to read this piece that he

223
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,579
wrote it goes like this it's never good

224
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:14,319
when a fire breaks out in an indoor grow

225
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:16,269
but it's even more tragic when that grow

226
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,620
room is in our home I want to take this

227
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,079
moment to say something about fire

228
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,519
safety in an indoor home grow we've all

229
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,259
heard the horror stories of bad wiring

230
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,240
Catching Fire or the plant canopy

231
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,430
getting too close to a hot light and

232
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,960
bursting into flames we try not to think

233
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,910
about it too much because aside from

234
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,918
having a clean safe grow area and a fire

235
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,700
extinguisher handy there is very little

236
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:37,039
we can do when we do have a fire

237
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,629
I work on fire suppression systems for a

238
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,430
living which means I spend eight hours a

239
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:42,649
day talking about learning about

240
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,449
installing and maintaining fire systems

241
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:46,729
I know that a commercial grower has

242
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:48,560
options however for our community of

243
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,960
home growers options are limited because

244
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,540
our realities are different we need

245
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,129
simplicity because by definition were a

246
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,760
hands-on group that will do it ourselves

247
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:01,790
if we can mobility is a must when some

248
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,889
of us grow in an extra room closet or

249
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,900
cabinet that someone has that sometimes

250
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,519
has to be moved there's also the need

251
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:10,099
for stealth if we're growing our

252
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,659
medicine in a prohibition state for an

253
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,790
indoor home grow there are basically two

254
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,200
choices from what I've seen out there we

255
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,180
either have to get an overhead fire

256
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,389
sprinkler system or an automatic fire

257
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,370
extinguisher also known as an AF II and

258
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,740
then there's a picture here of an AF II

259
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,139
and it says an AF e this a if he has

260
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,740
been in service since 1993 and is

261
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:33,259
designated to cover 60 cubic feet this

262
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,389
little device it looks basically like a

263
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:37,039
really small fire extinguisher and they

264
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:39,139
took that fire extinguisher handle with

265
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,689
the sprayer off and it's got a little

266
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:43,729
pressure valve and it looks like a like

267
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,260
a ceiling sprinkler in an office

268
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,030
building like the fire sprinklers in an

269
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,990
office building and it looks like you

270
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,240
would probably hang this thing

271
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,279
horizontally I'm not sure how it be

272
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,629
mounted how it be used in the room but

273
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,639
it would go up high I would assume and

274
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:57,080
then it would probably rupture when it

275
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,669
hit a certain temperature in there and

276
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,650
then whatever is in here will put out

277
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:02,379
your fire is what I'm assuming from the

278
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,639
looks of it but it just looks like a

279
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:06,409
mechana stir like a fire extinguisher

280
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,049
with a different type of head on it

281
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:11,209
so I'm gonna continue it says growing

282
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,799
with fire sprinklers in the room some

283
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,269
homes some homes come with fire

284
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,519
sprinkler systems which is a great thing

285
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,620
if you have a fire not so good for the

286
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,720
grower in US and here's why the pros

287
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,279
they do an excellent job at controlling

288
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,620
and knocking down a fire that could burn

289
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,179
your house down the cons there's going

290
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,919
to be a lot of water to clean up when

291
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,779
the fire sprinkler goes off and unless

292
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,399
you're using waterproof equipment you

293
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:33,350
may be looking at a total loss

294
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,789
so if you've got a fire in your grow

295
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,370
room and your fire sprinklers go off

296
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:39,349
your lights your air conditioning your

297
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,330
dehumidifier and your crop will be

298
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,009
destroyed it goes on to say the water

299
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,480
that rains down will have some form of

300
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:47,149
bacteria in it because it's been

301
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,350
stagnant for so long yeah that water's

302
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,360
been sitting in those pipes

303
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,399
in funky it hasn't been filtered it

304
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,899
that's gonna be nasty-ass water that may

305
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,850
get you sick it's gonna ruin your plants

306
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:58,490
if the plants are flowering all that

307
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,379
stagnant water will cause mold that is

308
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,090
very true and who wants to smoke plants

309
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:03,669
that had bacteria-laden sprinkler water

310
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,780
on them that sounds [ __ ] disgusting

311
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:07,579
the article goes on to say when the

312
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,259
system goes off bells and alarms will

313
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,000
ring and first responders such as the

314
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:13,879
fire department and police will usually

315
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,649
show up you don't need that [ __ ] in your

316
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,080
grow especially if you're in an illegal

317
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:20,090
state and you don't need that anyway

318
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,040
so I'm gonna keep reading the article

319
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,899
excuse me for the throat clearing I'll

320
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,309
blame it on the dabs it goes like this

321
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,019
nothing in this chain of events sounds

322
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:28,250
like a good time but it could happen

323
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,740
when you're growing with a fire

324
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:33,169
sprinkler in the room then he says my

325
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,549
AFE lets me sleep better the thing I

326
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:36,559
found that gives me peace of mind about

327
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:38,359
this is an automatic fire extinguisher

328
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,189
these beautiful pieces equipment were

329
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,539
originally designed to put out fires in

330
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,220
boat engine rooms

331
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:45,379
they've been repurposed over the years

332
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,120
to be used in everything from flammable

333
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,610
liquid cabinets to server rooms and

334
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,029
other enclosed areas where water isn't a

335
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,769
good idea the ones I use are called fire

336
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,600
boys and are designed to go off

337
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:58,370
automatically when the gross space or

338
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,620
grow room gets to a hundred and

339
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,259
sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit or 74

340
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,120
degrees Celsius I have to get the cubic

341
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:06,830
feet which is the length times the width

342
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,899
times the height of the grow room or

343
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,060
space to make sure I get the right size

344
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,769
unit each one will have enough agent in

345
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:15,649
them to easily put out a fire in the

346
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:17,870
size room that it's designed for I also

347
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,490
have to think about ventilation about

348
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,470
the ventilation system when I'm talking

349
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,240
about this type of extinguisher with an

350
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:27,170
active or passive air exchange a high

351
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,419
temp shut off excuse me a high temp shut

352
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:30,829
off should be put on the fans these

353
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:32,750
extinguishers work by flooding the

354
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,460
Froome flooding the room with the agent

355
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,500
when they go off plus it stays active in

356
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:39,170
the air for a bit to keep things from

357
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,820
reigniting the intake fan could feed

358
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:44,719
oxygen to the fire which could allow the

359
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:46,430
fire to stay lit or reignite easier the

360
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,920
exhaust fan could suck out the agent

361
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:50,689
from the room before it's done its job

362
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,490
so you guys if you do install an

363
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,710
automatic fire extinguisher

364
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,590
it would be a good idea to put your

365
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,300
blowers on a turn off if the heat gets

366
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,129
to a certain now this sounds weird but

367
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:04,109
if it gets to 135 degrees and your

368
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:05,460
there's a fire in there and you need to

369
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,019
turn off the blower to quit feeding

370
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,150
oxygen in there you need to turn off the

371
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,159
extraction fan to quit sucking out the

372
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:13,259
fire extinguisher you should have those

373
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,569
on a heat shut off it's also a good idea

374
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:17,490
to have your lights on a heat shutoff if

375
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,590
the lights get if the room gets over 99

376
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,909
degrees then it hits 100 degrees the

377
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,649
lights should turn off until it gets

378
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:24,539
back down to 85 degrees and then come

379
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,649
back on that would be ideal you

380
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,269
shouldn't have something like that in

381
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:29,309
the grow just to prevent overheating and

382
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:30,750
to prevent fires so those are some

383
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,579
things you should think about along with

384
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,340
one of these automatic fire

385
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,990
extinguishers you need some heat

386
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,509
detection devices that will turn off and

387
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,230
on the proper equipment all right so I'm

388
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,000
gonna keep going

389
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,529
it says growers know when you have a

390
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,879
fire system it doesn't mean you're not

391
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,919
going to have damage when you have a

392
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,649
fire the system is only there to

393
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:51,929
mitigate loss if there is a fire you

394
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:55,379
will have smoke fire or water damage and

395
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:57,689
there is no escaping that then they show

396
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:59,279
a picture of a whole bunch of these fire

397
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,530
suppression devices it says current

398
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,689
models have a more environmentally safe

399
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:09,120
suppression agent than what was

400
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:11,340
available it says no system is perfect

401
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,710
and there's a good and bad to everything

402
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,040
fire boys are no different but they are

403
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:20,070
a lot better than any other AFE on the

404
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,110
market and here is why the pros they're

405
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,000
rated for Class A which is trash wood

406
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,100
and paper and Class B which is liquids

407
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,350
and Class C which is electrical

408
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,730
equipment so you can get the one for the

409
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,680
electrical equipment for your grow room

410
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,970
that may be the one you need there's a

411
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,279
lot of electrical [ __ ] in there that's

412
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,710
probably what's gonna go wrong

413
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:39,269
the next Pro is the suppression agent is

414
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,190
life-sustaining which means if it goes

415
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:42,779
off and you're in your grow room you

416
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,670
more than likely won't drop dead where

417
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:47,100
you stand the error will get a little

418
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:48,389
acidic but you'll be alive so some of

419
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,920
these agents could probably make you

420
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:51,779
super sick probably [ __ ] up your lungs

421
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,399
possibly kill you sounds like this one's

422
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:57,089
not gonna be so bad if you're there and

423
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:59,279
it does go off it goes on to say the

424
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,649
suppressing agent is considered a clean

425
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,389
agent and comes out in a fine mist it

426
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:05,909
won't leave a residue on any equipment

427
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:07,889
surfaces so there's no powdery film that

428
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:10,139
has to be cleaned off like with other

429
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,220
automatic fire extinguishers so it

430
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,750
sounds like they designed this stuff

431
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,399
mostly for like computer rooms and

432
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,899
server rooms and [ __ ] like that

433
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,399
tour if you do have a

434
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,709
and these things go off you could just

435
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,689
go in and basically wipe down everything

436
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:24,090
instead of having to get water out of a

437
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,380
room that sounds way easier to me it

438
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,910
already sounds like a good idea and

439
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,590
nobody has paid me to read this or say

440
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:30,209
this I just found this very useful I

441
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,070
like keeping my friends and my growers

442
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,420
safe and my listeners I want everybody

443
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,280
to be safe a lot of you may have

444
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,829
overlooked the importance of fire

445
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,539
control fire extinguishing that's why

446
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,190
we're doing this so I'm gonna keep on

447
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:42,809
going it says they come in different

448
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,360
sizes to cover different sized rooms

449
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:45,959
from 25 cubic feet to over a thousand

450
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,169
cubic feet

451
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,240
it also says no bells or alarms will

452
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:53,659
sound when these go off unless you set

453
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,889
it up to do so which is a great thing

454
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,629
like we talked about earlier if you have

455
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:59,669
a fire and some alarms go off some bells

456
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:01,259
and whistles start going off guess who's

457
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:03,089
coming the police and the fire

458
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:05,370
department and then maybe if you're in

459
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,450
the wrong place the de fuckin'-a you

460
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,399
don't want to get yourself in trouble

461
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,890
because you had a fire trying to produce

462
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,600
medicine so these may help you out it

463
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,759
also says they will ship to almost

464
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,639
anywhere in the world which is always a

465
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,439
plus here are the cons of using this

466
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,269
product here it says the clean agent has

467
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,790
not been tested on fruits or vegetables

468
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:25,740
much less cannabis if it goes off in a

469
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,659
room with the flowering plants in it

470
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,060
that bud is a loss in my opinion because

471
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:32,129
I just don't know if it's safe I would

472
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,419
agree with that if you do have a fire in

473
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:35,399
there and this little extinguisher goes

474
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:36,929
off and it releases its agent which is a

475
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,039
secret so I want to call it the secret

476
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:39,719
agent they haven't told me what's in

477
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,399
there yet but when the secret agent pops

478
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,810
out and gets all over your buds you do

479
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,279
not want to smoke that stuff I have

480
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,929
smoked the [ __ ] are not smoked I've

481
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,179
smelled the [ __ ] that comes out of a

482
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:49,199
fire extinguisher before there's a fire

483
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:51,179
somewhere I had to spray the fire

484
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,830
extinguisher that stuff stinks if it

485
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,569
smells anything like that I don't want

486
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,430
it near the buds if it does get on the

487
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,830
buds don't make hash out of them don't

488
00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:00,269
smoke them dispose of them properly be

489
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,410
glad that you didn't burn to death be

490
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:04,199
glad that you didn't have a big fire

491
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:07,769
live to grow another crop all right

492
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,170
we're gonna continue it says where was I

493
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,669
Here I am you can't pull a unit out you

494
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,139
can't pull a unit out of one room and

495
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:15,120
put it in a bigger room and expect it to

496
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,889
work the same it won't have enough agent

497
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,590
to put out a fire in the bigger room you

498
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:21,389
can however pull one out of a small room

499
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:24,090
or out of a larger room and put it into

500
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:25,049
a smaller room no problem it also says

501
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,210
you can only get them through a

502
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:29,549
distributor you can't find them at a

503
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,589
hardware store so you may have to Google

504
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:33,179
find them online I'd also says I hope

505
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,250
this information encourages everyone

506
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:37,588
every one of you to think about fire

507
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,970
safety differently especially if you and

508
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,769
your family live in the house in which

509
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,660
you grow if you want more information

510
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:45,209
about different fire systems or how to

511
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:49,169
size and order a fire boy get ahold of

512
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:51,599
me and as always grow learn teach and I

513
00:16:49,169 --> 00:16:53,669
found this at in my Grod comm is where

lot of stuff up here getting started

516
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,649
from seed as a link nutrient Guyot is a

517
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,060
link I'm gonna click on this getting

518
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:01,980
started from seedling and just see what

519
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,958
it says and what it does Canada's plant

520
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,338
in the vegetative state part 3 oh look

521
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,549
he's gone he's made a lot of stuff you

538
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,290
you got to be cool about fire safety is

539
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,910
what I think the commercial says you

540
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:50,549

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,889
this thing I don't want to see her and

556
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,450
clearing my throat for 30 seconds I'm

557
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,970
gonna press pause real quick take a DAB

558
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,450

559
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,009
right back thanks for listening you guys

560
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,569
all right podcast world welcome back

561
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:26,640
thanks for hanging on for a second there

562
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:29,308
while I fixed my voice before we get

563
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,860
back into this I owe an apology to some

564
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:34,079
friends of mine up there in the frozen

565
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,418
[ __ ] state of Maine on the last

566
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,189
episode Mike and I were talking about

567
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,750
Maine and Mike kind of said some things

568
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,340
about Maine and I kind of said some

569
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,720
things about Maine and Maine I owe you

570
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,449
an apology

571
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,240
I got called out on Facebook so Big Shot

572
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,529
it's my friends Nick shoutout to Amber

573
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,298
Maine's not that bad you guys are some

574
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,038
cool people up there I'm sure of it

575
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,869
because when we talk trash about him all

576
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,119
six of the cool people up there sent me

577
00:18:54,869 --> 00:19:00,089
a message on Facebook shot it's my

578
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,619
friends in Maine all right let's move

579
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:04,259
forward a little bit I've been asked a

580
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:05,939
couple of questions recently about veg x

581
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,730
and what type of veg x I prefer

582
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,900
recommend in what type of veg x I use so

583
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,089
when your plants are in the vegetative

584
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,159
state you've got a lot of options the

585
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:15,538
main goal is to keep them vegging until

586
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:17,549
they're big enough healthy enough hearty

587
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:18,480
enough ah the shape you need them the

588
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:20,339
size you need them

589
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,720
make sure everything's topped and

590
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,250
trained and set up the way you want it

591
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,259
before you put it into the flowering

592
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,298
state now the way to keep a plant in the

593
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,609
vegetative state is by controlling the

594
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:32,190
light cannabis is a photo period

595
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:33,869
sensitive plant which means if you give

596
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,669
it enough light it will stay in a veg

597
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:37,048
state but when the light starts reducing

598
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:38,610
and you get a certain amount of

599
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:40,918
uninterrupted hours of darkness that

600
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:43,199
plant will go into its bloom stage

601
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,720
cannabis is whole goal in life like a

602
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,450
lot of us is to reproduce all cannabis

603
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,610
wants to do is drop pollen or get

604
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,069
pollinated that's its main goal it wants

605
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:56,308
to reproduce make seeds so they can grow

606
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:57,899
the next generation next year so you can

607
00:19:56,308 --> 00:20:00,210
keep it into a vegetative state by

608
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,490
controlling the light if the plant gets

609
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,890
enough light it will not go into a bloom

610
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,960
stage as soon as that plant gets a long

611
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,390
enough uninterrupted dark period it will

612
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,730
start flowering it will go into a bloom

613
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,929
stage so we control the lights we

614
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,548
control the amount of time that the

615
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:17,309
lights are on and that the lights are

616
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:19,048
off so some plants are very sensitive

617
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:21,240
they have what's called a very sensitive

618
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:23,069
critical period if they get just a few

619
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,380
hours of darkness they will start to

620
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:27,029
flower some of them you have to go kind

621
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,400
of hard which is why we do the twelve

622
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:31,319
twelve then almost all plants will flip

623
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,659
at twelve twelve you could probably get

624
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:35,519
them to flip at fourteen and sixteen but

625
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:37,980
twelve twelve seems to be the universal

626
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,259
combination to get every plant to flip

627
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,640
eleven thirteen is also common but

628
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:43,470
twelve twelve is your best bet you'll

629
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,538
get the best harvest you'll see the best

630
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,038
production now I'm really gonna get off

631
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,359
topic here and get off on a side rant

632
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,369
but you'll notice outside when you

633
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,740
flower your plants outside they do start

634
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:55,408
to flower before you have twelve hours

635
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,549
of darkness outside that's because not

636
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:58,290
all of the plants need

637
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:01,319
12:12 that's just what we do indoors

638
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:03,119
because the light isn't as strong it's

639
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:05,220
just better it's better for commercial

640
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,979
production also here's something that I

641
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,319
will add when the Sun sets the Sun puts

642
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,509
off a specific spectrum that tells the

643
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,799
plant hey it's time to go to sleep so it

644
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:16,319
kind of triggers the plant to go to

645
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,180
sleep that's why things like sometimes

646
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,159
light street lights and things don't

647
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,930
disrupt plants outside sometimes they

648
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,730
will this depends on the plant this

649
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,830
always depends on the plant but

650
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,569
sometimes some small lights outdoors

651
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:29,970
will not disrupt your flowering period

652
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:32,129
because the Sun was so intense all day

653
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,509
it was like you're awake [ __ ] and it

654
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,600
was just beaming down on that plant and

655
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:38,549
is it's at there's the sunset I believe

656
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,289
in a globe that we got around earth as

657
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:42,210
the Sun set the curvature of the earth

658
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,680
creates a certain spectrum and I don't

659
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,329
understand exactly how this happens but

660
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,039
the curvature of the earth and the Sun

661
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:49,049
setting creates a spectrum of red and

662
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,339
that red spectrum I could go away into

663
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,990
that but I didn't read so I don't want

664
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:53,189
to be wrong I sometimes I need a little

665
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,839
reading to do a refresher

666
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,340
but the near red and far red and

667
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,470
phytochrome red words all come into play

668
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:59,879
right here as the Sun sets it tells the

669
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,130
plant hey it's time to go to sleep and

670
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,420
so that plant actually goes to sleep and

671
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,310
when the Sun puts it to sleep like that

672
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,130
it's way harder to disrupt that

673
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:10,019
nighttime period so outdoors yes

674
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,910
sometimes people say the moon and the

675
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,980
stars won't disrupt my outdoor plants

676
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,180
but that's not exactly how it works

677
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,920
they've been out there getting beat up

678
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,750
by the Sun all day they haven't been

679
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,230
indoors under a thousand watt Gavita

680
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:24,420
it's a big difference so let me get back

681
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,860
to what I was talking about I really

682
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,690
like to get off on a rant sometimes on

683
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:28,529
these podcasts don't I sometimes that's

684
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,330
what I think you're listening for

685
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:32,309
sometimes that's my favorite part that's

686
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:33,750
when I learned the most let's see so

687
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,099
we've talked about what makes them

688
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,140
flower what makes them flowers you put

689
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:38,490
them under twelve twelve you guys

690
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,660
outdoors the Sun will tell them it's

691
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,400
time to go to sleep [ __ ] it's time to

692
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,630
flower indoors you got to put them under

693
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,970
the twelve twelve they start going to

694
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,780
sleep veg times you've got a couple of

695
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,630
options here

696
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:52,049
um the options that you have for veg

697
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:55,140
time is 24 hours on your plants will

698
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:57,659
live if you put them on with 24 hours of

699
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,700
light if your lights are not very strong

700
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,250
if you're using t fives to keep some big

701
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,910
mother plants alive 24 hours may be the

702
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,819
way to go

703
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:08,009
if the plants don't get enough light yes

704
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,700
they may have a long light period but

705
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:11,619
also if the light is weak

706
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,509
they may decide to flower on you I've

707
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:15,518
seen people have big mother plants where

708
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:17,349
the insides get real bushy and leafy and

709
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,638
the inside will start flowering you got

710
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:20,980
to get in there and cut all that inside

711
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:22,959
[ __ ] out if you have more light that

712
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,538
won't happen so if you don't have enough

713
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,028
light instead of running an 18 hour veg

714
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:29,408
period put it on 24 hours that may help

715
00:23:28,028 --> 00:23:30,849
you out you still need to get in there

716
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:33,250
and take care of the plants but a 24

717
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:34,599
hour veg time is possible it's not my

718
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,009
favorite

719
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,990
myself and a lot of other growers

720
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:40,569
believe that everything wants to sleep

721
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,429
my clones are on for 24 hours a day when

722
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:44,109
I cut my clones in their fresh I keep

723
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:45,580
them on for 24 hours the clones don't

724
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:49,240
get any sleeping period once they go

725
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:51,730
into a veg cup or a veg pot those get a

726
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,159
sleeping period and depending on where I

727
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,558
am and what I'm doing the veg period

728
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,110
changes so let's talk about a couple of

729
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,599
different options there's 20 on and four

730
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:04,329
off or 19 on and five off which are very

731
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:08,019
similar this is very common in a mother

732
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:10,418
room either 19 and 5 or 20 and 4 very

733
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:12,548
common in a mother room that's long

734
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:14,710
enough to keep the plants in a consonant

735
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:17,408
veg stage so that anything that gets

736
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:19,720
root bound or likes to Otto flower if

737
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:21,730
it's in doesn't get enough light those

738
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,669
things will not Otto flower on you under

739
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:27,399
a 19 or 20 hour light cycle but then you

740
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:28,899
get that 4 hours of sleep I feel like

741
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:31,089
indoors it takes them like an hour to

742
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:32,859
fall asleep if you're not giving it the

743
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:34,119
light cycle from outside if it's not

744
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:35,288
getting the Sun to tell it to sleep I

745
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,778
think when the lights just go off and

746
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:39,038
they're blank it's like what and it

747
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:40,569
takes them a few minutes probably like a

748
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,460
full hour to get to sleep so if you give

749
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:44,079
them 4 hours and they're gonna get three

750
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,419
full hours of sleep technically and

751
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,798
that's that that helps I think

752
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:49,000
everything that's alive wants some

753
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:50,829
sleeping time you'll see them grow a

754
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,089
little bit when they come back on even

755
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,589
if you just give them the four hours or

756
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:56,048
five hours of darkness you'll see growth

757
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:58,298
when they come back on that works very

758
00:24:56,048 --> 00:25:01,388
well let's talk about the pros and cons

759
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:04,690
of the 24 hour time 24-hour lights on

760
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:06,519
the pros of that lots of growth things

761
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,139
will not auto flower if you've got

762
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:10,870
something that did flower you can bring

763
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:13,719
it back to veg with 24 hours of time the

764
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:14,888
con of 24 hour time it's always on man

765
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,808
you're always running your electricity

766
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,668
always running your gear your plants

767
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:21,759
don't get to sleep they start to look a

768
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:23,440
little frazzled the 24 and 19 5 are the

769
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,839
20 on and 4 off

770
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,450
the 19 on five off cycle pros and cons

771
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,519
here the pros to this vigorous growth

772
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:32,319
they get a little bit of sleeping time

773
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:33,940
as a con you saved some electricity you

774
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,250
save some cooling time you save time on

775
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,169
your bulbs make stuff all your equipment

776
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,700
will last for hours longer now every day

777
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,159
you get four more hours out of your gear

778
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,200
so that adds up to a few more days the

779
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,639
downside to that I think a little more

780
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,830
sleep time is better you don't get

781
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:49,359
enough rest time on your plants they're

782
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:50,888
just not as happy you can see that

783
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,398
they're a little bit stressed from other

784
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:56,199
plants this is cool but ah I think I

785
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:58,719
think a little less light time is better

786
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,990
one thing that I do notice the people

787
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,329
that use longer vege times when you go

788
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:06,609
in to flower your plants do flip a

789
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:08,259
little more quickly then people that use

790
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:09,758
a shorter ven chime because the plants

791
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:11,980
notice they're like wait it just went

792
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:14,528
from summer to fall I need to flower

793
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,378
they just jump in more quickly and we're

794
00:26:14,528 --> 00:26:19,538
gonna talk more about changing flowering

795
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:20,678
from veg to flower do you want that dark

796
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:23,440
period or not we're going to talk about

797
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,120
that in a future episode so we've done

798
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,090
the twenty-four we've done the 19 and

799
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,949
five we're 20/4 periods the pros and

800
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:32,408
cons of those then here are my two

801
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:37,750
favorites the eighteen on and six hours

802
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:39,129
off that is a very good veg phase 18

803
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,750
hours on is plenty of time for those

804
00:26:39,128 --> 00:26:42,398
plants to grow and suck up their

805
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,619
favorite nutrient their favorite feeder

806
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:46,778
which is like the plants want light more

807
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:48,398
than anything so that's 18 hours to

808
00:26:46,778 --> 00:26:50,950
absorb light that lets them get a lot of

809
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,479
vigorous growth within six hours it lets

810
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,220
all of your equipment cool down you're

811
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,079
not running so much equipment the

812
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,759
electricity is not being pulled the

813
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,829
plants get to rest your bulbs get to

814
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,389
rest you get some dark time that's

815
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:03,908
always a good thing the plants get to

816
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:06,788
sleep they grow there's also sixteen on

817
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:08,440
and eight hours off that's probably the

818
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:10,269
last one I would recommend I wouldn't go

819
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,159
less than 16 because indoors

820
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:14,829
you're probably gonna start flowering if

821
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:18,610
you go less than 16 hours of light on 18

822
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:21,819
hours off so the pros and cons of the 18

823
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:23,619
and 6 you get some off time during that

824
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:26,109
sleeping time you can see the plants

825
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:27,939
grow they get more vigorous although you

826
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:29,199
are gonna produce more humidity in those

827
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,519
night times you're gonna have to find a

828
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,830
way to get the humidity out of there

829
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:35,319
that may get really humid in those long

830
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:37,419
night periods so those are vege times

831
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:39,129
that I would recommend the pros and cons

832
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,900
it's kind of up to you how you want to

833
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,090
do it where you are how much electricity

834
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,380
costs what your schedule is what your

835
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:46,299
rooms are setup like what your

836
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,370
lifestyles like just how your growth

837
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:50,200
fits into your current scheduling one

838
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:51,699
thing I can recommend maybe run your

839
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,789
lights at night if that's possible

840
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:57,340
because electricity is cheaper at night

841
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:58,659
it's easier to keep them cool at night

842
00:27:57,339 --> 00:28:01,059
because you're not competing with the

843
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,620
Sun and then when the lights go off

844
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,909
during the day and the Sun comes up you

845
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:05,559
don't have to try to fight with a grow

846
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,660
light and the Sun keeping that grow room

847
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,889
cool you can run the air conditioning

848
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,810
anyway just to keep the room a little

849
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,100
bit cooler during the day and hopefully

850
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:13,450
nobody thinks anything's going on

851
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:16,209
because it's normal to run an air

852
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,830
conditioner right now it's wintertime if

853
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:20,410
you've got to grow you should probably

854
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:22,179
be using that grow now because you don't

855
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,820
have to pay for cooling it really helps

856
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,950
out in the winter but I'm off topic a

857
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:28,450
little bit veg times I told you about a

858
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,940
bunch of veg times and I told you

859
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:34,059
different applications of them at the

860
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:37,480
large commercial facility I keep the veg

861
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:40,149
room on it's on 20 on and 4 off

862
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,370
sometimes we do 20 on and 5 off we're

863
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,680
experimenting when you're running a lot

864
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:47,229
of lights in a large facility every

865
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,299
couple of hours helps when you have to

866
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,009
replace as many bulbs as we do every

867
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:53,319
couple of hours helps when you have to

868
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:56,079
keep everything cool with as much as

869
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:58,179
cooling as we're using every every hour

870
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,220
on the bulbs and ballasts ELPS is what

871
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,570
I'm saying so we experiment sometimes

872
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,890
it's four hours of darkness sometimes

873
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:06,250
it's five we're just seeing what works

874
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:10,600
best for us in my personal grows I do

875
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:12,430
like to use the 18-6 for mother plants

876
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,309
for my personal mother plants I do use

877
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:17,650
the 20-hour on and four hour off cycle

878
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:19,929
and for all of my clones the clones go

879
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,120
24 hours on so that's my personal setup

880
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,320
there one thing I've noticed and I might

881
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,809
have mentioned this I teased on this

882
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:28,299
just a little bit ago if you have a long

883
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:30,159
veg time the people that go 24 hours of

884
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:32,079
edge and they never turn the lights off

885
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:35,440
when you put the plants in to flower

886
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:37,299
those plants flower just a little bit

887
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,150
more quickly most of the time it'll take

888
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:42,519
10 to 14 days to see flowers turning if

889
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:44,800
you just went from 24 and then you went

890
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,720
to 12 12 you might see that change

891
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,059
happen in seven to 10 days instead of 10

892
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,130
to 14 that's one thing I have noticed I

893
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:53,649
wouldn't do the 24

894
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,420
in veg or the 20/20 on and for off in

895
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,640
veg unless you were only gonna veg

896
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,900
little plants for a little while if

897
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,250
they're gonna get bigger and start

898
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,690
branching out you want to give them some

899
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,400
night time let those hormones move

900
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,720
around let the plants get some rest let

901
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,610
your equipment get some rest

902
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,809
just think about how long you want a

903
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:10,029
bedroom if they're gonna be little you

904
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:13,059
can do 24 on and then when you flip them

905
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:14,440
they will really blast off alright

906
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:16,210
podcasts world I hope I taught you a

907
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,890
little bit about veg times I hope I

908
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,720
helped you choose how long you want to

909
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,460
put your lights on if you're trying to

910
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,289
get something to come out a flower and

911
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,960
go back to veg it's got to be on for 24

912
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:27,460
hours or it's not gonna go back I did a

913
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,990
whole episode about reeve edging plant

914
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,539
so if that's what you're trying to do go

915
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:34,000
search for that one let's see what else

916
