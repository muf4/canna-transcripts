complaint it has been raining for two

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,478
solid weeks here in Pueblo Colorado if

25

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,368
here at this dab table right here at

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,740
this recording area that's right I am

31
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,290
smoking some flow wax from our friends

32
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,000
at concentrates supply company groan I

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,789
had Three Rivers of course where I'm the

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,259
lead cultivator if you know me you know

35
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:30,659
that I've got sort of a love-hate

36
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,849
relationship with the flow plan I've

37
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,519
been growing flow for probably ten years

38
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,709
my first or second legal medical

39
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,269
marijuana grow contained flow plants

40
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:40,978
that's how long I've been growing flow

41
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:42,899
it was a gift from a friend I took it to

42
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,759
the garden I took clones of it I

43
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,219
flowered some out I kept clones

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,469
I took a mother plant and I have had

45
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,149
this flow flying around for probably 10

46
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:53,250
years I say I've got a love-hate

47
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,570
relationship with flow there's nothing

48
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,849
wrong with flow it's got a very unique

49
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,978
smell and that's what I love hate is the

50
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,899
unique smell of flow part of flow smells

51
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,118
amazing to me part of flow smells

52
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,978
terrible to me it just kind of depends

53
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,409
on how it comes out and what part of the

54
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:08,368
flowering period you're in one point

55
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,959
that smells great

56
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:13,050
then it turns into this thing that I do

57
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,459
not like part of it could be because I

58
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,560
grew it for so long that I would wake up

59
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,479
in my house my entire house would smell

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,280
like flow I would go to bed and my

61
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,049
entire house would smell like flow I

62
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,310
would leave and pull up into the

63
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,870
driveway and when I got out of the car

64
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,789
the first thing I would smell would be

65
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,620
flow a lot of people are like you have

66
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:30,959
big problems dude but sometimes that

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,580
same smell forever that she gets on your

68
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,650
nerves and you just want to not smell it

69
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,330
and I couldn't get away from it so I had

70
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,830
like a love-hate relationship with flow

71
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,180
and I would refuse to smoke it for a

72
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,160
long time I'll grow the [ __ ] out of some

73
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,450
flow because I grow for a dispensary and

74
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,689
people buy the flow so we got to have

75
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:47,909
the flow but flow is not my favorite to

76
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:50,219
grow or smoke but then I was at the

77
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,539
dispensary and I grew this material and

78
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,459
they said hey we turn to some of the

79
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,009
flow into wax do you want to smell it

80
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,550
and I put my nose in the little jar I'm

81
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,189
doing right now

82
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,069
and my mouth just went yeah I'll take a

83
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,748
gram of that

84
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:05,748
and I did an episode called follow your

85
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:07,579
nose and I was totally correct when I

86
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:09,408
smelled this I wanted some and as soon

87
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:10,609
as I got home and dabbed it I said to

88
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:12,979
myself you should have bought more of

89
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:15,230
that because it's got a really great

90
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:16,938
high to it it just kind of it kind of

91
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:19,548
mellowed me out a lot of dabs make me

92
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:20,628
super rambley and super chatty I know it

93
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,310
sounds like I'm rambling and chatty

94
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:23,840
right now because I'm doing a podcast by

95
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,280
myself and I'm the only one here to talk

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,229
and I'm explaining how I feel and [ __ ]

97
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,968
so I do sound rambley but my thoughts

98
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:30,858
are much slower much more controlled

99
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:33,430
than it would be how to smoke some Jack

100
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:35,540
flash or platinum tangi or something ah

101
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,950
it's a pretty damn good high off this

102
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,358
blowback so I enjoy this I'm nice and

103
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:39,168
relaxed I'm sitting down on my chair

104
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,040
nice and mellow

105
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,909
I made some solid notes here it kind of

106
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,408
descrambled the eggs in my brain that

107
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:47,298
gets scrambled sometimes when I take too

it was CSC I'm not certain but one of

127
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,189
the concentrate companies sent us an

128
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,779
email saying that our material yielded

129
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:29,959
the most concentrate that they have ever

130
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:31,149
gotten from a batch of material so we're

131
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:33,198
doing something right at Three Rivers

132
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:35,750
they're doing something right over at

133
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,490
CSC concentrates good job this flow is

134
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,319
amazing I'm also digging the Cindy

135
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,389
Walker which is Cindy 99 with white

136
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,788
Walker in there and I've also got some

137
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,918
blueberry headband great work but I'm

138
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:47,478
loving the flow of the flow is you know

139
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,819
I think this batch of flow may have

140
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:51,468
restored my faith in my fascination with

141
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:53,300
flow I might be back on the flow train I

142
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:55,149
might smoke some more flow more

143
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,860
frequently now that I've tried this

144
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:58,939
alright so let's talk about something

145
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,129
else that's cool from the grower at

146
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:03,168
Three Rivers we have two lab tests

147
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,209
everything that we grow everything that

148
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:08,839
we grow is tested for potency and it's

149
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:11,000
also tested for molds and yeasts to

150
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,098
microbial testing so we send everything

151
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,750
out before it can be sold at the store

152
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,189
it all has to be sent out that all has

153
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,889
to be tested the results have to come

154
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:20,420
back then we can sell it the test

155
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,669
results for some of our strains have

156
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,280
come back pretty impressive lately and I

157
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:28,189
want to brag about our 31 percent THC

158
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,869
test result on presidential Kush we did

159
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:32,240
not breed the presidential cush that is

160
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,699
not my project of breeding but we did

161
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,670
grow it and we tested at thirty-one

162
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:39,110
percent THC I'm pretty proud of that

163
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,270
that's a pretty good number most strains

164
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,060
that you're gonna find in a dispensary

165
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:46,579
they hover somewhere between the 22 to

166
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,860
like 29 is high 27 is kind of where

167
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,839
you're gonna find him mostly 22 to 27 in

168
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,990
that range if you get over 30

169
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:56,179
that's impressive 31 is super impressive

170
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,220
the highest that we have seen is 35 I

171
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,590
don't think I've ever seen a higher test

172
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,020
which was of course the arize the tested

173
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:06,949
at 35 in a fraction that was grown at

174
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:09,109
organic a'that was bred by myself um so

175
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:12,050
yeah I just wanted to brag on our whole

176
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,819
crew and our genetics and the Janie tech

177
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,569
that we're using over at Three Rivers

178
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:19,550
we got an official lab result at 31.6%

179
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:21,259
you know back in the day we got a test

180
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,430
from our ecto cooler strain there was a

181
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:24,228
little higher than that but everybody

182
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,939
thought that it was a fluke so everybody

183
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:28,159
kind of dismissed that and we're just

184
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:31,189
gonna celebrate the 31 percent we're

185
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,990
gonna take this 31.6 seriously and we're

186
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:35,240
gonna brag about this one so big shot

187
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,860
it's everybody at Three Rivers let's see

188
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,030
what do I want to touch on next you know

189

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,949
heart

204
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:09,019
podcast all right speaking of new seeds

205
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,728
let's talk about my most current

206
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:12,889
breeding project that's right on the 1st

207
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:14,449
of this month I started a new breeding

208
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,699
project I put a few plants into flour

209
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:19,159
I'm running one light in a very small

210
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,719
room with a very small amount of plants

211
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,390
let's see what's in there I've got a

212
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,890
chem 4 there is a rise there are two

213
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,279
different phenotypes of arise arise

214
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,839
number E and a rise number 8 there's an

215
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,359
no cooler in there there's strawberry

216
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,429
fields we've got a kosher cush there's a

217
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,129
flow there's a grateful dog there's a

218
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,019
Zack Hayes space [ __ ] and of course

219
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:39,610
hell's og they're all in the breeding

220
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:42,159
room together they're all going to get

221
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,050
hit with pollen from my arise mail that

222
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,780
a rise mail is known as King Solomon ah

223
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,150
let's see the Kim for I've made Kim four

224
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:51,189
seeds before with Solomon ah they don't

225
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:52,539
have a name I only made about 30 of

226
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:55,000
those so I never let any of those out

227
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,879
arise Ian a rise 8 of course will make a

228
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,550
rise f two seeds ecto cooler I have

229
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,649
never bred the ecto cooler to the arise

230
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,780
before what I'm thinking is gonna happen

231
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:07,810
is we're going to get really tall really

232
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,699
dense really stinky really resin covered

233
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,709
buds with a very unique flavor the ecto

234
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:14,139
cooler has a very unique flavor the

235
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:15,639
arize has its own pungent smell I think

236
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:18,099
when you mix the two we're going to find

237
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,259
some great progeny the Strawberry Fields

238
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,270
is in there Strawberry Fields has a very

239
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,639
strawberry candy light kind of smell

240
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:26,799
kind of a soft a hint of a strawberry

241
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,899
instant sort of a thing I think we'll

242
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,660
create some really tall tropical

243
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,549
flavored strawberry type sativa buds

244
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,889
Wow the kosher pushes in they're kosher

245
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,139
cush from DNA genetics it's a great cut

246
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,750
of kosher cush my goal with the kosher

247
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:42,490
cush cross the kosher doesn't put out a

248
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,740
lot of weight it produces a bunch of

249
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,299
really small buds I'm hoping maybe we

250
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,940
can increase the yields on the kosher

251
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:51,009
cush maybe put a little more funk into

252
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,960
it kosher is already a great strain but

253
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:55,269
I think adding it to a rise we're going

254
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,000
to increase the production just making

255
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,069
an overall plant all together flow is in

256
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,720
there flow makes when you cross flow to

257
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,420
a rise that makes a strain called prana

258
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,700
prana is an indica sativa hybrid with a

259
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:09,099
very unique aroma the smells that come

260
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,920
out of that plant are amazing I produces

261
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,589
big fat chunky colas what's next the

262
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,269
Grateful dog when you cross grateful dog

263
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:19,510
to an arise male that creates a plant

264
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,799
called the morning dew morning dew is as

265
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:23,230
close to grateful dog

266
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,969
as I have released in regular seeds a

267
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,370
long time ago I released grateful dog

268
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,379
and feminized seeds it quickly became

269
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,089
very popular but I quickly sold out

270
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:32,889
because I am NOT making more feminized

271
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:34,900
seeds for a long time there's no plan in

272
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,699
my future to make feminized seeds so

273
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,110
that morning dew was as close to the

274
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,480
grateful dog that I have

275
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,639
in a regular seed what else do we have

276
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,789
on the list here Zack Hayes let me tell

277
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,740
you about Zack Hayes Zack Hayes is

278
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:50,349
Strawberry Cough crossed to killer clean

279
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,419
and it was made for our friend Zack

280
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,730
Hayes from New Mexico who was part of

281
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:56,278
the organic a dispensary Zack Hayes

282
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,930
unfortunately passed of cystic fibrosis

283
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:01,088
so he had a strain named after him

284
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:03,789
long live Zack I'm going to cross the

285
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:06,190
arize - Zack Hayes hopefully I can get

286
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:07,778
those available for you at org antica

287
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,490
and Albuquerque so if you're a medical

288
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:11,409
marijuana patient or if you knew Zack

289
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,930
there will be a way for you to get your

290
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,939
hands on the Zack Hayes seeds big up -

291
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:17,439
Zack much love miss a little buddy

292
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,050
alright what else do we have in the room

293
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,570
space [ __ ] space [ __ ] is Mike Ross of

294
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:24,458
grateful dog to space clean I took my

295
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,260
favorite space clean female and I

296
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,268
pollinated it with the grateful dog

297
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:30,578
feminized pollen this mate was made

298
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:33,120
years and years ago and I never released

299
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:35,409
it I kept this one to myself it

300
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,539
basically almost every plant that I grew

301
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:38,949
from there came out very similar to

302
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:41,199
space Queen it looks like I just made a

303
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,180
space queen cross it didn't show much

304
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,640
grateful dog in there I'm hoping to kind

305
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:47,909
of mix that weird and mango funky flavor

306
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:50,588
that space Queen creates with that gassy

307
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:52,448
funky tropical thing that arise has and

308
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,449
I'm really curious what that's gonna do

309
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:57,490
the space Queen stays short and squat or

310
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:59,409
the space [ __ ] stays short and squat

311
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,940
and branches out a whole bunch a rise

312
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,189
likes to grow real tall and as real

313
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,220
branchy so I may have created a beefy

314
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,390
ass plant with a bunch of stink all

315
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,670
right what else is in there hell's oh

316
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,990
gee I have crossed hell's og to arise

317
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,259
before and that makes a strain called

318
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,539
Hellfire og since it starts off with an

319
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:18,578
OG Kush as a mother that female puts

320
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:21,009
that really it just gets a lot of a

321
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:22,659
hell's OG fuel and funk and dake nests

322
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:24,879
and then you put the arise in there

323
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,259
which is golden go and Daybreaker now

324
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,649
we're gonna I'm gonna go back a little

325
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:31,750
bit day breaker is chem D and Joseph og

326
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,149
so I'm putting chem D Joseph og and

327
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,278
golden goat to another cush plant it's

328
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:38,528
bringing out a lot of great cushy

329
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,828
undertones and some have like a lemon

330
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:43,419
cush some of them are real greasy some

331
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:44,859
have a smell of like lemon pledge with

332
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:47,559
cush on it and then some have like a

333
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,149
weird it reminds me of like lava soap or

334
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,789
some kind of soap that I can't quite put

335
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:53,759
my nose on

336
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:55,469
but it's got a great aroma to it my goal

337
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,059
was the hell's OG does not produce very

338
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,769
well it's kind of a tall lanky skinny

339
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:02,039
shitty plant like a lot of oh jeez and

340
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:03,779
the arize is just a stocky really robust

341
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,299
plant everything that breeds to that

342
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,559
comes out with more production so I'm

343
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:09,329
trying to increase the production

344
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,969
increase the structure of the hell's OG

345
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,410
and it is working so that's what's in

346
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,850
the breeding project right now all of

347
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:17,159
those will of course be hit by the arize

348
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,259
male there are only seven or eight days

349
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,329
into flower right now they need about 21

350
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,830
to 25 days to get into bloom before I'll

351
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,360
hit them with pollen then from there

352
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,310
they're going to need five to eight

353
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,259
weeks for those seeds to harden up I'll

354
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:29,819
go pull seeds occasionally from certain

355
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,590
plants and see if they look like they're

356
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,629
ready the flow finishes really quickly

357
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,490
those seeds come on quick for some

358
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:37,799
reason the hell's OG those seeds seem to

359
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,360
take a really long time to harden up so

360
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,519
it's all about the plant it's all about

361
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,409
timing things it's all about having a

362
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,299
goal and it's all about paying attention

363
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:47,100
to what's going on so if you're gonna

364
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:48,899
breed have a goal don't just throw some

365
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,460
plants in there have an idea what you're

366
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,049
gonna do know what you want to create

367
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,240
anyway that's a look into my breeding

368
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:57,839
room thanks for joining me I let's see

369
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,700
what do we want to move on to next let's

370
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,740
read a message from a listener if you

371
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,050
listen to the episode last week I talked

372
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,850
about how to talk about cannabis with

373
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,919
your kids how to address your cannabis

374
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,080
use with your children a lot of you live

375
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,969
in places where dare is trying to set

376
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,950
your kids up to snitch on you I think

377
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,389
that if you hide your cannabis use it

378
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,100
looks like you're up to something I

379
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:19,049
think if you talk to your kids about it

380
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,820
and tell them what's going on you have

381
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,229
built an honest relationship with your

382
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,270
family and there's no reason to hide

383
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,250
[ __ ] when you hide things it makes you

384
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:27,600
look like you're hiding something you

385
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,649
might be acting just a little bit

386
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,210
differently because you're hiding

387
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,980
something and the kids are so receptive

388
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,000
that they're going to see you acting

389
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,409
differently and they're gonna know

390
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,480
you're hiding something so don't hide

391
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:38,429
[ __ ] don't lie to the kids when you hide

392
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,170
things you have to lie when you lie you

393
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:41,519
have to lie again then you have to hide

394
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:43,319
that line then you gotta lie again and

395
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,460
it's just a [ __ ] shitty web and you

396
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,750
don't want to start that with your

397
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,620
children tell the children the truth

398
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,470
anyway

399
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,639
a listener sent me an email and I don't

400
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,080
know if they want their name set on the

401
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,939
air so I'm going to keep that private

402
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,259
but he knows who he is and hey bro we

403
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,700
need the session soon I know you live in

404
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,929
Colorado I know you're kind of far from

405
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,540
me but we do need to get together in

406
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:02,069
session also brother great work on the

407
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,079
drum videos on Instagram I see you

408
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,620
playing the drum videos I'm a drummer

409
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,060
too

410
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,980
we need to get together in Seche and

411
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,449
play a little bit of drums are you

412
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,279
bringing your drum kit to me or am i

413
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,780
bringing my drum kit to you that's the

414
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,409
question anyway let's get into this

415
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:18,089
message it goes like this thanks for

416
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:19,679
making people aware of the wretched meed

417
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,420
background check it's kept my family

418
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,069
struggling since we've moved here I'm

419
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,079
still trying to find a good lawyer to

420
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,610
file suit with the meed I really think

421
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,500
the ten years is ludicrous

422
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,389
it ruins the chance of any young felons

423
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,059
getting a badge ten years from the

424
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,949
moment you turn 18 is 28 so anyone with

425
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:37,109
any charge under 28 are out of the

426
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,030
industry then if it's 10 years from that

427
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,550
it puts you at 38 years old if that

428
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:44,009
makes any sense now at one time they

429
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:45,929
didn't allow felons at all someone filed

430
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:48,090
a complaint and a lawsuit and they

431
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:49,739
changed it to 10 years I believe if they

432
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,290
changed it to 10 I can get them to

433
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,700
change it to 5 allowing me and thousands

434
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:55,679
of other others that are stuck on

435
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,030
welfare in Colorado I think he's saying

436
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,709
that would allow them to get a job in

437
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,689
the industry which would be taxpaying

438
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,730
citizens with a badge I know I'm

439
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,350
preaching to the choir but you if if you

440
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,220
have any lawyer suggestions I would

441
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,159
appreciate it

442
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,840
the recent parent podcast was great okay

443
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,549
so now I just caught up to the part

444
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,889
about the last episode so I mentioned on

445
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:15,659
an episode that you should find out if

446
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:17,490
you can get a marijuana Enforcement

447
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:19,199
Division badge before you move to

448
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,690
Colorado if you want to work in the

449
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,670
legal marijuana industry in Colorado you

450
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,380
have to get a badge you cannot come into

451
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:26,879
a facility without a marijuana

452
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,830
Enforcement Division badge

453
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,899
you can't touch product you can't do

454
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,960
damn near anything you were a visitor

455
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,879
without that badge so to get that you

456
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,440
have to pass a thorough background check

457
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,330
there are a lot of things that could

458
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,920
screw you on getting that badge if

459
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,690
you've got a felony within the last 10

460
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,189
years or if you've got a drug crime

461
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,630
there are a lot of things that can

462
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,010
really mess that up I don't remember all

463
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:48,779
of the specifics I'm not gonna search

464
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:50,370
right now but if you are planning on

465
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,379
coming to Colorado to work in the

466
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,060
cannabis industry go to the Colorado

467
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:56,100
marijuana Enforcement Division website

468
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:58,019
and see or if if you are even eligible

469
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,029
for a badge there is a list of things

470
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,159
it's about ten or twelve bullet points

471
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,379
and it says do any of these apply to you

472
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,059
and if you say yes to any of those there

473
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,649
is a good possibility you were banned

474
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,419
from working in the marijuana industry

475
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:11,610
for the time being until your time

476
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:13,679
period comes up or until you can get a

477
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,389
lawyer to fix all of that [ __ ] for you

478
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,679
so be careful if you're coming to

479
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,480
Colorado that's what he's talking about

480
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,000
this guy wants to find a lawyer

481
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,009
to help him file a suit against the meed

482
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,929
in the state of Colorado to reduce the

483
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:26,578
ten year period to five so if anybody

484
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:28,409
out there is a lawyer anybody wants to

485
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:29,669
lawyer up and help this guy send me a

486
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:31,679
message it grows from your heart at

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,639

493
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,509
recent parent podcast was great we had

service is called on us in Kentucky over

498
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,310
moving here they came in and evaluated

499
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,230
me and my wife and concluded that if we

500
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:00,149
did use cannabis it was not affecting

501
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,339
our children in any way we were very

502
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:04,140
lucky it could have gone badly more

503
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,029

530
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,349
medicine I quit drinking alcohol almost

531
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:56,910

532
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:59,759
pharmaceuticals for back pain and

533
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,298
anxiety and quit smoking cigs about ten

534
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,759

that's [ __ ] awesome alcohols terrible

537
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,590
pharmaceuticals are terrible and

538
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,990
cigarettes are the devil so I'm proud of

539
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:11,428
you for quitting I meant I'm glad I'm

540
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,720

541
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:15,360
away from that stuff and take better

542
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,100
care of yourself the message keeps going

543
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,990
and it says like this I don't use iTunes

544
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:20,129
or I'd give you a well-written five-star

545
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,990
review hey Thank You Man

546
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,000
that still means a lot to me he says

547
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,650
consider this I digress I'm high on some

548
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,259
homegrown Jack Herer right now

549
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,060
I wish Jack had a higher CBD content as

550
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:32,529
it is I find it to be a wonderful

551
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:34,720
medicine in certain areas

552
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:36,220
have you ever bred with Jack um I

553
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,960
haven't bred with Jack but I've read

554
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,190
with Jack flash I haven't grown the

555
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,140
seeds out yet and then he goes on to say

556
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,600
or can you recommend a strain very

557
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,790
similar to Jack but with a heavier CBD

558
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,289
medical side I highly respect your

559
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,159
opinion that's why I'm reaching out to

560
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:52,869
you directly

561
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,460
too much conflicting infective liking a

562
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:56,289
few of my photos gave me a lot of

563
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,700
confidence that I'm doing something

564
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:59,349
right hey that's pretty cool that Jessi

565
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,930
likes your photos on Instagram you were

566
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:03,579
definitely doing something right now as

567
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,920
for conflicting information that's why I

568
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:07,240
do this podcast I wanted to write a book

569
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,950
I realized that a book would evolve

570
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,960
almost every week in the new cannabis

571
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,220
industry and then I also knew that there

572
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,809
was a bunch of [ __ ] out there on the

573
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,240
forums that was making people ruin their

574
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:18,039
grows so I wanted to put out a way to

575
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,970
teach people how to grow with just like

576
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,710
you said in the beginning with no

577
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,779
[ __ ] with no jokes with no tricks

578
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,720
with tried-and-true methods that

579
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:27,759
actually work in home grows and large

580
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,519
scale horticulture so thanks for the

581
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,710
compliments there now let's talk about

582
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,950
strains that are similar to Jack but are

583
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,569
a little bit higher in CBD now a strain

584
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:40,000
that may surprise people that often has

585
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:41,740
a lot of CBD in it is Alaskan Thunder

586
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,890
[ __ ] Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] is thought of

587
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,690
as a sativa it grows really tall

588
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,180
reaching colas it has like a really nice

589
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,470
minty sandalwood sort of a flavor it

590
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,720
kind of depends on where you get it who

591
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,819
grew it but it acts more like a sativa

592
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,470
but I have seen test results from

593
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:59,589
Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] that have tested

594
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:01,450
tested with impressive CBD numbers

595
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:04,299
another strain I think you may like may

596
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,950
be penny wise penny wise is a kind of a

597
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:08,049
sativa growing plant it's got a nice -

598
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,809
Teva high but it's also got plenty of

599
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:14,529
CBD in there now another really popular

600
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:16,659
high CBD strain is ac/dc ac/dc has a lot

601
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:18,039
of CBD but it's also got THC it's gonna

602
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,200
give you a nice head buzz but you're

603
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:22,809
also going to get that relief you're not

604
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,630
gonna get bogged down a couple of other

605
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:27,730
really popular CBD crosses are Harlequin

606
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,620
and canna tonic you can find those quite

607
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,880
often in Colorado I'm not sure if they

608
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:32,859
are available in your area

609
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,720
many of the strains I listed are

610
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:37,209
available in seed form you can probably

611
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,130
find some of them at the dank team.com I

612
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,840
can't guarantee what they've got

613
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,510
thing that I have noticed is in my

614
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,759
opinion CBD works better as an edible I

615
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:47,470
find it to be more effective smoking CBD

616
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,470
comes on quickly but it doesn't last

617
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,329
very long in my opinion maybe something

618
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,100
you might want to consider keep growing

619
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:56,259
the jack keep smoking the jack

620
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:58,899
but maybe add a little bit of CBD edible

621
00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:00,490
or CBD teacher to your regimen and that

622
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,800
may be the way to go to help with the

623
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,509
relief if you want to go extreme and

624
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,329
grow a plant that is really heavy and

625
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:09,640
CBD and won't do much on the THC side I

626
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:12,490
would recommend Tora Bora from DNA

627
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,790
genetics it's not the best plant to grow

628
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:18,730
it does not produce very well but it

629
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:20,379
does put out very good CBD medicine

630
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,420
it'll have a nice cherry flavor will

631
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,460
have kind of a cushy aroma and the CBD

632
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,070
effects are very strong so that's Tora

633
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,090
Bora from DNA genetics all right yeah I

634

and I've learned a lot thanks for doing

650
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,440
the podcasts for us hey you're very

651
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,120
welcome the email goes on to say I

652
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,100
listen to your sea of green episode and

653
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,989
got some great info I'm planning on

654
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:07,209
using the scrog tech since myspace is

655
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,250
very limited I recall you saying that

656
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,049
you use this method as well I'd love to

657
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,299
hear another more in depth episode on

658
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,849
your methods pot size transplant before

659
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:18,309
a flower and plants per square foot I'm

660
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:20,199
planning on growing Cindy 99 using the

661
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:23,139
true living organics method the Rebbe

662
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,610
sells c99 f for that he says we're good

663
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,930
with this growing method that should

664
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,809
work pretty well in that method by the

665
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:31,870
way any tips for small grow spaces

666
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:34,119
Thanks and keep it up well I'm not going

667
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:35,949
to do a whole long episode on scrog

668
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,019
again because I kind of covered most of

669
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,000
it in that first episode let me get

670
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:41,950
right to the point with your questions

671
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,200
you said you want to know more about pot

672
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,819
size now since you're doing a small area

673
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,920
you actually included your area you say

674
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:49,899
that it's two by three and a half by

675
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,310
eight so you've got two feet wide three

676
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,040
and a half feet deep and eight feet tall

677
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:54,779
that's not a lot of space to wear

678
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,460
with but that's plenty of space for a

679
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,809
small light maybe you've got a 400 watt

680
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,910
light in there hopefully you've got some

681
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,259
airflow in there maybe you've got a 600

682
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,890
watt light with a whole lot of airflow

683
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:08,789
that's up to you but pot size in a space

684
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:10,500
that small I would probably do 2 or 3 3

685
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:14,039
gallon pots and just spread them out

686
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,690
really far or maybe do one 5 gallon pot

687
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,759
if it even fits in there that's gonna be

688
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,799
a tight fit if you can get those square

689
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,529
pots one 5 gallon pot in there would fit

690
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,089
spread it down real real low and just

691
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:25,889
keep that plant as short as you can get

692
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:27,449
it every time it grows up Bend it back

693
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,400
under that trellis net and keep it low

694
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,860
another thing you can do if you want to

695
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,840
go smaller pots you can do more plants

696
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:35,759
in smaller pots and you don't have to

697
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,339
veg as long the thing with more plants

698
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,349
is you have less veg time with less

699
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:41,879
plants it takes more veg time you're

700
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:43,949
just gonna grow one plant longer to fill

701
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,140
the space or you'll grow more plants for

702
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,480
shorter to fill the space so if you want

703
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:52,500
to do rock wool cubes do like the 4 inch

704
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,390
rock wool cubes maybe do 1 2 3 like 4 do

705
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:59,700
maybe like 16 rock wool cubes in the

706
00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:03,210
whole room or maybe do like 12 or 9 4

707
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,740
inch square pots or 9 6 inch net pots it

708
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,539
kind of depends on how often you want to

709
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,400
water how many plants you want to run

710
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:10,859
how many plants are you legally allowed

711
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,300
to run is this an illegal grow there are

712
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:14,369
things like that to think about so in

713
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:16,339
your space I would say 2 or 3 3 gallon

714
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:19,619
pots or a whole bunch of little ones

715
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:21,119
transplant before a flower like I said

716
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:23,489
it just put them into the 3 gallon pots

717
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,799
or maybe 1 5 gallon pot I'll use a good

718
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:28,109
aerated soil using quality soil mix use

719
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:30,089
good nutrients plants per square foot

720
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:31,319
let's see that's kind of up to you if

721
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:32,819
you just like I was saying earlier if

722
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:36,480
you want to do a whole bunch of little

723
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:38,909
ones you could do like 30 little tiny

724
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,759
rock wool cubes or you could do 16

725
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:46,050
bigger rock wool cubes or like 9 6 inch

726
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:48,329
net pots or 3 3 gallon pots or one 5

727
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:50,669
gallon pot or maybe 1 7 gallon pot would

728
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:51,750
fit in there what this is gonna do is

729
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,519
it's gonna make a difference on how

730
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,750
frequently you have to water it's gonna

731
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,789
make a difference on how long you have

732
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,289
to veg and it's going to make a

733
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:59,789
difference on how many plants you have

734
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,589
in there those are some of the things to

735
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,029
consider when you're deciding this so I

736
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:05,429
feel like I may have kind of just told

737
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:06,660
you figure it out but you kind of have

738
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,680
to figure this part

739
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,450
that's something you're gonna have to

740
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,400
decide do you want to veg longer do you

741
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,069
want to veg shorter if you want one big

742
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,030
plant do you want multiple strains

743
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:16,319
that's one of the fun parts about

744
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:18,240
cannabis is that you have a little

745
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,069
wiggle room there are no solid rules on

746
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,480
what you've got to do okay what I would

747
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:23,279
probably do I'm looking at it I'm trying

748
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,380
to picture this size of space I think I

749
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,299
would do four three gallon pots and I

750
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,240
would be sure to do all the same strain

751
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:31,409
I would grow them up about like until

752
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,089
they have a few nodes you know when they

753
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,740
start making that node where the one

754
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:36,209
starts taking off at the top I would top

755
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,890
them take that main top node out of

756
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,569
there now you got a nice even plant I

757
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,950
would start trellising them out then and

758
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:43,289
spread them out real wide now you've got

759
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,450
four plants that are probably like ten

760
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:47,190
inches tall they're nice and bushy put

761
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,690
them under the screen get that screen

762
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,190
set up about ten or twelve inches above

763
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,420
the top of the pot and just start

764
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,309
spreading them out as wide as you can

765
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,560
instead of letting that plant grow up

766
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:56,909
make it grow out and then let it go up

767
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,279
from there and then if you have another

768
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,720
screen up you can use the next screen to

769
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,579
support all the buds that you're going

770
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,500
to create they'll start falling over use

771
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:05,759
the next one as like little supports

772
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,619
forms for when they start tipping you

773
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,599
just have this little little rows of

774
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:11,459
buds everywhere it'll look beautiful so

775
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,259
I hope I gave you useful information I

776
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,940
know I just told you figure it out do

777
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:17,250
what you feel best with but I would do

778
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,890
four three gallon pots and put the net

779
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,660
about ten or twelve inches above the pot

780
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,490
use for the same strain let those plants

781
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,930
grow all into that net keep bending them

782
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:28,200
down bending them down keeping them low

783
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:30,299
I do some go and pop and twist the stems

784
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,380
do a little bit of super cropping in

785
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,599
there and make sure those sticks are

786
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,550
nice and strong let move the nutrients

787
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,259
around real well and then when you've

788
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:38,819
got that screen filled in let it grow

789
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:40,559
straight up just a little bit and then

790
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:42,769
flip it into flower and I think you will

791
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,819
be completely happy with your results

792
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,170
again I know I left a whole bunch of

793
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:48,569
wiggle room in there I didn't give any

794
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,370
steadfast answers but this is some stuff

795
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:52,529
that you get to play with I did say I do

796
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:55,019
the four pots three gallons run those

797
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,700
Cindy 99s in there are these seeds

798
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:58,379
feminized or are they regular if they

799
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,930
are f4 as it says here they're probably

800
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,510
regular seeds plan on pulling out some

801
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,640
males so here's my opinion if this is

802
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:07,379
possible for you however many seeds

803
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,930
you've got grow all of them in that

804
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,790
space in small pots put them in a six

805
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,650
inch net pot and if you've got a ten

806
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:15,569
pack run all ten of them when they get

807
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,580
big enough to take a clone take a clone

808
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:20,159
from every one of them and label it like

809
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:21,839
make plant a plant a plant

810
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,460
eat plant be go label all your plants

811
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,649
and then take a clone and label that

812
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,420
clone plant a clone a plant be clone be

813
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:29,759
and then grow them you're gonna find

814
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:31,740
some boys throw the boys away throw the

815
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,690
corresponding clones away now you've got

816
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,579
a bunch of girls to finish finish those

817
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,200
girls find the one you like the best

818
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:39,480
you've got a clone of that over there in

819
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,769
the cloner or hopefully it's in a pot by

820
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,019
now and rooted but you've got a clone of

821
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:44,910
the good one so now you can grow as many

822
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,559
of that as you want next time so maybe

823
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,870
start with a whole bunch of small pots

824
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,639
find the one you want and then run four

825
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:52,649
clones of that one in three gallon pots

826
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,420
next time that may be the strategy I

827
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,860
don't know if you've got room to keep

828
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,900
clones I don't know if you have room to

829
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:59,459
keep that and the good one is a mother

830
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,660
plant I don't know what your options are

831
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,910
it sounds like you've got very limited

832
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,370
space but if you can dedicate another

833
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,560
very small space to keeping a clone and

834
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:10,349
one keeper mother plant you would have

835
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,429
yourself a small perpetual grow all

836
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:13,079

837
