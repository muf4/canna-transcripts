episode I know that the 710 episode did

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,098
come out a little bit early my recording

63
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,359
schedule is a little bit chaotic a

64
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:20,098
little bit hectic right now I've got to

65
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,480
record the episodes and try at a time

66
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,579
when they're coming out sometimes I miss

67
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,219
it by a couple of days but uh thank you

68
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,360
for the great response to the early 710

69
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,280
episode of course if you haven't

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,099
listened to that go listen to the 710

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,098
podcast I do talk about what 710 is what

72
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:36,780
710 means to me how 710 did evolve thank

73
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,238
you for the great feedback on that I do

74
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,699
appreciate it it is really lucky that I

75
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,259
did record that show early because I

76
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,060
tried to record yesterday and I

77
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,500
experienced a power outage in my

78
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,860
recording space that's right the

79
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,719
Transformer on my block exploded uh

80
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,980
smoke came out of it a bunch of flames

81
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,539
came out of it for about a minute and

82
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,639
then it petered out then the power was

83
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,039
out in the whole block for several hours

84
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,018
so there was no work done yesterday uh

85
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,719
no podcast recording no seed packaging

86
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,039
no editing no progress was made I simply

87
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,300
jumped in the car and went for a ride

88
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,519
and tried to stay cool and keep the

89
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,099
phone charged so I'm really lucky that I

90
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,200
did record that 710 episode a little bit

91
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,539
early because last night I was unable to

92
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,518
utilize the studio space so here we are

93
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,318
catching up today but uh there was a

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,120
power outage so I'm really lucky that I

95
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:23,579
got that going thank you guys for all of

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,500
the uh the feedback on that 710 episode

97
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,719
I do appreciate it there's more stuff

98
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,818
that I do want to loop back and touch on

99
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,039
on that 710 episode some things that I

100
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:34,560
may have missed and I was reminded

101
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,658
because today I saw a friend buy

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,219
um a friend of mine went to a bodega if

103
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:41,039
you live near a bodega you know what

104
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,719
that is basically just a small store uh

105
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,400
with a bunch of random products in there

106
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,780
A lot of times you'll find ethnic

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,180
products in there A lot of times you'll

108
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,979
find off-brand products in there a lot

109
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,299
of weird random [ __ ] in the bodega but

110
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,280
you could survive out of there if you

111
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,099
need to it's basically a convenience

112
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,140
store but also a bunch of random items

113
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,719
in there anyway one of the members of

114
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:04,738
the irie Army today did pick up a dab

115
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,239
rig complete and ready to use for 35 at

116
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,640
a bodega so don't think you've got to

117
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,219
spend a ton of money on a smoking device

118
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,079
on a good dab rig I've got rigs that

119
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,239
cost well we don't need to talk about

120
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,519
dollars I've got expensive Rigs and more

121
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,139
affordable Rigs and honestly the rig I

122
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,060
hit the most is one of the more

123
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,120
affordable devices in my collection it

124
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,319
works well it functions well it's clear

125
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,418
glass it doesn't have a lot of color

126
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,159
it's not real fancy but guess what when

127
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:31,139
I put the dab in the Banger I put the

128
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,180
carb cap on it and I inhale that rig

129
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,439
punches me in the face it is it's like a

130
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,418
right hand right to the jaw it's

131
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,918
beautiful I enjoy it none of the other

132
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:39,180
rigs hit like that I paid a lot of money

133
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,399
for them they're really pretty they have

134
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,959
a lot of color a lot of fancy design a

135
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,120
lot of function but they just don't hit

136
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,638
like the simple rig so something I

137
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,978
wanted to talk about is small practical

138
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,478
affordable rigs are very good for an

139
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:52,978
entry level Dabber don't think you've

140
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:54,779
got to spend a lot of money get

141
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:57,300
something kind of small you're not

142
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,219
buying a bong you're buying a dab rig

143
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,680
there's a big difference in smoking a

144
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,320
dab then smoking a bong when you smoke

145
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,240
the bong the idea is to light the bowl

146
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,579
and smoke until you get that big glass

147
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,620
chain that big space all that area

148
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:12,359
filled with the volume of smoke and then

149
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,800
you carve it you pull the bowl or you

150
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,300
pull the carb and then you suck and then

151
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,060
all that smoke goes into your face all

152
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,579
at once you get that big bong rip when

153
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,500
we're smoking dabs we don't need to burn

154
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:25,319
the flour and smoke for so long and fill

155
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,660
the chamber we just need smoke Vapor

156
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,038
basically to go through the water to

157
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,080
cool it down so it doesn't roast my

158
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,639
esophagus and then I need it to get into

159
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,740
my lungs I'm not really trying to fill

160
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,780
up a big tube and clear it I can kind of

161
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,639
manage that enough with the carb cap by

162
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,138
filling the chamber the little uh the

163
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,699
can on the rig and just fill it enough

164
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,740
and keep it going but I don't like a big

165
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,240
bong I'm not going for a big bong rip

166
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,680
with the big bong you got to smoke

167
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,819
forever you just keep inhaling and

168
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,860
inhaling and you don't even get any

169
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,139
smoke until you finally pull that car up

170
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,419
with a little rig as soon as I put my

171
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,460
dab onto the Banger as soon as it hits

172
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:58,139
the dab nail and I start sucking I'm

173
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,579
getting a fat dab to my brain I'm gonna

174
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,740
cough my eyes are gonna cross I'm gonna

175
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:05,038
go red-faced that's what I'm looking for

176
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,538
so a smaller practical rig is ideal for

177
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,060
especially a new Dabber that's what I

178
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:10,620
use is a very small practical rig it

179
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,240
doesn't need a lot of perks a lot of

180
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,000
swirls a lot of Twisties it doesn't need

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,220
to be a recycler I do enjoy my recycler

182
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,079
rigs my in-cycler rigs my fancy [ __ ] but

183
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,300
honestly my favorite rig doesn't have

184
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,339
any of that [ __ ] so if you're going to

185
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,199
get a rig don't think that you need to

186
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,579
spend a bunch of money all the glass

187
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,600
sellers out there right now are going

188
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:29,399
damn it Jeff we're going to make some

189
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,800
money just get a rig that functions it's

190
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,899
all about how it works I prefer a

191
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,759
flared-out mouthpiece if the mouthpiece

192
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,379
is too little on a rig I take a big dab

193
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,300
I feel like I get built up concentrates

194
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:40,800
on my lip I don't like that I like a

195
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,439
flared-out mouthpiece I like something

196
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,660
about hand size and I mentioned before I

197
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,038
like it when I go to take the dab that I

198
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,539
can look at the Banger and not go

199
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,399
cross-eyed I don't need to be cross-eyed

200
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:52,259
with that it's not like a smaller rig

201
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,418
the other things that I did not mention

202
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,919
is that you're going to need a torch

203
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:57,959
you're going to need some way to torch

204
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,240
that nail do you have a torch we usually

205
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,560
just use a creme brulee torch Newport

206
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,960
makes a good torch there are a bunch of

207
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,399
a bunch of great torches out there again

208
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:08,038
you don't have to buy the super

209
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,318
expensive torch those expensive torches

210
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,240
will jot will die just like that cheaper

211
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,979
torch so get the torch that fits your

212
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,660
budget budget that makes you happy the

213
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,339
next thing you're going to need is a

214
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,199
Dabber if you've got a rig you've got a

215
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,519
banger you've got a torch the next thing

216
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,319
you need is a Dabber you need something

217
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,019
to scoop up that concentrate and put it

218
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,598
into the Banger then I would recommend a

219
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,818
carb cap carb cap that fits the Banger

220
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,459
and goes kind of deep down inside if you

221
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,199
are using a terp slurper most of my

222
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,060
advice will not work for you I'm not a

223
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,580
fan of the terp slurper the community

224
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,079
may roast me for that I am not a big fan

225
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,180
of the bird feeder it doesn't do

226
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,240
anything good for me in my dabbing style

227
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,879
I don't like it I strongly prefer a flat

228
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,500
top Banger round bottom flat top with a

229
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,680
carb cap let's get it that way that is

230
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,538
my preferred uh method of dabbing but uh

231
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,220
so you may need a carb cap the carb cap

232
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,918
will definitely increase the quality of

233
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,539
your dab all the time another thing I

234
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,519
recommend is Q-tips as soon as you're

235
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:04,199
done dabbing grab a q a good quality

236
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,418
Q-tip don't get the [ __ ] that melts

237
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,180
those cheap Q-tips will melt get good

238
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,439
like glob fathers or dab mops or

239
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,780
something like that some good quality

240
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,399
Q-tips or if you go to Dillard's and go

241
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,198
to the makeup section those Q-tips those

242
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,579
are great other makeup Q-tips they're

243
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,500
better quality than the [ __ ] you use in

244
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:20,939
your ear those will melt so get some

245
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,800
Q-tips as soon as you're done dabbing

246
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,139
grab that Q-tip and clean out the

247
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,460
residual oil or the residual wax in your

248
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,978
Banger and that'll help you keep it

249
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,060
clean also I recommend some rubbing

250
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,218
alcohol you're going to need to clean

251
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,458
that dab rig all your tools are going to

252
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,320
get sticky 91 isopropyl alcohol is your

253
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,778
friend in a previous episode I did

254
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,360
recommend a product called Dark Crystal

255
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:44,700
Dark Crystal is available on Amazon it's

256
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,200
a great product if you can afford it uh

257
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,700
heat it up a little bit people think I'm

258
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,860
crazy when I say that the instructions

259
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,240
say to heat it up a little bit it works

260
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,060
so much better when it's hot and you

261
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,860
cannot heat up the alcohol as hot safely

262
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,799
you could probably but I'm not gonna do

263
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,139
that but heat up the Dark Crystal that

264
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,699
[ __ ] will clear clean your glass quite

265
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,139
quickly another thing I'm going to

266
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,519
recommend they don't pay me to say this

267
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,980
but if you want a really nice and smooth

268
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,778
dab check out the dab right Ah that's a

269
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,278
good product uh the dab right you just

270
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:12,958
basically set your Banger above it and

271
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,759
it'll measure the heat on the surface of

272
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,139
your Banger you tell you set a

273
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,120
temperature you tell it I want to dab at

274
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,338
650 I want it 650 that [ __ ] beeps and

275
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,899
you take your dab it's really great

276
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,060
um so the rig that I use most of the

277
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,220
time somebody on YouTube asked me what

278
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,559
is that rig the rig that I was hitting

279
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,740
on the previous episode was a hitman

280
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,659
sidecar with a hammerhead perk nothing

281
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,639
fancy it's made by a company called

282
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,740
Hitman it's called a sidecar because

283
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,899
it's got a can and the mouthpiece comes

284
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,580
off the side that's a sidecar it's got a

285
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,019
hammerhead percolator in the inside of

286
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,820
it which means the downstem goes

287
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,200
straight down then it goes to the left

288
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,940
and to the right and it's got holes

289
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,320
facing the left and right it looks like

290
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,600
a hammer if I had it here to show you it

291
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,440
looked like it like Thor's hammer it's a

292
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,459
Hitman uh sidecar with a hammerhead perk

293
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,140
that's what that is so if you're looking

294
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,979
for that it'll be hard to find because I

295
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,100
don't know if they're making those

296
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,600
Hitman however is coming back check your

297
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,120
local glass shops check their website

298
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,159
harass them on social media where was I

299
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,379
going next not a bong is what I wrote

300
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,899
I've already talked about why not a bong

301
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:14,399
why I prefer a little rig I've talked

302
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,620
about the torch

303
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,659
if the torch is not something you're

304
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,578
comfortable with or maybe if you're

305
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,319
going to be traveling a lot maybe the

306
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,899
torch isn't for you

307
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,339
um driving and hitting torching a dab

308
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,720
nail is kind of challenging unless

309
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,279
you're a pro allegedly I wouldn't

310
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,399
recommend it I've never done that wink

311
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,899
wink something like a puffco something

312
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,339
like that maybe a little better for you

313
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,839
if you're not into the torch if you need

314
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,399
to be discreet if you got kids in the

315
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,680
house or if you're going to be smoking

316
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,120
in the car that dab torch and the hot

317
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,099
Banger in the car can get quite

318
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,720
dangerous if you're not super uh

319
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,120
coordinated if you are a clumsy an

320
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,700
accident prone maybe consider something

321
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,620
like the puffco also think about the

322
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,940

334
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,159
questions I was recently asked a

335
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,440
question

336
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,480
um that I'm asked a lot and I don't know

337
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,680
if I address it enough publicly I don't

338
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,620
know if I've said this enough to where

339
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:28,139
people uh know my answer so not only am

340
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,299
I a podcaster I'm also the uh the

341
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,458
breeder for irie genetics premium seeds

342
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:35,399
I own I regenetics premium seeds I make

343
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:39,000
high quality regular and feminized seeds

344
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,700
so somebody asked me today again how do

345
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,559
I feel about people breeding with the

346
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,959
seeds that I have created and I've

347
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,159
always had the same answer hopefully I

348
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,659
will always continue to have this

349
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,799
attitude and the same answer but the

350
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:52,259
answer is

351
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,319
uh go ahead and breed with my seeds if

352
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,759
you acquired my seeds in an ethical way

353
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,800
if you didn't steal them or rip somebody

354
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,899
off for them or lie to somebody to get

355
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,578
them if you got them in a positive way I

356
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,200
give you full permission to breed with

357
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,319
the seeds that I've made

358
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,759
I'm not territorial I'm not uh I guess

359
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,440
territorials the word that I'm not

360
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,659
possessive with my seeds you paid for

361
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,579
them they're yours have a good time just

362
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,259
like all the seeds I bought or let's

363
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:18,838
talk even further down the line I didn't

364
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,578
invent cannabis in any way

365
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,860
um we all know that Willie Nelson and

366
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:24,838
Bob Marley invented cannabis in 1952 if

367
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,399
you don't know that read the story so I

368
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,200
did not invent cannabis which means I

369
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,360
did not have seeds to start with I

370
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,860
didn't just sneeze and have male seeds

371
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,419
and sneeze and have female seeds or

372
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,339
sneeze and have a male plant and cough

373
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,799
out a female plant and start breeding I

374
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,260
had to get seeds in Plants somewhere so

375
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,539
I'm working with other breeders plants

376
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,819
and other breeders seeds so if I wasn't

377
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:47,099
using other breeders [ __ ] then I would

378
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,200
not be breeding or working with cannabis

379
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,060
in any way every plant that I used use

380
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,980
had to come from somewhere to get me

381
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,859
started I didn't I didn't invent this

382
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,480
cannabis so uh that being said I give

383
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,120
you permission to breed with anything

384
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,519
that I have put out there I do have a

385
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,560
couple of stipulations and maybe a

386
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,078
couple of by the ways with that you it

387
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,879
would be cool if you give me credit when

388
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,319
you breed to my stuff if you make a

389
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,299
cross and you put it out or you talk

390
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,940
about it on social media it would be

391
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,139
kind of you to say this is my whatever

392
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,579

people it's the ire genetics cross in

397
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:28,200
there honestly if you're a new breeder

398
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,120
if you're getting started that may give

399
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,339
you an advantage that may help you out

400
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,899
but also that just shows it shows

401
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:35,820
respect and gives me credit it tells

402
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:38,759
people what you're working with never

403
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,040
ever uh in any way for any reason change

404
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,919
the names change the stories and change

405
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,899
the crosses of your stuff of my stuff of

406
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,578
any stuff if you're breeding tell the

407
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,078
truth we need to know what's in there we

408
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,359
need to know what plants were used to

409
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:54,059
make that cross many people are using

410
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,740
cannabis as a medical medical remedy and

411
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,119
they want to know what genetics they're

412
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,459
smoking because it'll have certain

413
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,078
effects for certain ailments I know some

414
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,578
people that won't smoke a sativa like

415
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,078
nope I'll be too high I'll have a panic

416
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:05,638
attack I know some people that really

417
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,559
really love certain strains and really

418
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,180
hate certain strains so let's stay

419
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,099
honest with the labeling and let's not

420
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,899
change any names that's really important

421
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,180
when you do go breeding with anybody's

422
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,639
stuff just give us credit honor us honor

423
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,198
your elders I think it's really it shows

424
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,698
a lot when you Reveal Your Source a lot

425
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,799
of times you'll hear me say I learned

426
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:24,599
this from this person because I'm Not

427
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,519
The Wizard of Oz like I said I did not

428
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,920
invent cannabis I'm also not a weed

429
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,360

of teachers a lot of people around me

431
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,919
and I absorb information very well but I

432
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,019
do not think I'm the Wizard of Oz or

433
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,240
some cannabis Guru Guru I just read a

434
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,220

475
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,759
care that you put some pride into it

476

00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:18,419
um there are a lot of things to unpack

485
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,120
there first of all sub cool was somebody

486
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:23,278
that I feel uh was my mentor subcool was

487
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,139
one of my heroes sub cool taught me a

488
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,720
lot about this business sub cool Tommy

489
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:30,060
what to do and also I always say subcool

490
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,820
taught me a lot of what not to do as a

491
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:34,619
cannabis breeder as a cannabis person

492
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,839
um he made a lot of mistakes but he also

493
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,060
made a lot of Headway he carved the path

494
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,620
that many of us are walking now so I

495
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,198
felt that it was my responsibility

496
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,120
almost to make a tribute strain 2 sub

497
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,559
cool when sub cool passed away rest in

498
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,198
peace subby love you every day I miss

499
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,119
you bro you honorary [ __ ] but uh

500
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,299
subcool's gone so I took it upon myself

501
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,519
to continue some of subcool's work

502
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:58,620
subcool does not make f2s sub cool a lot

503
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,120
like myself was an F1 monster he had a

504
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,740
couple of killer males and he would

505
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,480
pollinate everything with those males

506
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,699
and it would work so he had a good plan

507
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,140
a good strategy and subcool would tell

508
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,439
you if it ain't broke don't [ __ ] fix

509
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,880
it so subcool is continuing on that path

510
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,980
subcool would have never made f2s of

511
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,660
Jack the Ripper Jill may have uh Jill

512
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,919
may have inspired that Jill may have

513
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,779
thought about that along the way she's

514
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,699
more uh that way in breeding but sub

515
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,139
would have just kept making new [ __ ] so

516
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,179
sub was never going to make the Jack the

517
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,038
Ripper f2s I love Jack the Ripper it

518
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,538
really does something special to me uh

519
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:29,879
gets me lit in a way that I really like

520
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:32,220
and it honors a good friend of mine my

521
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,280
mentor my hero who has fallen also I

522
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,740
just mentioned Miss Jill Miss Jill uh

523
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,899
for a long time was uh I think they may

524
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,880
have been married when sub passed they

525
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,900
uh they had a rocky relationship as the

526
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,280
best I'll say right here Jill wouldn't

527
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,600
mind me saying that that's [ __ ] well

528
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,220
known I'm pretty sure they were

529
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,219
separated but still married when sub

530
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,919
passed however Miss Jill was a big part

531
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,660
of TGA Team Green Avengers which was

532
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,160
part of that's what sub cool Seed

533
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,798
Company it was sub cool and Miss Jill

534
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,320
they were TGA there were other people

535
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,119
involved also in TGA but to the best of

536
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,538
my knowledge sub and Miss Jill were the

537
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,579
core of TGA the green Avengers now after

538
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:10,619
subcool passed away I did the

539
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:12,418
responsible thing I reached out to my

540
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:14,699
friend and fellow breeder Miss Jill and

541
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,559
I said hey do you care if I work with

542
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,000
Jack the Ripper I want to make f2s and I

543
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,859
want to make a bunch of outcrosses and

544
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,599
she said you know what I'm done with

545
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:24,058
Jack the Ripper and Subs obviously done

546
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,399
with it you've got our blessing have fun

547
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:28,440
do your thing with Jack the Ripper so I

548
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,140
did my work with Jack the Ripper with

549
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,240
the blessing of the Widow of the breeder

550
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,620
who made it who was also involved in the

551
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,900
company so I feel like I've got

552
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:39,599
permission I did my due diligence I did

553
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,280
my it's Grace I did I've got Grace I did

554
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,839
what I needed to do to keep the

555
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,879
relationship strong to keep the business

556
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,199
strong and to not feel like a [ __ ]

557
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,360
about it if you feel like a [ __ ]

558
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,460
about it you know inside that's when you

559
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,859
are doing something wrong ethically

560
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,140
alright so yes you can breed with my

561
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:57,719
seeds but follow the rules very few

562
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,700
rules don't change the names respect the

563
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,100
breeder and pay homage and tribute to

564
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,779
the breeder then don't go breeding with

565
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,298
just my straight up mail do some work

566
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,859
find your mail then do the work sell

567
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:09,000
those seeds if that's what you choose to

568
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:10,798
do

569
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,599
something else I should mention bro I

570
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,519
like seeds too if you're making [ __ ]

571
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,619
with my crosses send me a 10 pack come

572
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,359
on I'll take them I just might grow your

573
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:19,678
seeds out find something cool and breed

574
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,178
it back to some of my other [ __ ] and

575
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,460
then send you more seeds it goes that

576
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,200
way sometimes people get gifts in the

577
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,759
mail all the time also I like clones of

578
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,620
Keepers if you grow some of my seeds and

579
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:29,640
you find a good keeper let me know I do

580
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,259
like clones

581
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,520
um where are we going from there

582
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:33,900
um talk to the breeder just tell the

583
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,579
breeder hey this is what I want to do

584
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,960
and see if they have a project similar

585
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:39,000
to what you're going to do lined up or

586
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,259
something you may end up getting to work

587
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,179
with the breeder you never know what

588
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,740
could happen the breeder a lot of us are

589
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,240

590

mentioned don't change the names don't

596
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,319
change the story you will be found out

597
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,819
there's a story behind every plant

598
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,200
there's details behind every plant

599
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:03,240
somebody gave you that plant somebody

600
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,558
gave you that seed somebody knows the

601
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,480
truth don't [ __ ] it all up let's keep

602
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,178
this cannabis story real

603
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,679
there's so much [ __ ] uh behind the

604
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,080
cannabis plant behind the Cannabis

605
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,400
industry cannabis lore

606
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,199
um we've got the internet now we've got

607
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,320
enough resources to clear up [ __ ]

608
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,240
and keep things real as a podcaster as a

609
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,798
breeder uh just with the mindset that

610
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,179
I've got I feel like I'm sort of a

611
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,918
cannabis historian it's my

612
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,140
responsibility to make sure that strain

613
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,360
details cannabis history that all this

614
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,980
[ __ ] is correct so help me out with that

615
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:33,658
you guys don't [ __ ] up the story don't

616
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,460
convolute the story of your plants of

617
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:37,200
your strains if you don't know you don't

618
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,120
have to chime in definitely don't make

619
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,580
some [ __ ] up and do not change the names

620
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,379
don't do that dumb [ __ ] when it comes to

621
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:45,538
breeding with my seeds that was the long

622
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,919
rant the short version is [ __ ] go for

623
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,960
it have a good time I encourage it

624
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,340
because it's kind of an honor like if

625
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,079
you're going to use my plants as

626
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:54,119
breeding stock that's saying that I made

627
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,918
good enough [ __ ] to where you trust in

628
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,418
it that you want to breed to it because

629
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,919
you like it that much it's like saying

630
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,900
my Beats were funky enough you wanted to

631
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,580
sample them for your album all right I

632
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,200
appreciate that do breed with my seeds

633
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:06,000
I've got another thing I do want to talk

634
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,440
about here somebody today asked me in a

635
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,240
Discord chat big shout out to my friend

636
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,220
who asked me you know who you are they

637
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,140
said if you could use any plants for

638
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,519
breeding what two plants would you

639
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,159
select and I thought that was a very

640
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,619
good question my answer though was

641
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,740
probably not what everybody was hoping

642
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:25,500
for because I don't have two plants in

643
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,240
mind that I would love to breed because

644
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,740
I can't just tell you that I want to

645
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,339
breed to some [ __ ] because of the names

646
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:35,460
of the plants like apricot Kush and

647
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:37,439
[ __ ] Vanilla Sky would probably taste

648
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,058
and smell really good but that's just

649
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,460
two names what does that have to do with

650
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:42,899
those plants uh anything with the plants

651
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,140
other than names that some person

652
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,659
arbitrarily labeled these plants I like

653
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,580
to pick my breeding pairs by seeing

654
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:52,380
plants sometimes I'll be growing out

655
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:54,298
some seeds looking for a female and I'll

656
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,980
see a male in there and I'll go [ __ ] I

657
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:57,599
wasn't looking for a boy but that dude

658
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,038
right there has got to go into a

659
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,839
breeding project we got another male

660
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,158
coming up that we're having a hard time

661
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:03,240
getting we're running some more Fino

662
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,580
hunts we're having a hard time getting

663
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,980
rid of some boys because they're showing

664
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:09,899
such potential and it's really hard so

665
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,640
to choose plants just based on names and

666
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,320
things without actually seeing plants

667
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,000
for a breeding project I don't think

668
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:16,139
that's right that's like just uh

669
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,579
scrolling through the phone book and

670
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,780
picking a boy name and a girl name and

671
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,879
putting them on a date and hoping that

672
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:23,519
it works I need to actually see the

673
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,960
plants I need to see uh I want to see

674
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,119
the plants in veg I want to see the

675
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,340
plants in early flower mid flower and

676
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,019
late flour I want to see what they look

677
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:32,759
like just before Harvest I want to know

678
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,200
what the buds taste and smell like I

679
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:36,240
want to know the density of the buds I

680
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,380
want to know the buzz that it gives me I

681
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,298
want to know what happens if the room

682
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,740
got too hot if the room got too cold if

683
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:42,720
I took off too many leaves if I didn't

684
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,279
take off enough leaves I want to know a

685
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,140
lot of details about these plants before

686
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,019
I choose to breed with them so just

687
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,120
knowing by the name isn't really a way

688
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:53,819
that I would choose to select my

689
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,259
breeding pairs now let's talk about ways

690
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:56,158
that I actually would do it because I

691
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,319
don't want to shoot down your question

692
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,299
without a good answer

693
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,220
um currently I've got a King Solomon

694
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:04,980
male you guys know King Solomon that's

695
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,659
an arise male that's kind of 50 50. I

696
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,038
know the terms indica and sativa are

697
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,960
kind of outdated those are going away

698
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:12,298
but if you were going to label it as an

699
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,579
indica or a sativa Maya rise my King

700
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:16,798
Solomon leans a little bit sativa but

701
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:19,439
he's kind of 50 50 ish he's kind of 60

702
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,179
40 but he's real close to the middle he

703
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,159
grows real well he's got a great Buzz

704
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:25,380
that one's kind of 50 50. then I've got

705
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,659
the Jack the Ripper male who is real

706
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,419
sativa leaning real sativa heavy

707
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:33,059
probably 70 ish five 75-ish percent

708
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,520
sativa then I've got the BC Lemon Skunk

709
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:37,798
mail which that's a lot of sativa which

710
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,900
just straight lemon funky flavors in a

711
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:41,460
real particular growth pattern so if I

712
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,340
were gonna pick more plants to breed

713
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:48,058
with right now I would be looking for a

714
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:50,399
really short squatty broadleafed male

715
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:53,879
that finishes in like eight weeks and

716
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,220
produces gassy skunky Aromas maybe like

717
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,260
a moon tower male something that's more

718
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,740
uh couch locky because everything else

719
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,379
I'm making is really uh it's a head [ __ ]

720
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,538
I like panic attack weed but to broaden

721
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,360
the catalog to bring some new [ __ ] in

722
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:11,400
maybe I need something more mellow more

723
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,859
Indica dominant as the old term we used

724
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,740
to use some big broad leaves some gassy

725
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:18,479
Aromas get that funky gassy Aroma that

726
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,058
maybe a hint of those burnt tennis balls

727
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,579
get that and then breathe that to all of

728
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:24,899
the other really sweet tropical candy

729
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:27,240
flavored females that I've been

730
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,340
collecting the strawberry Starburst the

731
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,659
Golden Goat The Lemon Skunk of course uh

732
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:32,579
the Lemon Skunk female I do have a Lemon

733
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,140
Skunk male and a female just because I'm

734
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:35,879
sure it does get confusing from totally

735
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,799
different breeders different batches but

736
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,179
I should mention that but I think the

737
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:41,158
thing I would be looking for now would

738
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,840
be more of like a broadleaf Indica type

739
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,640
of male that finishes in eight weeks

740
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,899
because that is very different than

741
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,940
everything else that I've got in my

742
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,500
catalog and when you're breeding things

743
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,480
that are very different is when you have

744
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,119
great success so I think that would work

745
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,360
well for me maybe a moon tower male or

746
00:24:54,119 --> 00:25:00,000
possibly a cream male maybe good there

747
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,399
could be a cream male hidden somewhere

748
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,200
you never know what make sure you check
