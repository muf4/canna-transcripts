1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,569
alright I'm doing something new I

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,730
usually don't press record during the

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,648
dab session before the show tonight I've

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,750
decided to press record right before I

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,000
dab I'm gonna take this dab and then we

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,740
might jump into the show who knows I may

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,750
end up editing this part of the show out

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,519
I am heating up the dab nail right now

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,198
getting it nice and warm for myself I've

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,358
got a big fat dab lined up we'll talk

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,650
about that dab in just a moment this is

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,990
awkward because I'm trying to work the

13
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:26,788
dab torch trying to hold the rig I've

14
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:28,709
got my dad prepared and also I've got a

15
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,660
microphone in my face so that's a new

16
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,460
obstacle to work with but I'm sure I can

17
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,929
figure this out getting the nail hot

18
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,460
it's nice and hot now it needs a couple

19
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:37,350
of seconds just to cool down

20
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,420
I got a carb cap Within Reach I got my

21
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,710
concentrate Within Reach this is going

22
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,679
to work out ladies and gentlemen I have

23
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,090
faith in this endeavor I feel like we're

24
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,439
at the right temperature ladies and

25
00:00:45,090 --> 00:01:09,750
gentleman dab with me and then we will

26
00:00:46,439 --> 00:01:11,400
do a podcast oh wow I am seriously lit

29
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,859

30
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,109

boom punch of lemons then there is a

42
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:13,800
sharp astringent cleaner flavor and it's

43
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,449
Pleasant it is not

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,270
bad at all it sounds like it may not be

45
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:21,060

of armpit like it's kind of gross and

51
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,740
deliciously disgusting but it's all

52
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:37,109
topped off with this wonderful lemon

53
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,350

got a great email asking about a

111
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:43,229
specific strain there is no reason to

112
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,569
waste time let's jump right into this

113
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,790
email so we can start a strain review

114
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,680
this email comes from our friend in

115
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,270
Toronto Canada I'm not sure if they want

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,170
their name said they know who they are

117
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:58,019
the message goes just like this hey Russ

118
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,540
- Jeff big up for all of the mad content

119
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:03,149
I just got authorization for 50 plants

120
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,280
for medical usage nice 50 plants for

121
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:07,409
medical use I miss those days

122
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,629
now goes on to say I just ordered some

123
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,490
of your hellfire oh gee I thought that

124
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:14,639
the parents would give a crazy contrast

125
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,870
so I ordered these beans I like that you

126
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,669
did some research and that you were

127
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,870
intrigued by the parents and then you

128
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,699
were excited to see what's gonna come

129
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,009
out of those you are the type of grower

130
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,659
that becomes a breeder in the future

131
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,060
that's the type of passion that leads to

132
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,740
breeding how the message goes on it says

133
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,449
if you could please give me a brief

134
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,610
description of the fee knows I may

135
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,750
expect and any other tips with growing

136
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,810
this strain it would be much appreciated

137
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,120
I'm spreading your name and love across

138
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,120
Toronto thanks for everything you do

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,340

140
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,019
it with their name big up big shout out

141
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,239
big respect to my new friend up there in

142
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,939
Toronto Canadia they asked for a brief

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,090
description of hellfire OG here is what

144
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,560
I call a brief description one thing I

145
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,869
should mention before I get too far into

146
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,879
this is I have been notified and I am

147
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,300
aware that there is another breeder who

148
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,459
is using the name Hellfire OG honestly I

149
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,610
think that breeder may have had it first

150
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,500
I apologize I [ __ ] up I guess I didn't

151
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,750
do my proper research and do my due

152
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,329
diligence as a breeder who releases

153
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,220
seeds for commercial purposes I [ __ ]

154
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:18,959
up that was my fault that's not cool I

155
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,090
should not have done that I let that

156
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,529
seed strain out a lot of people bought

157
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,879
it a lot of people grew it they posted

158
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,009
pictures of it they tagged it Hellfire

159
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,689
OG the other breeder went hey mother

160
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,180
[ __ ] that's my screen name and I went

161
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,370

162
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,410

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,418
because I am NOT going to make any more

164
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,669
I have gotten rid of the female plant

165
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,889
that I use I have discontinued that

166
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:41,399
cross I am not making any more of those

167
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,839
seeds

168
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,789
that I don't [ __ ] with that guy's other

169
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,589
product I don't want to change the name

170
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,410
of it that's rude that feels strange

171
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:51,689
that also feels shifty so it's a limited

172
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,460
batch what I made is made a lot of it is

173
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:55,439
already gone there are very few packs

174
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:58,349
left I've got very few 10 packs left

175
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,689
myself so it is discontinued if you've

176
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,310
got some [ __ ] hold on to it or grow

177
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,589
it if you want some get it quickly

178
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,990
because it will be gone very soon and I

179
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,369
will not make any more because I stole

180
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,110
somebody else's name and that's just

181
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,939
straight-up wrong so that is not going

182
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,889
to be made anymore I apologize if that

183
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,180
breeder hears this bro I know I did that

184
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:16,918
that wasn't on purpose

185
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,079
I [ __ ] up this is what I can do about

186
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,519
it I can stop making it so let me get

187
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,019
off of that so box and we'll move

188
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,109
forward and actually talk about the

189
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:27,959
strain itself why did I call it Hellfire

190
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,439
og because it is a cross of hell's og

191
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,750
and arise hell's og is also known as

192
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,949
biker cush hell's og is also known as

193
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,389
Hell's Angels og there's a long story of

194
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:42,210
dispensaries in Colorado having Hells

195
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:45,418
Angels og on the shelf and the actual

196
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:47,250
Hells Angels organization sent him a

197
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:49,620
letter from their lawyer requesting they

198
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,418
change the name so the Hells Angels og

199
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,209
was no longer called that it got called

200
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:56,759
either hell's og or biker cush so that

201
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:59,098
got spread around I acquired a clone of

202
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,439
the hell's og from a good friend I

203
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,569
decided that it was an awesome plant but

204
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,339
it could use some improvement that's why

205
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:07,860
I decided to breed with it it had many

206
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,839
great desirable traits also so does my

207
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,729
arise so it was kind of like a match

208
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,829
made in heaven as a plant breeder as a

209
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:15,750
seed maker I see things in certain

210
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:17,129
plants and I go oh if those plants right

211
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,379
they're bred together they would make

212
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,389
amazing offspring most of the time I'm

213
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,879
right I will admit that sometimes I'm

214
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,769
wrong as [ __ ] and we throw large

215
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,019
quantities of seeds away or we feed them

216
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:30,689
to the birds but most of the time I

217
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,370
strike gold with most of my intuition so

218
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:36,149
let's get my high ass back on track

219
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,060
Hellfire o G is a cross of hell's og to

220
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:41,309
my arise male who is known as King

221
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,989
Solomon when I name a cross I try to

222
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,639
honor the parents train or keep some of

223
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,889
the lineage in the name to make it sort

224
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,409
of obvious what the cross came from so

225
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:51,899
Hellfire was an obvious name for Hell's

226
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:53,730
OG to arise I also thought about calling

227
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,110
it the Phoenix but I think the Phoenix

228
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,300
has already taken

229
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,070
there's also a Steel Pulse song called

230
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,620
earth crisis and one of the lines he

231
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,420
just says he'll fire and that's part of

232
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,159
where it came from also yes I listened

233
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,019
to a lot of reggae music I named a lot

234
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,179
of my strains after Grateful Dead

235
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,589
after reggae type inspired sort of stuff

236
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:10,739
so that's where my mind is that's where

237
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,630
my

238
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,720
names are coming from and also of course

239
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:18,179
I like cartoons I've got the TMNT stuff

240
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,430
there also allegedly maybe some GI Joe

241
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,859
named stuff out there that's well that's

242
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:25,349
where my brain is and things like arise

243
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,000
and horizon those are just one word

244
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,528
positive names they look good on

245
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,389
packaging and sound nice and are

246
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:32,578
memorable and words that stick with you

247
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:34,949
and are uplifting words that's where my

248
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:37,379
name schemes come from so that's where

249
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:41,009
the name Hellfire OG comes from it's a

250
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:43,500
hell's OD female to my male arise also

251
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:45,870
known as King Solomon about a little

252
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,870
more info about the hell's og that is a

253
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:51,360
cross of OG Kush and Blackberry when I

254
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,750
grew that I thought it smelled like gas

255
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,089
and cushy I know that sounds very cliche

256
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,519
but it's hell's oh gee because it smells

257
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:01,620
like OG Kush it smells sweet cushy like

258
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,299
what cush is supposed to smell like it's

259
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,360
got some pine to it it's got some dirty

260
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:09,629
feet it's got a bunch of gas to it when

261
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,750
it grows it grows rocks the buds are

262
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:14,220
just straight dense hard rocks and it

263
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,799
makes a little pine cone type rocks

264
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,959
maybe some golf balls it is not a huge

265
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,629
yielder that was the problem in my

266
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,328
opinion with the hell's OG it put out

267
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:27,000
very high quality product but it put out

268
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:28,919
kind of stringy thin plants with not

269
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,750
huge buds and I wanted just a better

270
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,809
producer and I thought maybe I could

271
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,970
carry that aroma and that frost right

272
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,859
into the progeny and kind of increase

273
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,870
the productivity and the production of

274
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,120
that plant making a better plant for a

275
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,310
commercial environment and then here's a

276
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,379
little bit of info on the father which

277
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,539
was in a rise male I keep calling him

278
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,669
King Solomon if you listen to my podcast

279
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:52,919
a lot you know that King Solomon is used

280
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:55,409
in many of my crosses that isn't a rise

281
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,399
male that is a golden goat female

282
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:01,708
pollinated by a day breaker male

283
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,659
Daybreaker is chem D and Joseph og so

284
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:05,759
we've got chem dog and og cush in there

285
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,740
to give you that real funky aroma

286
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,250
I took the pollen from that plant I put

287
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,070
it on a goal

288
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,740
and NGO that created arise I selected a

289
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,690
very unique male out of that batch of

290
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,629
plants and I have named him King Solomon

291
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,480
I used that as my main stud breeding

292
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:23,850
male is a [ __ ] champion everything I

293
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,730
put pollen on from King Solomon turns

294
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,129
into gold it improves everything I breed

295
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,810
it to it fixes problems it increases

296
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:32,610
potency and vigor I think it is a

297
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:34,500
magical planet that's why I use it so

298
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,500
much so now let's talk a little bit more

299
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,389
about this Hellfire og cross like I

300
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,029
mentioned earlier I really enjoyed the

301
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,889
aromas and flavors and the buzz of the

302
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:46,110
Hells OG but it did not live up to

303
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:47,879
expectations and standards for a

304
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,129
commercial grow environment so my goal

305
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,740
was to increase the vigor and kind of

306
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:56,129
increase the harvest weight and yields

307
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:59,279
of the Hellfire OG I wanted to keep the

308
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:01,710
gas and dank and cush skunky tennis-ball

309
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,039
flavors and aromas in that cross and I

310
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:07,950
feel like I achieved that goal I get a

311
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:11,429
lot of the fresh tennis ball fresh tires

312
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:13,920
cushy gassy dirty feet sort of aromas

313
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:16,559
coming from many of the phenotypes some

314
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,750
of them have a sweet bubblegum

315
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,029
maybe juicy fruit gum or some kind of

316
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,070
sweet tropical candy flavor coming from

317
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:25,439
them on the back end after that cushy

318
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,170
smell and that's coming from the golden

319
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,300
goat side of the arise but since we've

320
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:32,819
got so many earthy and cushy flavors

321
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:35,490
most of them are very dominated by that

322
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,620
fuelie earthy kush fresh tennis ball

323
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,419
maybe some fresh sneakers kind of an

324
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,370
aroma there's a place in California

325
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:43,199
called the Norwalk indoor swap meet and

326
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,120
very few people have probably been there

327
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,820
that listen to this show but I think

328
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,950
sometimes some dank weed has a hint of

329
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,170
the smell of some of the shoes at the

330
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,540
Norwalk indoor swap meet allegedly

331
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:56,909
possibly some of those boots may have

332
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:59,069
some knockoff Air Jordans and they smell

333
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:01,110
really unique and that is sort of

334
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,420
sometimes what some of this cush smells

335
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,669
like I'll talk about specific phenotypes

336
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:07,559
and stuff like that in a moment but I

337
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:09,959
want to talk about the buzz that comes

338
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:13,079
from most of the phenotypes from the

339
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,680
Hellfire og I am a heavy smoker and I

340
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,509
like potent cannabis and potent extracts

341
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,669
most of the time I do smoke concentrates

342
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:21,840
but if I go to a concert if I go

343
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:23,339
somewhere I'll roll up a

344
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,960
couple of joints and take those with me

345
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,300
so I can enjoy them when I'm out doing

346
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,100
whatever I'm doing I also like to smoke

347
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,959
a joint of whatever I just bread if I

348
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,730
breed something new I grow a bunch of

349
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,769
those seeds and then I get to smoke it

350
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,360
first I like to get that first flavor

351
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:38,220
it's like my work I want to see what it

352
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,259
tastes like it's like being a chef I've

353
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,269
created this potential masterpiece or a

354
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,409
potential disaster so I've got to stick

355
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:45,389
my finger in there and see what it

356
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:46,919
tastes like so that I can assure that

357
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:49,289
I've got a quality product before I

358
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,079
serve it to the world so the first time

359
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:53,759
I drew out some Hellfire OG I grew it I

360
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,710
dried it I cured it trimmed it up

361
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,600
properly I rolled it up into a big fat

362
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,400
joint I laid it up and everybody went

363
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,750
damn that smells good that was the first

364
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,039
thing that people say when you light up

365
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,289
a joint of some good weed they go hot

366
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,699
smells good and I took a couple of puffs

367
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:07,049
off of it I passed it around the room

368
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,850
and it came back and I took a couple of

369
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:12,479
puffs off of it then I noticed I'm

370
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:15,029
[ __ ] up Hellfire og brings that OG

371
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,480
Kush potency that just punches you in

372
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:18,389
the face

373
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,149
and I call it time travel weed or tunnel

374
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:23,100
vision weed this is where the word faded

375
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:25,230
came from I think we used to hear people

376
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,180
say brah faded I think they might have

377
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,070
smoked some good og cush and they might

378
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,289
have possibly had somehow fire OG

379
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,330
because you just get faded your

380
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:35,429
peripheral vision is gone you just get

381
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,050
tunnel vision you can only focus on

382
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:40,079
what's right in front of you and you can

383
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:42,479
barely focus on that so I love that just

384
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,490
stoned tunnel vision just straight to

385
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,990
the face [ __ ] forgot where my keys

386
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,669
are and they're in my pocket I'm looking

387
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,500
for my sunglasses and I'm wearing them

388
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:51,659
still that's the kind of herb that I

389
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,539
love and the Hellfire OG brings that

390
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:56,669
punch to the face potency and I love

391
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:58,740
that and some herb that good dank flavor

392
00:14:56,669 --> 00:15:00,299
and that punch to the face that is what

393
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,019
I was looking for quite often when

394
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,069
people say recommend your cushiest

395
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:07,169
gaseous strain to me

396
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,420
the Hellfire and the liberation are the

397
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:12,360
two that I recommend for gas and dank

398
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,889
and cushy aromas so now we know how it

399
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,029
smells we know what it tastes like we

400
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:16,559
know that you're gonna get [ __ ] lint

401
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:19,049
when you smoke it now let's talk a

402
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,329
little bit about the growing aspects of

403
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:24,089
the Hellfire OG if we're gonna grow this

404
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:26,550
what should and could we expect from

405
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,970
this plan there are a couple of distinct

406
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:31,919
phenotypes most of them unfortunately

407
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:34,139
grow tall and they are quite stretchy

408
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,639
these plants will take off at the

409
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,830
beginning of flower just like any

410
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,049
oh gee cush they take off they tend to

411
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:42,090
get rather tall you can do some popping

412
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:43,949
and twisting and some lollipops and

413
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,930
maybe some trellis work and that will

414
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,509
prevent the stretch but they will

415
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:50,219
stretch I'm not one to push products on

416
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:52,620
my podcast but something that will help

417
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,590
you reduce the amount of stretch in the

418
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,289
first 21 days of your flowering process

419
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,180
is a product called decision from new

420
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:02,309
millennium nutrients it is a great

421
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,829
product it tells those plants quit

422
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:06,389
stretching start flowering use that when

423
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,480
you initiate flower and it will reduce

424
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:10,949
the stretch also if you do some popping

425
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,110
and twisting of the stems which I'm

426
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,550
going to do an episode on very soon when

427
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,200
you do that popping and twisting at the

428
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:17,759
start of flower the plants don't have

429
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,050
the energy to stretch because they're

430
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,789
trying to repair their cellular

431
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:23,490
structure that you just broke which is

432
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:25,289
fine we want to disrupt that structure

433
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,450
so that they build fatter thicker more

434
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:29,279
robust stems also they don't stretch as

435
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,020
much we slowdown that growth they get

436
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,100
thicker and they don't get taller which

437
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,480
is what we want so that's a way to

438
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,820
prevent that stretch with some of this

439
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,440
oh gee cush stuff these plants are going

440
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,780
to get tall on you so be prepared for

441
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,910
tall kind of lanky stretchy plants with

442
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,889
a little bit of stretchy internodal

443
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:46,049
spacing don't be worried if they look

444
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:49,039
stretchy that is just what these plants

445
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:51,899
do you may see a phenotype that gets

446
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,179
gigantic leaves if you've got a plant

447
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,370
with gigantic fan leaves that you could

448
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,359
have a nice shady spot underneath on a

449
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,269
hot sunny day

450
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,610
if those leaves are continuously droopy

451
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,440
it is not a problem with the plan the

452
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,539
plan is not thirsty the plant has not

453
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,970
had too much light that is a trait that

454
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,769
comes from the Daybreaker father so that

455
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,019
is actually the grandfather it's coming

456
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:14,879
from the day breaker don't worry don't

457
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:17,039
stress if you've got big fat purple

458
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,990
leaves that are droopy that is just a

459
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,269
trait that comes with this plant don't

460
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:23,370
be paranoid and generally that happens

461
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:25,470
with the darker green phenotypes almost

462
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,969
a purple leaf you'll notice the darker

463
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,860
colored leaves make it a little bit

464
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,450
droopy err on you this one is fun to

465
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:32,039
grow because it does turn a lot of great

466
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,080
colors that'll get dark green it'll get

467
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,549
purple on you you may see some oranges

468
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,289
in it you may see some like tints of

469
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:39,210
yellow toward the end it's kind of neat

470
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,909
watching this one change colors now the

471
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,250
main phenotypes that you will see are

472
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,500
what I call the golf-ball phenotype and

473
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,349
that is very representative of almost

474
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,589
any oh gee cush family plant you're

475
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:51,329
getting

476
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:54,629
a lot of OG cush in there you're seeing

477
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:56,009
big fat golf balls just fist size golf

478
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,620
balls up here stems

479
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:01,048
it doesn't make long fat colas but every

480
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,089
one of those golf balls is just covered

481
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:05,009
in frosty trichome so you're gonna get

482
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:07,259
the golf ball phenotype and then you're

483
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:10,019
going to get the more desirable one the

484
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:12,058
big Cola phenotype and you will know the

485
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:13,829
difference about four or five weeks into

486
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,869
Flowery ago yep those are golf balls and

487
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:17,460
that's a [ __ ] monster Cola you will

488
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:19,649
be able to tell the difference now

489
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,230
here's what happens with most cannabis

490
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,778
when you grow the golf ball phenotype it

491
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,028
is going to be covered in trichomes and

492
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:29,429
it's going to taste amazing the other

493
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:31,019
one doesn't have as much frost but it

494
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:32,820
tastes just as good so you've got to

495
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,220
make the decision between do I want this

496
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:37,918
super [ __ ] frosty plant or do I want

497
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,450
more like that is then when it comes to

498
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,679
being a connoisseur grower sometimes

499
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,450
that's a hard decision to make

500
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,519
if you're drawing for personal use you

501
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,960
probably want that golf ball phenotype

502
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:47,730
if you're trying to take this to a

503
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,590
production facility if you're a cash

504
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,839
crop er if you're looking to profit in

505
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:53,009
any way you probably want that big fat

506
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,349
Cola phenotype

507
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:57,269
they're both going to have beautiful bag

508
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:59,158
appeal the only person who is going to

509
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:01,379
notice a difference on the other end is

510
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:02,970
the grower the person trying to pay the

511
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,830
bills one is going to give you quite a

512
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,500
bit more product than the other and it

513
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:09,148
will be very obvious now sometimes I do

514
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,220
see a phenotype that is a little bit

515
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,989
squatty ER and a little bit pointy er

516
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,220
and that may sound strange but when you

517
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,859
see them lined up you'll go

518
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,288
that's the squatty pointy one that short

519
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:21,898
squatty your phenotype in my opinion is

520
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:24,298
expressing a lot of golden goat traits I

521
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:26,308
feel like it is showing a lot of Romulan

522
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:28,769
traits that one finishes a little bit

523
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:31,829
earlier most of the phenotypes are going

524
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:35,038
to finish around 70 days this romulan

525
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:39,148
dominant phenotype will finish closer to

526
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:42,269
60 days however it lacks that dank cushy

527
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:44,729
funk it is more like a sweet golden goat

528
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:47,009
cush sort of a cross it is not the most

529
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,419
desirable sought-after phenotype but

530
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:49,710
here is something I want to mention that

531
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,179
I've been thinking about when it comes

532
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,308
to talking about phenotypes and

533
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:56,610
identifying phenotypes for my people who

534
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:59,519
are buying my seeds I don't want you to

535
00:19:56,609 --> 00:20:02,428
see the phenotypes that I like I want

536
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,480
you to seek the phenotypes which you

537
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:06,028
like find the fee

538
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,710
type that grows best in your garden find

539
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:10,349
the phenotype that does best for your

540
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,389
medical or recreational needs find the

541
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:15,178
phenotype that does best for your cash

542
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:18,479
crop needs find the one that suits your

543
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,038
desires I prefer the one that is kind of

544
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,019
stretchy the one that makes the golf

545
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:24,298
ball buds that smell like dirty feet and

546
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:26,069
armpits that's the one I would go for if

547
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:27,750
you're running a cash crop you're gonna

548
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:29,009
tell me to go [ __ ] myself with that one

549
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,808
because you're not going to make any

550
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:32,908
profit that is the connoisseur head

551
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:35,940
stash plant you want the other one that

552
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:38,490
makes the big gigantic buds oftentimes I

553
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,288
noticed the girls really prefer the

554
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,028
phenotype that is a little bit sweeter

555
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:43,679
and golden goat dominant and I'm not

556
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:45,839
being sexist towards the women that is

557
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,269
what I've noticed if I put out multiple

558
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,730
jars and I say take your pick the ladies

559
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:52,740
will tend to pick the sweeter smelling

560
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,480
product most of the time as just my

561
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,009
observation from paying attention to

562
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,200
offering product to different people

563
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:01,259
that golden goat dominant phenotype is

564
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,600
more desirable for the ladies so when it

565
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,849
comes to picking your phenotypes take my

566
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,558
advice on what you can expect heed my

567
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,058
words on what is coming from those

568
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,190
packages and how you can adjust your

569
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:12,898
grow to that sort of thing but don't

570
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,580
seek a phenotype based on my

571
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:16,138
descriptions get what you want

572
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,609
that's like me trying to say bro you

573
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:19,229
really want to go to this restaurant and

574
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,898
get this meal it's going to be perfect

575
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,639
I'm a vegetarian you might be a steak

576
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:24,928
eater if I send you to my favorite

577
00:21:23,638 --> 00:21:26,699
restaurant you're gonna leave pissed off

578
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:28,409
and hungry and I'm gonna do the same at

579
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,509
your favorite restaurant so find that

580
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:32,070
phenotype it works best for you let me

581
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:33,960
get my high ass back on track here and

582
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:36,298
talk about Hellfire OG a little bit more

583
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,149
something you can count on with all

584
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:41,129
phenotypes of Hellfire OG is that they

585
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:42,989
are going to want more cal-mag

586
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,260
and I know that sounds funny that sounds

587
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,028
like a joke most of the OG Kush

588
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:50,879
varietals are going to be happier with

589
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:54,808
more cal-mag they want more cow mac give

590
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,510
them more also this one may go nutrient

591
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:58,980
deficient on you late in Flour if you

592
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:01,500
don't feed it properly

593
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,450
so I'm not saying to overdose it early

594
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,788
I'm saying to keep a good eye on it

595
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,380
instead of tapering off your nutrients

596
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:09,450
toward the end of flour you may need to

597
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,950
ride them out an extra week and make

598
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,830
sure this plant does not run out of

599
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,419
energy now I say this about many of the

600
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:17,490
strains that I breed because King

601
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:20,580
Solomon makes tall plants

602
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:24,000
I extra mean it with this one you will

603
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:26,759
need multiple layers of supports when

604
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,059
you're growing Hellfire og this is a

605
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:31,890
tall lanky skinny plant it's going to

606
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,579
need some supports if you grow it

607
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,160
properly

608
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:37,769
hopefully you need two maybe three or

609
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,570
four layers of trellis net I would

610
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:41,970
spread it out really far with that first

611
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:43,799
net spread it really far and wide and

612
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,049
then let it grow up into that second net

613
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,700
then flip it into flower and put up a

614
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:50,129
third net because it is going to grow

615
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,670
into that third layer of trellis be

616
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,830
prepared for tall stretchy plants

617
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:57,750
Hellfire og is probably not a plant I

618
00:22:55,829 --> 00:23:00,509
would recommend for beginner growers if

619
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:03,210
you have never grown an OG Kush or chem

620
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:05,430
dog type varietal you may want some

621
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:09,329
practice with something a little less

622
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:11,640
finicky than the Hellfire OG the og cush

623
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:13,169
genetics in this plant give you a little

624
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,430
bit of a challenge when it comes to

625
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,620
growing there are a lot of things to

626
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,080
look out for sometimes they don't want

627
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:21,479
as much water as other plants sometimes

628
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:23,639
they need a lower pH than your other

629
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,069
plants and like I said a moment ago

630
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,380
Hellfire og is certainly going to want

631
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:30,899
more cal-mag than most of your other

632
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,980
plants and I think those things are true

633
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,500
for most

634
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,420
oh gee cush type varietals you're gonna

635
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,019
find those things true with almost

636
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,670
anything

637
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:40,799
oh gee and if you haven't grown OG

638
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,180
before it is a special experience it

639
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,549
doesn't grow like most of your other

640
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,799
cannabis they don't want as much water

641
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:49,079
they get a little bit stretchy they take

642
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,450
a lot more work but they are very

643
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,210
rewarding there was a time period here

644
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:56,400
in Colorado when all you could find was

645
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,440
some type of cush now I've talked about

646
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,030
this on the show before unfortunately

647
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,940
during that time period people were just

648
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:05,970
slapping the words OG and cush on every

649
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,100
strain in the dispensary you went to the

650
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,140
dispensary on Friday before a cush got

651
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:11,609
super popular and they had 12 different

652
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,460
strains that none of them had the words

653
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:16,439
OG or cush in them over the weekend cush

654
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,840
got popular you went back on Monday and

655
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,670
now they had 12 different cushions how

656
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,649
the [ __ ] did that happen I think they

657
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,480
just relabeled everything so that does

658
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,490
happen unfortunately in this industry

659
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,950
let me get back on track again because

660
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,410
this lysergic lemon concentrate has got

661
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,480
me [ __ ] rambly my point is that

662
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,130
Coosh type cultivars are very

663
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,890
challenging to grow but they are very

664
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,930
very rewarding I tried to take some of

665
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,700
the challenge out of the hell's og by

666
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,039
breeding it to the arize but

667
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,049
unfortunately it kept that challenge but

668
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,690
I think it is worth the struggle because

669
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:51,329
the final product is very rewarding the

670
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,700
aromas the flavors the kick to the face

671
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:55,649
type of a buzz I think it is all very

672
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,690
much worth the extra work you have to

673
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,790
put in when you're growing some OG Kush

674
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,590
now when I say this part it sounds like

675
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:04,440
I'm just bragging and making [ __ ] up I

676
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:06,869
would highly recommend extra carbon

677
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,590
filters when you're growing Hellfire OG

678
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:12,599
this is very skunky very stanky very few

679
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:14,299
ly if you're growing in an area where

680
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,129
growing is not welcomed and accepted

681
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:19,769
somebody is going to smell your Hellfire

682
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:22,470
OG and they may talk about it because it

683
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:24,720
is stanky it is potent it will make your

684
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,430
eyes burn when I trim it I'm not sure if

685
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,870
it's making me tear up with pride or if

686
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,940
it's making my eyes burn because it's so

687
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:32,729
stanky but it definitely does something

688
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,160
to my face while I'm trimming it is also

689
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,960
a finicky plant you have to keep your

690
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,390
cal-mag dialed in you have to keep your

691
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,430
vapor pressure deficit proper these

692
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,680
plants don't want a dry environment they

693
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:46,380
want a little bit of a damp environment

694
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,539
don't let them get dry in the air but do

695
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,640
let them get dry in the pots they do not

696
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,670
like to be over watered you will not

697
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,590
kill an OG Kush varietal by under

698
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,289
watering it you are much more likely to

699
00:25:55,589 --> 00:26:00,179
kill an OG Kush plant by over watering

700
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:03,750
so keep that in mind when it comes to

701
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:06,840
cush type varietals the hellfire OG also

702
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:10,410
tends to like lower pH and she also

703
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:12,059
really enjoys kelp type products I think

704
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,279
the kelp really brings out the aromas

705
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:16,710
and the stinky feet flavors from the

706
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,049
Hellfire og that will also help you

707
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,900
lower the pH of your nutrient solution

708
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:23,909
so that works out very well I often talk

709
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,070
about defoliating in a commercial grow

710
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,880
and also in a small-scale personal grow

711
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:30,359
environment

712
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,850
I do not defoliate the Hellfire og as

713
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:35,429
heavily I do remove some of those

714
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:37,469
amazingly large leaves but I don't take

715
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,660
off a lot of leaf because she does not

716
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,180
respond well to excessive defoliation

717
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:44,610
this is one of the rare exceptions in my

718
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,360
lineup where I will say do not defoliate

719
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:47,669
her

720
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,740
- heavily it will piss her off she makes

721
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,259
those gigantic leaves so you don't have

722
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,089
a lot of opportunity for defoliation if

723
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:55,829
it's bigger than my hand I tend to pull

724
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:57,720
it off if it's not much bigger than that

725
00:26:55,829 --> 00:27:00,149
I like to leave it there and just let it

726
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,220
grow toward the end of the flowering

727
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:05,100
phase these plants will turn some

728
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,990
amazing dark colors you'll get blacks

729
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:09,419
you'll get purples you may see some

730
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,400
Silver's I've seen some red and yellows

731
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,558
on the leaves before the colors that

732
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,179
come from these plants are very

733
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,798
beautiful so if you're a photographer

734
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,929
you'll get those cliche bug shot

735
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,639
pictures around weeks five six and seven

736
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:22,200
but around weeks eight and nine when you

737
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,210
start flushing and then into week ten

738
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,000
you will have some amazing photo

739
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,548
opportunities with some amazing colors I

740
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,279
have also noticed that Hellfire OG

741
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:34,769
appreciates lower temperatures toward

742
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,480
the end of flower don't go to extreme

743
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:37,980
because you will have big fat buds you

744
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,509
don't want to risk getting powdery

745
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,099
mildew but if you can drop your

746
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:42,929
temperatures slowly toward the end of

747
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,449
flower and get kind of cold at the end

748
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:47,040
of flower maybe even reduce the lights

749
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,740
toward the end of the flowering cycle

750
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,619
also helps speed up and create some

751
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,210
density in the Hellfire OG I think I

752
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:56,399
mentioned before that most phenotypes

753
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,470
will take nine to ten weeks there are a

754
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,809
couple of outliers that do take closer

755
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,900
to eight weeks in my opinion those are

756
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:06,089
the non desirable phenotypes again you

757
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,640
can reduce that flowering time if you

758
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:11,069
reduce the amount of light hours during

759
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,350
the flush cycle instead of running 12 12

760
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:15,808
or 11 13 maybe drop it down to 10 hours

761
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:17,308
of light then a couple of days later put

762
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:19,319
it down to 8 hours of light and then

763
00:28:17,308 --> 00:28:21,539
harvest after that there are tricks you

764
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,519
can do to speed up the end cycle also

765
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:25,589
add a little bit of density I don't

766
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,629
recommend that 24 or 48 hours of

767
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:29,730
darkness that's not something I do but

768
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,770
you can reduce the overall amount of

769
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,630
darkness that that plant gets every day

770
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:35,400
that will help speed it up also I'm sure

771
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,929
you've heard me talk about increasing

772
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,610
the light toward the end of the

773
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:40,200
flowering cycle to kind of make your

774
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:42,269
plants beef up that is something I

775
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,740
recommend for more advanced growers who

776
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:45,269
know what to look for and can pay

777
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,339
attention to their plants so that if

778
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:49,319
they do experience any problems they can

779
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:50,939
cut down right away and not have any

780
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,678
terrible outcomes but that is

781
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,590
experimentation and that is for you to

782
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,090
decide do you want to run 12 12 or 1113

783
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:58,079
all the way through flush all the way to

784
00:28:57,089 --> 00:28:59,369
the end

785
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,500
a commercial grow and you've got

786
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,909
multiple tables and multiple cycles in

787
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,529
one room that's what you're gonna do

788
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,810
you've got to go 12 12 all the way

789
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:08,039
through if you've got the opportunity

790
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:09,750
maybe you'll cut it down to ten hours of

791
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:11,579
daylight and have 14 hours of darkness

792
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,200
for a couple of days maybe you'll kick

793
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:14,879
it down to eight hours of daylight and

794
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,830
they'll have sixteen hours of darkness

795
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,430
just for the last couple of days or

796
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:22,109
maybe for the last week to ten days you

797
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,910
can turn your timer back on to eighteen

798
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:25,789
six and try to add on a little bit of

799
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,170
bulk there at the end those are all

800
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:30,180
experiments that you have to do in your

801
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:32,850
own garden to dial in your grow style

802
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,380
your phenotype and your goals but those

803
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,829
are options that are always there to

804
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,780
play with

805
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:38,879
holy-shit ladies and gentlemen boys and

806
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:41,039
girls I feel like I got on a good ramble

807
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,470
for this podcast I hope we learned a lot

808
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,259
about Hellfire OG like I said before I

809
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,769
will not be making anymore Hellfire og

810
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:49,319
seeds

811
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:51,180
so what armaid armaid i've only got a

812
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,279
