00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,620
very influential in my cannabis career

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,410
my cannabis development and heavily

26
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:03,390
influential in my cannabis photography

27
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:05,368
if you look at his photography then you

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,250
look at the evolution of my photography

29
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:10,709
you can for sure see subbies influence

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,299
in my work sub cool did a lot of things

31
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,789
for our community another thing he was

32
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,070
very well known for was his super soil

33
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,530
sub cool has a great super soil recipe

34
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,889
online that many people based their

35
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,629
super soil recipes off of to this day

36
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,909
sub cool also did what was known as the

37
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:29,310
school of dank where he would do a large

38
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,500
seminar type class where a lot of people

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,329
would fly from around the world and sub

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,640
cool would teach a multiple day class

41
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:38,008
and then most of the time the proceeds

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,780
from those classes were donated to a

43
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,299
charity many times it was to autism

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,340
awareness and to raise funds for kids

45
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,259
with autism so sub cool did a lot of

46
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,420
great things not just for the cannabis

47
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,060
community but for his regular community

48
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,879
and the people around him obviously and

49
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,609
unfortunately sub cool has left the

50
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,228
building sub cool is no longer with us

51
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:00,599
sub cool had been battling a condition

52
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,069
known as alpha 1 for quite a while if

53
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,868
you follow him online you know that he's

54
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,809
been getting injections and medicine for

55
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,128
quite a while to treat this condition

56
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,868
unfortunately his body finally gave out

57
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,209
and he did not wake up this morning so

58
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:14,389
he went peacefully in his sleep so

59
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,250
hopefully that was quick and

60
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:17,959
I'm [ __ ] heart broken but subby

61
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,939
wouldn't want me to sit here and cry

62
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,129
about it sub e would want me to smoke a

63
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:24,169
fat joint sub cool would want me to

64
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:25,340
sprout some seeds and then sub cool

65
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:27,349
would want me to get back to business

66
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,689
teaching you how to grow top-shelf

67
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:31,879
cannabis so I'm gonna press pause for a

68
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:34,039
moment gonna blow my nose I'm gonna take

69
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,840
about forty seven fat dabs and then when

70
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,719
I get back I promise to deliver a

71
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,500
top-shelf podcast dedicated to my buddy

72
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,330

73
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,370
all right I'm back through the magic of

74
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,230
editing here I am already that was quick

75
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,360
I took a lot of fat dabs feel a lot

76
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:50,090
better you know I wasn't going to do a

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,410
full episode on sub cool I had some

78
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,659
other stuff I was gonna talk about here

79
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:55,669
is gonna do a regular show but while I

80
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:56,930
was taking my dad's and was just

81
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:58,399
chilling and thinking about subby and I

82
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,469
was like we should give the dude a full

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,750
show why not so this is going to be a

84
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:05,449
brief episode fully dedicated to sub

85
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,710
cool or sitting here dad and I'm trying

86
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:08,389
to catch my breath no I just didn't want

87
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,040
any of these thoughts to escape my head

88
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:13,039
so I just wanted to hit record and get

89
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:16,039
talking but I remember chilling out way

90
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,560
back in the day growing sub cool strains

91
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:20,479
and sitting on the couch watching sub

92
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,659
cools weed nerd videos while I was

93
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,939
trimming sub cool strains so I've been

94
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,979
following sub E for quite a while I was

95
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,389
watching the weed nerd shows before they

96
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:31,399
were the weed nerd he had a bunch of

97
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,109
just random sub cool videos that he

98
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,539
would put out and I remember watching

99
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,080
all of those way before he was the weed

100
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:39,289
nerd

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,170
I think some of the very first seeds I

102
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:44,719
purchased from the atitude seed bank my

103
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:46,909
first order had sub cool seeds in that

104
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,949
order they were TGA sub cool seeds I

105
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:50,810
remember ordering them so I've been

106
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:52,639
following sub cool for quite a while and

107
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,140
I've learned a lot from the guy one

108
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,229
thing I will address before we get too

109
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:59,988
far as yeah the dude had some quirks he

110
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:03,018
did some weird [ __ ] but we all have our

111
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:05,330
own quirks and we all do weird [ __ ] I'm

112
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,769
going to excuse that for this episode

113
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,390
because I've got nothing but love and

114
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,159
respect for the guy and this is a

115
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:11,419
tribute to him so if you're gonna say

116
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,549
something negative about him in the

117
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,319
comments or out loud or something to

118
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,879
shut the [ __ ] up right now cuz I've got

119
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,500
his back so I'm gonna keep moving

120
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,988
forward with my tribute to my bro I just

121
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,418
had to address that sub cool is a

122
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:26,629
teacher bro he taught me so much and you

123
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:27,949
can see it in my gross style I used to

124
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:30,560
run seven gallon pot

125
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,389
with tomato cages I used to top him I

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,189
used to branch him out real wide I used

127
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,289
to cram too many into a room I used to

128
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:38,209
get the light too close to him my rooms

129
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,160
looked just like sub cool came in there

130
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:42,560
and built my rooms you could see my

131
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,270
evolution of my growing I was doing a

132
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,769
whole bunch of one gallon pots and

133
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:47,180
trying to pack the room and then I

134
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,620
started watching sub cool and he was

135
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,240
like why don't you top him spread him

136
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,730
out a little bit put him in tomato cages

137
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,110
get a little bit bigger of a plant start

138
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,340
growing it this way he was showing me

139
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,840
that he was pulling this much weight

140
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:58,879
from each plant and I was like well [ __ ]

141
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,139
I'm running the same genetics why don't

142
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,000
I do it that way and it started working

143
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,189
really well I got better at growing

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,829
through watching a lot of sub cool stuff

145
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:08,389
and then if I or anybody else ever had a

146
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:09,859
question about something he said on the

147
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:11,659
weed nerd show you could just send him a

148
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,069
message and he would answer you he would

149
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,110
answer you directly you'd say Oh bro

150
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:17,029
this is what's going on then he would

151
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,009
ask you questions that means when he's

152
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:20,809
asking questions he actually cares he's

153
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:22,699
engaging he wants more info so that he

154
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,980
can answer you again appropriately and

155
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,050
get your garden going so sub cool was a

156
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,780
great resource he was a valuable asset

157
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,270
to a new grower he was a valuable asset

158
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:34,429
to an educated grower he knew a lot of

159
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:36,680
[ __ ] he knew a lot of ins and outs of

160
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,750
the industry he made some predictions to

161
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,540
me in conversations about the industry

162
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,360
about people and that [ __ ] always came

163
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,430
true another thing I need to give sub

164
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,400
cool some credit for is a lot of the

165
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,129
development of my cannabis photography

166
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,889
he inspired me and educated me a lot on

167
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:56,839
my cannabis photography the way I frame

168
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:59,060
a shot the way I outline a shot the way

169
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,389
I background a shot the way I set up a

170
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,269
shot is very inspired by sub cool sub

171
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,610
cool put out a couple of books sub cools

172
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:10,370
the science of dank had a lot of great

173
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,400
photography and that photography really

174
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,170
improved my photography it inspired me

175
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,479
so much that I wanted to do things

176
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,090
differently and I started taking better

177
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,220
photos that leads me into another thing

178
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:24,349
that I really want a shout sub cool out

179
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,410
for sub e was one of the first people I

180
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:30,379
saw taking and sharing photos of male

181
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,900
plants he was posting photos of one of

182
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:35,569
his legendary studs that he called the

183
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:38,479
space dude he was posting those photos a

184
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:41,480
long time ago in forums the space dude

185
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,610
is featured in a book there are some

186
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,259
any beautiful pictures of the male

187
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,480
flowers we don't see enough of that and

188
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:49,819
sub took some great great shots of his

189
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,950
male plants and shared those he told a

190
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,230
lot of great stories about how he found

191
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:56,750
his male plant and then he used the [ __ ]

192
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,790
out of that male plant you may see some

193
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,189
similarities here I did find a stud male

194
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,920
and of course I used the [ __ ] out of him

195
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:06,170
he became just as popular as some of my

196
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,580
females so for some of you it sounds

197
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,009
like I'm just kissing the soil guys ass

198
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:12,439
but he was honestly very important and

199
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:15,170
very influential in my development I

200
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:17,149
region etics would not exist if sub cool

201
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,620
did not pave the way and kind of teach

202
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:20,120
me how to do this there are a lot of

203
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,340
other breeders and growers and

204
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,920
influential people along that path but

205
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,409
sub cool was a very big part of my

206
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,240
education and my development he was

207
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,950
doing the weed nerd show he kind of

208
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,569
taught us how to go online and do this

209
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:35,449
sort of thing he was doing it before a

210
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:37,639
lot of us so sub cool did inspire me and

211
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:39,680
kind of teach me how to do it in a way

212
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,110
he's got a few years on me he got

213
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,300
started before me he definitely had a

214
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,460
great torch to pass and I'm proud to

215
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,410
have grabbed one of the torches that sub

216
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:50,479
cool is passing out to keep carrying

217
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,060
because he taught a lot of people sub

218
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,280
cool did a lot of time for cannabis sub

219
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,889
cool has been arrested and served a lot

220
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,419
of his life in jail because of this

221
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:02,060
cannabis plant we got to give a big

222
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,550
shout out to miss Jill while subby was

223
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,829
serving time miss Jill was finding

224
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,449
cannabis books and in jail you can't

225
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:10,189
have books that have the word weed or

226
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:12,079
cannabis or reefer in it right and you

227
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:14,689
definitely can't have books to teach you

228
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,089
how to grow cannabis in jail so miss

229
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:19,339
Jill was finding cannabis grow books and

230
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:21,409
rewriting them and taking out the word

231
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:23,479
cannabis and putting tomatoes or

232
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,580
blueberries in there so that sub was

233
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,350
able to read these books while he was in

234
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:29,329
jail and keep up on his cannabis

235
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,310
education so we got to give a big

236
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:34,069
shout-out to miss Jill also she was a

237
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,529
huge part of TGA she is actually now the

238
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,930
owner of TGA it's a big shout out to

239
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:41,329
Jill I do know that sub and Jill had a

240
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,918
rocky relationship that was very public

241
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm not putting any information out

242
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,639
there that's private but I do know they

243
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,620
resolved their [ __ ] before sub you was

244
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,059
gone and I know that she was a huge part

245
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,649
of the team and she took great care of

246
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:53,479
sub and Jill takes great care of

247
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:54,659
everybody around her so I want to send

248
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,820
her a big shout out also

249
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,039
since we're talking about TGA and the

250
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,680
green Avenger family and sub cool

251
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,469
history because Jill is a major part of

252
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,299
that Jill actually bred the Jilly bean

253
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,490
so when you talk about Jilly bean coming

254
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:11,069
from sub cool and TGA that was one of

255
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,570
Miss Jill's creations she's still

256
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,030
killing it so make sure you guys support

257
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,530
TGA and Miss Jill still but I wanted to

258
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:18,419
make sure to send her some love

259
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:20,309
she took care of sub II she helped out

260
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:23,519
sub you while he was in jail she was a

261
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,750
great partner in crime for sub cool I've

262
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,490
been going for almost ten minutes

263
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,779
talking about my buddy sub E I'm going

264
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,789
to wrap up this tribute here very

265
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:32,970
quickly but let's talk about some of the

266
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:34,559
strains that sub cool is very known for

267
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,930
breeding you guys if you have ever

268
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,179
smoked Jack the Ripper that is a sub

269
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:41,309
cool strain if you've ever smoked space

270
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,569
clean that was a sub cool and miss Jill

271
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:44,489
strain that could have been miss Jill

272
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,270
but I'm sure sub and miss Jill worked on

273
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,370
that one together

274
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:49,500
if you've ever smoked the vortex that

275
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,690
was from sub cool a lot of that old

276
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,580
stuff back in the day was coming from

277
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:57,060
sub cool and you didn't even know it

278
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,280
back around 2010 there was a dispensary

279
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:02,759
in Denver called the clinic and they

280
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,860
carried some vortex batter it was bred

281
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,870
by sub cool and grown by somebody there

282
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,700
in Denver and extracted by a local guy

283
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,179
in Denver and it was available on the

284
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,740
shelf at the clinic that vortex

285
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:16,079
concentrate was one of my favorite

286
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,419
concentrates ever that place is a

287
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,460
hundred and thirty miles from my house I

288
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:22,589
would drive up there as soon as I saw

289
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,810
that [ __ ] come up on weed Maps I would

290
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,269
drive up there and buy as much as they

291
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,579
would sell me then they started making

292
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:31,289
limits so I had to take friends with me

293
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,900
so they could buy as much as they would

294
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:36,240
sell them also I used to love that

295
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,039
vortex concentrate it would give me the

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,779
dad sweats it would make me shake a

297
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,819
little bit it would give me a little bit

298
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,620
of paranoia I'd be looking for my

299
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,570
sunglasses while I was [ __ ] wearing

300
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,149
them I tried to find my keys while they

301
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,070
were in my hand it was amazing I love

302
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,289
that sort of high so I missed that

303
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,270
vortex concentrate but that's the kind

304
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:57,029
of stuff that sub-cooled bred mostly

305
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:58,889
sativa dominant kind of high THC a lot

306
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:01,079
of real candy flavored sort of stuff but

307
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:05,250
he did a lot of great breeding and I

308
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:07,889
used many of his creations in my work I

309
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,559
actually used his plush berry in my

310
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:12,129
black

311
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,889
um I also used his space clean in one of

312
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:17,379
my crosses I used a female space queen I

313
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:19,240
reversed a grateful dog plant and I made

314
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:21,009
what I called space [ __ ] it was space

315
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,500
Queen to grateful dog and it was

316
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:26,350
feminized I found a sweet female out of

317
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,500
there and I pollinated that with my

318
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,269
arise male and I called that creation

319
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,339
space force and that is still available

320
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:35,949
today there are only a few packs left

321
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:38,320
but space force is one of my crosses

322
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,140
that came from one of sub cools

323
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,730
creations so you guys I just wanted to

324
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:44,710
take a minute actually I guess I wanted

325
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,539
to take 12 minutes and I wanted to kind

326
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,450
of pay tribute to somebody who really

327
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:51,278
helped me develop as a cannabis grower
