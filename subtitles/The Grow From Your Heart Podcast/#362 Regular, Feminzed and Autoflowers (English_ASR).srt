seed dot store I like to start these

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,379
shows off by letting you know what I'm

10
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:25,049
smoking today I've been taking dad's of

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:27,570
orange skittles ambrosia from apothecary

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,039
farms I really like this as my morning

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,629
smoke I'm recording earlier in the

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,460
morning than I usually do and this

15
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,589
orange skittles has that orange juice

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,780
orange candy sort of a taste it's also

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,090
got my head going pretty quickly so it's

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,340
a great way to start the day I'm smoking

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,260
the orange skittles Fambrough Jie from

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,880
apothecary farms the only difference

21
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,280
between the ambrosia and the Fambrough

22
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,960
Jie is the ambrosia is a 1 gram jar when

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,550
they put it in the 4 gram jar that's

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
when they call it the fam brochure

25
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,390
that's for the fam so the orange

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,480
skittles Fambrough Jie the potency says

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:02,310
seventy three point seven percent THC

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:03,659
zero CBD total cannabinoids 84.6% it's a

29
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,129
great way to start the day it's got an

30
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:07,228
uplifting head high it's got that

31
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,850
amazing orange candy flavor to it and

32
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:10,590
it's got me nice and talkative and

33
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:13,319
energized so this should be a good

34
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,840
podcast this is going to be another grow

35
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,389
lesson in the last lesson I talked about

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,950
clones versus seeds now in this episode

37
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,680
we're gonna talk about regular seeds

38
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,960
feminized seeds and auto flower seeds

39
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,520
before we get into the seed talk I want

40
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,500

all right podcast world this episode is

57
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,649
going to be about regular seed feminized

58
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,899
seed and Otto flower seed and deciding

59
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,060
what will be best for you and your new

60
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,370
garden a lot of people out there will

61
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,870
have an opinion about feminized seeds

62
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,030
a lot of people out there will have an

63
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,250
opinion about Auto flower seeds

64
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,709
don't let anybody stop you from growing

65
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,139
what makes you happy there's a reason

66
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,060
why regular seeds exist there's a reason

67
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,818
why feminized seeds exist there is a

68
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,430
reason why auto flower seeds exists

69
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,560
there are applications for all of those

70
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,540
types of seeds do what you love and

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,209
don't let anybody out there stop you

72
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,519
from growing from your heart when we are

73
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,769
shopping for seeds we are thrown a lot

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,310
of information some of it is very useful

75
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,989
some of it is just fluff for advertising

76
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,789
somewhere in that information we should

77
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,789
be able to tell if the seeds we are

78
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:56,400
shopping for are regular feminized or

79
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,858
autoflowering that should be clearly

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,840
noted somewhere in the description if I

81
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:03,239
don't see any sort of notation I

82
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,039
generally assume they are regular seeds

83
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,079
and that's a really good place to start

84
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,030
what do I mean by regular seed by

85
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:11,129
regular seed I mean they were produced

86
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,709
conventionally they were made with a

87
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:15,929
male plant and a female plant so in that

88
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,810
package of seeds you will find males and

89
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,939
females they are also not auto flour

90
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,280
which means they are photoperiod

91
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:26,129
now let's talk briefly about photo

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,620
period photo period means that a plant

93
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:32,370
is triggered into its flowering stage by

94
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,009
a light cycle in nature this light cycle

95
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,280
is mostly dictated by your location in

96
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:40,409
relation to the equator are you right on

97
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,729
the equator are you far north or are you

98
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:44,219
far south of the Equator

99
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,798
now as the seasons change as fall rolls

100
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:49,650
around regions on the equator will start

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,199
experiencing longer nights and shorter

102
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,019
days those longer nights and shorter

103
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,639
days tell our plant hey winter is coming

104
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,560
you need to start producing your flowers

105
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,239
so that you can reproduce before the end

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,310
of the season and that triggers the

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,099
plant to go into flowering that is its

108
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,009
photo period indoors most cannabis

109
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:10,948
plants require about a 12 hour dark

110
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:12,479
period to induce flower outdoors can be

111
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,010
different because the Sun puts off

112
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,840
different spectrums they trigger the

113
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:17,370
plants to go to sleep as the Sun sets it

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,598
puts off a red spectrum that tells that

115
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,548
plant hey it's a nighttime and then it

116
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:22,079
starts going to sleep as the Sun rises

117
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,668
it puts off a blue spectrum that tells

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,218
the plant it's time to wake up so you

119
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:27,959
don't need the 1212 outdoors you can

120
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:30,000
work closer to a 14

121
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,129
or day and more of a 10-hour night

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,019
outdoors because the Sun tells the

123
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:36,029
plants to go to sleep but that is photo

124
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,008
period the plants work off the light

125
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:39,750
cycle and the light cycle works with

126
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,150
nature outdoors indoors we're

127
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,399
controlling that with a timer so that is

128
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:46,500
basically photo period if your seeds are

129
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,138
marked regular seeds or if it says photo

130
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,000
on the package that indicates that those

131
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,310
plants will be triggered to flower by

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,310
reducing your light schedule to 12 hours

133
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,228
on and 12 hours off now regular seeds

134
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,079
also indicates that there will be males

135
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:02,579
and females in that package of seeds if

136
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,139
you're trying to grow a seedless crop

137
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,029
you will have to pay attention and keep

138
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,340
the males out of the flowering room

139
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:09,750
somewhere between 7 and 10 days those

140
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:11,159
plants will start showing their sex

141
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,470
you'll have to go through and pull out

142
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,570
all of the males if you leave one male

143
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,550
plant in there for too long it will

144
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:20,339
pollinate and all of the plants around

145
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,139
it will be seated and depending on how

146
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,000
long you let that male go and how much

147
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,620
pollen he released and how much wind

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,019
flow and how much movement you have in

149
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,810
that grow you may see the entire crop

150
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:33,269
with just one male so that is basically

151
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,490
regular seed they are regular seed they

152
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:37,939
were bred conventionally traditionally

153
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,720
with a male and a female plant they are

154
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:41,339
photosensitive which means they will

155
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,680
trigger into flower by reducing the

156
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:46,138
lights to approximately 12 hours on at

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,030
12 hours off some plants will work one

158
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,098
hour either direction you could go 13

159
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:52,109
hours on you can go 13 hours off you

160
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:55,319
could play with that but we recommend

161
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,479
1212 as the critical period also you

162
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,029
will find males and females in your

163
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,620
regular seeds if you're not looking to

164
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:03,689
do any breeding if you want to grow

165
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,848
seedless cannabis you do need to call

166
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:09,029
those males so that's the only major

167
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:10,860
downfall of regular seeds when you buy a

168
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:13,168
package of regular seeds you've got

169
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,968
about a 50/50 chance of getting males

170
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:17,908
and females it's hard to dictate what

171
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:19,500
you get with regular seeds now a lot of

172
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:21,718
people don't want to waste the energy

173
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,939
the time the space or the money buying

174
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:25,680
and growing seeds that could possibly be

175
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,839
males and need to be removed from the

176
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,718
garden now that is where feminized seeds

177
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,369
come into play a lot of people have

178
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:34,348
hatred toward feminized seeds because

179
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,019
they are misinformed a lot of people

180
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:39,209
have hatred or a bias against feminized

181
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:41,189
seeds because there were a few breeders

182
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,699
back in the day they put out a batch of

183
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,219
feminine

184
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,779
Zuber total [ __ ] and a few people bought

185
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,520
those and it put a bad taste in their

186
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,679
mouth and those people spread that taste

187
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,389
throughout the internet and i understand

188
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,490
when you get a terrible product you want

189
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:56,039
to tell people people believe you I get

190
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,780
that but that was way back in the day we

191
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,490
have come a long way since then we

192
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,739
understand how to produce feminized

193
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,990
seeds on a commercial scale and there

194
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,090
are a lot of breeders and producers out

195
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,639
there putting out reliable quality

196
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:11,339
feminized seeds when they are made

197
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,939
properly feminized seeds will produce

198
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:17,369
plants they give you 99.9 percent

199
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:20,550
females this is nature and science

200
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,620
together so there will be anomalies you

201
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,540
will find things that don't fall into

202
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,420
the chart that we drew because that's

203
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,360
how nature works that's why we say 99.9

204
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,259
percent if I do my job correctly when I

205
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,629
produce feminized seeds you will get

206
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:38,670
99.9 percent female plants I'll give you

207
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:41,009
a brief explanation on how I make

208
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,560
feminized seeds and how a lot of the

209
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:46,289
leading feminized seed producers make

210
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,790
their products I create a solution of

211
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,650
silver thiosulfate

212
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,210
that is really easy to learn how to do

213
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:52,949
all the instructions for that are

214
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:54,569
readily available on the internet you

215
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,969
can make a silver thiosulfate solution

216
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:59,639
from products that are easily attainable

217
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:02,160
on the internet for less than $30 get

218
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,689
these products I use product number one

219
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,760
and product number two I mix them into

220
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:07,110
water then I mix the two things of water

221
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,949
together now I've got my silver

222
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,840
thiosulfate concentration i dilute that

223
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:15,420
each plant that I'm using requires a

224
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,219
different dilution and application rate

225
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,560
there is a standard that I start with

226
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,190
the basic dilution that I recommend to

227
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,350
start with would be a one to nine ratio

228
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:27,839
of silver thiosulfate to water so you've

229
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,060
got nine parts water one part of the

230
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,919
silver thiosulfate concentrate mixed

231
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,320
into there shake that up real well and

232
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,479
apply that to the plant on the first day

233
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,060
of flower and then apply it every three

234
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,280
days for 21 days so you're going to give

235
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,009
the plant seven full applications and

236
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,199
spray it until it drips and get the

237
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:48,000
stalks don't just get the leaves get in

238
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,230
there and spray the stalks and be

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,419
careful when you're using the silver

240
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,730
thiosulfate spray because it may turn

241
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:55,110
some things purple if you've got a white

242
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,579
wall depending

243
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,560
which are up against whatever that hits

244
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:00,539
it could turn it purple including your

245
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,799
skin so be careful wear gloves wear a

246
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,599
mask when working with the silver

247
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,059
thiosulfate solution that is always my

248
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,560
recommendation so I take the silver

249
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:10,739
thiosulfate solution that I have created

250
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,289
then I apply it I mix it at a dilution

251
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,259
of nine to one nine parts distilled

252
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:17,399
water one part silver thiosulfate

253
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:19,559
concentrate then I apply it to the

254
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,828
plants every three days for 21 days it

255
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:25,739
gets 21 applications then usually around

256
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:27,389
day 25 to 30 it starts putting out

257
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,278
pollen that's when I start collecting

258
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:30,870
the pall and I put something usually a

259
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,100
piece of glass just depends on where I

260
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,810
am and what I'm working with and put a

261
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,250
piece of glass near the plant collect

262
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:36,539
some pollen as it naturally falls out

263
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,730
pick the male flowers out of there

264
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,230
gather that let it dry then when it

265
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,339
really starts getting dumping that's

266
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,959
when I'll move it right over by the

267
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,180
girls and give it a good shake and now

268
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,129
we have just made feminized seeds I've

269
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:49,289
still got six or seven weeks of

270
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,789
nourishing those seeds but if I have

271
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,610
done everything carefully and done

272
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:55,139
everything correctly I have created

273
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,060
feminized seeds and there should be no

274
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,490
reason why those should be problematic

275
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:00,838
unless I completely screw up the next

276
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,579
six or seven weeks which is very

277
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,290
unlikely because all I've got to do is

278
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:06,208
make sure the equipment functions make

279
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:08,009
sure everything stays on a 12-2 up cycle

280
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,389
I've got to feed it properly I know how

281
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:11,399
to feed plants that are pregnant I know

282
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:13,409
how to produce quality seeds I've got to

283
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,389
defoliate properly and I've also got to

284
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:17,370
make sure to keep everything pest and

285
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,778
problem free and I'm quite experienced

286
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,789
at all of that so far so there should be

287
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:23,070
no problem I also make sure to

288
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:25,078
thoroughly test run every batch of seeds

289
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,519
I make before they make it to market I

290
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:28,139
grow some out myself

291
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,429
I give up punch out to my friends I'm

292
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:30,750
sure you guys see on Instagram people

293
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,489
have the new stuff you're like how do

294
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,470
they get that it's because they grew

295
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,389
something of mine I was impressed by it

296
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,949
I reached out to them and I said hey you

297
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,049
want to run my next batch I need you to

298
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:41,639
take good notes take good photos send it

299
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:43,469
all back to me and then I'll know if I

300
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,059
want to release that line or not so I

301
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,040
have other people grow it I grow it

302
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,958
myself we test it before it's put out to

303
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,389
market that way I know that you're

304
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,828
receiving a quality product I'm gonna go

305
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,750
off way on a side right here that's not

306
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:56,609
even written down when I make a new

307
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,379
strain so let's just say I just pulled

308
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,539
some seeds out of a plant last night

309
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,129
that's a brand new cross nobody's ever

310
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,289
seen it I've never seen it I don't know

311
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:06,419
what it's gonna do before those seeds go

312
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:09,058
anywhere I'm going to throw a handful of

313
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:10,558
them in a paper towel and germinate them

314
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:12,598
and then in 24 hours I'm gonna pop it

315
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:14,308
open and I'm gonna see how many have

316
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:15,689
sprouted tails and I'm gonna make a note

317
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:18,149
and I'm gonna write down the ratio

318
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:20,698
however out of a hundred they sprouted

319
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:22,589
tails or they did not sprout tails then

320
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:24,748
I'll close it back up and I'll let the

321
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,189
other ones keep going and I'll see in 36

322
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:28,439
hours how many made tails and I'll take

323
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:29,908
good notes then I'll put some of those

324
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,738
the ones that did sprout tails and look

325
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:33,448
good I'm gonna put those into some cups

326
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:34,859
of dirt and I'm gonna grow them and I'm

327
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:36,418
gonna pay attention to them and I'm

328
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:38,189
gonna keep a lot of notes I'm gonna veg

329
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:40,708
them I'm gonna flour them I'm gonna grow

330
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:42,718
them I'm gonna dry them cure them smoke

331
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:46,198
them make concentrates out of them smoke

332
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,389
the concentrates we're at least 120 days

333
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:50,878
from even knowing what that product

334
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:53,038
tastes like probably closer to 150 with

335
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,199
the dry and cure phase in there then

336
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:57,239
that is my first grow with it if I

337
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:59,308
approve then I'll pass some seeds onto

338
00:11:57,239 --> 00:12:01,168
gram if Grimble grows it and it looks

339
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:03,448
good in his garden I'll spread it out to

340
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:05,908
a few more people if they grow it well

341
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:08,399
that's when I'll let it go to a vendor

342
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:10,288
or for retail but I test the [ __ ] out of

343
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,178
my feminized seeds and my regular seat

344
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:14,399
so I stand behind my product and

345
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:15,838
honestly every feminized seed that I

346
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,908
produce sells

347
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,129
I can't keep feminized seeds in stock

348
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:22,259
and I don't get any complaints on my

349
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:24,709
feminized seed products so that's how

350
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:28,048
things are made that's how I make my fam

351
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:29,608
Gemini's seeds is there are no males to

352
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:31,948
remove from the garden you know that

353
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:33,689
every seed you plant will result in a

354
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:35,308
harvested crop you won't have to grow it

355
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:37,678
long enough to sex it you won't be

356
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:39,358
wasting any time that's advantageous for

357
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:42,149
people who live in medical states or

358
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:44,369
anybody who is limited by a plant count

359
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:47,099
so your feminized seeds are all going to

360
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:49,139
be females now you would say why would

361
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,879
people grow photoperiod seeds when they

362
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,739
can grow feminized seeds and guarantee

363
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,319
that everything they grow makes it to

364
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:58,918
harvest like I said a lot of people have

365
00:12:55,318 --> 00:13:01,978
a bias against feminized seeds also a

366
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:03,958
lot of people like myself like finding

367
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:06,239
the males breeding with females and

368
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,488
reversed females and alpha females is a

369
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:10,918
great practice but I like working with a

370
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:12,569
solid male plant I've got a passion for

371
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:14,999
conventional breeding I do make

372
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:17,038
feminized seeds but I have more fun with

373
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:18,329
conventional breeding another thing you

374
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:20,578
may notice when you're shopping for

375
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:23,069
seeds is that feminized seeds are about

376
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:25,259
twice the price of regular seeds so you

377
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,540
you do get viable females that you can

378
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,939
take to harvest but that pack of seeds

379
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,379
cost exactly twice is what a regular

380
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,700
pack of seeds cost although you didn't

381
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,950
have to waste the time the space the

382
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,810
soil the energy and you didn't have to

383
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,910
have that extra plant count to add to

384
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:41,369
your numbers in your legal garden so if

385
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:44,459
the packaging says feminized seeds that

386
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,019
means that 99.9 percent of the plants

387
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,570
that come out of that seed package will

388
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,039
be females now here's something that is

389
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,930
kind of a side rant that I was talking

390
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,669
to somebody on social media about that I

391
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:56,099
want to include in a podcast I'm just

392
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:57,839
gonna give it a couple of seconds we

393
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,050
talked about the flip when we flipped a

394
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,090
flower feminized and regular photo

395
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,919
period seeds we flipped them to flower

396
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:08,670
by changing the light cycle either from

397
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:10,229
24 on and 0 off to 18 on and 6 off or

398
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:12,509
however you've got your light cycle set

399
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,519
up then you switch to 12 on and 12 off

400
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:16,679
you are now in flower or if you're gonna

401
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,539
follow the DJ short plan you go a

402
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,529
Lebanon 13 off that's a whole other

403
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:23,579
podcast

404
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:25,799
anyway we flipped a flower that is day 1

405
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,180
of flower your seed package will give

406
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,240
you an estimate of how long they need

407
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:33,299
the flower 9 to 10 weeks 60 to 70 days

408
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,360
whatever it says the day you initiated

409
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:38,579
that flip is day one not the day you see

410
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,500
buds set not the day you smell something

411
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,840
not the day the butterflies flew in and

412
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,120
did their magic dance the day you change

413
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,009
that timer is day one of flower that's

414
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,019
how you keep track of that that's what

415
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:51,840
we're talking about when we indicated

416
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,429
that on the seed package just wanted to

417
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,320
add that side note I'm not sure if that

418
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:57,659
was even relevant but there you go a

419
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,280
little bonus nugget for your brain all

420
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:01,469
right now let's work into autoflowering

421
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,179
seeds let's talk about Auto flowers what

422
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,279
do I mean by an auto flowering seed

423
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:08,849
earlier I was talking about your

424
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,409
location in relation to the equator most

425
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,120
of us live in an area where we see

426
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,819
seasonal changes and we also see changes

427
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,590
in day and night time but keep in mind

428
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,590
there are parts of Russia and Alaska

429
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,210
that will receive extreme stretches of

430
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,850
daylight and night time without

431
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,980
interruption there are some points in

432
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,610
Alaska when they will have full sunlight

433
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:33,870
for 80 days in a row they will not get a

434
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:36,120
night for 80 solid days cannabis is an

435
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,720
extraordinary plant and it has evolved

436
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,209
the

437
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,339
we're familiar with which is evolved

438
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:44,458
from these extreme conditions with no

439
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:47,100
dark is known as ruderalis these

440
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:50,008
ruderalis plants have evolved to flower

441
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,899
without any dark period after so many

442
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:53,970
generations they went hey it doesn't get

443
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,278
dark we need to do something about this

444
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,430
so through evolution they started to

445
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,500
flower without a dark period a lot of

446
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:04,409
those ruderalis plants have no desirable

447
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,470
effect when smoked but they have a lot

448
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:09,360
of desirable traits when grown some of

449
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,819
them stay short they stay squat they

450
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,409
push out really nicely and you don't

451
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:16,019
have to change the light cycle to

452
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:18,088
convince them to flower for you so

453
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,159
cannabis breeders got a hold of

454
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:22,350
ruderalis plants and they bred them

455
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,230
together they bred our autoflowering

456
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,360
ruderalis to our high potency cannabis

457
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,970
plants and the offspring resulted in

458
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,129
high potency autoflowering cannabis

459
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,410
plants most of the autoflowering seeds

460
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:36,539
available for most breeders now are

461
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:39,059
feminized so you'll get autoflowering

462
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:40,708
seeds that are all girls which is really

463
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:42,508
advantageous and we'll talk about that

464
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,308
in just a minute I should warn you that

465
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,259
when you're looking at seeds and you see

466
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:48,990
feminized seeds on there also look to

467
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,850
see if they say photo period or Auto

468
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,350
flower on there make sure they indicate

469
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,629
that if they don't they're probably

470
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,399
photo period all of the auto flower guys

471
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:58,558
like to let you know that you're working

472
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,509
with Auto flowers they clearly indicate

473
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:02,250
that on the package and earlier I

474
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:04,709
mentioned that feminized seeds cost

475
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,630
twice as much as regular Auto flowers

476
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,480
generally cost twice as much as

477
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,069
feminized so you got your regular than

478
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,199
their doubled then their even doubled

479
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:14,399
again so they will let you know if

480
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,990
they're Auto flowers just make sure you

481
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,788
read the package when you're buying your

482
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,130
seat that'll either say regular or

483
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:21,568
feminized or Auto flower just do a

484
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,740
little research before you buy your

485
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:24,869
seeds make sure you know what you're

486
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,509
getting now let's talk a little bit

487
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:29,879
about how these auto flower seeds are

488
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:31,679
useful if you've been listening to the

489
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,840
show for a while you'll love my favorite

490
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,390
example of these Auto flowers and use

491
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,000
several years ago there was a very large

492
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,038
grow discovered in a National Forest not

493
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,950
too far from here and it was discovered

494
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:46,349
that that grow was ran by a cartel as

495
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,240
the reports and pictures came out they

496
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:50,119
were saying that the cartel had three

497
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,370
different stages of growth happen

498
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,989
in their illegal grow area now that

499
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:55,819
really made me wonder how are they

500
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,980
growing different stages outdoors

501
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:59,720
because the Sun dictates what our plants

502
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,339
do if they put them outside they all

503
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,870
went into flower at the same time then

504
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:06,259
my brain went dude they're using Auto

505
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:08,509
flowers so this large cartel would set a

506
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,769
patch of auto flower plants then they

507
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:11,599
would wait a few weeks and they would

508
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:14,058
set another large patch of auto flower

509
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,129
plants wait a few weeks and set another

510
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:18,139
large patch of auto flower plants for

511
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,669
eventually they had a perpetual cycle

512
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,610
going to where they had people out there

513
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:24,740
in this national forest

514
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:27,019
camouflaged hidden growing a perpetual

515
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,308
grow packaging up and sending it to who

516
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:30,048
knows where I have no idea where it was

517
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:32,058
going but they were producing quite a

518
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:34,519
bit of cannabis out there by using Auto

519
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:36,259
flowers they had a perpetual grow under

520
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,940
the natural Sun they didn't have to veg

521
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:39,528
and then flower they could just throw

522
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,870
the seeds out there they would grow and

523
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:44,028
do their thing so that's one way where

524
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:46,489
Auto flower seeds were highly effective

525
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:48,470
now let's scale that down a little bit

526
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,899
let's say you've only got one grow space

527
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,149
and you want to produce a perpetual grow

528
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:55,699
you don't have a bedroom you don't have

529
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:57,139
a flower room you can't go buy clones

530
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,940
from a friend you can't have a friend

531
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,580
veg for you the way you could run a

532
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:04,580
small self sustainable perpetual grow is

533
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:05,990
with Auto flower plants in one room fill

534
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:07,788
up a quarter or half of the room with

535
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,679
Auto flowers as soon as they start

536
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:11,390
flowering plant more Auto flowers and

537
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,429
put them in the same room you'll have

538
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,770
veg plants and flowering plants in the

539
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:17,840
same room you can't do that with photo

540
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:20,028
period plants so if you're limited on

541
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,918
space if you've only got one room that's

542
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:24,440
a really useful method and a really

543
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,500
useful application for auto flowering

544
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,538
plants the major downside that I see to

545
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,558
auto flowering plants is you always have

546
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:32,839
to buy new seeds

547
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,548
you cannot clone an auto flowering plant

548
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,829
if you're growing with regular or

549
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,629
feminized photoperiod seeds you're

550
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:40,189
always able to cut a clone you can keep

551
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,659
that clone as a mother you can keep it

552
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,700
perpetually and then you can always

553
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:45,770
clone off of that mother and you can

554
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,690
keep that plant sustainable with Auto

555
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:50,179
flowers you're always going to be buying

556
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,980
new seeds and earlier I mentioned most

557
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,870
of the auto flower companies are only

558
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,329
putting out feminized so you're not even

559
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:57,979
able to breed your own Auto flowers with

560
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,839
males and females anymore you're gonna

561
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,120
have to reverse one and I have no

562
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,889
experience doing that all right you guys

563
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,409
that is my breakdown on regular

564
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:09,320
seeds feminized seeds and autoflowering

565
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,540
seeds the regular seeds are always photo

566
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,349
period I like them because we find males

567
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:13,970
and females

568
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:15,409
I like breeding with the regular seeds

569
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,900
that's a lot of fun for me

570
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,090
the feminized seeds can be photo period

571
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,009
or they can be Auto flower they are

572
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:24,289
probably well marked on the packaging

573
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:26,420
those are always going to be females if

574
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,069
they were bred properly I've done a

575
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,519
whole nother podcast episode about

576
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:32,779
marking feminized seeds with s or r1

577
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:35,660
generations I encourage you to listen to

578
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:37,700
that one that one is episode 331 and

579
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,170
it's titled selfing and reversals you'll

580
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,480
learn a lot about why we label the

581
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,789
packages the way we do also I recommend

582
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,460
you listen to an episode called seed

583
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:48,649
pack expectations and that is number 245

584
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,940
there's a lot of useful information in

585
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,100
that episode for anyone who is

586
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,240
considering purchasing new seeds then

587
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:55,339
we'll keep it moving we talked about

588
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,470
autoflowering seeds auto flowering

589
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:59,480
plants are unique to photoperiod plants

590
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,610
because they flower based on their size

591
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,710
or their age we can put them under the

592
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:05,719
veg lights we can have them in the 1860

593
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,850
and they will still flower and they will

594
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,589
still produce buds a lot of auto

595
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:12,169
flowering plants boast that they will be

596
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:14,569
completely done around ten weeks so

597
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,700
that's 70 days of a full cycle with a

598
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:18,439
photo period plant you've got closer to

599
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,410
a hundred and twenty days if you want

600
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,630
usable product so that is my lesson on

601
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,120
regular feminized and autoflowering

602
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,160
seeds I hope I made your decision easier

603
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,109
when it comes time to go shopping don't

604
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,029
be afraid to try regular seeds don't be

605
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:33,949
afraid to try feminized seeds and don't

606
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,839
be afraid to try Auto flower seeds you

607
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,430
just may fall in love with something you

608
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,409
never thought you would even like and

609
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,410
don't forget you can find your seeds at

610
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,390

614
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,800
my recording gear has been giving me a

615
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:53,449
couple of technical issues and my throat

616
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,069
is obviously burning out so I'm gonna
