environment I will go in thorough detail

92
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,349
about my nutrient mix and how I feed my

93
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,709
plants that will happen shortly after

96
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,099
and twisting our plants I've also got a

97
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,959
great episode about lolli popping I've

98
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,269

99
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,280

100
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,319
bring you some quality podcasts again

101
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,939
thank you to everybody who supported me

102
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,370
and kind of let me take a little bit of

103
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,959
a break while I was having a rough time

104
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,060
I'm also getting excited because the

105
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,039
endo Expo is coming up really soon

106
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,069
that's right the endo Expo in Denver

107
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,339
Colorado that is on January 25th and

108
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:22,048
26th at the Denver Mart in Denver

109
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:24,839

Sunday is open to the general public if

111
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,539
you need tickets I suggest you get that

112
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,430
now because the event will sell out and

113
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,010
if you do get tickets get there early

114
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,439
because there is a long line to get into

115
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:38,149
the building but the endo Expo is a

116

talking about Metallica early on in the

166
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,339
podcast because that's influential [ __ ]

167
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,899
to me that's really important so that's

168
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:26,269
gonna come up sometimes in a show or

169
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:27,799
sometimes in conversation so I love that

170
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:29,180
you caught an episode where I talked

171
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,889
about my uncle and I talked about

172
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,689
Metallica and then I did it just again a

173
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,918
couple of episodes ago and you've been

174
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:36,918
listening for quite a while and you're

175
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,899
right bro we are approaching episode 500

176
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,490
that means four episodes from now we'll

177
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,500
be number 500

178
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,870
I actually just sent a text message to a

179
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,699
few of your favorites that have been on

180
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,139
the show inviting them to come back and

181
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,180
be on the show four or five hundred

182
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,978
we've got a group chat going on we're

183
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,709
going to get a date together we'll sit

184
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:57,379
down a record episode 500 hopefully by

185
00:06:54,709 --> 00:07:00,138
the end of the weekend so 500 is coming

186
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:01,459
up and yes I am super excited about that

187
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,900
he says Congrats

188
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,758
thank you bro I appreciate that thank

189
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:07,728
you for being here for so long also I

190
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:10,580
goes on to say so 500 you were asking

191
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:13,008
for some ideas yes I reached out on the

192
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:15,288
podcast and I said what do we do for

193
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,060
episode 500 should it be ceremonious or

194
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:19,038
do we just smoke out and record a normal

195
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,439
show just like we normally do and here

196
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,439
is some feedback from my friend the can

197
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,839
of crack he says do it live and that's a

198
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:30,228
really good idea it says rotating cast

199
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,418
white mic Clint Jesse a few hours of

200
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:34,579
dabs rambles and general bullshitting

201
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:36,348
about cannabis that sounds like a great

202
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:39,168
idea one of the only downsides to that

203
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:41,180
is I believe Jesse is in Mexico Jesse

204
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:43,430
likes to take random vacations down

205
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,468
there in Mexico he speaks better Spanish

206
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,788
than he does English now he's got a

207
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:49,069
thing for Mexico

208
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:52,579
I think it's tacos he [ __ ] loves

209
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:54,860
tacos Jesse is half taco at this point

210
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,689
but so Jesse won't be around but of

211
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,939
course I did invite white Mike to

212
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:00,649
episode 500 it wouldn't be episode 500

213
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:02,779
without white Mike it would be rude as

214
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:04,339
hell to not invite white Mike I feel he

215
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:06,679
needs to be here so I did invite cracker

216
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:09,168
Mike for that also I invited Clint I

217
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,718
also invited Dumbledore tank I'm waiting

218
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:13,609
to see ah let those three guys kind of

219
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:14,779
lock in a date get some stuff scheduled

220
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,550
and then I've got two or three other

221
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:18,709
people I'm going to send a text to once

222
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,478
I have a better idea of who is coming

223
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:22,310
and how many chairs and microphones I've

224
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,649
got left I've got one or two more people

225
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,788
that I do need to invite I just want to

226
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:27,620
walk in a date and tell these people

227
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:28,668
this is when it happens because that's

228
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,259
how they work you know some of your

229
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:31,758
friends you let them schedule some of

230
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,680
them you just have to tell them Tuesday

231
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,399
at 5:00 and then they'll show up Tuesday

232
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,649
at 7:30

233
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,179
just like you anticipated you know how

234
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,070
your stoner friends are let's move

235
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:42,588
forward I would love to get my friends

236
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,350
the crew the Irie army over for the show

237
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:47,329
it is hard to schedule that but if I can

238
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,820
get a few people over and if I can get

239
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:52,278
them all to agree to it I would not have

240
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,830
any issue with doing some of the podcast

241
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:57,860
live I may not do the

242
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:01,160
tool Podcast portion of the podcast life

243
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,409
I may do a pre-show dab session on

244
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:05,329
Instagram live would be the easiest way

245
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:07,069
for me to do that I could just set up

246
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,990
the iPad prop it up on something across

247
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,640
the room so it gets the whole smoking

248
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,049
section into the shot and then we could

249
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,549
just do a little dab session and say

250
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:15,500
what's up to everybody on the live show

251
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:17,149
and then we could turn off that and then

252
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,070
actually record the actual podcast maybe

253
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:21,889
do a little bit of a bonus live party

254
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,028
before maybe I'll get to stoned after

255
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:25,100
that and I'll forget to turn off the

256
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:27,950
camera and we may keep rolling and I may

257
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,259
record the entire podcast episode and if

258
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,399
it is not too challenging I'm a piece it

259
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:34,220
into a YouTube video

260
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,589
but honestly video editing is not my

261
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,180
favorite thing and it is very time

262
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:40,250
consuming and I've got a lot going on

263
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:41,899
this month with the Indo Expo so I make

264
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,110
no promises for video but I may do a

265
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:47,059
live chat before you guys these dad's

266
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,250
got me [ __ ] rambly I've had plenty of

267
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:51,139
caffeine I smoked that cherry fluff and

268
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,899
I cannot shut the [ __ ] up this is gonna

269
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:56,870
be a longer podcast than I anticipated

270
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:59,179
you are welcome Kenny crack goes on to

271
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,980

272
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:02,419

00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,970
I can almost smell it through his photos

328
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,980
I keep scratching my phone screen and

329
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,600
holding it up to my face just wishing I

330
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,769
could get some scratch and sniff

331
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,840
smellivision

332
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,789
technology so you guys make sure you

333
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,440

00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:26,299
our friend who calls themselves dude

00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:29,269
dank and it goes a lot like this hey

340
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:31,490
Jeff its dude dank here again I just

341
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:34,159
thought that since you asked for ideas

342
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:37,789
since you have episode 500 coming up and

343
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:40,069
the DGC have episode 1000 coming up why

344
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:43,250
not collaborate and do an anniversary

345
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:47,180
show together and pull off a bit of a

346
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,980
party and that is a cool [ __ ] idea

347
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:50,989
that would be a really good time you

348
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,909

349
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,940
good that's a really good idea he said I

350

support and love both shows hey thank

351
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,050

353
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:03,919

354
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:06,259

00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,459
big shout out to guru and everybody

356
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,049
behind the scenes I know there are a lot

357
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,280
of folks that make that show happen that

358
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:12,139
we don't get to see that we don't talk

359
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:13,789
about a lot so let's give them some love

360
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:15,830
right now big thanks big shout out big

361
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:17,419
fist bump to all of the folks behind the

362
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,610
scenes at the dude Gro show that we

363
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:22,159
never get to see I really do love the

364
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,409
idea of doing a party

365
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:28,519
in episode us doing 500 and them doing

366
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:31,399
number 1000 the problem is the dude

367
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,889
grows studio where Scottie is is about

368
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,889
four hours away from my location and

369
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:38,389
then the dude is in Canada so if we

370
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:40,430
wanted to do something like that it

371
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:42,740
would take a lot of planning and a lot

372
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:44,628
of internet technology and that would

373
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,089
basically eliminate the possibility of

374
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:48,470
getting my crew here to be able to be on

375
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:50,540
the show as well we would need too many

376
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,819
computers too many cameras too much

377
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:54,620
equipment too much preparation it would

378
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:57,438
be a lot of work and I don't have any

379
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,209
gurus I don't have any warehouse kyle's

380
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:01,219
or any errands or anybody like that to

381
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,750
come do my [ __ ] for me the girl from

382
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,790
your heart podcast is all me it's a

383
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,610
one-man show over here so I don't have

384
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:09,588
the technology the gear or the true for

385
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,699
that but it's a cool idea I can see it

386
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,459
in my head it would be the greatest

387
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:15,828
party ever we do actually have a couple

388
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:18,708
of events that become the dude grows

389
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:20,929
event but it is also a lot of the growth

390
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:23,119
from your heart podcast listeners a lot

391
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:25,219

394
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,600
by the dude grows crew it is the dude

395
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:34,698

396
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,790
together again around 7:10 and we do the

397
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:39,679
dude grows concentration celebration so

398
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:41,750
we've got two great events thrown by the

399
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,669

446
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,429
compliments I appreciate that

447
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:27,739
perfectly time thank you I goes on to

448
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:29,778
say I wouldn't be as inspired to grow

449
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,600
and I certainly wouldn't be doing as

450
00:16:29,778 --> 00:16:35,389
well so early on without the hours of

451
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,360
fantastic content you put out there that

452
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:41,240
is awesome to hear thank you I am

453
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,519
delighted to hear that my little work

454
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,860
I've done sitting here and writing and

455
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,528
talking I'm delighted to hear that that

456
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,438
effort has made your grow experience

457
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:52,789
more enjoyable and more successful I

458
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:54,469
thought I think those two things may

459
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:56,899
come together the enjoyment and success

460
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,730
may reflect each other but it does mean

461
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,350
a lot for me to hear that you feel like

462
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,269
you did better because of the little

463
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,980
effort I put out you had to put a lot of

464
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:05,838
effort out as well my friend so it was a

465
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,759
group effort there is more to this it

466
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,099
goes on to say in an industry quickly

467
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,838
becoming corporate where people

468
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,298
increasingly try to hide their knowledge

469
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,730
as trade secret you put it almost all

470
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:20,209
out there and thus improve the quality

471
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,250
of cannabis for everyone exactly that is

472
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,409
kind of my goal I feel like I learn

473
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,029
rather quickly I learned things that I

474
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:27,709
care about rather quickly I've got a

475
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:29,298
very absorbent brain I'm not sure if

476
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,470
that's the appropriate terms for it I

477
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,730
talk about how smart I am and I don't

478
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,919
even know the [ __ ] words to use for

479
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,269
it right I feel like I I can retain

480
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,770
knowledge that I care about quite

481
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:38,750
quickly obviously I care a lot about

482
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:40,819
cannabis I care a lot about growing

483
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,950
cannabis I care a lot about smoking

484
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:44,960
consuming cannabis I absolutely care a

485
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,940
lot about breeding cannabis I just have

486
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,980
a big passion for cannabis it's a big

487
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,580
part of my life and I feel like it has

488
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,529
taken me

489
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:53,059
very far I feel like I am successful in

490
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,670
life not a lot of people can actually

491
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:57,859
say they feel successful and I feel like

492
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:00,769
I'm doing what I enjoy doing and I'm

493
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:02,750
surviving semi comfortably by doing

494
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:04,490
something that I have passion for so I

495
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,920
don't feel like I'm working my ass off I

496
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,720
work very hard but since I love it and

497
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,850
have passion for it I don't feel like

498
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,860
I'm slaving away working for myself and

499
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:14,629
doing something that I have passion for

500
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:17,209
it just feels like I'm having the best

501
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,620
day every day when I'm working and I'm

502
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,960
doing a little air quotes when I say the

503
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:22,669
word working it is work but it's not

504
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,920
work that a lot of people have to endure

505
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,509
so I feel like I'm very and I hate to

506
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,120
sound cliche right now but I am very

507
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:30,289
blessed I am very grateful for the fact

508
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,149
that I don't have to work for a

509
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:33,619
corporation or that I don't have to have

510
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,110
one of those nine-to-five jobs that

511
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:37,609
everybody hates I'm very grateful that I

512
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:40,729
don't have to do that so I feel like

513
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:42,289
since this plant took me so far since I

514
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,870
had such great passion for the plant

515
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:46,490
since I was able to learn so quickly and

516
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:48,469
there was such a need for this knowledge

517
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,539
I feel like it was kind of my duty in my

518
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:54,680
job to put all of this stuff I learned

519
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:57,139
out there there is so much bad advice on

520
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,680
the internet there are so many bad

521
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:04,009
growers offering what looks like expert

522
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,980
advice online and a lot of that stuff is

523
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:09,379
going to cause more problems I felt like

524
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,299
it was partly my responsibility I've got

525
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,670
a big mouth I can't stop talking I've

526
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:15,470
got a huge passion for cannabis I've got

527
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,670
all this beautiful gear I felt like

528
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,559
something came together and said you

529
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,019
need to put this information out there

530
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,819
for everybody to be able to grow the

531
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:25,369
quality cannabis the you and your

532
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:27,139
friends are producing in your area I was

533
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:30,289
around the Colorado medical marijuana

534
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,330
market early I was growing in another

535
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:34,159
state before it was legal we won't talk

536
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:36,349
too much about that but it may have been

537
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,570
happening so I had a lot of experience I

538
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:40,279
was a little bit ahead of the game I may

539
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:42,019
have been doing it before it was legal

540
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,029
so I had a little bit of practice and as

541
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:46,190
soon as it was legal all I had to do is

542
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:48,230
go look I know how to grow and everybody

543
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,410
needed help and needed guidance and I

544
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,940
was more than happy to return that karma

545
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,009
back to the world because I got away

546
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,870
with illegal grows in illegal states I

547
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:57,710
started my cannabis career as a

548
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:59,839
black-market

549
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,610
just a joint seller I worked in a

550
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,339
restaurant I sold joints to the kitchen

551
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:04,599
crew and then eventually I sold

552
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:06,970
ates to the kitchen crew and then

553
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,439
eventually I sold a bunch of quarters to

554
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,089
all of my friends and then eventually I

555
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,559
was selling quarter pounds and then you

556
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,179
know you're just selling a bunch of

557
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,559
pounds and then you're doing crazy [ __ ]

558
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,509
that you don't want to be doing anymore

559
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,579
and now those days are over for me and

560
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:21,009
I'm here in the legal cannabis industry

561
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:23,109
and I feel like I kind of got away with

562
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:25,240
a bunch of [ __ ] that I may or may not

563
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:27,219
allegedly have done back in the day

564
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,529
involving cannabis and now I feel like

565
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,779
my karma is to put this knowledge back

566
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:35,139
out here and help everybody produce

567
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:36,730
top-shelf medicine or recreational

568
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,190
cannabis I believe that's medicine also

569
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,990
I feel better after I consume cannabis

570
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,240
and that means it's probably medicinal

571
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,549
in some sort of way it's absolutely

572
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,589
therapeutic for me so maybe we'll just

573
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:48,519
make up a new term therapeutic cannabis

574
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:50,679
it's right in the middle between

575
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:53,500
recreational and medicinal

576
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,410
so my first dab is medicinal marijuana

577
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,480
my second dad is medicinal marijuana my

578
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,790
third one is therapeutic my fourth one

579
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,829
that's recreational you guys I'm [ __ ]

580
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:05,259
rambley from the recreational dad's I've

581
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:07,210
been taking let's finish up this email

582
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:08,470

583
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,539

584
