207
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:57,000
responsible and did the arm wave so

208
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,240
we've got a couple of things we could

209
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,790
touch on here a few days ago giddy

210
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,430
teased about you can't believe what's

211
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,170
happening in Denver I think it's my

212
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,250
responsibility to pry that information

213
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,960
out of you my friend what the hell is

214
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,660
happening in Denver no I think I think

215
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,859
the secrets kind of out of the bag now

216
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,330
the reason and the reason why I didn't

217
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,800
want to touch on it and talk about it

218
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:20,269
too much in my post because I was

219
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,270
waiting on more information to come in

220
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:38,279
hit me a little diamond deposit in that

221
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:40,649
blunt what a why you know name names one

222
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:44,579
of the larger facilities in the state in

223
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:46,500
Denver had contacted me and they'd went

224
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,300
over their SOPs with diamond production

225
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,399
with fire department as the fire

226
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,779
department those guys are great first of

227
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,789
all big shout out to Denver Fire

228
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,539
Department those guys have always been

229
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:59,279
like really cool to work with

230
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:01,019
considering what we did and like they

231
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,689
worked with us when it was sketchy as

232
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,949
[ __ ] then because of them now companies

233
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:09,300
like mine and other companies can

234
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:11,430
flourish in multiple states so yeah

235
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,629
much love to Denver fire department over

236
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:16,259
here what doesn't a lot of people like

237
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:18,090
did they get involved because of some

238
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,370
things they got they got involved

239
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:23,060
because somebody had a jar pop in an

240
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,500
ignition on a high saturation in a lab

241
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:28,500
now wait break that down to normal

242
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,379
people talk yeah most of the people

243
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:35,700
listening are sorry I'm talking to the

244
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:38,340
room I'm holding my you stand that but

245
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,950
so from what I understand there was a

246
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,810
the way a lot of people make jar jars of

247
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,540
diamonds is jar tech you put a high

248
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,579
saturation of butane in the jar set a

249
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:50,039
temperature put it in and diamonds drop

250
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,810
out and you'll have the separate but it

251
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,730
takes a lot of and have a lot more

252
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:56,549
butane than you ever want to put in an

253
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,750
electronic oven so it was kind of those

254
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:59,729
things that we knew was gonna be

255
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,129
short-lived we knew what we knew that

256
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,100
wasn't when they got that tech that tech

257
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:07,889
it exactly that that technique the way

258
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,700
that most people entry-level start doing

259
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:13,199
it they're definitely not gonna be

260
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,330
allowing that they're not gonna be

261
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,060
allowing poor offs that reach a certain

262
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,570
limit on the if here so basically it's a

263
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,829
denver comes in show me your SOP explain

264
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,020
we're gonna go over how you do your

265
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,600
diamonds so when you pop your lid off of

266
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,939
your extraction device to pour in to be

267
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,970
a pressure vessel jar anything that you

268
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,040
have anything about pressure vessels

269
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,200
they are not liking pressure they will

270
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:41,639
not have pressure vessels in ovens they

271
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,700
won't have pressure vessels that that

272
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:47,490
stand for a long time so they're not

273
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,920
liking the what they're seeing right now

274
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,960
from the pressure vessel market they are

275
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,860
definitely absolutely not liking jar

276
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:59,129
tech that doesn't mean there's not a way

277
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,620
to skin the cat yes you know I'm telling

278
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:03,870
the man who like one of the best diamond

279
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,060
producers that I even know of is sitting

280
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:11,639
across from me right now so in a dad is

281
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:12,838
five gram diamond later as you know

282
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,730
there's no way but what it's gonna do is

283
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,339
go clean out the riffraff in the legal

284
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,970
market just gonna shake things up and

285
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:22,530
it's gonna prove for mainly like what I

286
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,110
look is the people that I messed with is

287
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:29,549
the guys in the lab it's another hurdle

288
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:31,620
if you can't adapt and go then we'll all

289
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:34,019
this dried the prices of the

290
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,269
concentrates up it depends on what the

291
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,220
stock is of the market for some places

292
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,588
that people shop if you shop at one or

293
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,120
two places it could happen it well I

294
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:43,380
mean if they come into your place and

295
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,759
you buy if you're the type of customer

296
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:45,950
that buys the white label to the Spencer

297
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,120
in that dispensary that

298
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,670
vertically-integrated dispensary wasn't

299
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,889
ready for it they may increase the price

300
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,958
of what they got because

301
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:55,759
they're gonna have to rego a lot of

302
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,588
these people have a large stock of

303
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,678
diamonds and it's not a problem that's

304
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:02,540
going to it's gonna take them off their

305
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:05,539
feet long enough to affect that large

306
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:11,238
supply of stock so do you foresee this

307
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:15,428
happening statewide I know you gotta say

308
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:15,429
nation everywhere but we're gonna talk

309
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:21,350
what did but what what Denver do they

310
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,720
all do can we compare this to how people

311
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,558
used to open blast they're shatter and

312
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,939
have all these explosion there's

313
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:31,399
definitely some comparisons while I do

314
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:35,149
believe that the same dangers exist in

315
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,649
both one is significantly less case in

316
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,509
point

317
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:40,369
no I mean nobody talks about you know

318
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:42,649
jars popping and I don't mean we put

319
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:45,619
thousands but thousands of jars out and

320
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,850
you know into into the process and if

321
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,298
you do it the right way it doesn't

322
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,689
happen

323
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:52,938
well TNT and I had this discussion and

324
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:55,548
he said the well the state can come in

325
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:57,078
but that doesn't fix stupid well you

326
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:58,578
know it's funny because right here right

327
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:02,178
here in this building that were setting

328
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:06,258
in Marc Rudolph of the Denver Fire

329
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:08,028
Department very classy fellow smart guy

330
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,558
and knows exactly what we all do he's

331
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:11,778
actually trained and certified on

332
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:15,860
multiple hydrocarbons I've trained him

333
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:17,869
on my equipment in he's a good guy he

334
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,730
came in here one day after there was an

335
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:23,119
accident with an emo tech machine in a

336
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:25,879
lab and they brought me the video you

337
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:27,439
know what happened here why was it fell

338
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,659
you know we went and did an incident

339
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:32,178
report on it and feel that like from

340
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:35,418
what we could see was all of the things

341
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:38,328
that led to the accident which in that

342
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:40,788
case was a Lou gross negligence of the

343
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:42,498
owner the extractor quit and they sent a

344
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:44,568
female blood tender that had never been

345
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:47,629
in the extraction lab out to finish

346
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:49,668
someone's run so something she did not

347
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,350
know what she was no she was come no she

348
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:54,288
wasn't certified to run the Machine she

349
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,209
didn't work in the lab she had no idea

350
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:58,698
she was trying to be safe and made some

351
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:02,118
mistakes that that caused the vessels

352
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:03,859
lid to come off and actually all the

353
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:05,899
butane lakes she didn't shut off the

354
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,159
valve she didn't next

355
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:10,139
any of the stuff that you're trained to

356
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,179
do like in the case of a catastrophic

357
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,519
failure for any machine and that's one

358
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:16,229
of the parts of the peer review when we

359
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,509
talk about you buying peer reviewed

360
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,810
machines we talked about asme

361
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:25,019
certifications what has happened here is

362
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:27,239
a group of engineers have taken whoa

363
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,110
it's Stormin we just lost power for a

364
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,340
second

365
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,750
Podcast kept good Podcast don't care but

366
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,590
did y'all see the glowing horse head

367
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,940
when the lights went out that time

368
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,889
nobody has gone over that particular

369
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,940
machine or design of machine to see if

370
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:46,470
there is a functionality a function of

371
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,180
our function of the machine that

372
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,600
wouldn't that would cause a catastrophic

373
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:53,039
failure part of that peer review being

374
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,440
done is you have to have your

375
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:59,069
instruction manual you have to have a

376
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,470
clear set way of training and in and you

377
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,540
have to have a certification program for

378
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:07,830
the people that actually run it and put

379
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:09,389
it up on the wall so with none of that

380
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:12,000
ever being a placement of you know that

381
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:14,340
was the first steps into a multi-step

382
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,620
problem the customer and Marc Rudolph

383
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,360
said giddy you make these things idiot

384
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:28,049
proof and they just keep making better

385
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:30,190
idiots supposed to be a joke I was just

386
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:33,258
saying I've been talking for 90 seconds

387
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,259
[Music]

388
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:44,250
13 they're just gonna devices in your

389
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:46,169
facility going to I mean there's a

390
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,580
million ways to skin the cat so they're

391
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:52,379
just gonna have to go around using

392
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:54,420
pressure vessels and I think I think the

393
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,799
thing is I don't think it doesn't just

394
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:57,149
you can't they but they won't just say

395
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,000
yes pressure vessels what'll it take

396
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:02,279
we'll be a company like mine getting the

397
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,080
peer review in process to get to get a

398
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,829
vessel to get a pressure as they'll

399
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,500
accept pressure vessels are like the

400
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,670
low-hanging fruit though anybody

401
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,919
precipitation of THC

402
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:15,179
I mean there's there's a million other

403
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,498
ways to do it but I mean that's

404
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:20,698
definitely the most

405
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:22,199
proof and quick fast repent and and you

406
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,178
can hire someone and train them how to

407
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:28,708
do it in a day and it doesn't take a

408
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:30,538
real real grasp of science to do it that

409
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:34,468
way that's kind of monkey-see monkey-do

410
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:36,778
and yeah and that but you know that that

411
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:40,079
also in itself has inconsistency in the

412
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:42,448
product you can't get what you can't get

413
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,158
what he makes right there J you guys

414
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:46,438
can't see what we have on the table

415
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:48,778
there are some diamonds here you can't

416
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:52,908
get what he has as consistent as he has

417
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:55,259
like bar Jalan in an oven with some

418
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:57,239
three month employees you know cuz you

419
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:59,548
fired everybody like that that takes

420
00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:01,439
work so we're not gonna see too drastic

421
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:04,500
of a change in the market no it's just

422
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:07,828
gonna be enough to shake up what I see

423
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:11,189
is a bunch of complacent people in the

424
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:13,288
market happy with mediocrity that think

425
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,209
they got it [ __ ] going on as long as

426
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:17,038
it makes a better product for the

427
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,600
patients that's all that matters we're

428
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,669
just as long as it makes a better

429
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,500
product and it is the industry I mean

430
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,179
that's what everything is meant to

431
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,929
happen you know totally how we need to

432
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:29,879
say facilities there's nothing that

433
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:32,788
anybody can argue about this being right

434
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:34,349
or wrong you can't come set set across

435
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:36,210
from me and look me in the eye and tell

436
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:39,209
me that your [ __ ] jar Tech's safe I

437
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:41,429
know it's not I people have kept it real

438
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,319
secretive I'm not into the concentrate

439
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,028
making so I've kind of I've ignored the

440
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,500
tech but you guys spilled more of the

441
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:48,659
tech on this episode than I've been able

442
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,308
to get out of people that have been

443
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:52,259
working on this for a long time so I'm

444
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:53,878
kind of new to jar tech yeah that sounds

445
00:17:52,259 --> 00:18:00,450
dangerous as [ __ ] I'm surprised this is

446
00:17:53,878 --> 00:18:02,459
the first time the first diamonds I made

447
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,960
were jar tech the early days we were

448
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,240
doing pressure relief valves on jars

449
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,250
like when we first started that's yeah

450
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,859
it's kind of the tech weird is he

451
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,720
finding 15-pound pressure released

452
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:15,990
pressure valves on jars we went down

453
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,890
like a six pounds I just I just worked

454
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:22,589
my it mess trial and error without

455
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,870
when we were still using yes very

456
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:28,139
beginning tail end of but now we use

457
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:30,808
argon or nitrogen to back purge to back

458
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,009
pressure eyes which is it's way easier

459
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:34,879
because you start off with a clean

460
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:37,470
solution rather than starting your

461
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,660
recrystallization in a dirty solution to

462
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,190
begin with people are trying to take

463
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,298
notes there are people that are

464
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,980
listening to the show that are just

465
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,420
scribbling down their backspace and what

466
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,700
you just said trying to figure that out

467
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,630
yeah if you want to share any of that

468
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,250
information

469
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,780
you could keep going if you'd like how

470
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,220
to do any of those steps a little more

471
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,259
in-depth or if you'd like to keep your

472
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:05,610
tech to yourself feel free to teach us

473
00:18:55,259 --> 00:19:07,619
all about the tech man follow him he'll

474
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:10,589
give you what you need for I'm sure if

475
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:12,329
you really want to make it change then I

476
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:13,409
would just say purchase your hash from

477
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:18,210
somebody that knows what they're doing

478
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:20,130
and on top of that man [ __ ] like your

479
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,429
money is all your power people and

480
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:25,530
that's the industry that's how you vote

481
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:27,660
support research the people that you're

482
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:29,759
buying from look into this you know and

483
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,169
like it makes you're making people a lot

484
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,910
of money you're giving your money to a

485
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,590
place you should feel good about it you

486
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:39,390
know what I mean are all diamonds

487
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:41,928
created equal no no material to like so

488
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:51,900
you can make crystals out of shitty ash

489
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:53,940
okay so on that talk about dropping

490
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,830
diamonds out of crew but I yeah people

491
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,990
do it people drop diamonds out of crude

492
00:19:55,829 --> 00:20:00,329
and it's actually if somebody puts you

493
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,308
on to it it's the simplest process in

494
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:05,509
the world is no different than anything

495
00:20:02,308 --> 00:20:08,668
else we do are people doing that oh yeah

496
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:14,429
yeah yeah and here's the thing here's

497
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:18,090
the thing as long as you take care

498
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:21,330
you're right your [ __ ] is thorough that

499
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:24,720
is the same THCA that you're getting out

500
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:28,230
of whatever as you were getting out of

501
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:31,200
the most fire prime cure buds and that's

502
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,410
where the connoisseur attitude has to

503
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,319
take a backseat

504
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:37,660
to the designer you know cannabinoid

505
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,669
makeups that we're doing nowadays this

506
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,279
is gone beyond we were taking everything

507
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,740
that you love and separated it and now

508
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,899
we can do designer mixes on it I'm still

509
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,349
a holistic smoking guy like my raw

510
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,070
products like water hash I don't like

511
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,490
rosin

512
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:57,669
I like BHO but I don't like it over

513
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:07,960
processed why is it you don't like rosin

514
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:11,410
I really want to know I don't like don't

515
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,269
get me wrong I was I just know I even

516
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:18,550
heard you say the other day like you're

517
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:20,139
considering making rosin my drop drop to

518
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:23,049
the floor do you know how many people

519
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:28,840

520
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:31,539

521
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:33,039
rosin no you were like Nick of T's rosin

522
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:35,529
that they dropped out at fields out

523
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,740
there man it was so far and I come

524
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:41,920
across fire rosin I don't like rosin

525
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,990
enough to take a chance to dab it to not

526
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,360
like I do not like the taste of bad rose

527
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,609
and I do not like the burn neither do i

528
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:53,549

some really good rosin somebody's also

532
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,370
got to check those vegan [ __ ] man rosin

533
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:07,179
boys out here running around acting like

534
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:16,000
[ __ ] don't stink I swish swish I'll see

535
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:17,380
you in the streets I'm glad you said

536
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,579
that on a low voice on that mic that is

537
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,620
perfect we're just gonna I'm not having

538
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:22,299
an edit fat yeah a lot of the rosin I

539
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:23,589
smoked tastes like a burnt popsicles

540
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,529
yeah or something and that's it bro I

541
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:29,379
love everything done if that shit'll

542
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:31,960
burnt and I'll smoke it it's kind of

543
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,600
like sometimes rosin is like like how

544
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,789
people used to look at BHO like it used

545
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:38,649
to be just the trim and stuff like that

546
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,059
they would go to it like that's how some

547
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,560
people look at Roz and a lot of people

548
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,509
with all the melts and stuff like that

549
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:46,000
that isn't full melt gets

550
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:47,640
dumpin Roz and I mean there are there

551
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,950
are some people that are doing you know

552
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:54,520
like squishing the 90 in the 120s which

553
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:58,240
makes amazing tasting rosin but a lot of

554
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:59,829
its taking out the joke I guess sorry we

555
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,640
just discovered a tech thing it's being

556
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:01,779
solved for me

557
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,370
I appreciate my friends are helping me

558
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:05,440
out it's plugged in right down there but

559
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:10,839
I don't know if I plug it in to have

560
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:19,390
some monstrosity because it's funny and

561
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:21,339
because it gets panties in a wad panties

562
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,170
in the water and honestly in this day

563
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:24,639
and age I really don't even like to

564
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,470
think that I do that on this game if you

565
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,630
notice I don't make many rosin jokes

566
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,180
many more that linger I'll pop one out

567
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:34,990
every now when like creativity strikes

568
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:37,150
but uh I mean that's another real topic

569
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,910
is how hateful everybody is on the

570
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,769
Internet of people I love I love a good

571
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,300
rosin talk I love what it does yeah I

572
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:47,079
love what it does it gets people moving

573
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:49,869
I just see something and I'm like it's

574
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:52,269
like I could call I could say something

575
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:54,459
politically incorrect or I could just

576
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:58,599
[ __ ] call it rosin ish you know and

577
00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:01,930
just tie rosin to it and what were you

578
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:04,889
just handed besides heaven how else

579
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:10,870

581
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:16,869
mean yeah white like champagne colored

582
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:17,950
all right podcast world unfortunately at

583
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,389
this point in the recording that

584
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,460
technical issue I was talking about

585
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,200
caught up to us I was forced to press

586
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,940
pause on the recording I had to restart

587
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,840
the computer while the computer

588
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,670
restarted we smoked down we got lit up

589
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,549
in that building we smoke some dabs of

590
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:35,680
THC a crystals we smoked some rosin we

591
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:38,500
smoked a couple of blunts we made that

592
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,450
place cloudy and then we all sat back

593
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,000
down in our seats and we got back down

594
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,460
on a podcast and here is what I captured

595
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,599
so before a technology went haywire on

596
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,220
us we had a little low we had some

597
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:49,839
lightning we had some wind we had some

598
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,430
stuff we have Denver as well we've got

599
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,079
it kind of disrupted my recording

600
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,269
equipment but we are back on track we

601
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,250
took a nice fat smoke break during that

602
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:59,680
break I was given a dab of so

603
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:02,559
Rasen from my friend max here at tnt off

604
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,029
of this gorgeous little rig what what

605
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,750
strain did you give me to dab bro

606
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:09,279
that was some the chem the cam yeah

607
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,450
you're right bro not all rosin is [ __ ]

608
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,740
I'll give you that that was pretty good

609
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,350
bro thank you no problem

610
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,500
it gave me a different kind of stoned

611
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:19,089
BHO dabs crystals any type of eh oh I

612
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,339
feel like it's missing this eye high

613
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:22,899
that I agree yeah it's that's not in

614
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:24,669
there whatever does this to my this when

615
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,890
you smoke well I always did smoke blunts

616
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,440
also but I noticed it from that that

617
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,580
rosin dab it went right to my eyes right

618
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,559
to the front of my face and you don't

619
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:35,379
get that from BHO so that's kind of cool

620
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,029
that I've missed that I don't I don't

621
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,910
think it's not that you don't get it

622
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:43,029
from BHO I think it's people get into

623
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:45,490
the habit of smoking one type of product

624
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:46,899
you know if you smoke BHO and you go

625
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,009
smoke cause it's gonna affect you

626
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,780
differently because it's gonna it's

627
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:52,599
gonna work differently you haven't had

628
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:53,980
it for a while and it's great and when

629
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:55,629
you bounce back and forth it's almost

630
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,610
like strain like I think cuz I hit good

631
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,740
rosin bro and you're right it it gets me

632
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:02,589
completely different high than my BHO

633
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,690
gets me but if I if I only smoke flower

634
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:07,359
for a while and then I go smoke BHO the

635
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:10,450
BHO hits me right again to where I'm I'm

636
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:13,000
just stubbornly stupid rosin messes me

637
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:16,539
up yeah it puts me to sleep like bah oh

638
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,599
yes chill it just threw me back I'm just

639
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:23,139
like whoa well you also been smoking

he's got he's got several seconds he's

645
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,789
dabbing now there's a big contemplation

646
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:44,920
on how long he should wait he's making

647
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:47,740
the candy cuz it looks real nice it's

648

is on it's like you guys were here with

650
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:57,569
us taking a DAB he's got a sexy mohawk

651
00:26:53,380 --> 00:27:00,930
it's hanging it's sexy

652
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:02,189
you've been practicing let's go back in

653
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:07,950
four seconds he's gonna finish the dad

654
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:09,420
because he is a grown man he's smacking

655
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,710
his lips we're gonna ask him what he

656
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,450
thinks about the rosin here as soon as

657
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:17,130
he's done with this micro cough he's not

658
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:18,960
gonna cop to smell it it doesn't have

659
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,250
that uh that Burt popsicle smell that

660
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,720
I'm used to with rosin it didn't have

661
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,940
that taste at all it's actually smooth

662
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,049
it was pleasant I tasted like Cammy it

663
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,410
tastes to feel it in the front of my

664
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:30,149
forehead nice quick but now again do you

665
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:34,590
think that's because of the starting

666
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:36,240
material is the starting material was

667
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:40,199
good and the process that they had for

668
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,519
making rosin was done right yeah a lot

669
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,580
of it is the starting material you can't

670
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,809
you can't turn you can't always like you

671
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,819
always got to remember the starting

672
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:48,359
which other material can't polish say

673
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:50,189
you're right

674
00:27:48,359 --> 00:28:01,859
that's why they have flower categories

675
00:27:50,190 --> 00:28:04,860
and all these awards the process he

676
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:09,419
exhaled he would back any exhales he

677
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:13,740
just relaxed back part of the couch just

678
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:16,200
become one his legs a cry looking like a

679
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,460
yogi over there I've got a question for

680
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,750
him and I'm trying to give them in a

681
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,610
moment so that he can get his brains

682
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,220
back in his head after that Deb hey we

683

689
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:48,509

690
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:50,909
made in Oklahoma it's actually one of

691
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:53,129
the reddest states around we've got

692

you know we're doing high CBD hemp and a

698
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,600
lot of other stuff too we're doing CBG

699
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,960
we're the only lab I know right now that

700
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,418
will make a product specific blend for

701
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,950
somebody in that CBG to it which

702
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:26,370
cannabinoids can you put into that

703
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,929
specific blend no we want to drill you

704
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:30,509
right after you take a DAB I apologize

705
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:33,120
for that I'm good time any better I hit

706
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:36,660
that rosin like like my girlfriend was

707
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,529
watching you know I'm saying that [ __ ]

708
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,660
was fire

709
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:45,000
I got brave grannies here yeah

710
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:47,070
max is huge FC everybody's watching me

711
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,109
smoke crosses we all smoked brass and

712
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:53,339
now we're on the couch my face is high

713
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:56,548
you know it's it's really it's coming

714
00:29:53,339 --> 00:30:00,089
along so quick and which cannabinoids

715
00:29:56,548 --> 00:30:04,319
which cannabinoids well there's no THC

716
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:06,269
so no Delta 9 as far as I know no Delta

717
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,730
8 either and that was gotta be the one

718
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:10,168
that people would be curious about

719
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:13,558
because it's new you know what I mean

720
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:15,870
it's not THC Delta 9 which in a lot of

721
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:19,558
the states that particular verbage is in

722
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:23,509
the law so if you have a compound that

723
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:27,329
is not that you can kind of argue that

724
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:29,220
you know while it is THC but it's not

725
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:32,639
tasty Delta 9 which is which we know so

726
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:36,419
they okay so I have a question then is

727
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:40,230
there any chance that smoking this would

728
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:43,980
cause someone to have a hot UA say you

729
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:45,419
work for the federal government yo say

730
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,460
you work for the federal government and

731
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:50,820
you smoke this you smokes for a

732
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,460
wonderful product no you will not you

733
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:55,769
well not you have to watch that about

734
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,829
CBDs and that is honestly she'd ask

735
00:30:55,769 --> 00:31:02,069
questions that you could ask so we use

736
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:03,928
provar ting out of massachusetts to test

737
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,220
all of our to test all of us we have all

738
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:08,820
of our COAS

739
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:13,230
our SOPs the way that we produce our

740
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:15,149
hand we have no THC and we keep all of

741
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:18,839
our test stores to back it up on top of

742
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:22,759
that as we were open this company we did

743
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:26,309
matches with our people that smoked and

744
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:28,170
we didn't have people pissing hot we did

745
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:31,589
have people that smoked other people's

746
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:33,720
product that didn't smoke any THC that

747
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,609
did piss hot yes there's a lot of places

748
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,170
in Oklahoma right now because the CBD

749
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:38,729
market hit they're crazy and they popped

750
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:41,130
up like vape shops on the vape shop

751
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,720
[ __ ] oh there's a lot of people who

752
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,610
are selling stuff that pisses hot

753
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,380
there's a lot of people that are using

754
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:48,569
fraudulent tests or like you know

755
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:52,440
getting one test done on something and

756
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:53,849
reusing its deal but um what's being set

757
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,769
forth right now in Oklahoma as a means

758
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:57,719
to enforce all that you know just like

759
00:31:55,769 --> 00:32:00,480
it happened to Colorado they're doing it

760
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,650
like that on the CBD side prepping for

761
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,240
what we pulled at 56% in favor of bill

762
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:09,600
788 passing medical marijuana in

763
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,089
Oklahoma who would that yeah I was gonna

764
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,889
say who would put THC in a CBD product

765
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:17,490
it's not that they're putting THC in a

766
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:21,030
CBD product on axe they're effectively

767
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:24,569
removing any THC from the product if

768
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:26,849
there's a if if they're if they're not

769
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:30,169
processing everything right you know

770
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:33,059
there can be trace amounts of THC in it

771
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:34,470
that's gonna cause people jobs child

772
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:37,500
support cases that's gonna wreck

773
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,509
people's lives it definitely it

774
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,700
definitely will and it definitely has

775
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:45,900
and there's a lot of products out there

776
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:48,690

797
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:46,418
we need are these cannabis Dr Terps that

798
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:49,999
are going back in food great herbs

799
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:52,519
cannabis derived terpenes no THC all

800
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:53,990
depends it depends on which ones it

801
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,620
really depends on which one summer

802
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,720
actually

803
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:59,479
hemp derived terpenes some are other

804
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,649
natural plant derived terpenes depending

805
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,118
upon which which terpene profile I don't

806
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,638
think I'm really disappointed about on

807
00:34:05,118 --> 00:34:16,338
this packaging is your face is not on it

808
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:18,710
and that's because it's coming unless

809
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:21,078
this is you laid out on the M no do you

810
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,389
model for that no that didn't that that

811
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:26,659
right there is um that right there is a

812
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:31,909
house product with terpenes that the lab

813
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:34,159
has been working on now now that I'm

814
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:37,909
actually on as as part owner and part

815
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,280
shareholder we're going to establish a

816
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:43,128
licensing agreement between me and and

817
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,919
the company that brings the giddy-up CBD

818
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:48,500
line that I've been wanting to debut

819
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:50,328
there and that'll be distributed to our

820
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,000
distributors across the country and

821
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:53,750
it'll be available pretty much

822
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,489
everywhere we have you know we're the

823
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,960
same people that produce a quantum CBD

824
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:02,328
water our waters are in erawan in

825
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,550
California they're in a lot of stores in

826
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:06,109
Oklahoma and really they're it's a wide

827
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,060
range we've got distributors all over

828
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:09,818
the country that send out our water and

829
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:13,309
to be perfectly honest we've given away

830
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:15,619
you know hundreds and hundreds of

831
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:17,568
thousands of bottles to you know get out

832
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,160
and do the more excellent thanks for

833
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:21,710
getting CBD out there more people need

834
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,779
access to CBD more people need access to

835
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,789
actual CBD there's too much snake oil

836
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,589
and [ __ ] out there you don't see

837
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,949
somebody yeah no no you don't want

838
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:29,690
Chinese

839
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:32,299
I don't want fish oil you don't want

840
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:34,670
dragon's blood you want actual CBD yeah

841
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,200
and and that's that's a big part of you

842
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,450
want every you know every kind of

843
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:42,439
annoyed you can get so us being guys

844
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:45,319
that offer an extract to that has CBG

845
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:50,450
which not a lot of people do what's the

846
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:52,210
benefit of CBG there's a lot of benefits

847
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:55,159
to CVG and without getting too technical

848
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:58,639
into it CBG really kind of affects your

849
00:35:55,159 --> 00:36:01,839
focus in your head and like it's it's

850
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,579
really it's really while CBD is is

851
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,260
healthy body

852
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:07,759
CBG apparently appears to be really

853
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,230
healthy mine is that the one they're

854
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,500
saying will help us with Alzheimer's

855
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:14,389
it's one of the cv g'v is one of the

856
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,099
ones into that and CBG is also the

857
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:18,440
precursor to everything almost

858
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:21,909
everything that exists in the camera i

859
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:25,280
like to equate it as stem cells for weed

860
00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:26,750
the precursor oh you like that don't you

861
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,700
trademark trademark don't you

862
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,380
[ __ ] go putting stem cells [ __ ]

863
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:31,849
on oh I want to hear none of you

864
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,010
[ __ ] talk about stem cells

865
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:36,469
that's my [ __ ] hashtag wheat stem cells

866
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,420
hashtag wheat stem cells stem cells in

867
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:40,309
your weed hash that get e sales get

868
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,260
concentrated get e cells but that's the

869
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:47,269
way I like I like to explain it I don't

870
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:50,690
like honest managers I would I can't

871
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:53,150
wait man we're so close to we're so

872
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:57,079
close to just really having such solid

873
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:58,610
data on isolated cannabinoids bro and

874
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,829
that's the cool thing about this plant

875
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:04,250
is when you start mixing these and

876
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:07,340
ratios I love I love a 10% CBD to CBG

877
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,690
ratio I've always said I don't know

878
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,970
about always for a long time I've been

879
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,500
saying that we'll be able to go into I

880
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:14,149
don't know what type of facility it'll

881
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,590
be maybe it's similar to a pharmacy in

882
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,750
my mind and you hand them your little

883
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:19,760
card and your cards got your print print

884
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,280
out on it I want this much CBD this much

885
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,960
CBG this much THC this much limonene

886
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,400
this much pine oil and each of us would

887
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,480
just go in and stick out our Slurpee cup

888
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,889
and concentrate would fill up your

889
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,170
Slurpee cup with your exact order

890
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:32,089
there's four grams of the Jeff Hanks

891
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:35,240
I'll tell you we're not we're not far

892
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:36,590
from that of course we all would but

893
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:38,659
we're total at the isolation of

894
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,820
cannabinoids is all we're getting close

895
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:42,170
being able to make a special mixture

896
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:47,750
before you go to bed you know what I

897
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:50,869
mean yeah a little bit THC let's talk

898
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:53,329
about medicinally we can isolate true

899
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:59,690
formulas to fight specific

900
00:37:53,329 --> 00:38:02,269
yeah absolutely because if we can make

901
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:05,090
formulas to to help ladies that are

902
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:07,250
going through breast cancer or prostate

903
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,450
cancer I mean that's you know people

904
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,849
with seizures how people with

905
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:13,419
Alzheimer's people with brain injuries

906
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:17,000
people but we will be able to isolate

907
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,680
formulas specific design design if we're

908
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,599
already doing that almost right now it

909
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,669
does an amazing job of doing it itself

910
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:24,019
and its form but I mean oh we could

911
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,510
definitely assist it

912
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:28,099
well all we're doing is just moving

913
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:30,440
stuff around you know what I mean and

914
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:32,719
the cool thing is is and the reason why

915
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,079
we say anything and why you'll hear you

916
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:38,989
know where you hear people going it's

917
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,599
the cure for everything the reason why

918
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:44,689
there's some truth to that is because of

919
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,969
the versatility of the effects of the

920
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,990
difference of the different compounds in

921
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:52,369
the plant there's an anti-virus there's

922
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:55,219
anti-inflammatory anti-inflammatory the

923
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:57,289
door anti fungal tech turret you know

924
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:59,179
there's so many different things that

925
00:38:57,289 --> 00:39:02,199
the plant can do that when you start

926
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:05,719
isolating the compounds in the plant and

927
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:07,519
tracking back their ratios to see what

928
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:09,769
interacts with different people and

929
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:12,380
maybe it's something by blood time maybe

930
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:15,289
it's something by genetics that is

931
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,660
identified 50 years from now of working

932
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:19,940
with the plant nicely but that we will

933
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:22,009
derive the cures for most advanced

934
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,619
sicknesses from this plant in plants

935
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:28,060
like it it's that technology it's that

936
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:31,339
time it takes to do it and that's why

937
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:34,429
and it is you said and plants like it

938
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:38,900
because we know different spices have

939
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:40,549
the same holistic effect yes that's

940
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:44,210
right you found that out what the apple

941
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:46,039
cider vinegar did you know that cough so

942
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,179
much it got it out of me so I don't I

943
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:48,380
don't know the exact science behind the

944
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:50,929
Sun I'm gonna sound completely ignorant

945
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,539
but we can do DNA tests on ourselves now

946
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:55,460
and we can find markers in our DNA that

947
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:57,079
are going to predict hey you may get

948
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,909
Alzheimer's hey you may be prone to

949
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,099
cancer because of these genetic markers

950
00:39:58,909 --> 00:40:02,809
in your DNA I listen to a lot of Joe

951
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,460
Rogan I don't absorb it all I'm driving

952
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:05,590
that's the short version of what I

953
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,179
understand

954
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:09,340
one day we'll be able to match up those

955
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:10,509
genetic markers with our cannabinoid

956
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,740
needs nope

957
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,060
you'll print out you'll take a little

958
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:14,379
blood you'll get your DNA and they'll

959
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:15,849
say hey your DNA is shaped like this

960
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,619
you're gonna get Alzheimer's you're

961
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:19,329
gonna get prostate cancer which

962
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:19,750
cannabinoids do you need which Terps do

963
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,549
you need

964
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,920
here you go start consuming if you eat

965
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,350
eat this if you dab dab this we'll be

966
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,119
able to dial it in based on a printout

967
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:30,069
and we'll be able to use it all so

968
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:34,059
that's the future bro and as you know

969
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:41,710
it's great [ __ ] high right now that

970
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:43,299
this makes it makes all the sense do 50

971
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,460
but think about dudes I mean look at

972
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,470
what we mean and let's let's step back

973
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,110
and let's get a little deeper for just a

974
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:51,369
quick look at what we've done in the

975
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,800
last 50 years

976
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:56,170
I'm of a special part of the generation

977
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,530
on the last of an analog generation I

978
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:02,590
was born into an analog world and I

979
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:05,830
became a young adult and a digital age

980
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:10,240
when it showed up and you know I

981
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:13,029
remember my uncles only having physical

982
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:15,549
toys to play with yes I started life

983
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:18,000
with physical toys and up until I was a

984
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:20,800
teenager and then when I was a teenager

985
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,570

987
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:35,320

994
00:41:54,250 --> 00:42:00,130

00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,429
next refresh wash it out wash it out

1288
00:56:29,568 --> 00:56:37,460
what's a what's a spiritual dose

1289
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:40,699
forgetty a lot probably more than I

1290
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:43,220
should talk about in the show know when

1291
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:47,059
I do find the need for those like and I

1292
00:56:43,219 --> 00:56:49,909
can tell like you I'm not a religious

1293
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:51,920
man like I like to consider myself a

1294
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:55,848
relatively spiritual man

1295
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,700
like in the sense that I try to flow

1296
00:56:55,849 --> 00:57:01,309
with the universe I try to go and I try

1297
00:56:58,699 --> 00:57:03,558
to be aware of my surroundings you know

1298
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:05,980
when I feel like I need to get back to

1299
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:09,048
the part of my brain that I shut away

1300
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:12,318
day after day when I go to work I lock

1301
00:57:09,048 --> 00:57:14,659
in the back of my mind that you know the

1302
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:17,119
the the thing of the the creative

1303
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:19,068
thoughts that flow and sit like that I

1304
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:23,210
smoke weed to [ __ ] deal with stress

1305
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:25,929
and I enjoy taste and like and you know

1306
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:29,659
like I feel better smoking weed but

1307
00:57:25,929 --> 00:57:33,440
that's the numb the pain like I I do i

1308
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:35,328
do hallucinogens to to look the pain in

1309
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,740
the eye and see what's going on I don't

1310
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:38,420
know about y'all but every time I get

1311
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:42,979
done I kind of know what I need to do

1312
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:45,920
with yeah I'd be real with myself when I

1313
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:48,318
do it and I'm very introspective when I

1314
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,240
do hallucinogens I don't like to do them

1315
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:52,219
at parties or the three exactly yeah

1316
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:56,239
yeah but by yourself by the campfire

1317
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:59,078
just get out so you're three gram 5

1318
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:02,000
grams 7 gram kind of guys though 7 girl

1319
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:03,440
you do it that's the students over here

1320
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,469
shaking his head that just getting

1321
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,970
started or not blowing out of the water

1322
00:58:05,469 --> 00:58:09,139
he said I'm too old for that [ __ ] that's

1323
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:11,899
everybody who ever wants to remain

1324
00:58:09,139 --> 00:58:13,219
anonymous on the podcast ok he's too old

1325
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,200
we got another I'm too old for that [ __ ]

1326
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:21,108
we got a couple of them - we got it we

1327
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:22,818
got one guy he doesn't like them I love

1328
00:58:21,108 --> 00:58:25,400
them sounds like Kevin enjoyed himself

1329
00:58:22,818 --> 00:58:34,329
the last time I think I saw some

1330
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:34,329
Instagram videos yes we were nothing

1331
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:40,440
well we're not gonna incriminate anybody

1332
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:44,789
oh yeah that has to come out man the

1333
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:47,070
oars were wonderful that day I totally

1334
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:50,519
think that you know with my experience

1335
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:53,309
in the past with it and like it should

1336
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:56,429
absolutely be thought of as a type of

1337
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:58,679
therapy for for a lot of people's

1338
00:58:56,429 --> 00:59:03,379
possibly don't produce dopamine which

1339
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:05,819
are like a lot of TBI people because of

1340
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:08,430
because of our long-running more we have

1341
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:11,220
a lot of TBI survivors that also have

1342
00:59:08,429 --> 00:59:13,500
PTSD and that really works we're kind of

1343
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:16,618
both of those yeah I see in the

1344
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,690
headlines a lot that you know that that

1345
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:20,789
is like something that they're trying to

1346
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:23,900
at least get some attention on and I

1347
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:27,119
think because of Colorado we have a huge

1348
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:29,160
military population yes we do that's

1349
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:32,309
right we have a lot of veterans here

1350
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:34,469
that have been through those wars yeah

1351
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:36,358
so I think maybe that has something to

1352
00:59:34,469 --> 00:59:40,559
do with why they are looking into it

1353
00:59:36,358 --> 00:59:43,319
here well I mean it makes sense I think

1354
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:46,079
that the large population really has a

1355
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:48,930
lot of the VA here and now I think

1356
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:52,588
honestly with the the the pressure that

1357
00:59:48,929 --> 00:59:55,759
they've had on them from our soldiers

1358
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:58,039
coming home that are you know the VA

1359
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,839
typically their mo is kind of like

1360
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:03,570
medicate the problems yeah heavily

1361
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:06,599
heavily I think their pressure for

1362
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:08,039
marijuana has got the same people

1363
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:11,400
showing up saying there's other

1364
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:16,320
alternatives not just marijuana but you

1365
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:20,099
know LSD mushrooms therapeutic doses

1366
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:23,580
micro dosing mushrooms I know a lot of

1367
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:25,650
people that that are that micro dose

1368
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:27,539
that say this is like changes anything

1369
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:29,849
about my I follow people on Instagram

1370
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:31,349
that do a journal every day I take this

1371
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:33,300
much and this is how it's improving

1372
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:34,588
I see it working for people I think

1373
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,940
everything that's growing out of the

1374
01:00:34,588 --> 01:00:37,769
earth was put here for a reason some a

1375
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,440
little [ __ ] kill you some of it at

1376
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:42,630
the right dose will cure you the same

1377
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,309
same thing the wrong dose will just ruin

1378
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:46,170
you I never encourage anybody to

1379
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:48,090
recklessly do anything

1380
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:51,000
like never do anything that jeopardize

1381
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:53,579
anything you know you know like I've

1382
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,400
always chose to do a row I do it in a

1383
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:58,309
safe environment when I do any kind of

1384
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,410
hallucinogens you know like I never

1385
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:03,840
would drive or have that like you'd be

1386
01:01:01,409 --> 01:01:06,480
lucky to get me out of my bed well if I

1387
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,309
had seven grams that once I would not be

1388
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:13,650
driving that's the way to do it that's

1389
01:01:08,309 --> 01:01:15,539
the way you get seven I do I do there's

1390
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:17,130
a difference in a spiritual dose in a

1391
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:18,119
micro dose that's absolutely and I if

1392
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:20,280
I'm going in I'm going for that

1393
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:22,139
spiritual experience I need to look in

1394
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,370
there and have the problem identify and

1395
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:28,440
then dance around on my head and then

1396
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:29,489
find a solution to that problem there

1397
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,409
are other things that will take me to

1398
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:32,759
that room much more quickly and reveal

1399
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:35,369
problems for me but we'll talk about

1400
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,630
those on other episodes oh boy I've got

1401
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:40,069
a little giggles throughout the room for

1402
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:40,070

1403
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:48,510

could see maybe maybe functioning off

1445
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:51,549
one light puff that but - you start

1446
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:54,880
getting somewhere in three years all

1447
01:03:51,548 --> 01:03:57,909
these great analogies now listen listen

1448
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,430
these are great analogies but somebody

1449
01:03:57,909 --> 01:04:04,989
once told me I think it was a Joe Rogan

1450
01:04:00,429 --> 01:04:07,868
podcast that I heard and he said doing

1451
01:04:04,989 --> 01:04:13,449
DMT is like having your computer desktop

1452
01:04:07,869 --> 01:04:16,420
and it's like doing DMT takes all the

1453
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:19,389
files on your desktop and shrinks them

1454
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:22,389
down into one file that was labeled wild

1455
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:27,639
[ __ ] yeah

1456
01:04:22,389 --> 01:04:30,118
yeah and I has a real good analogy I

1457
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:32,500
have way too many [ __ ]

1458
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:37,028
responsibilities to not give a [ __ ]

1459
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:40,179
about them I'm scared to death that I'm

1460
01:04:37,028 --> 01:04:43,028
going to do DMT and go it doesn't do

1461
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:45,338
that to you it doesn't dive you already

1462
01:04:43,028 --> 01:04:59,230
know pimpin you already know I've never

1463
01:04:45,338 --> 01:05:00,639
talked about this on the five and that's

1464
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:02,740
the problem it won't run my life but

1465
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:04,929
it'll change it drastically it will take

1466
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:06,489
I change your thought process not as

1467
01:05:04,929 --> 01:05:08,859
drastically as you're gonna think it's

1468
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:10,449
and it's very I haven't done a

1469
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:11,890
psychedelic drug since my traumatic

1470
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:13,239
brain injury had a severe traumatic

1471
01:05:11,889 --> 01:05:14,679
brain injury and for a little while I

1472
01:05:13,239 --> 01:05:16,868
heard a humming noise that would not go

1473
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:19,419
away and it was terrible and that noise

1474
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:21,940
is gone and I'm afraid that if I do any

1475
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:22,900
drugs it's gonna come back and if it

1476
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:24,550
comes back I don't know how I'm gonna

1477
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:26,710
handle it especially if I'm tripping or

1478
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:28,510
something so I'm afraid but before then

1479
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:31,900
it would not be rare to find me doing a

1480
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:35,800
blast of DMT what I felt like it would

1481
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:37,660
do I describe him as the mooninites from

1482
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,789
Aqua Teen Hunger Force those little

1483
01:05:37,659 --> 01:05:41,649
square guys yeah those little guys you

1484
01:05:39,789 --> 01:05:43,690
take a blast of DMT arrest your

1485
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:45,519
microphone you fall back into the chair

1486
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,720
and those little guys danced around in

1487
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:49,329
front of me and all they said was hey

1488
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:50,949
it's okay and they just kept like

1489
01:05:49,329 --> 01:05:53,739
rubbing me on my knee and on my shoulder

1490
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:54,849
and then go it's okay bro and you start

1491
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:57,069
thinking about all that well what could

1492
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:58,118
they mean and that triggers you to go

1493
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:59,530
well what could they mean and then you

1494
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:02,440
remember well that happened when I was a

1495
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:04,330
kid [ __ ] and then I go home okay I guess

1496
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,800
it's okay remember all this dumb [ __ ]

1497
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:08,440
that you've suppressed or that you're

1498
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,760
dealing with or whatever dumb [ __ ]

1499
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,108
trivial [ __ ] that shouldn't even be

1500
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,480
bugging you it pops up in your head

1501
01:06:11,108 --> 01:06:15,429
vividly it's got spotlights on it but

1502
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,900
you can rotate it in every direction you

1503
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:17,949
can look at it from the bottom you can

1504
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,750
look at it from the side and you've

1505
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:21,429
stepped back and you can pivot it all

1506
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,108
around and then those little those

1507
01:06:21,429 --> 01:06:25,000
little guys they go hey bro did you ever

1508
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:27,789
think of this maybe you're just clinging

1509
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,159
to some stupid [ __ ] it's okay and then

1510
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:33,639
you come out of it and you go oh it's

1511
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:35,529
okay it's okay it's like cleaning your

1512
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:37,000
stupid [ __ ] filter is kind of what it

1513
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:38,560
does it's a good way to get pat like if

1514
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,849
you're stuck on something if something

1515
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,730
happened and you got a thing in your

1516
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:44,949
brain like why this why or a [ __ ] how

1517
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:46,269
or or whatever look some DMT and put

1518
01:06:44,949 --> 01:06:49,149
that in your mind and you'll you'll know

1519
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:51,039
why or how I gotta go to work realizing

1520
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:53,500

1741
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,189
