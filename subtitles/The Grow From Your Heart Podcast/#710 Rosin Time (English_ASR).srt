doing a hash episode on 710 then we'll

125
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,919
delve deeply into making concentrates

126
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
what i want to focus on in this episode

127
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,438
is i want to get the audience the

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,280
listeners uh basically self-sufficient i

129
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,358
want them to be able to grow uh from

130
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,958
seed or clone however they're growing uh

131
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,719
manage their grow all the way up to

132
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
getting that dab onto the nail and

133
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
taking a fat hit of their product pedro

134
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,040
got excited he's about to take that fat

135
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,519
rip right now cheers brother enjoy that

136
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,280
uh so let's uh briefly talk about what

137
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,159
710 is a lot of people might not even

138
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,638
know why we are celebrating 7 10 uh the

139
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,040
710th episode uh so let's give them a

140
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,600
quick update uh since pedro has taken a

141
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,360
dab ryan do you have any input on what

142
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,960
710 means i'll let you talk for a minute

143
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
because i feel like i talk a lot on the

144
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,399
show

145
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,240
well 710 to me is kind of a newer thing

146
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,478
i mean it's you know it's oil backwards

147
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,040
uh it's for us dabbers these days that's

148
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,879
the new 420. that's exactly what i would

149
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,840
have said it is the new 420 it's

150
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,879
upgraded 420 420 for big kids

151
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,038
absolutely

152
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,719
upgrade your tolerance all right so

153
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,478
basically that is uh what i would have

154
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,240
said it is the new 420. i agree

155
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,000
we're all agreeing it is the new 420 if

156
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,280
you turn the word oil upside down it

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
does say 7

158
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,198
7 so when that clock strikes 7 10 we

159
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
used to smoke a bowl at 4 12 i still

160
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,000
smoke a ball at 420 but now also i'm

161
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,240
taking a dab at 7 10. so today's just

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,600
another excuse that's like we needed it

163
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,918
i was just going to say we actually did

164
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,560
take one on 710.

165
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,839
yes oh we actually were we didn't even

166
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,639
really yeah beautiful seeing the

167
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,399
laughter itself out that way so 710 is

168
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,400
dab time so this is the seven tenth

169
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,799
episode uh i want to teach everybody how

170
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,599
to make their own dabs at home we're not

171
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,439
going to talk about bho um no uh

172
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,759
solventless stuff here because i don't

173
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,879
want to uh encourage anybody or teach

174
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,960
them how to hurt themselves there's a

175
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,399
lot of [ __ ] that can go wrong in that uh

176
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,879
no offense no hatred if you're doing

177
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,478
that do your thing but stay safe and

178
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,719
don't call me when you get blown up by

179
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,399
your own mistakes so i'd like to step in

180
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,600
there if i could for a second i want to

181
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,079
hear it brother that's what you're here

182
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,600
for it's good because you said something

183
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,879
that i hear a lot of people say and it

184
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
just it's like it's like sticking

185
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,759
something underneath my skin it just

186
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,439
just drives me nuts it's like a little

187
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,720
mosquito buzzing around your head i want

188
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,160
to show you i want to show you how to

189
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
make dabs

190
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,600
i want to show you how to make dabs it's

191
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,600
not dabs dabs are

192
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,280
a dab is like a like i'm gonna i don't

193
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,280
know it's a verb right

194
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,799
um so it's it's not a noun but we're

195
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,159
gonna show you how to make hash and how

196
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,478
to make rosin that's we're gonna talk

197
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,039
about today perfect thank you i

198
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,560
appreciate that live hopefully yeah

199
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:37,519
right yeah and we'll talk about the

200
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,120
differences yeah we'll talk about

201
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,959
differences let's jump into it now that

202
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,439
we're uh we're here this is the good

203
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,359
part to just jump off on uh let's talk

204
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,279
about the process i want to start with

205
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
kind of like uh

206
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,079
i'm hoping that a lot of the people

207
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,360
watching are growing their own product

208
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,159
as well they've got to get the product

209
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,240
to to wash the press from somewhere so

210
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,240
let's talk about are there any uh

211
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
significant differences in the grow if

212
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,840
we're gonna grow for flour when i grow i

213
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,680
grow for seed so my grow's way different

214
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,279
than most people most people are growing

215
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,879
for flower you guys are growing for

216
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,879
concentrate is there a big difference in

217
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,879
the way you treat the grow other than

218
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,478
most people

219
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,478
i would say i would say minimally

220
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,478
strained selection yeah i would agree i

221
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,879
would say randomly as far as

222
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,758
as far as like technique um the only

223
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,680
thing i can come up with would be

224
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,720
scrogging excessively so that you don't

225
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,598
get uh main big colas you want a very

226
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,400
consistent bud size um so

227
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,079
so you know it's a big scrog is

228
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,239
something that i really really strive

229
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,279
for my plans grow horizontally not

230
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,800
vertically

231
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,079
and that's what most people should be

232
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,360
doing now anyway no matter how you're

233
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,159
growing that's kind of the ideal way to

234
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,680
do it

235
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,240
it's a good way to maximize your space

236
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,319
really especially for us homegrowers i'm

237
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,079
a stronger i'm a four by four strokes

238
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,400
perfect all right let's let's step back

239
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,719
for a second can we explain

240
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,598
just as an overview

241
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,599
what

242
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,120
hash and rosin are and what we're trying

243
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,598
to achieve and why we're doing what

244
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,759
we're doing absolutely let's do it okay

245
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,598
so i like to explain it in a in a broad

246
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,520
sense um kind of like hash for dummies

247
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:10,319
right um try trichomes are the plants uh

248
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,758
a defense mechanism um for uv light and

249
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,160
for other and for bugs and pests and

250
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,919
whatnot you have to think of them as

251
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,520
well i think of them as millions and

252
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,159
billions and billions of little beach

253
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,799
balls on your plants right and those

254
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,319
beach balls are on top of a stock and we

255
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
don't need to get into technical terms

256
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,280
because that's just advanced classes

257
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,918
so you've got a billions of beach balls

258
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,478
on top of a stock what we are after from

259
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,158
a hash standpoint is those beach balls

260
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,879
all of those little beach balls they're

261
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,759
a little waxy cuticle filled with oil

262
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,958
hopefully filled with oil right and that

263
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,439
oil inside that waxy cuticle is what us

264
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,838
rosin heads are after we leave the waxy

265
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,240
cuticle behind in the hash and we

266
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,399
extract the oil which is where the 710

267
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,959
the oil comes from so

268
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,200
there's spots you can stop along the way

269
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,039
but that is kind of ultimately what we

270
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,839
are going after and everything that

271
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,120
we're going to be talking about

272
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,480
subsequently eases our access to those

273
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,639
trichome heads

274
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,480
okay

275
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,399
that's a perfect explanation yeah thank

276
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,159
you you yeah i don't even need notes

277
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,519
after you that's perfect

278
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,199
that was perfect i don't even have

279
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
anything to say after that

280
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,800
yeah

281
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,399
yeah case dismissed um so you said

282
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,079
trichome heads that's i'm going to jump

283
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,480
back to a conversation that we that i

284
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,080
interrupted before the show do trichome

285
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,159
head sizes make a big difference in

286
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,160
trichome shape

287
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,319
i would say yes absolutely we're after

288
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,759
those big trichome heads and we want

289
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,278
that weak neck that we can kind of break

290
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,838
off and get those beach balls as pedro

291
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:42,320
just explained yep yep and uh and it and

292
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,720
does the size the size not so much

293
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,800
but the uh shape you know if you've got

294
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,399
uh heads that are stuck together two

295
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,838
three four heads i mean you can have a

296
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,679
stalk with two three four heads stuck

297
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,360
together um they're going to collect in

298
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,838
different bags and whatnot so a

299
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,200
uniformity is also desirable as well in

300
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,519
size uh that being noted as i said

301
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,839
in a couple seconds ago the trichomes

302
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,919
are the plants uh protection against uv

303
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,000
light right so if you're if you're not

304
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,719
giving them uv light they have nothing

305
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,320
to create a protection against

306
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,959
um a lot of sun grown cannabis has big

307
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,519
juicy bulbous trichome hits because of

308
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,679
the extra uv light from the sun

309
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,879
so that that i did not i did not did not

310
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,159
know that so you're teaching me stuff

311
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,039
right now ryan i feel like keep that in

312
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,319
mind

313
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,759
yep and keep that in mind you're making

314
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
your led selections as well for your

315
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,639
lighting absolutely beautiful all right

316
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,480
so you guys if you're going to make

317
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,319
concentrates uh let's upgrade and get

318
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
some of those uh those leds with uv

319
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,680
lights in there that may help you out

320
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,519
bigger trichomes the better

321
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,559
um so the strain selection that was one

322
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,159
of the things that you mentioned that

323
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,879
it's all about a lot about strain

324
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,120
selection do you uh find a difference

325
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,120
back in the day dr dre taught us that we

326
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,278
want a sack of rocks everybody wants

327
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,639
dense buds if you go to the dispensary

328
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,480
all the buds are super dense you're

329
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,958
already i think you know where i'm going

330
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,480
is does the bud density really make a

331
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,000
difference for you concentrate makers

332
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,360
are those fluffier buds going to be more

333
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
ideal for you

334
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,959
yeah yeah it makes a huge difference all

335
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,720
right a lot easier to watch that's for

336
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,919
sure i was actually just talking or

337
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,680
somebody was i was reading through

338
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,120
discord and somebody was giving someone

339
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,399
a suggestion upon lights and this and

340
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,078
then i said if you don't give them

341
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,919
enough light you're gonna have airy buds

342
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,278
and they were like you're like oh that's

343
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,759
a bummer i don't want airy buds and i'm

344
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,879
like i do like i'd much rather have a

345
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,559
bud that the first wash just falls apart

346
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,200
rather than go in on the third wash and

347
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,559
see

348
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,720
dense nuggets that i still haven't

349
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,119
broken into you know i've always

350
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,639
explained it as if i took my fist and

351
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,720
moistened my fist and dunked it in

352
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,120
powdered sugar i get my fist worth of

353
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,040
trichomes on the outside here if i open

354
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,278
up my hand and do the same process i get

355
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,199
my palm all the insides of my fingers i

356
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,039
get that much more space for trichomes

357
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
and also like you said easier to wash i

358
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,799
don't have to wash inside of my fist i

359
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,319
got fingers open you can wash that i

360
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,319
really i thought that would be a thing

361
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,920
of the future some of what i breed isn't

362
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,760
super tight and super dense but i know

363
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,078
that it you press some strawberry

364
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,000
starburst and uh pedro and that was some

365
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,719
of the best rosin i've ever smoked that

366
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,720
changed my mind on raw and honestly nice

367
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,000
good yes sir uh big shout out to our

368
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,360
friend kelvin who grew that and then you

369
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,720
pressed that at the dude gross cup

370
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,120
um that was a hell of a freaking thing

371
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,639
wasn't that a good time

372
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,799
i missed those events that put a smile

373
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,159
on my face all these times come back

374
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,240
right hopefully these times come back

375
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,000
soon yeah oh yeah it's coming back

376
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,919
around now we're talking about making

377
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,399
concentrate making concentrates out of

378
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,919
trichomes from plants that were growing

379
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,440
one of my main questions was do we treat

380
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:30,879
them any differently it seems like we

381
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
just grow them like normal try not to

382
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,240
scrog them take good care of them how do

383
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,399
we manage pests a lot of people are

384
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,720
putting pesticides on plants i don't

385
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,120
want to smoke pesticides especially

386
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,639
pesticide concentrates in my concentrate

387
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,078
how do you guys manage pests in your

388
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,799
your garden wait who's spraying

389
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,799
pesticides

390
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,919
wait a second what are you guys doing

391
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,720
nothing gets sprayed in my flower room

392
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,479
period nothing no foliar no nothing in

393
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,320
my flower room um and that's just the

394
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,399
way it is i'm i'm just sacrilegious

395
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,160
about it it doesn't happen uh if i have

396
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,519
pests in my flower room we cut we start

397
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,120
over

398
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,600
wow that's dedicated i'm pretty much the

399
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
same way so uh same way no no sprays or

400
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,200
anything like that in my flower room if

401
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,879
i do have any issues uh for me it's

402
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,519
generally thrips up here we get thrips

403
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,320
quite a bit um i usually do grease green

404
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,399
lacewing larvae they work really good

405
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,000
simple cheap one round usually takes

406
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,759
care pretty much right through flour and

407
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,839
uh that does it man other than that i'm

408
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,759
a big doctor's arms person pretty much

409
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,240
uh through veg

410
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,919
cockney and green cleaner enzymatics i

411
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,000
will agree with the beneficial bugs

412
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,759
greatly i generally try to stick with

413
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,278
them in veg but of course they carry

414
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,360
over in front of the flower so yeah i

415
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,559
agree with that i concur big time i was

416
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,560
hoping that that would be the answer was

417
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,078
the beneficial predators there and i'm

418
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,679
glad you said lace wings those have been

419
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,120
some of my favorite in a commercial grow

420
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,278
especially in colorado because they

421
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,278
tolerate uh all types of environments

422
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,439
they don't die off as quickly as your

423
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,799
swarovskis and hypoaspis and they stick

424
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,320
around a little bit

425
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,198
all right and those those larvae are

426
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
hungry

427
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,479
oh yeah those little crocodiles they

428
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,039
they go crazy

429
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,039
cool as hell

430
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,480
oh really they'll bite the [ __ ] out of

431
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,240
you yeah i think that i'm pretty sure

432
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,159
that's what was biting us right they'll

433
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
bite the [ __ ] out of you all right so

434
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,919
we've talked a lot about the grow

435
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,240
process grow it don't spray it uh try to

436
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,958
get the even sized buds we want bigger

437
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,360
trichomes that seems to be a thing let's

438
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,000
get into the process of actually making

439
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,480
the concentrates here um i don't know

440
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,519
the first thing about making any sort of

441
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,759
rosin

442
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,198
any live rosin so

443
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,278
let's say we are right to the day of

444
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,439
harvest uh what do we do if we're going

445
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,480
to make concentrates i know a lot of us

446
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,079
are going to freeze it some of us are

447
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,199
going to press it right away what are

448
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,039
the differences that we're going to run

449
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,759
into can you teach me how to harvest for

450
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,198
concentrate production

451
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,319
yeah the first thing that comes to mind

452
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,679
is cold

453
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,839
cold cold cold

454
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,359
all right and then it comes down to yeah

455
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,040
are we doing fresh are we doing a half

456
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,639
dry are we doing a full dry as far as

457
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,519
i'm concerned that's kind of the three

458
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,278
things that we can do um and i'll let

459
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,919
rosin take to take the fresh because he

460
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,360
says he likes fresh so go live bro i i i

461
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,000
really like the fresh stuff uh pretty

462
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,440
much uh uh you know most of my my top

463
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,519
buds and stuff for the most part i

464
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,360
pretty much generally keep for smoking

465
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,039
i generally do it all for myself so all

466
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,399
my larf anything that doesn't have any

467
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,719
kind of bag of peel pretty much goes

468
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,399
right to my hash bags uh i fresh freeze

469
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,639
it that night

470
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,799
and then i pretty much try to process it

471
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,959
as soon as i possibly can um if i tend

472
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,198
to store it i do vacuum seal it and keep

473
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,039
it frozen that way um the longer the

474
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,599
storage obviously the worse terpene

475
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,838
preservation is everything obviously

476
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,959
um so other than that like pedro said

477
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,120
cold cold cold um i'm a strong believer

478
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,198
in distilled water i like my water super

479
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,799
super cold i don't like to wash unless

480
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,559
it's winter time generally

481
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,078
you know garage is a perfect place for

482
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,838
that this time of year

483
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,958
i've got the words washing weather on my

484
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,959
notes here i was going to talk about

485
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,958
that it is beautiful washing weather it

486
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,638
is i don't touch anything all summer

487
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,000
long really you don't even mess with it

488
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,000
in the summer

489
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,519
i don't personally know what's the uh

490
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,039
what's like the temperature threshold

491
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,120
when you start going oh it's washing

492
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,120
season what gets you excited

493
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,039
oh soon as i see that snow fly okay

494
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,399
that's all i can think about pedro's got

495
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,919
a big silly grin

496
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,958
yeah i was just like i was just letting

497
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,278
him go i'm just thinking about where i

498
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,958
can fill in here and where

499
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,600
snowboard kids and the hash washers get

500
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,439
excited at that first time

501
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,720
i have a cold room i built myself a cold

502
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,440
room

503
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,519
so i can make it 32 degrees in my room

504
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,040
when it's 100 degrees outside

505
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,720
um and i always wash in 32-33 degree

506
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,759
weather if i can

507
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,440
um

508
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,278
especially with fresh frozen my god

509
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,959
especially with fresh frozen that's some

510
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,799
of that's one of the nuances that uh

511
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,239
that that doesn't get talked about

512
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,159
enough

513
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,759
is people you know fresh frozen fresh

514
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,958
frozen have you ever touched a [ __ ]

515
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,680
plant

516
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:52,000
you ever seen how sticky a plant is

517
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,838
now collect all those sticky balls

518
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,759
right so that's why we do it in the cold

519
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,839
the cold takes away a lot of the

520
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,399
immediate stick right and it also

521
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,399
brittles the trichome heads um and if

522
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,640
you're doing fresh frozen that's

523
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,480
immensely more important to to get it

524
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,919
cold and to have them break off and to

525
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,759
remain cold

526
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,400
if you have if you have fresh frozen

527
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,240
hash that gets above

528
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,519
goodness sometimes 50 degrees it's

529
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,959
already starting to congeal it's already

530
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,480
starting to melt together it's already

531
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,078
starting to lose its beach sand

532
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,360
consistency

533
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:27,198
so fresh frozen is not a beginner game

534
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:31,199
fresh frozen is an advanced player game

535
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,679
cold cold cold is immensely important

536
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,519
anything again anything above 40 degrees

537
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,280
and you're starting to get problematic

538
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,759
with your with your bag your collection

539
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,079
bag stuff sticking to them um trichome

540
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,919
sticking to spoons uh just being a

541
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,279
nightmare um

542
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,440
absolutely kind of one of those do you

543
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,599
even keep going i was just going to say

544
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,200
i even like to keep a a bucket of cold

545
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,759
water right next to me as i'm washing so

546
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,080
i can put my bags right in it yeah my

547
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,879
bags going up my spoon goes into a

548
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,879
little

549
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,039
cup with ice water in it absolutely yeah

550
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,600
like when i say cold

551
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,279
i hope i'm not being underestimated

552
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,798
30 degrees that if you're not if you're

553
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,798
from the coast one of the coast 30

554
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,400
degrees doesn't make sense to you uh but

555
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,160
30 go in the walk-in cooler or wherever

556
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,240
if you work at a restaurant go in there

557
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,798
that's not 30 degrees it's colder than

558
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,839
that at 30 degrees yeah it's probably

559
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,200
not 30. yeah walk in your starting water

560
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,720
stand in your walk-in cooler for eight

561
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,840
hours and tell me how you feel

562
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,079
yeah i was going to ask if you can get

563
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,599
dizzy in there not physically get dizzy

564
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,119
your wife's name is dizzy can you get

565
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,798
dizzy to even walk in that walk-in

566
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,000
cooler yeah she'll walk in and bring me

567
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,000
lunch or something that's about it

568
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,960
yeah i don't i can't keep my like i

569
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,558
can't keep my dab briggs in there it's

570
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,079
too cold you know

571
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,160
yeah i can't dab in there i can't go you

572
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,759
can't water would get frozen oh because

573
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,519
i was gonna mention

574
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,200
do you keep your your water ice cold too

575
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,319
like do you keep uh like i use distilled

576
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,840
water and i always keep it in a beer

577
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,319
fridge before i generally use it keep it

578
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:57,519
right at that 33 degree mark i have

579
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,678
three 44 gallon drums as my res is in my

580
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,720
room underneath my my cabinets and those

581
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,720
get ice

582
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,919
i mean dude when i go why when i when i

583
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,919
wash i'll bet i'll go through

584
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,960
a couple hundred pounds of ice

585
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,960
yep wow it's just a lot even though my

586
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,960
room is that cold even though my room is

587
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,558
sure everything is ice cold period

588
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,720
you're using at least 25 pounds usually

589
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,558
per 5 gallon wash yeah yeah oh yeah and

590
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,319
then and four gallons of distilled cold

591
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,119
cold water yeah i don't use distilled

592
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:30,639
for the wash um i'm over that i will use

593
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,439
ro for my final rinse um i will say that

594
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,799
the

595
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
the higher quality water that you're

596
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,319
going to use in minimal increments are

597
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,520
going to be higher quality concentrates

598
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,879
for sure

599
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,240
absolutely

600
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,080
for us we use well water so you don't

601
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,000
want that trace yeah yeah definitely

602
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,399
that taste to kind of transfer through

603
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
agreed agreed mineral flavor let's go

604
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,000
back real quick though to the to the

605
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,279
fresh and then half and then and then

606
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,440
the other dry because i think i covered

607
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,519
it real good with the fresh but there's

608
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,519
other options you know if you can't

609
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,359
achieve 32 degrees you know you got

610
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,440
outside it's got 40s the best i can do

611
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,000
bro or

612
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,159
there's a bunch of different things um i

613
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,319
i highly recommend a half dry like it's

614
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,720
one of my like go-to's i feel like i've

615
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,798
kind of underlined that in the industry

616
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,480
right um and i and i say half dry

617
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,839
anymore because people want to [ __ ]

618
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,000
tie you down they want to be like what

619
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,199
is it four and a half days bro like you

620
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,640
know it's

621
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,720
you know it's that half dry it's that

622
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,559
when the outside of the bud just starts

623
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,360
to get crunchy but the inner side of the

624
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:30,480
butt is still is still uh

625
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:34,240
hydrated you know that's about when i'll

626
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,159
hang my flowers you know 50 50 60 60. 60

627
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,798
and if i brush over that 50 degrees 50

628
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,840
humidity 60 degrees 60 humidity in that

629
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,558
window

630
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,639
dry for the half right your eight days

631
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,759
your seven days your whatever your half

632
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,919
dry is

633
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,919
then buck that off here's another thing

634
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,120
that i think we do we don't underline it

635
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,600
when in techniques is again millions of

636
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,839
little trichome heads millions of little

637
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,319
balls filled with oil right be careful

638
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,798
with that [ __ ] man don't don't molest it

639
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,319
at all you know people want to use

640
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,599
trimmers and they want to bounce their

641
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,119
[ __ ] and they want no as as easy and as

642
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,038
careful as you can

643
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,399
each trichome head is another little bit

644
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,158
of oil that you're trying to that you're

645
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
trying to extract

646
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,080
and then and then there's the full then

647
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,159
there's a full dry and as we progress

648
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,599
through the from the fresh to the half

649
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,919
to the full dry

650
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:27,119
the trichome heads get more brittle they

651
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,200
get less sticky less terpene content um

652
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,759
so they're a little bit easier to handle

653
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,558
yes i said less terpene content not to

654
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:37,440
the point of degradation necessarily but

655
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:40,000
to the ease of handling you know um so

656
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,120
there's definitely some uh tricks you

657
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,960
know when you're when you're they're

658
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,319
half dry you can probably wash in 40

659
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,960
degree weather when you're full dry you

660
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,399
can maybe wash in 50 degree weather

661
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,200
that brings me to the conversation are

662
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,960
you a wet trimmer or dry charm

663
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,240
so when i harvest i'll take off

664
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,480
everything with uh with without trikes

665
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,599
everything without trikes goes away and

666
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,200
it brings me another thing to fill in

667
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,158
one of your blanks you said you keep

668
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,679
flour

669
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,600
we don't

670
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,720
we we have a couple plants that i grow

671
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:10,158
mimosas specifically um and a couple

672
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,159
other very few ones that will actually

673
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,280
keep for flour i don't personally smoke

674
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,280
flour like hardly at all um dizzy smokes

675
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,879
a lot more flour than i do i'm just i'm

676
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,918
a straight hash head

677
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,720
um

678
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,080
so yeah we're 50 50. so we keep uh

679
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,440
you know

680
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,960
flour and good hash in the house

681
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,159
absolutely and the hash just hit me in

682
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,400
the face and i forgot where i was going

683
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,400
with that

684
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,320
i just took a dab and stumbled over my

685
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,320
words

686
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,759
you don't save any of it uh what doesn't

687
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,678
have trichomes comes off you don't save

688
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,038
any of it for flower production perfect

689
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,720
and then and then it just gets bucked

690
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,079
straight into a bag you know from from

691
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,279
fresh if it's fresh it gets bucked

692
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,199
straight into a bag straight into the

693
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,038
freezer if it's half dry it gets dried

694
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,558
halfway get bucked straight into a bag

695
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,640
into the freezer if it's dried it gets

696
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,720
dried fully bucked into a bag put into

697
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,720
the freezer

698
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,400
i'm starting to understand why i see the

699
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,000
rosin's twice the price of other

700
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,080
concentrates on the shelf i didn't

701
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
understand but now now that i see that

702
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,599
you're getting you said like a few

703
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,519
pounds of herb gave you a very tiny

704
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,119
amount i was like that's all you get so

705
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,960
now i kind of i understand there's a lot

706
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,279
of work to go into it as well that's

707
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,159
funny it's definitely a lot lower to me

708
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:20,079
that uh that number is astronomical

709
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,440
uh what i what he's referring to is

710
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,599
earlier in a podcast i said that my

711
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,200
critical cush on average gives me if i

712
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,719
push the limits gives me two and a half

713
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,558
ounces of rosin per pound of flour

714
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,558
and if you think about the the market

715
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,798
prices on the on the recreational market

716
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,879
price right now flowers and the

717
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:37,839
wholesale prices for flowers in the 300

718
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,159
range

719
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:44,240
you know so uh wholesale pricing for

720
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,760
rosin is in the 15 to 30 dollar a gram

721
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,400
range so you can do the math and you can

722
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,240
see it quickly adds up all right i see

723
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,919
good rosin on shelves for eighty hundred

724
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,519
and twenty dollars a gram for the top

725
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,278
shelf [ __ ] i see that that's what it

726
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,879
sells for out here too

727
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,960
massachusetts and

728
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,360
our surrounding states are 80 to 100 a

729
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,679
gram for good rosin yeah yeah and i was

730
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,839
i was referring to the wholesale side

731
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,360
the yes not the purchase price yeah

732
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,240
absolutely yeah you guys don't come here

733
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,319
thinking you're gonna get it for the

734
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,759
price page that is wholesale yeah that

735
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,119
is whole that's that's wholesale on the

736
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,200
recreational market that's why i said

737
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,119
that because i i'm starting

738
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
i didn't i didn't mention that in the

739
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,479
intro and because i don't

740
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,480
we're still in kind of the infancy

741
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,640
phases and everything i'm busting my ass

742
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,120
putting in crazy hours but we are

743
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,400
entering the recreational and med market

744
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,599
um we as in pedro i guess i say we and

745
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,679

we're moving into you know every people

752
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,558
have been asking me for years if they

753
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,760
can purchase my rosin and the answer is

754
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:56,158
resoundingly no i'm sorry you can't um

755
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,000
but soon to be you will be able to

756
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,080
purchase rosin that i've actually made

757
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,440
excellent the world the world will look

758
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,278

very cool hit the rec market with that

760
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,480
pedro rosin all right i love it people

761
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:07,839
can come talk about what i've been

762
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,839
talking about the stuff that changed my

763
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,759
opinion on rosin that's that's crazy to

764
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,879
hear that's that that's crazy as i say

765
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,798
he's gonna have to send me a little bit

766
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,960
so i can sample that possibly allegedly

767
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:16,960
well

768
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,679
allegedly we'll all meet at the denver

769
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,278
airport yeah there we go there we go

770
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,600
just for the sake of recording purposes

771
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:28,880
you know um so we were in the middle of

772
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,199
talking about the half dry uh process

773
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,159
um we got to uh i don't even remember

774
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
where we got to because i'm not a

775
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,520
concentrate maker i don't know if you

776
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,278
were done with that part

777
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,798
i don't think you remember either uh no

778
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,359
i was pretty much done with that i think

779
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,759
um it's it's literally just differences

780
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,038
in climates well not literally just but

781
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,359
it's differences in climates that i

782
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,359
wanted to kind of underline and i wanted

783
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,038
to underline the point um that people

784
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,199
that are just starting to do this should

785
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:56,400
absolutely not start with fresh frozen

786
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,000
and that is just an underlying do not do

787
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,759
it period um start with start with dried

788
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,599
uh if you want to get crazy and think

789
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,839
you're somebody then go ahead and do the

790
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,599
half frozen but pay attention to what i

791
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,439
just said or they're not the half frozen

792
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,038
a half dry but pay attention to what i

793
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,880
just said i would highly recommend

794
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,640
anybody that's starting to wash their

795
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,120
first wash washes dry material

796
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,080
uh how dry like cured or just dry just

797
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,319
dry just dry just dry yeah yeah i i

798
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,240
always when i'm processing for rosin

799
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,678
it's either fresh

800
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,200
bag freezer

801
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,200
half dry bag freezer or dry bag freezer

802
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,080
and that doesn't mean dry and cure bag

803
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,000
free it's dry then freezer

804
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,839
agreed and that freezing process from

805
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,440
what i understand that's like uh and

806
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,959
this is scary to say just because i'm a

807
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,240
guy with dreadlocks it kind of thinks of

808
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,679
if you get gum and your hair or

809
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,798
something you used to freeze the gum and

810
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,159
it would come out of your hair it's kind

811
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:49,918
of the same idea i get when you talk

812
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,799
about breaking those trichome heads off

813
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,038
in the freeze is that correct yes which

814
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,480
is why we which is why we underline

815
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:57,679
being careful with it when i take it out

816
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,839
of the freezer i don't throw the [ __ ]

817
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,519
over my shoulder and i can walk into the

818
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,480
you know it's very delicate process

819
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,158
because i want to collect those

820
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,000
trichometes i thought a weed said same

821
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,679
thing when you're trimming it

822
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,960
definitely saw weed santa

823
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,240
and he said it right there and when

824
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,480
you're trimming when you're handling it

825
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,200
when you're everything you know when

826
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,599
when i bring someone into my grow to

827
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,679
to harvest or to to help me with the

828
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,798
process of pre you know basically

829
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,519
harvest

830
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,119
if i see a lot of ras a resin all over

831
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,558
your gloves and [ __ ]

832
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,918
we're gonna have a little bit of a talk

833
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,918
yeah a little why is that what are you

834
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,080
doing to those pods yeah stop molesting

835
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,840
my [ __ ] bro exactly there's at least

836
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,319
half a gram on your fingers right there

837
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,519
yeah so if super cold is one go ahead

838
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,119
ryan i don't mean to cut you off as i

839
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,398
say that's what i i feel like wet

840
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,839
trimming honestly there's you got a

841
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,278
little bit less handling and those

842
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,278
trichomes are a little less brittle i

843
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,599
think when they're wet too i feel like

844
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,440
uh those everything's more intact and

845
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,278
just better overall if you're doing a

846
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,840
wet trim if you're going to watch see if

847
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,798
that makes sense for me trimming is only

848
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,720
a flower thing if i'm going to if i'm

849
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,398
going to rosin there's

850
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,960
trim doesn't happen

851
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:02,959
if that makes

852
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,359
you don't but you probably don't trim

853
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,038
your lowers right you just throw that in

854
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:14,719
the bag no yeah

855
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:17,119
so so for your rosin you're not trimming

856
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,798
correct yep all my lowers larv anything

857
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,959
that has zero bag appeal dude right to

858
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,599
the hatchback yeah for sure literally my

859
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,720
entire heart my every bit of my harvest

860
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,038
go right in the freezer it's pretty

861
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,038
crazy

862
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,798
i want that freeze dryer too brother

863
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,720
ryan just segwayed for me we're trying

864
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,240
to keep the stuff cold uh is freeze

865
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,798
drying this bud an option is that

866
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,399
something that's useful

867
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,398
you got excited about that yeah all

868
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,398
right it's something that has been

869
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,519
talked about a lot

870
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,519
um

871
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:53,038
controversial as well and and maybe not

872
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,480
enough uh i think yes it's true super

873
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,599
controversial

874
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,798
i think that for smoking flour freeze

875
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,879
drying your buds is not applicable

876
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,960
um you're locking a lot of stuff in in

877
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,399
the plant you're just removing moisture

878
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,798
but you're locking a lot of stuff in the

879
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:12,239
plant that you that would otherwise

880
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,398
off gas and and dry and you know

881
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,399
chlorophyll yeah chlorophylls

882
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,398
was the one big thing i was thinking

883
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:19,918
about chlorophyll exactly chlorophyll it

884
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,719
tastes like green bug

885
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,720
that being said if we're not smoking the

886
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,558
flower we're just collecting the

887
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,759
trichome heads

888
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:33,678
is that a viable option you get very dry

889
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:37,038
dense or not dry dense very dry brittle

890
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,038
buds and trikes

891
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,119
it's it's viable but god damn think

892
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,799
about the price man it's 36 hours for a

893
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,319
freeze dry session and you can probably

894
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:49,119
put a half a pound in a big freeze dryer

895
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,200
so

896
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,359
would you it's very interesting you guys

897
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,480
want to spend 300 a gram you know like

898
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,519
man

899
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,440
so no uh viable but possible

900
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,798
with the with the tools and freeze

901
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,000
dryers and stuff that we have right now

902
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,918
no

903
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,359
for freeze drying flour now freeze

904
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,440
drying the hash

905
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,278
as far as i'm concerned that's like the

906
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,200
big step up in

907
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,798
in in question absolutely

908
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,919
definitely next level and uh that's

909
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,079
that's another thing we can talk about

910
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,480
is how you actually uh

911
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,558
try and process afterwards after we wash

912
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,720
uh for me i'm a homegrower freeze dryers

913
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:25,359
are expensive so that's that's a tough

914
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,759
thing for me so for me uh that was a big

915
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,079
uh a step uh to learn

916
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,960
as well just to preserve those terpenes

917
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,639
so for me uh i like i don't even press

918
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,960
it right out of the bag pretty much on

919
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,640
the pressing screens i keep it in a ball

920
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,880
i fresh freeze it and i got microplaned

921
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,559
the crap out of it um and that's the

922
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,399
only way i really can do it just flash

923
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,480
freeze it microplane it make it that

924
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,239
sandy material pretty much scattered

925
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,919
across a piece of parchment paper and

926
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,839
dry it as fast as you possibly can in a

927
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:56,320
24-hour period but at a cooler

928
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,319
temperature pizza box pizza box tech

929
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,000
i just i just i microplaned it put it on

930
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,839
a big piece of parchment paper and i

931
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,679
just set it on a counter in a garage at

932
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,240
40 50 degrees and it's pretty much dry

933
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,559
by the next day it's a very uh

934
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,679
low relative immunity here so sure it's

935
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,519
pretty much ready to rock by the next

936
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,640
day a lot of people also use uh they'll

937
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:18,640
put that parchment inside pizza boxes um

938
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,640
the car the cardboard makes it

939
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:21,918
when you turn it into dust basically

940
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,599
right you use the little file and turn

941
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,759
it to sand

942
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,278
yeah yeah so he's like like a lemon

943
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,919
zester he

944
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:33,759
breezed over that that is a

945
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,519
much more arduous task than he said

946
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,519
um

947
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,079
do you have a big

948
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,399
frozen ball of stickiness

949
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,798
okay that you're trying to microplane

950
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:47,199
before it gets too sticky so back to

951
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,558
cold right um yeah how many how many

952
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
times you put that freezer or that thing

953
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:50,720
back in the freezer while you're

954
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,880
microplaning

955
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,038
five four or five times at least exactly

956
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,799
how many minutes between those times all

957
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,398
depends it'll take me probably an hour

958
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,960
to microplane it okay just because i

959
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,879
have to keep re refreezing it yeah and

960
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,798
then and and with the air drying you got

961
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,559
you have oxidation you're losing terpene

962
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:10,480
content you know the whole nine yards

963
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:11,918
color color absolutely yep degradation

964
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,679
but that freeze dryer man two grand

965
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,679
that's a hard bite i know it's it was it

966
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,919
was a tough buy but one of the best i've

967
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,679
ever made you can get you can get by

968
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,360
with a small one you can get by with a

969
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,440
small one so don't don't feel like you

970
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,038
need a big you know expensive ball you

971
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,600
can get by with a small one it'll change

972
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,200
your game like oh trust me yeah that's

973
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,199
that's on top of the list buddy it's

974
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,840
awesome it's really nice

975
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,309
next christmas yeah right

976
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,480
next three christmases

977
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:40,960
[Laughter]

978
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,278
so we've gotten through the frozen the

979
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,679
half dry i think it's time to kind of

980
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,558
explain the process of harvesting and

981
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,960
turning our dry product into a smokable

982
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,000
concentrate uh yeah into a smokeable

983
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,038
rosin

984
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,119
trying to use the right words now that

985
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:58,240
i've been educated yeah yeah no worries

986
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:59,759
um cold cold water where

987
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,599
this is the fun part

988
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,200
we are if some people will say oh water

989
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,199
is a universal solvent so how are we

990
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,120
solvent-less right blah blah blah blah a

991
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,640
solvent is only a solvent when it's used

992
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,000
to dissolve

993
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,440
let's say we're using it mechanically

994
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,440
we're not using it we're not using the

995
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,600
water to dissolve our extract we're

996
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,080
using it as a carrier right we're using

997
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,798
it just just literally as a medium

998
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:23,918
um so so we're solventless and we're

999
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,759
using that cold that the the brittleness

1000
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,000
properties of that trichome head

1001
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,200
hopefully at least we discussed a little

1002
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,599
bit in

1003
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,319
the pre-show uh regarding a stalked

1004
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,398
trichome head and and a bulbous trichome

1005
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,879
head where it's literally just a bulb of

1006
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,558
a trichome head on the leaf itself where

1007
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,559
there is no stock

1008
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,359
um that does that doesn't wash well at

1009
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:45,519
all

1010
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,558
you definitely need stocked trichome

1011
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,000
heads that's what's going to give you

1012
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,599
your better yield

1013
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,119
um

1014
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,678
you literally

1015
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,199
dump your flower into water

1016
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,120
agitate it

1017
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,720
and collect the water

1018
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,518
and

1019
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,519
in the simplest form you know now we can

1020
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,679
get into ice content in the water we can

1021
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,839
get into a temperature of the water we

1022
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,760
can get into agitation practices whether

1023
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,838
it's mechanical or hand we can get into

1024
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,399
time vegetation we can get into

1025
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:17,279
collecting techniques there's a lot

1026
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,838
there's a lot a lot to it um but for

1027
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,399
this for the simplest dumbed-down

1028
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:25,039
explanation it's in water it's agitated

1029
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,799
cold and we collect the trichome heads

1030
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:27,679
that have collected in the water at the

1031
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,039
end

1032
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,720
and those trichome heads will be in the

1033
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,960
different size bags with the different

1034
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:36,158
uh micron screens in the bottom of them

1035
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,320
okay uh ryan said don't over agitate it

1036
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,159
i've made bubble hash before i was

1037
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,919
taught by uh the legendary sub cool i

1038
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,398
used his bubble bag method

1039
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,158
subby taught us to agitate the [ __ ] out

1040
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,000
of it some beat the [ __ ] out of this out

1041
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,599
of his father's

1042
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,250
a lot of guys used to use paint mixers

1043
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,000
on drills

1044
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,159
[Music]

1045
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,559
that makes me cringe i did it once and i

1046
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,240
was like holy [ __ ] what is going on me

1047
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,000
too is that what i bring i looked at my

1048
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,000
bags and everything was green

1049
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,239
okay chlorophyll that's exactly what i

1050
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,679
expected yeah chlorophyll

1051
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,919
so when we get into this um it's

1052
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:10,319
definitely a look of feel a touch it's

1053
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,400
it's definitely doing it multiple times

1054
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,640
uh watching that water watching what's

1055
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,320
actually going on it's it's not the same

1056
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,159
time every time it's not the same time

1057
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,559
with everything it's different for every

1058
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,960
strain every female exactly it's it's

1059
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,799
it's definitely a look a feel it's it's

1060
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,639
something that you got to know

1061
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,079
just by doing it

1062
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,118
absolutely

1063
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,119
um

1064
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,440
yeah i agree 100

1065
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,280
i think i understand the process of the

1066
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,280
sieve bags the bubble bags now i've got

1067
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,560
bubble i called it bubble hash back in

1068
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,240
the day because we use bubble bags to

1069
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,400
make it bubbles when you make it or when

1070
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,639
you burn it uh it melts when you light

1071
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,240
it up what do i do if i want to turn

1072
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,159
that into rosin

1073
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:51,358
what i this is the part where i am lost

1074
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,960
what do i do to turn my bag wash into

1075
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,880
rosin how do we press this stuff i have

1076
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,519
no idea how to do that part

1077
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,320
so after after i get my my hash out of

1078
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:02,400
the water i put it uh in a best

1079
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,519
consistency i can say is a pancake type

1080
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,440
consistency so my when my hash comes out

1081
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,480
of the bags let's step back a little bit

1082
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,559
more and talk about those collection

1083
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,199
bags yes um

1084
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,880
there's yes bubble bags bubble man uh as

1085
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,118
a matter of the funny thing is why i did

1086
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,800
an interview with uh with bubble man

1087
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,119
himself and

1088
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,720
the first bags that i purchased

1089
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,119
some 20

1090
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:27,279
20 years ago were hand stitched by his

1091
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,640
wife which is just

1092
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,079
freaking cool as [ __ ] she was hand

1093
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,519
stitching them in her in her in her

1094
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,640
living room at the time

1095
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:37,280
um so there's bags there's a 25 micron

1096
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:39,118
now this varies with manufacture but as

1097
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,760
for the most part yeah for the most part

1098
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,039
there's a 25 there's a 45 there's a 73

1099
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,240
there's a 90 there's a 120 uh there's a

1100
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,400
160 there's a 190 there's a 220.

1101
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,759
that's like the general you know and

1102
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,920
they'll they'll be off on a couple

1103
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,920
different a couple try or a couple of

1104
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,680
micron sizes on different manufacturers

1105
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,159
but that's about

1106
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,319
a round ball um

1107
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,920
as as as a whole

1108
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,760
most people

1109
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,760
and most phenos

1110
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:12,400
will collect somewhere in the 45 to 159

1111
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,440
range that might be 73 to 159 it might

1112
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,400
be 90 to 159 it might be 90 to 120 you

1113
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,720
know

1114
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,599
the essentially what the micron size is

1115
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:24,879
is it's a whole size in the bag it will

1116
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,079
let through anything smaller than 73

1117
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,680
microns than 93 microns and it will hold

1118
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,440
everything

1119
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,598
bigger than that

1120
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,358
you can use all eight bags you can use

1121
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,039
four bags you can use really whatever

1122
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:40,319
you want i've taught a lot of people in

1123
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:42,960
the past to use the 25 the 45 the 160

1124
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,599
and the 220 that's it you can collect

1125
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,800
your your 45 through 159 and have a

1126
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,599
beautiful

1127
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,240
um

1128
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,838
i call it broad spectrum i never call it

1129
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,759
full spectrum that's a whole nother

1130
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,119
conversation full spectrum of smoking

1131
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,599
flower

1132
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,760
uh you can have a very broad spectrum uh

1133
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,760
concentrate but you know and then as you

1134
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,400
pull it down into the 90 to 120 you've

1135
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,680
got a way more isolated spectrum

1136
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,320
product

1137
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,759
my 73 and my 120 are my sweet spot yeah

1138
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,680
usually it's about the right for me

1139
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,760
notice the 90 and 120 sell the best at

1140
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,519
the dispensary yeah if you and now

1141
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,000
here's the other thing when you start

1142
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,920
when you start isolating heads in a 90

1143
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,599
bag like let's say you're using all all

1144
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,159
of the eight bags right and you're gonna

1145
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,599
isolate the 90 to 120

1146
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,920
you're no longer getting that two and a

1147
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,880
half ounces per pound of the 90 to 120

1148
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,599
that that two and a half ounces is all

1149
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,680
of your rosin right so now if you start

1150
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,720
taking just this little bit now you've

1151
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:40,000
got what eight ounces of or eight grams

1152
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:43,439
or whatever whatever the numbers is

1153
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,480
right of high quality and that's why the

1154
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,800
shit's costing you 150 a gram

1155
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,079
you want me to burst

1156
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,839
that's why we don't sell it and we don't

1157
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,920
share it yeah you want to only burst the

1158
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:59,039
bubble i think the the

1159
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,039
120 the 73 the isolated bags is hype

1160
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,280
can you tell me why can you tell me why

1161
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,280
yeah because everybody started this

1162
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,800
smoking flower right it's a broad it's a

1163
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,320
that's your full spectrum that's getting

1164
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,599
the can every cannabinoid that the plant

1165
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,119
has to offer well i don't want to say

1166
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,559
every cannabinoid but that's getting the

1167
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,800
vast majority of the cannabinoids that

1168
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,519
the plant has to offer in your system

1169
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,680
when you start isolating things

1170
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,079
and not even burning plant material

1171
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,879
you've lost full spectrum you've just

1172
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,880
went down to broad at best and every

1173
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,160
time you take a step into

1174
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,480
a smaller uh

1175
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,118
size you know 90 to 120 a smaller bag

1176
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,039
size a smaller pole you've isolated

1177
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,240
cannabinoids you're no longer getting a

1178
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,000
broad

1179
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,439
you're no longer getting that full high

1180
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,880
you might only get a heady high you

1181
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,920
might go to sleep

1182
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,800
it's going to be different for every

1183
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,920
plant

1184
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,320
um i am i i am of a

1185
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,320
i started to do the 45 to 159 i do

1186
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,039
believe there's value in pulling the 45

1187
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,680
out and going like the 73 to 120 or 73

1188
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,320
to 159 like i do believe there's some

1189
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,519
subtle nuances and benefits to doing

1190
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,039
that

1191
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,880
but i think the more that we isolate the

1192
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,960
heads when we isolate the cannabinoids

1193
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,960
we're stepping away from that full body

1194
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,960
high

1195
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,039
i couldn't agree with that i can agree

1196
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,880
with that that's already great i noticed

1197
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,279
that some concentrates uh definitely

1198
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,480
make me super droopy eyed and super lazy

1199
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,560
and then some will definitely give me

1200
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,400
bug-eyed and moving and i notice that

1201
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:25,199
there's not the full experience that you

1202
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,800
get from some other uh delivery methods

1203
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,719
for sure

1204
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,640
and some people like want that and

1205
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:34,639
that's a great thing to know and to

1206
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:36,639
desire yeah but just be educated

1207
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,318
so we've got uh so we've done our press

1208
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,838
let's get back to our yeah we've done

1209
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:41,519
our wash how do we press this stuff

1210
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,799
sorry we're no no you're good we're all

1211
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,400
stoned here i'll get us back on track

1212
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,920
that's my job you ramble all day i like

1213
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,400
the info

1214
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,680
i'll never cut you off you keep going

1215
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,200
seriously i can listen to them all day

1216
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:52,480
long yeah yeah when i cut you off the

1217
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,799
listener from one hatch bigger to

1218
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,480
another absolutely appreciate it

1219
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,480
um so we've isolated our bags whatever

1220
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,838
bags we have right we've got hash that

1221
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,519
we're ready to press whether it's your

1222
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,078
73 whether it's your 90 whether it's a

1223
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,358
broad spectrum whatever i'm going to say

1224
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,760
we've got beach

1225
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:09,759
beach sand quality hash sitting in front

1226
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,680
of us whether it's been microplaned and

1227
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,440
it's the the sand particles are a little

1228
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:14,799
bigger whatever we've all got beach sand

1229
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,800
in front of us right

1230
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,800
um for me everything i use is rosin

1231
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,880
evolution sorry it's a plug i use them

1232
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,280
all day long every day

1233
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,440
uh i'll use the two

1234
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,480
or the other two by four and a half inch

1235
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,960
bags

1236
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,559
and in a two by four and a half inch bag

1237
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:35,920
i will put 20 grams of hash

1238
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:37,759
that's in a 25 micron bag boy there's a

1239
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,960
whole other story the bags have micron

1240
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,800
sizes too

1241
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,800
the the the rosin filter bags have

1242
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,640
micron sizes right

1243
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,318
double your bags as well per hour i

1244
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,199
triple them actually

1245
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:52,639
i double mic i do 37 micron doubles i do

1246
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,399
trespass 225s in a 160.

1247
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,838
um and i'm and i'm actually and i'm

1248
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,920
actually i just ordered and have them

1249
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,119
sitting over here right next to me uh 15

1250
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,519
microns so i'm gonna play around with

1251
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,640
some 15 microns as well i'm figuring man

1252
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:07,599
if it's oil if it's oil

1253
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:09,838
why do we want a micron size anyways

1254
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,200
you know this is true so take out the

1255
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:12,480
lipids for the most part right that's

1256
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,559
that's the main

1257
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,559
yep so so if we're getting down to 50

1258
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,318
you know 15 microns instead of 25 we're

1259
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:21,199
potentially even removing it more

1260
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:22,719
undesirable more absolutely so

1261
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,318
that being said there's different micron

1262
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:25,919
sizes back when we used to press flower

1263
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,318
price we used to press flower in a 90

1264
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,480
micron or a 120 micron and

1265
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:32,639
those days are funny to think back on

1266
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,358
um now we'll take 20 grams and we'll put

1267
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:38,000
it in a 25 micron bag i'll slip that in

1268
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:41,440
another 25 micron bag double filtration

1269
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,760
double uh blowout prevention um and then

1270
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,079
i will always put that in a 160

1271
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,000
the 160 is extra blowout protection

1272
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,200
there's no filtration with the 160

1273
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,679
whatsoever

1274
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,960
um the thing that it does that people

1275
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:56,480
don't

1276
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,440
give enough credit to is bag slippage

1277
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,760
when you put your uh your bags into a

1278
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,440
160 and put them onto parchment they

1279
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,720
won't slip anymore and what i mean by

1280
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,720
that

1281
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:09,598
anybody that's ever pressed hash has had

1282
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:11,919
a blowout if your bag is not centered on

1283
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,240
your plates or at least within the

1284
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,079
square inches of your plates if any part

1285
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,799
of that bag comes out

1286
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,640
of that press area you will have to blow

1287
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,560
out all of your hash will go to that

1288
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,358
little spot and it will literally

1289
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,519
you will have hash shoot at your face

1290
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,598
it's not a great won't be the nice same

1291
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,159
color as the rest of it no it's it's

1292
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,400
pretty horrible so when when i do it in

1293
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,318
the in the 225s that's double blowout

1294
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,720
prevention double filtration and then

1295
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,838
the 160 is blowout prevention but also

1296
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:44,000
slippage the bag stays put

1297
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,519
and um and man that's just i've been

1298
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,880
doing it that way religiously for a

1299
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:49,440
couple years now

1300
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,640
that's a good tip man i like that

1301
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,480
and then

1302
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,480
time temperature pressure that's what i

1303
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,990
just wrote time

1304
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,358
time and weight

1305
00:43:54,989 --> 00:44:00,078
[Laughter]

1306
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:02,239
so now we're uh usually again

1307
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,839
depends depends depends depends depends

1308
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,759
right this is where we're this is why we

1309
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:08,400
are who we are i guess strain dependent

1310
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,760
again yep yep so somewhere between the

1311
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,240
some people get crazy some people go

1312
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,960
down to 150s 160s you know some people

1313
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,439
are

1314
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,400
170 180 for me that's where i'm at 180

1315
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,200
almost almost religiously 180 uh 170 180

1316
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,960
sometimes if the hash

1317
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,559
is looking weird i'll bump to 190 just

1318
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,079
to see what the hell's going on

1319
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,880
but i just man

1320
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:31,680
i see people pressing at 2 2 10 220 i'm

1321
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,160
like whoa bro you see the bubbles

1322
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:36,318
do you understand what bubbling rosin

1323
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:37,838
means unless we're talking flour that's

1324
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,440
a different talk yeah right that

1325
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,759
bubbling should happen after i paid for

1326
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,119
it yes yeah the bubbling is literally

1327
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,040
that's where it should be happening the

1328
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,000
bubbling banger if you're bubbling on

1329
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:47,920
the press

1330
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,440
you're degrading your rosin

1331
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,880
horribly horribly if you're pressing

1332
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,159
above 190 you're degrading that's

1333
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,160
awesome that's where you get that burnt

1334
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,399
popcorn but yeah one of my notes is how

1335
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,719
to avoid the burnt popcorn flavor

1336
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,440
don't go above 190 don't go above 190.

1337
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:04,480
don't go above 180. try to try to stay

1338
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:08,400
below the 180 190 mark market

1339
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,639
and then temperature or time uh time

1340
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,318
if you really want the very specifics

1341
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:13,679
this is one of the things that i've done

1342
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:15,920
since the beginning that's kind of

1343
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,679
underlined who i am when you go to the

1344
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,200
rosin dot

1345
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:20,318
league

1346
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,799
account

1347
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:24,639
i tell you all this i pressed at 82

1348
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,480
degrees celsius for two and a half

1349
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,519
minutes at this amount of pressure at

1350
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,039
the back

1351
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,960
um

1352
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,519
man bag pressure is another thing too

1353
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,119
yeah i said that and it's just like

1354
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,400
it's slow pressure when you're pressing

1355
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,160
cash that's really another thing we

1356
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,760
should talk about get that get that slow

1357
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:40,960
pressure don't freaking squeeze the hell

1358
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,560
out of it you're gonna blow those bags

1359
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,039
out that's why we're double tripling

1360
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,199
them up uh big thing and same thing with

1361
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:50,318
flour if we're talking about flour uh i

1362
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:52,078
press it to 37 as well for flour and uh

1363
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,159
if you're pressing wetter flour or

1364
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,280
something that's just dried go slower

1365
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,598
you're going to blow those bags out if

1366
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,000
it's fresh

1367
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,000
that makes sense

1368
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,240
is that why a lot of the rosin that i

1369
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,159
smoke and i'm not trying to be a hater

1370
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,679
here is that why a lot of the ross and i

1371
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,719
smoke taste like straight popsicle

1372
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:24,318
sticks and burnt popcorn or uh yeah what

1373
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,399
is it a popsicle stick or burnt popcorn

1374
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:27,920
or are you smoking flour rosin yes

1375
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,039
that's probably what i'm assuming i

1376
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,960
don't because i don't make it i don't

1377
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:32,159
know people bring me gifts people i've

1378
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,079
got a lot of friends that will bring me

1379
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,000
gifts and i could tell sometimes as soon

1380
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,599
as i open it it's got that just that

1381
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,519
woody terp that i do not appreciate

1382
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,599
sorry guys i don't love it but yeah i

1383
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,039
think that i would honestly say that is

1384
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,480
probably well not necessarily

1385
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,000
flourishing like he just said it was

1386
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,599
probably pressed it was yeah it could be

1387
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,760
bubble hash just pressed at a high temp

1388
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,440
that's where i really get that popcorn

1389
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,839
taste to me yeah you know and here and

1390
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,000
here's the other thing too is

1391
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,159
you know he's just ryan said that he'll

1392
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,079
he'll only press the buds that don't

1393
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,199
have bag appeal right

1394
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,599
well the buds that don't have bag of

1395
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,159
peel also aren't the best buds

1396
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,440
right your trim isn't the best material

1397
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:11,279
to run your best material to run is your

1398
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,039
your your bag appeal

1399
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,599
that's your good hash that's your good

1400
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:18,079
rosin gold and gold out yeah absolutely

1401
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,160
so so you you might be getting trim run

1402
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,240
rosa which is

1403
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:26,000
a polished dog turd you know it's in it

1404
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:28,239
and it's and that's not a a a a negative

1405
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,239
thing if you could polish a dog turd

1406
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,838
[ __ ] you've done a great job but it's a

1407
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,118
hell of a task

1408
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:34,480
you know

1409
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,680
you could have done it correctly if you

1410
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,480
started off properly with the right

1411
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,279
absolute mind absolutely all right

1412
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,280
um

1413
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,640
they don't expect gold from trash

1414
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,079
exactly no you can never expect that in

1415
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:46,639
the cannabis industry especially

1416
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,640
solidless

1417
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:49,439
and i'm learning why this stuff is so

1418
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,880
pricey you guys you guys have explained

1419
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,599
it now i don't walk in and stare at it

1420
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,519
and go why sure sure people some people

1421
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,160
can make funny things out of bho yeah i

1422
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,358
mean all the pretty buds that you see

1423
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:01,598
they don't get small but they don't get

1424
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,039
put in a bag they're washed and thrown

1425
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,280
into my garden in the in the in the

1426
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,279
backyard you know like

1427
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,800
yeah the shit's there's a lot of work

1428
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,200
that goes behind and the money holy

1429
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,760
christ i bet i've got 15 or 20 000 in my

1430
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:15,679
cold room like it's just it's it's crazy

1431
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,599
you know so i mean it's it's it's tough

1432
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:19,118
man it's tough it's all about that

1433
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,039
dedication a lot of people don't realize

1434
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,200
what somebody in your position ryan's

1435
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,480
position my position uh when you have a

1436
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:26,159
niche product like that they don't

1437
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,760
understand the dedication to it the

1438
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,358
commitment to just the equipment and the

1439
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,079
room and the space and then there's the

1440
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:34,078
work after that which we'll talk about

1441
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,160
yeah for sure um i wanted to keep on

1442
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,760
this uh we got through temp how about

1443
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,598
how about time how long do we press this

1444
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,359
stuff once we've got it in the press we

1445
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,800
bring down that weight how long does it

1446
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,039
take for the goop and the gold to come

1447
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,559
out of there take it ryan

1448
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:47,679
well for the group and gold to actually

1449
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,599
start come out pretty much when you

1450
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:51,519
reach full pressure uh i usually hit my

1451
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,359
timer button once i hit full pressure uh

1452
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:56,079
for hash um minute and a half to two

1453
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:58,078
minutes generally oh quickly

1454
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,640
all right that's fast uh how much

1455
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,960
pressure should we put on there

1456
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,318
uh i i'm using a seven ton press but i

1457
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,519
don't have actual pressure gauge where

1458
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:07,119
my bag is

1459
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:10,239
okay

1460
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:12,960
so i will hit my timer uh when my bags

1461
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:15,679
hit the press uh and i usually do a 30

1462
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,639
minute warm-up again or minutes jesus

1463
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:22,399
christ 30 second warm-up 30 seconds

1464
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:24,000
again so you've just put 20 grams of

1465
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,318
millions of little beach balls with

1466
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,358
filled with oil into a bag right and now

1467
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:29,759
we're gonna put that bag and we're gonna

1468
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,279
we're gonna extract the oil that's in

1469
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,240
all these million little beach balls

1470
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,519
right

1471
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:38,000
but i don't want to extract the cuticles

1472
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:39,920
of the beach balls i want them to melt

1473
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,480
and then to give me the oil right i

1474
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,880
don't want when i press out of the bag i

1475
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,119
want oil to come out of the bag not hash

1476
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,358
so i i allow it to melt for that 30

1477
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,599
seconds and i very slowly and very

1478
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,598
methodically very system

1479
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,760
systemically that's not the word i want

1480
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,640
to use but systematically systematically

1481
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,440
thank you um it increase the pressure

1482
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,558
uh and that's why man so i do give

1483
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,880
classes

1484
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,079
because this gets very detailed quickly

1485
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,160
tell us how we can find those people

1486
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:12,800
want to know um pedro's grow room uh

1487
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,799
patreon gmail.com or go to uh

1488
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:28,558
so trying to do that so you get a hold

1489
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,399
of me um there's a big difference

1490
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,839
between uh um

1491
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,079
pressure at the gauge

1492
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:35,199
pressure at the plates and pressure at

1493
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,519
the bag

1494
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,519
um

1495
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:41,118
so let's just use ryan's here for

1496
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,439
example for a seven ton right seventh

1497
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,240
the ton if you're if if you're pressing

1498
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,960
at full pressure seven ton is fourteen

1499
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,639
thousand pounds right and now fourteen

1500
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,119
thousand pounds

1501
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:55,598
i i think we all understand that if i

1502
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,760
come up to you and with an open palm in

1503
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,119
your chest and push

1504
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,119
it's probably not going to do much right

1505
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,960
it's going to push you back right but if

1506
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,559
i walk up to you with a really sharp

1507
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,679
stick and stick it right in your chest

1508
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,119
and push with that same pressure

1509
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:10,719
things are going to happen right so

1510
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,800
there's a difference in pressure over a

1511
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,719
square over over your your uh your

1512
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,318
square for your square inches

1513
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,159
so let's just go with that two by four

1514
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:19,920
and a half inch bag right by the time i

1515
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,519
i fold it over and everything is maybe

1516
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,159
two by four inches

1517
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:26,719
eight square inches okay

1518
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:29,838
fourteen thousand pounds

1519
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:31,598
divided by eight

1520
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:34,318
is where we're at right so what are you

1521
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,838
about that's about two thousand pounds

1522
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:37,440
yeah we'll go close enough you know okay

1523
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:38,960
roughly 18 parts

1524
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,119
that's about actually perfect at the bag

1525
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,599
that's where right where you want to be

1526
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,960
literally right where you want to be

1527
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,559
so at the end of your press not

1528
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,960
straight into it

1529
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,640
butter it down let it when you see the

1530
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,358
pressure i said it's feel you really do

1531
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,960
got to go slow what do you do especially

1532
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,639
when you see the presses on my rosin as

1533
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,039
legal [ __ ] they're they're sped up in

1534
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:03,440
four times so they're four times speed

1535
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,679
um um but what that allows you to do you

1536
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,880
can aside from seeing me over there

1537
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:09,279
pumping it

1538
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,960
every time you see it

1539
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,720
just know i'm over there

1540
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,039
giving it more pressure that's why more

1541
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,799
is coming out you know

1542
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:18,079
makes more sense

1543
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,599
i don't think i realized that it was

1544
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,760
sped up either i don't think i did yeah

1545
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,680
there you go they're all four times

1546
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,880
man some of those presses uh some of the

1547
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,199
latest ones that i've been doing when i

1548
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,358
waterfall them on top of each other uh

1549
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:32,159
each press

1550
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:34,880
you know from into the plates to set up

1551
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:37,598
for my next press is four minutes

1552
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,880
so if i've done if you see me doing 10

1553
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,640
15 presses on one piece of parchment

1554
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,720
do the math i've had that camera sitting

1555
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,039
there recording that entire time and and

1556
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,879
putting that together

1557
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,358
i've i've realized now that people are

1558
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,760
going to have to straight up ruin a few

1559
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:54,799
batches of presses a few presses yes how

1560
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,720
many how many do you think they're going

1561
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,000
to ruin before they uh actually get and

1562
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:59,759
do washes

1563
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,599
and a couple of washes okay i didn't

1564
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,760
yeah putting that into consumption sad

1565
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,280
stories on the washes but isn't that how

1566
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,720
you get good at [ __ ] that's how you guys

1567
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,240
got to be the people that are on the

1568
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:11,039
show right is by [ __ ] up a bunch of

1569
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:12,399
times oh yeah oh definitely oh my god i

1570
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,719
washed fresh frozen in my freaking

1571
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,880
bathroom one time

1572
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,639
it was a nightmare talk about wasting

1573
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,440
[ __ ] product dude oh my god yeah

1574
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:21,118
because by the end it was just

1575
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,920
especially when it's flower it was

1576
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,640
horrible horrible um yeah the the

1577
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,480
variable there is how how soon did you

1578
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,639
stop the bleeding and call me for

1579
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,480
classes

1580
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,719
literally because you will ruin some

1581
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,960
[ __ ] it's it's just inevitable yeah i

1582
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,078
expected that just like growing up yeah

1583
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,838
what's an art you're not going to be

1584
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,960
good at it the first time and if you are

1585
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:42,639
then you're not going to be good at the

1586
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,159
second and third time and if you're not

1587
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:45,440
passionate you know if you're just in it

1588
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:48,000
for the dabs

1589
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,358
wink wink then you know you're probably

1590
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,039
not going to want to put through the

1591
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:52,960
effort to sit in the fall or that cold

1592
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,318
room for for eight hours and do the work

1593
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,039
that it's going to take to require to

1594
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:58,639
get the good rosin and a lot of home

1595
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,159
growers really let's let's face it are

1596
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,480
really going to probably press flower

1597
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:03,598
yeah probably it's easy you know it's

1598
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,039
it's you can buy a press for four or

1599
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,039
five hundred bucks decent press and

1600
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,838
they're gonna make dabs i will tell you

1601
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:12,239
to not don't expect to be blown away

1602
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,799
with by your flower rosin

1603
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,639
just expect to get high

1604
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,720
for some people to be self-sufficient to

1605
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,719
be able to go from there i have i take

1606
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,719
great pride still at this point in the

1607
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,318
game to grow something from seed and

1608
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,639
harvest it and put it in the bong and

1609
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:28,480
take a rip i still go yeah i did that

1610
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,000
you did that it's my billion time of

1611
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,838
doing it and i still feel like yeah i

1612
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,199
did that yep absolutely there's got to

1613
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:35,358
be another feeling once you've taken

1614
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,039
that from that flower to that frozen

1615
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:38,639
product to that pressed product and then

1616
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,719
put it to the banger that's got to be a

1617
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,719
whole other step of of relief and pride

1618
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:45,598
right there yeah absolutely and the only

1619
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:46,959
reason that i say don't be i don't that

1620
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,559
you know i don't want to stomp on people

1621
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,039
that are pressing flower go ahead and do

1622
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,200
it i just don't want you to smoke flower

1623
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:54,639
rosin and be like well this is [ __ ] and

1624
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:56,399
we're pedro's what the [ __ ] were they

1625
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:57,838
after like this is horrible

1626
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,760
just know that there's a lot of battery

1627
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,119
i just had yeah flower rosin is the

1628
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,480
bottom of absolutely maybe not the

1629
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,160
bottom of the bucket but it's towards

1630
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,719
the bottom of the bucket of rosin and

1631
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:08,798
unfortunately that's why for a couple of

1632
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:10,480
years i had a literally a bad taste for

1633
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:12,798
rosin in my mouth because i was being

1634
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,358
given uh probably flower rosin that was

1635
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:16,798
probably too hot and then uh you started

1636
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:18,159
coming around a little more you live far

1637
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:19,759
from me we're in colorado but we are

1638
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,679
hours and hours it is like four and a

1639
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,200
half hours it's crazy yeah so we meet up

1640
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,118
in denver and then you change my opinion

1641
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:26,480
and then green dot green dot doesn't pay

1642
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,400
me they don't even give me any discounts

1643
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,960
green dots started putting out rosin

1644
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,720
that really blew my mind and that's good

1645
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,559
same color same texture as yours so i

1646
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:36,078
had to buy some and i approve i'll buy

1647
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,079
more when they have it but it always

1648
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,400
sells out you rosin nerds but how do you

1649
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,000
know it's there already how do they the

1650
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,880
rosin nerds are like following around

1651
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,039
the delivery guy they're like stopping

1652
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,039
they pay attention um just like i hope

1653
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:50,639
they pay attention when i make my rosin

1654
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,159
come to the market the first time uh

1655
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,759
yeah they pay attention

1656
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,279
that's it they've been watching

1657
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,119
there is no good rosin here that's

1658
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,040
that's why i make it there's nothing

1659
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,960
here man it's it's it's rough up here

1660
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,199
our selection is very minimal uh like i

1661
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,440
said we're a very new legal state so our

1662
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:06,879
surrounding states it's the quality is

1663
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,880
very rough and if you find anything

1664
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,519
decent you are paying very big money for

1665
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,798
it

1666
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:12,239
i wasn't going to bring it up on purpose

1667
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:13,599
but big shout out to new york for uh

1668
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:15,519
recently legalizing i know you're up

1669
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,760
there in upstate new york uh big up for

1670
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:19,440
joining the team legalization sure

1671
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,200
absolutely that should make your your

1672
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,200
work a little bit easier going to get uh

1673
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:26,399
parts and supplies definitely not as

1674
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:29,118
much of a sketch yeah absolutely

1675
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,880
hopefully a career change someday too

1676
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,798
i'd love to see you running a facility

1677
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,480
doing pedro's job pretty soon oh it's

1678
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:36,400
crazy man it's it's

1679
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,440
i i always have to remind myself that

1680
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,240
it's

1681
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,400
it's not even a dream come true it's

1682
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,558
monumentally more than a dream come true

1683
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,240
i i you almost can't put into words dude

1684
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,400
when i go

1685
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,879
this [ __ ] was illegal when i was growing

1686
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,240
up yeah and i'm now getting paid to

1687
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,000
extract

1688
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:58,318
concentrate it's mind-boggling dude i

1689
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
i never want to ever i hope to god i

1690

beautiful we'll do we'll do for sure all

1698
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:15,920
right guys we've been going for close to

1699
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,078
an hour i think we've covered most of

1700
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,760
the things i had written down i do have

1701
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,680
one question i think you guys can answer

1702
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,680
it quite quickly i did ask for uh

1703
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:25,679
questions from the viewers this person

1704
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,358
just said what is with the foam that

1705
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,440
forms when making bubble hash why does

1706
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:31,119
it increase with each run i find that i

1707
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,200
have to stop and change the water and

1708
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,640
material after 25 minutes

1709
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:36,159
and then it says after my fourth run he

1710
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:38,400
says i would sometimes i feel like a

1711
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,318
fifth run would be worth it but with the

1712
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,079
all the foam i just say [ __ ] it he does

1713
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,199
have a lot more to the question but any

1714
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:48,000
idea why the foam guys surfectants

1715
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:50,000
surfactants yep surfactants uh very

1716
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,440
potentially spraying in flour

1717
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,280
um dust dirt dander anything like that

1718
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,240
um any oils

1719
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,880
can all be leading towards uh towards

1720
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:02,078
foaminess in the wash over agitation can

1721
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,280
be leading towards foaminess in the

1722
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,119
water that sounds that's what i was

1723
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,559
gonna say beating the crap out of it

1724
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,240
sounds like very possible when he's

1725
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,240
talking about forts and fish fourth and

1726
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:12,159
fifth washes i would immediately start

1727
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:13,919
firing questions back to him asking how

1728
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,558
long he's agitating what he's agitating

1729
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,000
in how much volume he's putting in his

1730
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,920
if he's using mechanical washers and

1731
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,318
only filling up halfway it's a way over

1732
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,039
agitation like there's a lot of missing

1733
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:26,400
variables here but in the most instance

1734
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,880
it's either over agitation or

1735
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,318
surfactants so

1736
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,680
i'm sure that's one of our agreements

1737
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:33,039
that you guys gave a lot of info on that

1738
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,159
i'm sure he'll he'll find an answer to

1739
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:35,920
that and dude if we didn't answer your

1740
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:37,440
question properly send me a follow-up

1741
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,960
question all i've got to do is text

1742
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,079
pedro yes i'll get the answer absolutely

1743
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,798
these guys are great they're on my team

1744
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,760
they're really close good resources um

1745
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:45,440
all right gentlemen i think we've

1746
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,799
covered a pretty good podcast do you

1747
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,240
have any things that you would like to

1748
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:49,280
add here at the end that i didn't ask or

1749
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:51,838
that you just want to put out to the

1750
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,839
universe

1751
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,920
big cheesy grin from pedro yeah i i mean

1752
00:58:55,909 --> 00:59:00,159
[Laughter]

1753
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,159
i i hope people people find some value

1754
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:05,598
in the concentrates um i hope people see

1755
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:06,798
the see the passion um and understand

1756
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,480
the pricing a little bit more like you

1757
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:10,559
just said that you do and it's worth the

1758
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,240
work it really is it's worth the work

1759
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,000
and you know if you enjoy quality

1760
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:15,439
concentrate it's worth the work yeah and

1761
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,960
and me with the

1762
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,838
the headiness if you will the new the

1763
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,440
new term the headiness um to me

1764
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,759
it all kind of goes hand in hand right

1765
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,679
like i want if i'm smoking out of what i

1766
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,839
consider one of the best glass pieces i

1767
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,679
want the best concentrate to go through

1768
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:32,960
it you know so i hope there's just an

1769
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:35,279
appreciation and an understanding um and

1770
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,400
and and and i guess another thing is is

1771
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,920
it is achievable it is achievable by

1772
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,920
everyone uh it's not something that's

1773
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,000
out of the realm and it's safe to make
