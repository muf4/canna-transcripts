138
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,639
episodes all the way up to 400 that's a

139
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,899
lot of loyal followers right there are a

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,189
lot of loyal listeners I don't know why

141
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:40,750
I called you followers it's not social

142
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:43,600
media you were two listeners it's a cult

143
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,728
it is the small it's the Irie army that

144
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,229
exami and I I appreciate each and every

145
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,439
one of the people that listen to the

146
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,810
show

147
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:53,589
for 400 episodes it's crazy that's crazy

148
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,699
yeah that's so much content how many

149
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:58,119
hours have we spent around this table

150
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:59,830
staring at microphones at least 400 I'd

151
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,149
say at least 200 because each show is at

152
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:02,500
least thirty minutes on when you're on

153
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:03,339
they get closer to an hour because you

154
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,009
got more to talk about

155
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:07,899
so the probably probably got 400 hours

156
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,099
of content oh yeah

157
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,509
some of the episodes are well there are

158
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,240
some repeats because we do those long

159
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:15,759
blocks but speaking of long blocks the

160
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,129
grow lessons I have compiled the grow

161
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,659
lessons into large chunks without

162
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,538
interruption so when we did the grow

163
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,310
series from planning your grow to

164
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:27,459
selecting your space or a whole bunch of

165
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,899
really specific grow lessons what I did

166
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,579
was sometimes we were doing that series

167
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,939
we got interruptions like Mike came over

168
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:35,829
for an episode we talked about candy

169
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,719
breaks yeah little breaks to break it up

170
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:39,370
and make it fresh and fun for me I've

171
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,200
really wanted to put all of those

172
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,269
episodes into one chunk so that people

173
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,939
could really just focus in and learn so

174
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:49,299
I've made compilations those compilation

175
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:53,379
posts will start at episode 401 so 401

176
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:56,110
402 403 and I think 404 will be

177
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:58,509
compilations of very specific highly

178
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,949
detailed grow lessons nice I made it 401

179
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:00,639
through whatever so they're really easy

180
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,829
to find

181
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,180
you just 401 it starts at zero ones

182
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:05,829
where the Guru lessons are so we're

183
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,930
gonna repost those and then we'll get

184
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:09,099
caught up on regular lessons

185
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,509
gonna be a good time but that way I

186
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,710
think people can really focus in and

187
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,038
learn I think it'll really help them

188
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:16,149
find all of the lessons so that's just

189
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,149
what I wanted to say after that I don't

190
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:20,288
know why that was so important right now

191
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:23,439
the next bullet point I've got written

192
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:27,370
down is uh music on those shows is

193
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:30,579
obnoxious the music on 401 and 402 and

194
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,550
403 somebody said make your own theme

195
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:35,319
music and Jeff went at it I went for it

196
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,360
but what I could what I would like sorry

197
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,639
I'm stumbling hi what I would like is I

198
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,710
need a theme song I've tried to use

199
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,228
music from other artists and other

200
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:46,538
places and I keep getting flagged on

201
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:48,758
youtube so if you have the ability to

202
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:50,288
make a fresh original song that you

203
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,910
haven't posted anywhere else that you're

204
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:54,699
not stealing rhythms from something else

205
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,810
if you can make a fresh new theme song

206
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,000
for the podcast

207
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,860
I would love new intro music obviously I

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,810
like reggae kind of stuff but if you've

209
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,879
got something cool for me probably

210
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,649
hopefully something instrumental without

211
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,329
a lot of voices in it maybe if it's just

212
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:08,500
got my voice being looped or something

213
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:10,719
maybe people that have been on the show

214
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,189
if you capture some show stuff if you

215
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,300
make music you know how to make an intro

216
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:15,759
music you know what I'm talking about

217
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,348
I would appreciate the support I don't

218
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,060
have a lot to offer in return but I will

219
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:21,310
definitely give you something that will

220
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,470
put a smile on your face so if you can

221
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,209
make some music maybe like a two-minute

222
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,560
intro that'd be pretty cool maybe a

223
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:28,658
little longer I wouldn't complain maybe

224
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,848
a little shorter can't be mad at you but

225
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:32,950
an intro track would be super sweet and

226
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:34,750
start at around episode 405 or something

227
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:39,430
if we can get it on time once we get

228
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:46,269
past these grow lessons cool yeah that'd

229
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:49,809
be rad deicide that would be pretty fun

230
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:51,309
they'd be crazy no thanks if they sent

231
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:53,649

232
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:59,469
hardcore why not let's do it at the end

233
00:08:53,649 --> 00:09:04,389

234
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:06,250

236
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,328

sorry all right

238
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:17,259

239
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,389

242
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:24,149
your heart at hotmail.com is the best

243
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,009
way to get it to me I want to hear what

244
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,350
you're doing musically I am honestly not

245
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:30,269
the best musical producer when it comes

246
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:34,139
to creating my own intro tracks with the

247
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:36,120
computer I mean it sounded like you did

248
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,250
pretty good to me but I mean these guys

249
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,919
will see it pretty soon they'll hear it

250
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,750
mic just started to speak about it and

251
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,419
then gave up what I heard was

252
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,690
technically music it was technically

253
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,860
original I mean YouTube might have some

254
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,570
problems with it but I don't think it's

255
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,009
gonna fly oh that's all original that

256
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,180
stuff is gonna fly at some of the reggae

257
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,819
tracks that I've built with GarageBand

258
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,649
YouTube has been like no that's a ripoff

259
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,570
and like but I mean it's already flagged

260
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:03,840
that one beat dude yeah it knows the

261
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,570
boom chicka chicka I know and it's just

262
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:10,740
you can't teach YouTube that there are

263
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:12,240
different yeah I get it Mike I get it

264
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,450

265
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,129
joke for three minutes I know I saw it

266

267

Chicka Boom Chicka I play guar do you

272

throwing like weird [ __ ] at you they

274

throw like joints it's somewhere out in

275
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,560
the world right now there's an IRA I

276
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:47,730
remember that's also a big wide by two

277
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:49,769
worlds no I have no hatred toward the

278
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,730
metal people would be surprised Clint

279
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:52,350
this is kind of what brought up the

280
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,460
metal to be honest Clinton I were

281
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,930
hanging out a little bit before Mike

282
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,340
came I was dabbing Clint was smoking a

283
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:58,049
ball and we're just talking about music

284
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,050
Clint brought up on to his favorite

285
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:02,309
bands from back in the day and I enjoyed

286
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:04,109
it but it wasn't my thing and I was like

287
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:05,579
that's like this band with a different

288
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,230
kind of singer so I went and played some

289
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,120
hardcore stuff and Clint was like no no

290
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,409
no no no that's not for me and I was

291
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,700
like so it's like similar music the

292
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,429
background tracks are the same but the

293
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,379
singers were way on different levels

294
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:19,049
when I was younger I like to delve into

295
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:20,759
the really aggressive side of music I

296
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,559
just enjoy music altogether I can listen

297
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,450
to some jazz I can listen to a little

298
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,549
bit of death metal but of course I'd

299
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,140
prefer some fish or some reggae but yeah

300
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:28,919
I appreciate all kinds of good music but

301
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,360
that's where that came from

302
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,039
we're talking about old music back in

303
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,210
the day what was the name of that band

304
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,659
II we're jamming dude I can't think of

305
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,209
the name of the one I liked yeah

306
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:39,399
Oh protest the hero protest to the hero

307
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:41,649
so if you guys like them we leave a

308
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,970
comment or something yeah tell us what

309
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,220
you think about protest of the hero that

310
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,440
is one of Clint's favorite bands those

311
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,850
guys are cool from nice guys what what

312
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,930
grade were you in when you fell in love

313
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,909
with that band like senior in high

314
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:57,188
school okay all right perfect

315
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:59,379
yeah I don't know somewhere around there

316
00:11:57,188 --> 00:12:02,578
have you have your musical tastes

317
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:05,110
changed now that you're up I had no I

318
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,088
I'm still listening to like a lot of the

319
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,589
same music I feel like my dad how he

320
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:10,870
just never stopped listening in to the

321
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,420
who that's kind of how I'm doing things

322
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:16,568
now is like no I'm just gonna listen to

323
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:18,929
like Killswitch Engage from like 2010

324
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:21,309
like that's like my favorite era of

325
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:21,669
metal music so it's like I'll just stick

326
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,378
with that

327
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:25,028
I don't need new stuff it ain't broke

328
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:26,889
don't change it bro yeah that's why my

329
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:29,289
sound clouds are not working very good

330
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:32,318
do you still dress like you did from

331
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:34,028
that era also yeah I think just jeans

332
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,828
and t-shirt that's a guy though guys

333
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:39,129
that's a guy that's what we tend to do

334
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:40,838
like around high school graduation year

335
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,639
around 20 that's why we're gonna dress

336
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,439
like that's how you dress from now on I

337
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,669
think that's Mike's kind of staring off

338
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:48,789
into space trying to do the math on that

339
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:50,708
no I'm actually I've every time I look

340
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:53,559
at my closet I feel guilt over this

341
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:57,219
phenomenon because I'm like I'm familiar

342
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:59,458
with the concept of man boys I don't

343
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,589
want to personify this but I will not

344
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:05,018
change my baggy jeans to doctors it's

345
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:07,589
not gonna happen yeah Mike is wearing

346
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:11,500
Jen COEs tonight I can't give them up

347
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:18,610
it's it's part of me from that era it's

348
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:19,899
a really weird podcast tonight 400 I did

349
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,250
not say that we're gonna talk about any

350
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,360
growing or any weed stuff we're just

351
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,860
gonna have a good time tonight you guys

352
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,870
know you're here you already hit play

353
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,519
you're stuck with us enjoy well that's

354
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:32,198
not really true is broken

355
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,578
there's mashing on that 32nd forward

356
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:36,639
button like do they ever get to anything

357
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:37,568
does this [ __ ] go anywhere mm we'll

358
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,339
see we'll see

359
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,509
let's ride with us please we could take

360
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:42,040
it somewhere we've gone for a few

361
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:44,019
minutes now I do have one thing planned

362
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,818
that we can handle real quick does

363
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,679
anybody need a DAB before we get into

364
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:50,528
some iTunes

365
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,759
customer reviews okay Mike said I'm good

366
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:57,759
clean you want your first dab on the

367
00:13:51,759 --> 00:14:01,000
podcast no that was hesitated I think

368
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:04,080
it's way better that I don't I think the

369
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,759
audience could know that I don't do dabs

370
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,920
it's just I feel like this is behavior

371
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,039
we should encourage like not

372
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,299
over-consuming is a good thing I think

373
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,159
all three of us are too old to be

374
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:17,049
carried home by our friends from a night

375
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,278
out oh geez [ __ ] six four and two

376
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,958
hundred pounds you ain't getting carried

377
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:21,070
too far I'll make them to that couch and

378
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:25,299
that's probably where he spends the

379
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:26,770
night yeah it's weird to explain that

380
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:30,069
you blacked out at a friend's house

381
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:31,480
because you over consumed and that's why

382
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,399
you didn't get home till 10:00 the next

383
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,050
day it's really heartbreaking to have to

384
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,990
call your adult friends wives to come

385
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:40,269
pick them up yeah like it was cool we

386
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,009
were 22 it was like oh so-and-so needs

387
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:45,338
to get carried home like I'll help but

388
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:46,659
now it's now it is strange all right I'm

389
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:47,709
trying not to move the computer too much

390
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:51,490
because we have all of the technology

391
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:53,139
plugged in it don't jiggle it don't the

392
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,240
computer too much when you've got the

393
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,439
USB plugged in here and you try not to

394
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,519
break anything and you hope you're still

395
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,680
recording cuz you can't see the screen

396
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,838
anyway we're gonna read some iTunes

397
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,819
customer ratings and reviews I like to

398
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,500
do that on the podcast here this first

399
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,060
review I don't know if I have read this

400
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,080
one it feels like I may have read this

401
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:09,129
one but it's a good review so we're

402
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,080
gonna do it again anyway

403
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:12,820
this one comes from a person who calls

404
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,220
themselves ganja goddess they left this

405
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,589

406
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,540

407
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,250
for that I really appreciate it it says

408
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:22,899
honestly I started with the dude show

409
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,120
and that's how I found this podcast

410
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,879
needless to say it's grown on me it's

411
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,028
grown on them I don't know if they even

412
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,980
meant that grown on me and is now my

413
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:34,659
favorite show to listen to and then they

414
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,310
give the little thankful hands and they

415
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:38,078
signed it with their at seas of cheese

416
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:40,328
that's probably their Instagram handles

417
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,338

434
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,059
because that's too many letters for

435
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:32,399
pressure to spell you just fell asleep

436

easy for you that's kind of what I'm

00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:28,648
here for is to kind of take the stress

483
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,390
off of a grower it can be really

484
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:31,648
stressful setting up your first growth

485
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,028
you've got a lot of equipment to think

486
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:34,528
about you've got a lot of plans to think

487
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,970
about you've got rules to follow and

488
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:37,319
then you've got these plants I like your

489
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,240
new babies it's like getting a kitten

490
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,678
but it doesn't meowing eat normal food

491
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,819
you got to figure it out you know what I

492
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,559
mean like a kitten just would look at

493
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,869
you and you gotta feed it then it goes

494
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,058
on shits on the come with instructions

495
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:49,288
either that's right that is very true so

496
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:51,148
it's a little challenging you become

497
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:52,740
stressful so I'm glad that I'm easing

498
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:54,808
the stress for the grower making it fun

499
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,980
instead of stressful and I'm also I feel

500
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:58,079
like I'm improving the quality of

501
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,640
people's outcome so instead of run mid

502
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,369
grade the first time they're gone kind

503
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,870
of low high grade like the lowest of the

504
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:05,548
high grade quality and then they have

505
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:06,869
opportunity for super high grade next

506
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:08,940
time and it's just more encouragement

507
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:10,918
instead of starting off almost failing

508
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,669
your first try well it's nice being able

509
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,860
to listen to it for free over and over

510
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:18,360

529
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:54,148
cool hell yeah

530
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,678
Mike you have a really serious look of

531
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:57,778
concern on your face over there not

532
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,250
concerned at all not concerned nope

533
00:19:57,778 --> 00:20:01,558
alright as long as you're cool with ever

534
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,819
doing it doing everybody still recording

535
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:04,168
I think we're still recording I haven't

536
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,639
looked at the thing Wow but I'm pretty

537
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,259
sure that since nobody's hit stop as

538
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,970
soon as you mentioned it I became

539
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:10,648
concerned also isn't it a weird feeling

540
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,419
you're not even the show producer I just

541
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:13,859
realized that I always see the sound

542
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,480
levels in the background and they're not

543
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,250
there now yeah all of this could be

544
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,549
disappearing into the ether this could

545
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,759
be a one-time thing

546
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:23,950
but I think it's working this might just

547
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,240
be for us it might be but I have a

548
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:30,549
feeling that's working so it feels dumb

549
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:32,140
just doing all this part so yeah thanks

550
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:33,909

doing it the longest trying the hardest

575
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:28,319
and just to ease everybody's mind it was

576
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,710
I'm glad all the people that are

577
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,290
listening to this recording who were

578
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,640
probably worried about that right it's

579
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:38,019
like watching a movie when you wonder if

580
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,520
the person lived but you know that they

581
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:41,049
live because they're in the [ __ ]

582
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,579
documentary doing [ __ ] interviews

583
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,200
like I wonder if he's okay and you're

584
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:45,579
like oh wait there he is with both legs

585
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,340
he survived

586
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:50,259
we're like if second movies see the

587
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:51,759
trailer for it or something he's still

588
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:53,950
like there's a part two I know he lives

589
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,599
if this was live that would have been a

590
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,950
really interesting moment where the

591
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,869

00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:42,339
which in turn means more people grow

608

you've probably got an iPhone or an iPad

00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,339
or some sort of Apple device go to the

617
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,750
podcast where you normally listen to the

618
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,579
podcast just like you're listening and

619
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,529
when it shows the available episodes

620
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:06,939

00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:14,410
really honestly feel I deserve so far

625
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,730
we've gotten all five star reviews

626
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,130
except for that one guy who left a

627
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,470
really terrible review I honestly have

628
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,330
no power to remove reviews iTunes took

629
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,370
that down I didn't do it I can't do it I

630
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:26,829
have no access to that iTunes has taken

631
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:28,809
that review down it is gone that's good

632
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:30,220
yep I mean it's a hundred percent that

633
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:31,299
means enough people went and reported it

634
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,009
and said that it was a negative comment

635
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:36,970
and that it didn't wasn't valid who

636
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:38,319
wasn't yeah just a hater comment so one

637

00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:31,430

740
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,620
as I'm gonna call you an outsider yeah

741
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,730
you're not into the cannabis culture you

742
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,169
said earlier I don't even care what

743
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,519
strain I'm smoking as long as it [ __ ]

744
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,320
gets me stoned I only need two hits

745
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,480
anyway so I don't really consider you

746
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:43,309
you were a cannabis consumer you are

747
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,730
part of T my region edited part of the

748
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:48,139
Irie army but you're not you're your

749
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,120
cannabis community but you're not part

750
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,259
of the like the hip culture part of it

751
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,909
you know what I mean you don't care to

752
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:54,619
be you don't care you just don't care to

753
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:56,870
wear the cool clothes anybody wears you

754
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:57,979
don't care to be cool to be seen you

755
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:00,049
gonna take care of your family and be

756
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,660
clean just me so it's kind of I'm gonna

757
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:06,440
call you an outsider to this culture yes

758
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:09,890
as an outsider how bad does this look

759
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:13,610
like drugs there's there's some of like

760
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:16,670
the the concentrates that as you I mean

761
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:20,599
you're using a blowtorch so that's

762
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:22,519
that's something that just seems now my

763
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,669
question I'm gonna compound on that mmm

764
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:29,329
this torch I'm using is not like the map

765
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:31,250
gas torch you see the crackheads using

766
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:33,529
or somebody that you'd see in a shop

767
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:37,240
welding something or maybe the kind of

768
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:37,240
torch that attaches a creme brulee torch

769
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:42,079
community people usually see yeah does

770
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,390
this torch make it does this being like

771
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,949
a cigar torch or a creme brulee torch or

772
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,960
not a crackhead looking torch does this

773
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:51,620
change the vibe slightly to you at least

774
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,319
I think I think that just the it clicks

775
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:56,509
it has the flame there's like you're

776
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,439
heating up something just to smoke it it

777
00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:01,799
just looks like I understand

778
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,750
that this is like knots this is the same

779
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:07,529
thing I'm doing just sit and accelerated

780
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:09,630
rate it just looks like drugs okay I

781
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:11,549
like that and it's not I don't have a

782
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,680
problem with it oh yes yeah it just

783
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:16,680
looks like it okay I just don't know how

784
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,990
much people on the inside of your

785
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:24,120
culture like deep into it just don't

786
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:25,980
realize that oh well if when you're

787
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:29,399
putting up pictures on Instagram and

788
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:33,720
like your rigs dirty or something like

789
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,960
that like oh I'm doing my dabs now it's

790
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,519
just like man you're just if you're

791
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,680
gonna take a picture of something at

792
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:45,500
least clean it up I agree with that

793
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:47,640
I don't know man there's a lot of things

794
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,869
what you just said took my brain a

795
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,900
couple of different places

796
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:55,229
sure like part of the war on drugs over

797
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:57,180
the last [ __ ] 80 years is there was a

798
00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:00,750
lot of stigmatization that went with it

799
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:03,120
and as far as like being a longtime

800
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,730
member of the cannabis community like I

801
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,589
got over the do you think my clothes are

802
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,000
silly you think my music is silly you

803
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,019
think my hair is silly you think my

804
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,210
earrings are silly

805
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:14,160
like I get that when you look at me you

806
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:17,250
judge me for lots of stuff adding

807
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,140
something like a blowtorch to my

808
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,140
cannabis consumption didn't bother me

809
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,880
that much on an appearance level but I

810
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,380
am more cognizant like when I'm out in

811
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,500
the world and people are paying

812
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:31,230
attention when I go to do a DAB non-kin

813
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,759
community members perk way up and become

814
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,490
far more interested than if I pulled out

815
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:36,839
to joy absolutely I could agree with

816
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,930
that they're like what do you got there

817
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:42,689
in the anti pot crowd [ __ ] loves to

818
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:46,740
rail about concentrates and dabbing they

819
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:49,710
uh they haven't figured out exactly how

820
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,660
and why it's like other drugs yeah

821
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,340
but they know it looks like harder drugs

822
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,540
and it's scary to people that aren't

823
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:56,490
familiar with it and so they're running

824
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:58,200
with it pretty hard yeah you know what I

825
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,670
think those people that think that it

826
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,080
looks like harder drugs that are on the

827
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,509
news that are like it looks a lot like

828
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:04,829
they're doing this kind of drug because

829
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:07,230
they used to do that kind of drug and

830
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:09,629
they know or they just seen it in their

831
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,960
town and it scares them because like

832
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,778
there's epidemics on [ __ ]

833
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,769
all sorts of drugs that hit you know the

834
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:20,690
East Coast got ravaged by heroin yeah I

835
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:23,388
mean coke came in and took over the

836
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:27,019
whole country for a while there and then

837
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:30,469
there's ecstasy and what's what's the

838
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:34,659
meth is hitting like small [ __ ] it so

839
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:37,368
so I I have extended family that is

840
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:40,278
definitely [ __ ] with that [ __ ] and it

841
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:41,058
[ __ ] them up sorry to drop a couple of

842
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:45,048
hard f-bombs

843
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:46,819
it's just [ __ ] it that's it scary so you

844
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:48,230
start seeing that stuff and you start

845
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:51,230
seeing the lifestyle that they were in

846
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:53,929
and it's like damn well it kind of looks

847
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:56,179
the same as this daybreak and I

848
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:57,440
completely understand that it's not but

849
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,119
you start seeing some of the stuff that

850
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,580
they were like smoking out of whatever

851
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:05,028
they were doing like Matt there's no

852
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:06,710
joke so I just I don't think that this

853
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:10,429
is a gateway because I'm not even

854
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:12,139
willing to gateway into daps you know

855
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:15,379
I'm not gonna go back to drinking either

856
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:18,079
though so I I don't know I'm a I'm a

857
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:19,668
different breed you know I'm willing to

858
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,148
smoke because it's the right thing for

859
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:23,799
me

860
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:28,158
it keeps me healthy I appreciate that

861
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:29,690
does it unhealthy you either like

862
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,330
there's that component to a lot of it

863
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,759
too yeah yeah like that's the thing with

864
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:37,189
me and booze is like the first couple of

865
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,749
days that I'm having a drink or two if

866
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,909
I'm on a trip or something aren't a

867
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:42,879
problem it's a week later what I'm

868
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:45,679
having half a bottle at night oh yeah

869
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:48,378
yeah so I want to continue with the

870
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,460
other dabs look like drugs thing you

871
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:51,648
were saying earlier that we've got a

872
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,019
mutual friend that smokes with a nectar

873
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:55,189
collector I'm gonna describe the

874
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,200
difference between the nectar collector

875
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,330
and a normal rig a little bit here so

876
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,519
with my rig it looks like I have got

877
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:03,349
this is a it's called a hammer head as

878
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,679
the style of pipe so it is a can just

879
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:08,449
imagine a small cylinder and then coming

880
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,159
off that cylinder is a long mouth piece

881
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,899
that is flared open that fits your mouth

882
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,009
and they're just pretty cleanly so you

883
00:33:11,898 --> 00:33:15,829
don't have to make a little kissy face

884
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:18,110
then coming off at the top of that is it

885
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:20,089
looks like a bowl it looks like a pipe

886
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:23,418
bowl it looks like a thimble on a 90

887
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:25,220
degree piece of glass you heat the

888
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,970
thimble part and you put the dab in

889
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,680
there then you put

890
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,740
cap on it and you smoke it just like you

891
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,330
would any other pipe or bubbler I like a

892
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,630
small dab rig I've talked about why like

893
00:33:32,329 --> 00:33:37,279
a small dab rig in several episodes so

894
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,200
this one looks like kind of like your

895
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,089
basic like maybe your bubble crack pipe

896
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,990
or just a basic bubbler for smoking bong

897
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:47,179
or smoking flour yeah so with the the

898
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,650
nectar collector it is just a straight

899
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,330
tube it is straight and it may have

900
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,160
water if it doesn't have water I call

901
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:54,019
that a dab straw but it's just a

902
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,810
straight tube it's also known as a drill

903
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:59,329
I'm in instead of putting the dab onto

904
00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:01,069
the nail you leave the dabs in a tray or

905
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,899
a glass dish something that kind of

906
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:04,579
looks like similar to an ashtray kind of

907
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,900
see a lot of people dabbing straight out

908
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:08,569
of their silicone container which I

909
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,860
don't know how I feel about yeah but you

910
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,450
heat the tip of that and then you press

911
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,180
that directly into the concentrate and

912
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:16,909
then you inhale through the opposite end

913
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:18,619
it works its effective I prefer a rig is

914
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:21,139
definitely the way I prefer to dab in

915
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:23,690
your opinion does the nectar collector

916
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:25,129
versus the daybreak does that look any

917
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,800
different to you that less drugs or just

918
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,730
just as much drugs the the little straw

919
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,110
thing looks pretty

920
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:35,480
I mean his is yours clean and his not so

921
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:38,510
that's something to do with it - okay

922
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,820
Mike it's also you're using a creme

923
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:45,640
brulee he's using like one of those blue

924
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:48,650
torch like alright you know it's just I

925
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:51,559
don't know I really think that for me

926
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:53,990
it's the torch okay as you went through

927
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:56,119
this thing it's like yeah I'm not mad at

928
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:58,729
your little bong you know what

929
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,889
essentially that's a little wrong that's

930
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,300
all it is it's a bong for constant for

931
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:03,889
the curious looking little bowl like

932
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,410
what kind of new bowl is that it's it's

933
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:10,159
probably just the way it heats up to me

934
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:12,469
that's just like wow that's that's

935
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,869
excessive with the optics better when it

936
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:17,149
was electric did you ever see the

937
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:20,750
electronic I did but that I mean that's

938
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:23,090
been so long ago I mean I'm you know I

939
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,800
don't even remember who I was back daddy

940
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,390
was brand new at that time when he was

941
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,750
coming over with the email on the table

942
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:32,659
oh yeah yeah yeah Jesus seems like a

943
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,969
lifetime ago it was we've evolved so far

944
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:36,289
those two hundred episodes ago probably

945
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:39,619
Wow

946
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:41,809
man how the time flies huh

947
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:44,150
time flies episode 400 it'll be episode

948
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:47,179

949
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:52,220
just at 300 yeah yeah it feels 100

950
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:53,389
episodes we just did 300 yeah once again

951
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:54,829
thank you everybody for listening I know

952
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:56,769
this is a rambley ass episode but I

953
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:59,569
think the rambley episodes are super fun

954
00:35:56,769 --> 00:36:03,409
Mike's not in his head yep good radio

955
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:05,840
voice head-butting the mic for

956
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:07,339
indication to Mary I go back and listen

957
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,519
to the shows and I listen to most of the

958
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:13,100
episodes listeners even the ones I'm on

959
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:14,900
my favorite part is the like I'm usually

960
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:16,880
alone when I listen to the podcast or

961
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,519
like it work with headphones in or

962
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,720
something and it makes me feel like I'm

963
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,449
at the table hanging out with friends

964
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:29,839
for a little bit which is really nice

965
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:33,769
especially if you do right go ahead

966
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:35,300
click go ahead I feel like the people

967
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:36,650
that listen to the podcast I have

968
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,420
developed a relationship like a

969
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,309
friendship with a lot of people online

970
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,170
with I only know them through the

971
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:43,519
podcast some of them I get lucky enough

972
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,079
to actually meet them in person like

973
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,429
Aldridge came a little while back and I

974
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,380
got to shake his hand and meet him I

975
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:50,389
said a lot of people from the Indo Expo

976
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,680
I get to meet a lot of those people but

977
00:36:50,389 --> 00:36:53,599
there's a thing that happens when you

978
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,669
listen to 400 episodes of people they

979
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,679
know us now like they know people

980
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,210
remember [ __ ] that I said that I forgot

981
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,089
I even said and they bring it up and I'm

982
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,280
like how do you know that podcast where

983
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:06,050
I probably said that and I have I've

984
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,660
since I listened to a lot of podcasts I

985
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:11,030
see the same thing in other shows like

986
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:13,219
when people come when comedians come I

987
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:15,500
feel like I know them like we do know

988
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:17,239
people but it's even we have tighter

989
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,829
relationships with them just because of

990
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,599
their podcast I feel like I know stuff

991
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:22,489
about them and when they come it's like

992
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,960
hey how you been how is I know some of

993
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:25,849
my friends wives names because of their

994
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,019
podcast and other dogs name I know that

995
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:29,269
one of my friends has to have an eye

996
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:31,039
surgery because of his podcast when he

997
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:32,659
comes I talked to him about that and so

998
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,429
the people that listen have that they've

999
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:36,619
developed that with us too definitely

1000
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:39,529
we're we're friends like we have bros

1001
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:41,630
and lady friends that aren't romantic

1002
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:43,970
what do you call Bros it or females I'm

1003

trying to find a non gender bras that

1004
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:49,579
see that don't like that at all and

1005
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,680
chicks is really derogatory

1006
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:54,710
see we have a bunch of friends of

1007
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:57,980

1012
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:17,059
friendly relationships with the people

1013
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,620

1028
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,510
relationships through the podcast on to

1029
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:47,360
social media and you know it's it's

1030
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,760
great that we have this platform that

1031
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,430
this is a thing that we're allowed to do

1032
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,840
this is a great freedom yeah yeah this

1033
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:56,419
used to be pirate radio you know what I

1034
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,460
mean it really did it used to be what we

1035
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:01,130
made a fairly decent movie about it

1036
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,760
called pump up the volume like way back

1037
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,380
in the day

1038
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,090
yeah the idea of having an open free

1039
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,440
communication platform like this and I

1040
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,150
actually made my niece and nephew go

1041
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,480
watch it they were both blown away by

1042
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:16,849
the whole concept of that being a movie

1043
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,559
now and the internet yes no that [ __ ]

1044

clips of that movie when he had to hide

1046
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,989
the phone so that it could make him look

1047
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:27,259
like he was somewhere else and then the

1048
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:32,689
seven-minute stretch no good part of the

1049

of the webpage no one will ever click

1060
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:59,360
that it's not just the only thing on the

1061
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:02,720
webpage all right no one will click that

1062
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,760
oh [ __ ] I love movies like that where

1063
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,349
you get a good taste and flavor for like

1064
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,310
the world of the level attack at the

1065
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:13,099
time and even a few years later its yeah

1066
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:14,599
we didn't have yea the pirate radio we

1067
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:15,650
did not have the internet back then we

1068
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:17,210
couldn't do this and then we got

1069
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,950
podcasting and then they tried to stop

1070
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:21,170
podcasting with the patent troll thing

1071
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:22,460
and we fought that and got that off and

1072
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,960
now we're still going I said got that

1073
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,980
off that's kind of gross but we beat

1074
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,480
that and now we're still going

1075
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,150

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,070
top of the tier when you trying to talk

1082

craft brewery for sure you know

1128
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,980
everybody grew their own they will

1129
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:14,989
be easy I compare it to like Mike said

1130
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,940
craft brewer brewery is probably a

1131
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:20,209
really good comparison I kind of think

1132
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:22,280
of it like music equipment and musicians

1133
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,809
there are different levels of musicians

1134
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,390
and different level of commitment and

1135
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:27,529
different aspirations when it comes to

1136
00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:29,839
music just like there are when it comes

1137
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,640
to growing the equipment is overpriced

1138
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,289
you have to invest in a lot of it it

1139
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:34,609
takes a lot of time to get good at any

1140
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:36,230
of it I kind of think of it like a

1141
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:38,240
musician and that's kind of how it

1142
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,940
evolves and there's all there are always

1143
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:43,039
new young people coming in older people

1144
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,829
coming that want to become a musician I

1145
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,509
myself I rant this is random rap that

1146
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,369
fits right in it's midnight I just

1147
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,350
turned 40 years old right now for my

1148
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:52,369
thank you thank you much thank you

1149
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:54,019
listeners that are telling me happy

1150
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:56,239
birthday I do appreciate that for my

1151
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:57,920
birthday I bought myself the expensive

1152
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:00,289
drum set that I've been staring at since

1153
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,269
I was a kid so there will be growers

1154
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:03,829
that come along that are youngsters that

1155
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:05,750
want to learn how to grow there will be

1156
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:07,219
people that have a medical need that

1157
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,539
their state just comes along that

1158
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:10,489
legalizes that want to grow then they're

1159
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:12,050
gonna be guys that are 40 years old that

1160
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:13,789
just for their birth today they're gonna

1161
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,019
say well it's legal now I got a little

1162
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:17,000
bit of money because I'm doing well in

1163
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:18,199
my old age but if I can go buy a grow

1164
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,730
set up and start growing and they're

1165
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:21,469
gonna want to find a podcast like this

1166
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,000
or like you're saying the other cannabis

1167
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:24,769
podcast so it's gonna be a growing

1168
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,849
growing market I hate to call it a

1169
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,409
market that sounds like I'm trying to

1170
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:29,269
capitalize too much but it's a growing

1171
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:32,719
there's always going to be a demand for

1172
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:34,579
this even after all 50 states legalized

1173
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,259
because eventually we'll have national

1174
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:38,210
legalization that's the goal right is

1175
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,680
legalization nationwide so that we can

1176
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,900
all possess consume and safely I have

1177
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,519
access to our medicine once we get to

1178
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,170
that point we're gonna have everybody

1179
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,759
from every book every single state is

1180
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,220
gonna try to want to grow cannabis and

1181
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,660
then once that tapers off we still get

1182
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:52,699
those waves of folks like I was talking

1183
00:43:50,659 --> 00:43:53,869
about the young kids that just turn old

1184
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:55,549
enough it's legal to grow when you're

1185
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:57,679
this age whatever the nation makes it 18

1186
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,880
21 as soon as a bunch of people turn

1187
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:00,259
that age they're gonna start growing

1188
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,599
we're gonna get waves of that then

1189
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,590
you're gonna get the midlife crisis guys

1190
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,940
as I guess what we're gonna call them

1191
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,530
the 40 year old dudes that want to just

1192
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,849
do something new instead of buying a

1193
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:10,340
drum kit a bunch of guys are gonna go

1194
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:12,409
buy run down to the hydro store and drop

1195
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,700
two grand yeah and just go learn it in

1196
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:17,869
the basement just like a lot of guys are

1197
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:21,769
gonna do with the drums I mean it right

1198
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:25,099
now is like this DIY era of everything

1199
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:27,980
because I I cannot say I don't know how

1200
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:31,009
anymore absolutely there is no no one

1201
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:32,750
can say that at all I it doesn't matter

1202
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,040
what you're doing there's a YouTube

1203
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,630
video for it yep

1204
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:37,429
it doesn't matter what you're doing

1205
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:39,530
there's gonna be a podcast about it

1206
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:42,289
yeah and somebody's put in 400 episodes

1207
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:44,990
into some niche thing that yes it's

1208
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:47,289
blowing up or coming comparatively to

1209
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:51,949
what it's been for the last 150 years

1210
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:56,769
but I mean it's it's neat that we have

1211
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:56,769
access to this I'm really excited for

1212
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:02,750
what we can make happen like individuals

1213
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:05,420
you know what I mean

1214
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:08,840
like you put in 400 episodes I'd I put

1215
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,789
in five you know Mike's helping out with

1216
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,070
a hundred but he would have done zero on

1217
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:15,590
here without you here yeah I'd I said

1218
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:17,390
there's no way my podcast yeah I

1219
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:20,329
appreciate that yeah it's just you know

1220
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:22,159
hard work that's all I don't know

1221
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:23,779
getting older I start seeing it and I

1222
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:24,649

1223
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,000
bro thank you

1224
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:27,860

1225
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,690
end of this podcast dude I burned out a

1226
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:32,030
macbook i drew please the macbook

1227
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:33,740
because mainly all that old macbook did

1228
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:35,930
was a podcast and it's your passion

1229
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:37,429
that's got 400 episodes I mean maybe six

1230
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:38,960
of those were me calling you and being

1231
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:41,389
like I want to do an episode on blank

1232
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,490
right and I wouldn't have made those

1233
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:45,349
phone calls had you not already done a

1234
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:47,589
couple hundred episodes on other [ __ ]

1235
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:52,099
there's one time when I was super sick

1236
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:53,690
just so sick I got like six of my

1237
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:55,519
friends here and then you guys did a

1238
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:57,380
podcast without me basically i sat here

1239
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,239
and worked the knobs and press record on

1240
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,890
the computer and it was just six of my

1241
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:02,449
friends just [ __ ] talking for me so I

1242
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:04,009
was pretty cool I think Mike and Jesse

1243
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:06,439
and Hannibal remember if you were never

1244
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:09,320
missed a money thing is huge like the

1245
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,920
amount of effort and dedication that

1246
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:14,420
that takes is kind of nuts well I don't

1247
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,039
plan on stopping you guys there's no

1248
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,809
reason to stop podcasting the computer

1249
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:19,670
works the table is pretty sturdy I feel

1250
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:21,170
good cannabis is gonna just keep getting

1251
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:23,059
better and more illegal everywhere we go

1252
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,740
so there's no need to stop very true

1253
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:28,190
we're definitely gonna make it to 4:20

1254
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:30,679
and then we're gonna make it to 500 from

1255
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:35,389
there the moon then a thousand is the

1256
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:37,409
goal after that right the weird number I

1257
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:40,710
think it should be 701 is the goal

1258
00:46:37,409 --> 00:46:42,449
several two is the goals I just every

1259
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,470
one of these is special Flint wants to

1260
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:46,679
go one step at a time

1261
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:48,480
I'm that's all I am time I like it

1262
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,440
stick with us you guys this is gonna be

1263
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,190
a good show there's gonna be a good

1264
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,710
future for us

1265
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:55,650
we got really rambley today but it's

1266
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:58,550
been a fun 400th episode holy crap how

1267
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:00,150
long do you think it's still America

1268
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,710
legalized this weed

1269
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:06,260
I don't think do you think we got 10

1270
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:06,260
years how many states were left Mike

1271
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:17,260
he's doing the math that is

1272
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:24,190
guessing there's maybe six eight states

1273
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:26,260
that don't have any laws in conflict

1274
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:30,210
with the federal marijuana law so I'm

1275
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:33,250
including CBD only states like Utah

1276
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:35,800
leaving six or eight states that still

1277
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:41,710
have a hundred percent all marijuana is

1278
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:47,740
illegal including hemp so we're like

1279
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:48,159
ninety percent of the way yeah that's

1280
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:51,339
pretty good

1281
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:53,559
we're I mean we're at the traditional

1282
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:56,110
tipping point now there's thirty some

1283
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:58,989
medical states that allow medical access

1284
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:01,990
on one level or another for high THC

1285
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:05,199
content cannabis there's another half

1286
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:07,569
dozen CBD only states there's a couple

1287
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,549
of you can't smoke it but she could have

1288
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:13,180
it medically states there's eight or ten

1289
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:14,890
recreational states now usually this is

1290
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:16,599
the point with this many states in

1291
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:18,819
conflict with federal law where the feds

1292
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:21,819
go all [ __ ] alright fine we'll talk

1293
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:24,160
about it and then we spend a couple of

1294
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,570
years hashing out what the feds are

1295
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,730
gonna end up doing in the House and the

1296
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:30,250
Senate and then eventually something

1297
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:32,559
lands on the President's desk saying the

1298
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:35,409
feds are gonna do this so that the

1299
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,539
states can go ahead and do this like

1300
00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:39,789
when we do this with alcohol when it

1301
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:42,099
became legal again there were a number

1302
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:43,329
of states that said the Volstead Act is

1303
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:47,589
ridiculous the eighteenth Amendment

1304
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:50,380
gotta go we're repealing prohibition

1305
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,610
just here in Colorado and then the feds

1306
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:54,039
were like well it's still illegal

1307
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:56,200
federally there for a couple more years

1308
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:58,690
until enough states had come online and

1309
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:00,549
we've done this both ways like with

1310
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,869
highway funding the states were like

1311
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,039
well through or the feds were like we'll

1312
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:05,019
throw you a bunch of money for highway

1313
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:07,119
funding but you have to jack your

1314
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:08,800
drinking age up and that's how they got

1315
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,139
the drinking age to 21 across the

1316
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,769
country I didn't know that

1317
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:15,960
yep yeah yeah it's cool I mean I'm happy

1318
00:49:13,768 --> 00:49:20,399
that the drinking age is 21 because I'm

1319
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:23,999
so anti alcohol that that's a good thing

1320
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,130
Bryce I do like the idea of it falling

1321
00:49:23,998 --> 00:49:29,098
into line like this like the dominoes

1322
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:31,410
are falling towards the end of this

1323
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:35,039
prohibition in honestly there's a ton of

1324
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:37,108
federal action right now there's the

1325
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:40,950
federal cannabis caucus is a group of

1326
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:43,108
senators that are all very Pro cannabis

1327
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:44,368
and they've been around for two or three

1328
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:47,940
years and they've been a pretty

1329
00:49:44,369 --> 00:49:49,108
unimportant non powerful group up until

1330
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,470
this year and they've got a lot more

1331
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:53,880
clout this year the federal regulator or

1332
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:55,469
the federal legislation that's been

1333
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,539
submitted so far this year is already

1334
00:49:55,469 --> 00:49:59,759
getting a lot more press and a lot more

1335
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:02,869
attention more co-sponsors and that sort

1336
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:08,599
of thing then we've seen traditionally

1337
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:08,599
we've never had up a president is

1338
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:16,369
uncommitted to a stated set of policies

1339
00:50:13,759 --> 00:50:20,009
that's pretty diplomatic way to say it

1340
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:21,480
as we do right now so we don't really

1341
00:50:20,009 --> 00:50:23,338
know if Trump's gonna show up tomorrow

1342
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,809
and be like make wheat legal if I were

1343
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:26,759
gonna edit this how would you have said

1344
00:50:24,809 --> 00:50:28,798
that diplomatic statement how would I

1345
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:30,358
have said that yes diplomatically yes

1346
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:31,858
never had a [ __ ] [ __ ] like this in

1347
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:33,119
office before okay just keep in mind I'm

1348
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:35,038
not going to edit that I was just

1349
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,989
curious what you would have said but

1350
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,489
honestly there's you have no idea what

1351
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:41,369
what he's gonna do from one day to the

1352
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:42,809
next and he's under a ridiculous amount

1353
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:44,789
of pressure and scrutiny right now

1354
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:46,528
because like everyone involved in his

1355
00:50:44,789 --> 00:50:48,269
inauguration team is now in jail or on

1356
00:50:46,528 --> 00:50:52,798
their way there has pled guilty to

1357
00:50:48,268 --> 00:50:55,078
several felonies he's pretty cool so I

1358
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:57,298
mean wouldn't gangster when you bang

1359
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,890
people into a corner like that it's hard

1360
00:50:57,298 --> 00:51:00,659
to tell what they're gonna do and he

1361
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,118
seems like the type of dude who likes to

1362
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:06,179
say whatever it is to get you to stop

1363
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,980
yelling at him and I have a feeling that

1364
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:10,108
one of the crazy things he does when

1365
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,789
he's really backed into a corner is just

1366
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,858
like all right we're making weed legal

1367
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:16,320
by Proclamation which isn't the thing

1368
00:51:13,858 --> 00:51:19,019
the president can do but

1369
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,700
it doesn't stop the orange POTUS before

1370
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:23,009
but if he does it we're all just gonna

1371
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:26,069
go yeah well if he did something like

1372
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:28,530
that immediately after then the members

1373
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:31,500
of the House and the Senate that are

1374
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:35,340
committed to marijuana law reform

1375
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:37,679
would immediately dive on that and use

1376
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,180
it as pressure to push actual

1377
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:39,868
legislation that would change the law

1378
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,000
forward

1379
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:48,300
I still think States should be allowed

1380
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:51,719
to not I mean I get that like I don't

1381
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,430
maybe not recreational it should be the

1382
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:55,469
state's choice because once we start

1383
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:57,690
going national then it's like the nation

1384
00:51:55,469 --> 00:52:00,358
telling us what we're allowed the only

1385
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:02,789
thing the feds would do with would be to

1386
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:04,049
say the states can pick and choose from

1387
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:06,420
themselves just for the sake of

1388
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:09,930
conversation why do people have to be

1389
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:12,930
sick they enjoy cannabis I guess I don't

1390
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:15,480
think it's so much that I think it's the

1391
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:17,879
state that's that's why we have States

1392
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:20,579
is so that way we can write those things

1393
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:23,130
in yes so if the majority of a state

1394
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:24,779
says no we don't want that then that's

1395
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:27,210
their prerogative I don't think we

1396
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:29,970
should push anything on anybody and if

1397
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:31,980
you want to come to Colorado I mean it's

1398
00:52:29,969 --> 00:52:33,750
full no I think most people are deserted

1399
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,409
walls are already up so you guys are

1400
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,480
[ __ ] out of luck

1401
00:52:34,409 --> 00:52:37,679
I'm sorry that's bull if you want to

1402
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,929
move here now you have to convince new

1403
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,129
people to leave yeah that's the rule but

1404
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:43,289
you can come here but good luck finding

1405
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:46,460
somewhere to [ __ ] Park or just parked

1406
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:51,300
any parking spaces left in Colorado yeah

1407
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:52,590
three years so let's say I want to just

1408
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,420
keep that I like this conversation we

1409
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:57,030
really got on a good roll here um so

1410
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:59,130
let's just say that we do legalize

1411
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:00,540
cannabis we create in my mind it'll be a

1412
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:03,660
recreational thing they're not gonna

1413
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:06,179
they're gonna go for if we go medical it

1414
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:08,129
has to get too involved in the medical

1415
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:10,139
system and it's not the way we're doing

1416
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:12,150
medical cannabis is not the way that any

1417
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:15,809
other medical program would work it's

1418
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:17,730
not like that I hate to crush anybody's

1419
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:20,309
idea of what a medical cannabis program

1420
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:22,260
is if you think about the way medicine

1421
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:24,029
works you have to go back and see your

1422
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,950
so you go to get a cannabis card a

1423
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:27,000
medical marijuana recommendation you go

1424
00:53:25,949 --> 00:53:28,230
see the doctor you give them some money

1425
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,059
goes here's your card have a great day

1426
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,829
any other medicine if

1427
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:33,179
I went to the doctor and I said on my

1428
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:34,589
back hurts he said cool we'll give you

1429
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:36,269
some of these medicines to make your

1430
00:53:34,588 --> 00:53:38,128
back feel better I got to go back in 30

1431
00:53:36,268 --> 00:53:40,558
days and tell him how it worked if I've

1432
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:42,208
got any recovery if I feel worse he's

1433
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,259
gonna check my liver and kidneys if he's

1434
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:45,148
a good doctor and make sure that

1435
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:47,099
medicines not [ __ ] me up then he's

1436
00:53:45,148 --> 00:53:48,628
gonna have a treatment plan a medical

1437
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,219
marijuana doctor goes oh you smoke weed

1438
00:53:48,628 --> 00:53:52,588
for your problems there's a card

1439
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:54,148
he says crush the dreams it's the look I

1440
00:53:52,588 --> 00:53:57,239
mean even if we're just talking about

1441
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:59,128
Colorado's system there are physicians

1442
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:01,048
and patients doing exactly what you're

1443
00:53:59,128 --> 00:54:05,159
describing within our current system

1444
00:54:01,048 --> 00:54:06,838
it's just it's not mandated most of the

1445
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,358
patients I just referenced are under the

1446
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:11,449
age of 18 right it is much more

1447
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:15,148
scrutinized if you're a minor well in

1448
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:17,429
the other side of that coin is patients

1449
00:54:15,148 --> 00:54:19,798
aren't getting nearly what they do with

1450
00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:21,778
every other class of drug like there's a

1451
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:25,498
number of things in cannabis that help

1452
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:28,949
with countless medical ailments but

1453
00:54:25,498 --> 00:54:32,938
we're not refining or targeting or

1454
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:36,479
studying most of these effects and so

1455
00:54:32,938 --> 00:54:38,578
we're just guessing and I've had to go

1456
00:54:36,478 --> 00:54:40,018
back I mean when I wasn't buying the

1457
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:41,399
level of product i buy now but I

1458
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:43,378
remember going back to the Spencer II

1459
00:54:41,398 --> 00:54:45,088
two or three times in a week playing

1460
00:54:43,378 --> 00:54:48,628
with different stuff before I had

1461
00:54:45,088 --> 00:54:51,509
learned enough about which strains

1462
00:54:48,628 --> 00:54:54,538
affect my symptoms the best what I'm

1463
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:56,429
really looking for as far as cannabis

1464
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:57,929
for medical affects I was I was born so

1465
00:54:56,429 --> 00:55:05,128
Chivas and wondering what my pain wasn't

1466
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:07,079
any better now I know but like in an

1467
00:55:05,128 --> 00:55:09,048
ideal world when I go to my physician

1468
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:11,548
and I say I've got pain and inflammation

1469
00:55:09,048 --> 00:55:13,768
the pains being caused by inflammation

1470
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:14,639
in my neck it's pinching nerves what do

1471
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,558
you have to help me

1472
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:18,509
the doctor is gonna give me a pill with

1473
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,009
what's taken and useful from the

1474
00:55:18,509 --> 00:55:22,349
cannabis plant in it that's focus

1475
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:24,989
specifically on my problem same thing

1476
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:27,419
for epilepsy cancer whatever and those

1477
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:31,139
drugs are on the market now for a number

1478
00:55:27,418 --> 00:55:33,658
of reasons but to make up for that lack

1479
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:36,149
of availability we've got the current

1480
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:38,798
system and it's just not tenable if this

1481
00:55:36,148 --> 00:55:42,440
is legal coast to coast

1482
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:44,719
okay No so in what I was getting at is

1483
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,579
if we do go national illegal it's gonna

1484
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:47,988
be recreational for the reason that Mike

1485
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:50,829
and I stated that was a long way to stay

1486
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:53,749
it but I agree yeah so now we've got a

1487
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:54,798
recreational legal cannabis system in

1488
00:55:53,748 --> 00:55:57,858
Colorado

1489
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,659
it took three to five years to get that

1490
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:02,449
system figured out you know what I mean

1491
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:04,190
it the medical so the medical system was

1492
00:56:02,449 --> 00:56:05,358
a train wreck when it started it was the

1493
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:07,489
Wild West you could do whatever you

1494
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:09,528
wanted for seven eight years when the

1495
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:11,210
state refused to even look at it for

1496
00:56:09,528 --> 00:56:12,710
seven or eight years and so it just went

1497
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,639
totally unregulated that's why Callie's

1498
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:15,170
so [ __ ] now

1499
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:18,618
that's why Oklahoma is awesome right now

1500
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:20,269
also by the way so then we have the

1501
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:23,088
medical market con we already had that

1502
00:56:20,268 --> 00:56:24,709
medical experience to build on but when

1503
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,989
the recreational markets opened up it

1504
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:29,809
was still a semi [ __ ] it was done

1505
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:32,568
pretty well for who it wasn't what it

1506
00:56:29,809 --> 00:56:35,869
was but it was a semi [ __ ] when

1507
00:56:32,568 --> 00:56:37,759
the national system does come from the

1508
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:39,890
day they say I'm gonna sign this paper

1509
00:56:37,759 --> 00:56:42,048
and then January 1st 2000 and whatever

1510
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:45,469
we're gonna say 2020 just to be hopeful

1511
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:47,150
January 1st 2020 cannabis is legal you

1512
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:48,588
can open up a dispensary or recreational

1513
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,690
dispensary for people 21 and over

1514
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:53,719
anywhere in the United States of America

1515
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:55,759
ready set go how long do you think it'll

1516
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:57,259
take for that to actually be in place

1517
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:58,969
because we know that people if he says

1518
00:56:57,259 --> 00:57:01,130
it in 2019 we're not gonna be ready in

1519
00:56:58,969 --> 00:57:03,318
2020 it takes a long time you got a

1520
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:05,450
build rules area start setting up

1521
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:08,478
regulations how long until we actually

1522
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:10,278
have a system that works is that a three

1523
00:57:08,478 --> 00:57:12,710
year process is that five or ten years

1524
00:57:10,278 --> 00:57:15,018
it'll vary based state to state in

1525
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:19,639
places like Colorado that I already have

1526
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:23,449
a highly regulated system that's already

1527
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:26,960
fully up and running it'll only take us

1528
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:28,399
six months nine months to get all of our

1529
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,199
paperwork changed over in our

1530
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,210
accountants familiar with the new rules

1531
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:34,518
and [ __ ] we're just gonna have little

1532
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:37,099
procedural changes right a couple of

1533
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:38,659
compliance things maybe another two

1534
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:40,609
inspections to schedule now that the

1535
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:43,670
feds gonna be real busy for a couple

1536
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:45,949
weeks right but like we've already

1537
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:48,380
figured out most of it okay

1538
00:57:45,949 --> 00:57:50,659
places like do you think will kind of be

1539
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:52,068
the guideline do you think we qualify if

1540
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:54,259
you were gonna say already

1541
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:56,329
gold-standard okay well I worked with

1542
00:57:54,259 --> 00:57:58,548
another state like it's not unknown that

1543
00:57:56,329 --> 00:58:00,650
I do consulting for other states I've

1544
00:57:58,548 --> 00:58:02,568
got one state dude that they refused if

1545
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:03,769
Colorado's done it like with him [ __ ]

1546
00:58:02,568 --> 00:58:05,719
we don't like it they like want to

1547
00:58:03,768 --> 00:58:07,399
reinvent the goddamn legalization wheel

1548
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:09,199
and it is the most frustrating thing

1549
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,420
ever there's a bunch of that out in the

1550
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:14,539
world word my god if someone else has

1551
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:16,039
done it you have to do it over it drove

1552
00:58:14,539 --> 00:58:19,190
me nuts when we were writing just the

1553
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:21,559
marijuana rules here I called it the

1554
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:24,318
committee to discuss reinventing the

1555
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,339
wheel they like to meet every month and

1556
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,469
at the end of the meeting they go well

1557
00:58:25,338 --> 00:58:30,159
[ __ ] boys round it is I guess yeah

1558
00:58:27,469 --> 00:58:30,159
that's exact

1559
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:35,239
we're rolling the wheel in Colorado

1560
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:37,009
we're ten years ahead of you guys and

1561
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:39,949
you just don't want to play with us it's

1562
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:41,358
really weird but uh especially when it

1563
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,709
comes to cannabis you run into people

1564
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:45,018
who are like but what about the

1565
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:46,639
boogeyman yeah and it's like well we can

1566
00:58:45,018 --> 00:58:49,608
talk about it and we can make a rule

1567
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:52,639
that prevents that but like it's in your

1568
00:58:49,608 --> 00:58:55,458
head you know that right we're making a

1569
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:58,068
rule that people have to follow because

1570
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:59,389
of nonsense in your head and they'll go

1571
00:58:58,068 --> 00:59:01,068
like yeah but it's important that's a

1572
00:58:59,389 --> 00:59:03,228
lot of the cannabis industry that's a

1573
00:59:01,068 --> 00:59:04,818
lot of them a lot of politics in general

1574
00:59:03,228 --> 00:59:06,248
we're just mainly focused on cannabis

1575
00:59:04,818 --> 00:59:09,228
I'm noticing that that is a lot of

1576
00:59:06,248 --> 00:59:10,248
politics in general so let's do it back

1577
00:59:09,228 --> 00:59:12,018
toward kind of where we were we're

1578
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:14,268
getting this legalization nationally

1579
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:15,558
Colorado is the golden standard we've

1580
00:59:14,268 --> 00:59:17,389
kind of set the rules people are gonna

1581
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:19,609
follow our outline our guideline on how

1582
00:59:17,389 --> 00:59:22,129
to do the National legalization rollout

1583
00:59:19,608 --> 00:59:23,748
I've got a shitty idea on where a lot of

1584
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,798
that cannabis is gonna come from that's

1585
00:59:23,748 --> 00:59:26,509
I think there would be some sort of a

1586
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:28,068
national program something will come

1587
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:29,088
into place where there's a regulation of

1588
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:30,650
grows that it comes from somewhere

1589
00:59:29,088 --> 00:59:33,768
that's government regulated we'll talk

1590
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:35,778
about that in the future so other states

1591
00:59:33,768 --> 00:59:37,068
we've got states like Oregon and

1592
00:59:35,778 --> 00:59:38,028
Washington they've got a pretty good

1593
00:59:37,068 --> 00:59:39,558
head start do you think they'll be

1594
00:59:38,028 --> 00:59:41,690
online with this national program within

1595
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:42,979
just a year or so give or take if the if

1596
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:45,619
your state's already gotten up and

1597
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:47,958
running program I can't see too many

1598
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:49,699
problems that it might have while it's

1599
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:52,009
up and running that would cause any

1600
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:54,108
money six months to already running bio

1601
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:55,639
track or metric and I don't mean metric

1602
00:59:54,108 --> 00:59:57,018
like the measuring system I mean metric

1603
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:58,909
the computer program system the

1604
00:59:57,018 --> 01:00:02,268
marijuana enforcement tracking and other

1605
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:04,518
stuff system we all have to log into and

1606
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:06,129
hate anybody using that I think there'll

1607
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:07,748
be a little bit ahead of the

1608
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:10,420
the only thing I'm thinking that's

1609
01:00:07,748 --> 01:00:12,639
really gonna slow people down is the

1610
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:15,880
local rules and zoning [ __ ] can really

1611
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:19,509
bogged down the process I'm in Colorado

1612
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:23,650
took about three years to really hash

1613
01:00:19,509 --> 01:00:25,838
out the medical rules and that was after

1614
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:27,459
five years of mumbling about we need to

1615
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:29,619
do this then there was a good three

1616
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:31,838
years of actual debate before the rules

1617
01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:34,358
got hammered out and then we had another

1618
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:37,268
year and a half of debate for rec rules

1619
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:39,458
I mean just a couple like a year and a

1620
01:00:37,268 --> 01:00:42,939
half after we finished the Med rules we

1621
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:44,649
did recreational in most places decided

1622
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,749
they wanted to completely reinvent the

1623
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:51,489
wheel they didn't want to base anything

1624
01:00:46,748 --> 01:00:53,738
off of their existing medical rules it

1625
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:55,719
was just a bizarre process but I think

1626
01:00:53,739 --> 01:00:57,489
most places now have gone through at

1627
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:58,719
least some of that there's very few

1628
01:00:57,489 --> 01:01:01,420
places that are really going to be

1629
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:04,568
starting from scratch the thing that's

1630
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:06,670
gonna take the longest is when the feds

1631
01:01:04,568 --> 01:01:08,108
say we don't care anymore let go ahead

1632
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:10,389
and let the states do what they want

1633
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:12,880
there's gonna be a period of time where

1634
01:01:10,389 --> 01:01:14,889
each state goes well what do we want and

1635
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,130
for the states that haven't moved on

1636
01:01:14,889 --> 01:01:20,379
this issue yet if they decide they want

1637
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:21,849
to go with legalization then they're

1638
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:24,239
gonna have to pick well what type of

1639
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:26,650
legalization we want do we want youto

1640
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:29,708
alcohol model where it's from state-run

1641
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:32,979
stores that are staffed by off-duty cops

1642
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:34,448
or we want the Colorado model where when

1643
01:01:32,978 --> 01:01:35,948
you show up here with your duffel bag we

1644
01:01:34,449 --> 01:01:37,959
give you two ounces a weeded average

1645
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:39,818
like which model do you want to go with

1646
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:41,798
each state maybe another year and a half

1647
01:01:39,818 --> 01:01:43,150
while the hammer that [ __ ] out and then

1648
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:45,608
another year while they hammer out

1649
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:47,199
zoning rules so if Trump said let's do

1650
01:01:45,608 --> 01:01:51,848
it tomorrow you're looking at three

1651
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:53,459
years before your your Salt Lake City is

1652
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:56,318
driving past the dispensary

1653
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:58,239
all right that Jeb we were trying to

1654
01:01:56,318 --> 01:01:59,588
convince people earlier not to drive to

1655
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,719
Colorado to move here and you just said

1656
01:01:59,588 --> 01:02:04,088
that everybody gets two months a break

1657
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:06,219
please don't encourage them okay that

1658
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:08,440
also costs $8,000 you know unfortunately

1659
01:02:06,219 --> 01:02:12,309
there's only only about 300 bucks if you

1660
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:17,590
want to Welch's and the weed and the

1661
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:19,570
Davidge the cheap studio apartment is

1662
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:21,940
or any 1250 a month yeah it's gonna get

1663
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:23,710
expensive that will get expensive beyond

1664
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:25,650
everyone being able to smoke

1665
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:28,840
recreationally I think that it's gonna

1666
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,160
people that are in jail for this [ __ ] is

1667
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,350
[ __ ] ridiculous

1668
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:35,649
so like that will be the best thing that

1669
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:37,750
like pushing nonviolent cannabis

1670
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:39,760
offenses or this is just expunge those

1671
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:41,739
yeah you just like oh you got hemmed up

1672
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,170
for growing a couple of times you know

1673
01:02:41,739 --> 01:02:45,129
three strikes and you got screwed and

1674
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:47,289
it's like if you weren't stealing

1675
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:49,300
electricity and working with some sort

1676
01:02:47,289 --> 01:02:53,050
of weird crazy distribution system yeah

1677
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:55,720
make sense there's a lot of like when

1678
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:58,300
you look at the people that are only in

1679
01:02:55,719 --> 01:03:00,669
jail for specific marijuana rule

1680
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:04,090
violations you can get that number

1681
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:06,599
pretty small because most of the people

1682
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:09,309
that actually end up in real trouble

1683
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:11,829
when the cop busts you for weed they

1684
01:03:09,309 --> 01:03:14,799
bust you for weed and right

1685
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:21,009
and so it's while you were on parole or

1686
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:26,470
probation or stealing power or driving

1687
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:28,000
wall whatever and so just when the feds

1688
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,799
changed the rule if we decide to go

1689
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,050
ahead and let go anyone who's just got

1690
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,490
marijuana on their their record it's not

1691
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:37,060
going to do that much good what really

1692
01:03:33,489 --> 01:03:39,219
helps is the expunging getting all of

1693
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:40,570
that off you off your record like San

1694
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:41,769
Francisco's talking about doing now

1695
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:44,019
there's a couple of places that are

1696
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:46,480
already doing it I mean that's just huge

1697
01:03:44,019 --> 01:03:48,610
for people to get that the scarlet

1698
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,019
letter off your back right trying to

1699
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:51,610
apply for jobs and [ __ ] that's where I

1700
01:03:50,019 --> 01:03:53,679
was headed a lot of the cannabis

1701
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:55,630
industry jobs if you've been in trouble

1702
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:57,339
for growing cannabis in the past you

1703
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:59,710
cannot be in the industry and that

1704
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:01,110
leaves honestly who's more og than the

1705
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:03,639
people that got caught growing weed in

1706
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:05,650
1985 like they probably know more about

1707
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:07,239
herb than most people right and now they

1708
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,650
can't even work in the Grove because

1709
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:10,029
they got caught I don't know about the

1710
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:11,680
rule the statute of limitations but

1711
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:13,060
people that have been caught for drug

1712
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:14,799
offenses and cannabis offenses are

1713
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:16,329
banned from the cannabis industry and

1714
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,220
they probably know a lot so we're

1715
01:04:16,329 --> 01:04:19,929
blocking people that way so like mike

1716
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:21,309
says cleaning up that record we'll be

1717
01:04:19,929 --> 01:04:24,039
able to let those people back into the

1718
01:04:21,309 --> 01:04:26,829
industry right now in Colorado those

1719
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:30,539
people are diving on hemp jobs because

1720
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:31,980
it's just outside of the industry but

1721
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:34,829
your record doesn't matter there's no

1722
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,420
meed when it comes to him absolutely I

1723
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,949
know a guy who actually is in that exact

1724
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:39,510
situation he's a pretty good hemp grower

1725
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:41,569
he's a cannabis grower can't be in the

1726
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:44,880
industry runs a giant hemp farm the

1727
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:47,010
cannabis Facebook page I run the biggest

1728
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,570
story I shared last week Mike what's

1729
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:50,070
your cannabis Facebook page called low

1730
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,660
for sensible cannabis laws I wasn't

1731
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,010
going to take that opportunity but there

1732
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:54,509
you go

1733
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:55,680
the biggest story I shared last week the

1734
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:58,050
one that got the most attention was

1735
01:04:55,679 --> 01:05:01,409
about a CBD processing plant it's gonna

1736
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:03,570
be hiring like 150 to 200 people and

1737
01:05:01,409 --> 01:05:07,469
half of the interest was like oh [ __ ] I

1738
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:09,059
don't need a badge for this and that's

1739
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:11,849
huge for people that industry is blown

1740
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:13,739
up right now getting a badge is super

1741
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:15,000
easy if you don't have those though so

1742
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:17,399
if you're dragging your feet on that

1743
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,590
it's like you print out a 12-page thing

1744
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,990
you paid 75 bucks you go to Colorado

1745
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:24,210
Springs you've done and that's it yep

1746
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:28,769
take your finger I'm sorry guys I forgot

1747
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:31,230
this is global marijuana Colorado so

1748
01:05:28,769 --> 01:05:32,880
it's pretty easy so look it up if you if

1749
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:35,070
you're interested in this industry it's

1750
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,070
blowing up right now yes it is so let us

1751
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:39,780
get in now that's that's how I feel

1752
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:41,820
about it you know you don't have to

1753
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:44,460
smoke but you can work in these places

1754
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:45,780
and you know you probably end up smoking

1755
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,420
because you're gonna be around it a lot

1756
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:50,460
but there are plenty of non-consumers in

1757
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,559
the cannabis industry I'm sure lots of

1758
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:53,400
them there's money-hungry of people that

1759
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,039
don't smoke weed

1760
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:58,050
so people need jobs for sure we'll need

1761
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:59,369
jobs and just there are people that work

1762
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:00,510
at the cereal store that don't eat

1763
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:01,769
cereal you know what I mean there's

1764
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:05,730
people that work at the chip factory

1765
01:06:01,769 --> 01:06:07,289
they probably don't like Doritos I'm

1766
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:12,559
gonna be pissed if I find out of vegans

1767
01:06:07,289 --> 01:06:19,739
in my state all right with that

1768
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:21,539
vegan sin hate at 15 yeah I've got two

1769
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:23,639
final bullet points that I want to cover

1770
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:24,989
there's no way to segue into these just

1771
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:28,889
random things that I had written down as

1772
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:31,879
we start wrapping up the show here I'm

1773
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:34,949
just making sure that okay cool

1774
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:37,019
one thing I want to talk about is I was

1775
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:38,969
at a dispensary recently and a young man

1776
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:40,980
came it was cold outside and a young man

1777
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:42,539
came running from his vehicle into the

1778
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,820
dispensary and he opened the door he

1779
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:45,289
walked any shook his jacket

1780
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:49,550
he sat down and he patiently waited in

1781
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:51,050
line like anybody else should another

1782
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:53,450
person in the dispensary made a comment

1783
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:54,920
to me about how he was cheating the

1784
01:06:53,449 --> 01:06:56,689
medical marijuana system because he

1785
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:59,360
looks like he's well bodied and able to

1786
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:01,789
run into the dispensary Mike is shaking

1787
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:04,480
his head he already sees the session so

1788
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:07,309
me - I wanted to politely tell people

1789
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,800
you don't have the right to decide who

1790
01:07:07,309 --> 01:07:11,900
has a medical problem that validates

1791
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:14,030
them using cannabis to improve the

1792
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:16,670
quality of their life that young man has

1793
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:18,410
a mental condition the cannabis prevents

1794
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:20,119
him from hurting himself on a daily

1795
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,079
basis I know that person he's a friend

1796
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,699
of mine so it kind of pissed me off that

1797
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:24,889
that person said that about him that

1798
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:27,230
person has come a long way in their life

1799
01:07:24,889 --> 01:07:28,849
and cannabis did it without cannabis

1800
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:30,230
that dude would have killed himself to

1801
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:32,569
be quite frank he would have killed

1802
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:34,490
himself a long time ago I've been his

1803
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:35,960
blood tender at multiple dispensaries he

1804
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:38,569
used to come to a dispensary Mike and I

1805
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:41,150
ran in 2008 so when that guy said that

1806
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:43,160
about him I was like yes yes I was like

1807
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:44,300
good I wanted to yell at that guy be

1808
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:46,399
like you're [ __ ] wrong dude just

1809
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,060
because you have a cane and you walk

1810
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,650
with the limp

1811
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:50,360
doesn't make you any more of a valid

1812
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:52,309
patient than that young man he can run

1813
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:54,980
he can lift weight but his struggle is

1814
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:57,320
internal and you can't see that little

1815
01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:00,019
even doctors can't glance at you and

1816
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:01,580
diagnose you right and you see this

1817
01:08:00,019 --> 01:08:03,139
outside of the cannabis industry too

1818
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:05,659
like I just saw something on Facebook

1819
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:08,769
about this happening to just a woman

1820
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:11,059
with a disability that's not obviously

1821
01:08:08,769 --> 01:08:14,269
obvious when you glance at her walking

1822
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:15,679
across the parking lot but it drives me

1823
01:08:14,269 --> 01:08:19,159
nuts in the cannabis space because

1824
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:25,789
there's a million reasons that people

1825
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:28,970
take cannabis medically and like I'm in

1826
01:08:25,789 --> 01:08:33,199
physical pain a lot say nine days out of

1827
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:35,300
ten my pains at a fiver better never or

1828
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:37,369
almost never does that affect my walking

1829
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:39,199
people that know you I know you I see

1830
01:08:37,369 --> 01:08:40,909
you on a regular basis I can see it yeah

1831
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:42,139
but people don't like know you'll see me

1832
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:44,449
walking in the store I'm just another

1833
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,320
giant guy walking store your hips move

1834
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:47,630
differently when you're hurting

1835
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:52,279
you're a terrific guy walk next to you

1836
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:53,659
on a regular basis you know yeah but you

1837
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:55,880
can't see it the first person I ever

1838
01:08:53,659 --> 01:08:56,708
helped get their medical marijuana card

1839
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,409
of the person

1840
01:08:56,708 --> 01:09:04,149
credit with really starting me on my

1841
01:08:59,408 --> 01:09:05,679
cannabis advocacy they have MS and some

1842
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:07,598
days you can be like all [ __ ] dude

1843
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:11,288
what's wrong with him like at a distance

1844
01:09:07,599 --> 01:09:13,569
you can tell in other days you can't

1845
01:09:11,288 --> 01:09:16,658
tell at all he's young he's healthy he's

1846
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:19,809
fit it doesn't make sense at a glance

1847
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:22,658
why he's got my handicap placard in his

1848
01:09:19,809 --> 01:09:25,809
windshield the last time me and him went

1849
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:28,058
to a concert at Red Rocks he felt super

1850
01:09:25,809 --> 01:09:29,619
guilty when I was like dude you're

1851
01:09:28,059 --> 01:09:32,469
driving and he was like what do you mean

1852
01:09:29,618 --> 01:09:33,759
and I was like [ __ ] handicapped

1853
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:35,408
placard dude we're going all the way to

1854
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:38,738
the top for parking in a good spot we're

1855
01:09:35,408 --> 01:09:40,748
walking 15 feet to our seats like if we

1856
01:09:38,738 --> 01:09:42,518
try to do this Red Rocks the other way

1857
01:09:40,748 --> 01:09:44,108
you're not gonna make it through the

1858
01:09:42,519 --> 01:09:45,489
first act you'll be too tired to keep

1859
01:09:44,109 --> 01:09:46,929
your head up and I'll have to call

1860
01:09:45,488 --> 01:09:49,838
people to help me get you back to the

1861
01:09:46,929 --> 01:09:51,880
car bro and he felt guilty about using

1862
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:53,349
it for himself and then halfway through

1863
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,900
the show he was like [ __ ] I'm so glad

1864
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:58,179
you suggested this I'd be dead if we

1865
01:09:55,899 --> 01:10:00,308
tried to walk here in the seat but

1866
01:09:58,179 --> 01:10:01,868
people that watch this park and watch us

1867
01:10:00,309 --> 01:10:03,729
get out of the car and watch us walk to

1868
01:10:01,868 --> 01:10:04,808
our seats I'm sure there were a number

1869
01:10:03,729 --> 01:10:09,159
of people that were like [ __ ]

1870
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:10,360
cheaters right I don't see that I see

1871
01:10:09,158 --> 01:10:12,098
because you're a compassionate person

1872
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:13,538
and not an [ __ ] but there are some

1873
01:10:12,099 --> 01:10:16,150
[ __ ] out there that saw that young

1874
01:10:13,538 --> 01:10:18,728
man that who's a veteran who's been to

1875
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:21,098
war and [ __ ] is a serviceman and has

1876
01:10:18,729 --> 01:10:22,599
MS they [ __ ] watch that dude walk and

1877
01:10:21,099 --> 01:10:24,369
couldn't see his lamp or see his

1878
01:10:22,599 --> 01:10:25,900
struggle and they judged him so that's

1879
01:10:24,368 --> 01:10:27,819
what I'm talking about you can't see it

1880
01:10:25,899 --> 01:10:28,958
my claim to fame I've got blown out

1881
01:10:27,819 --> 01:10:30,908
knees as part of why I've got a

1882
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:32,800
marijuana card i I hit my knees on the

1883
01:10:30,908 --> 01:10:34,808
dash and a car accident also I've got

1884
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,070
some stomach problems you don't hear a

1885
01:10:34,809 --> 01:10:36,788
lot about my stomach problems I don't

1886
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:38,708
talk about it a lot

1887
01:10:36,788 --> 01:10:40,868
nobody cares nobody wants to hear me cry

1888
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:43,118
that my tummy hurts but that is a lot of

1889
01:10:40,868 --> 01:10:45,969
my medical marijuana condition it helps

1890
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:47,469
with my stomach you can't see that can

1891
01:10:45,969 --> 01:10:48,880
you can you tell right now by looking at

1892
01:10:47,469 --> 01:10:49,719
me how does my stomach feel do I need to

1893
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,269
fart am i hungry

1894
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:53,729
you have no idea yeah sometimes it hurts

1895
01:10:52,269 --> 01:10:56,590
like someone's putting an ice pick in

1896
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:57,699
just to the my right side of my belly

1897
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:59,019
button it feels like they're putting an

1898
01:10:57,698 --> 01:11:00,279
ice pick in there and then kind of

1899
01:10:59,019 --> 01:11:01,659
pointing it up a little bit and then

1900
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:03,788
after it really starts to hurt it goes

1901
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:05,438
straight down and I've had a camera in

1902
01:11:03,788 --> 01:11:08,889
my throat I've had a camera in my butt

1903
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:10,360
there's no reason why but if I consume

1904
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:13,060
enough cannabis

1905
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:16,118
Stilley that doesn't happen that's

1906
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:17,619
awesome yeah yeah it sucks right let's

1907
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:19,599
do that we've got a cure that we found a

1908
01:11:17,618 --> 01:11:22,719
patch for it that it doesn't hurt so

1909
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,670
yeah pretty easy cure too it's not like

1910
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:32,319
[ __ ] radiation for cancer and the

1911
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:34,239
side effects from niacin is right but my

1912
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:35,529
point is you guys don't and I'm sure

1913
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:37,839
that nobody listening to the show here

1914
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:39,158
is going to judge anybody based on their

1915
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,779
appearance based on their cannabis needs

1916
01:11:39,158 --> 01:11:42,579
but sure that what the world don't let

1917
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:44,289
people judge people just because that

1918
01:11:42,579 --> 01:11:46,658
young man ran into the store edgeless

1919
01:11:44,289 --> 01:11:48,460
that dude's got issues that you can't

1920
01:11:46,658 --> 01:11:49,899
see he's he deal I don't know if I

1921
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:53,739
should talk about that dudes things he

1922
01:11:49,899 --> 01:11:55,210
may hear this but yeah he's got

1923
01:11:53,738 --> 01:11:56,888
struggles and we don't need to [ __ ]

1924
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:58,210
judge him and that's probably even worse

1925
01:11:56,889 --> 01:11:59,350
if that's why he [ __ ] struggles in

1926
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:03,609
the world because people are judging him

1927
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:05,110
okay we're just gonna right now I saw

1928
01:12:03,609 --> 01:12:06,429
something funny in the news this is

1929
01:12:05,109 --> 01:12:08,049
sadly funny

1930
01:12:06,429 --> 01:12:09,429
this is you were just talking about the

1931
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:10,600
warehouse that was hiring in I visioned

1932
01:12:09,429 --> 01:12:14,340
a warehouse and it brought me back to

1933
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:17,409
this news subject there are a few taco

1934
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:19,150
spots in Colorado Springs where I love

1935
01:12:17,408 --> 01:12:20,649
to eat dude I love to eat it all these

1936
01:12:19,149 --> 01:12:22,448
little crappy taco spots they've got a

1937
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:24,309
burrito supreme and some french fries

1938
01:12:22,448 --> 01:12:25,719
with cheese and guacamole I am an dude

1939
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,949
it'll be nice and late I'll be coming

1940
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:29,469
home from a show and that's the perfect

1941
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:32,349
spot to stop and get some snacks um a

1942
01:12:29,469 --> 01:12:33,579
few weeks ago one of the taco places was

1943
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:35,260
closed I was like well I'm just gonna

1944
01:12:33,579 --> 01:12:36,969
ditch her over to the other taco place

1945
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:39,460
of the same name just a few blocks away

1946
01:12:36,969 --> 01:12:41,109
and that taco place was closed as well I

1947
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,489
was like what's going on with all my

1948
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:43,658
taco shops and I mentioned it to a

1949
01:12:42,488 --> 01:12:45,729
friend and like dude you didn't know

1950
01:12:43,658 --> 01:12:47,049
that all the taco shops by that name got

1951
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:48,819
shut down by the local law enforcement

1952
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:50,949
because they were all laundering money

1953
01:12:48,819 --> 01:12:52,719
for a drug cartel and I was like that's

1954
01:12:50,948 --> 01:12:54,579
why they made the best burritos on the

1955
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,500
planet for like six bucks do you like I

1956
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:58,179
want a burrito in like six dollars no

1957
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:02,079
tax for just six dollars you're like

1958
01:12:58,179 --> 01:13:03,969
that's weird already like six dollars

1959
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:06,219
and you'd get a burrito that was the

1960
01:13:03,969 --> 01:13:08,198
size of like a watermelon you'd be like

1961
01:13:06,219 --> 01:13:09,579
that's a burrito and I couldn't eat the

1962
01:13:08,198 --> 01:13:11,138
whole I'm a big dude and I couldn't

1963
01:13:09,579 --> 01:13:12,760
finish that burrito and I get the

1964
01:13:11,139 --> 01:13:14,529
burrito with french fries cheese and

1965
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:16,119
guacamole it was like 13 bucks for all

1966
01:13:14,529 --> 01:13:18,189
of it you can get a horchata with it for

1967
01:13:16,118 --> 01:13:20,920
15 bucks are you set up they were a

1968
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:23,738
straight up front for a drug cartel just

1969
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,029
cleaning up all the money today bro too

1970
01:13:23,738 --> 01:13:28,238
the news you're smiling so I think you

1971
01:13:25,029 --> 01:13:30,460
saw the same article it's so funny there

1972
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:33,309
was a giant warehouse near them that

1973
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:35,109
just recently got raided because they

1974
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:36,370
were not ordering anything that they

1975
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:37,779
were claiming they were ordering they

1976
01:13:36,369 --> 01:13:39,279
were writing off tax order saying we

1977
01:13:37,779 --> 01:13:40,988
ordered like this many tortillas and

1978
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:42,969
this much food for this many restaurants

1979
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:44,589
they're connected you're talking about

1980
01:13:42,969 --> 01:13:46,149
the distribution warehouse for these

1981
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:47,619
restaurants yeah and I just got around a

1982
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:50,170
bus in the warehouse yeah yeah they were

1983
01:13:47,619 --> 01:13:51,099
only delivering to these taco shops but

1984
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,899
they were acting like they were

1985
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:54,760
supplying all of Colorado Springs with

1986
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:57,699
food for preparation but it was just one

1987
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:01,119
place so they were just so they this

1988
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:03,250
whole bus stems from a dude paying for a

1989
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:07,210
car that cost more than $10,000 in cash

1990
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:09,760
up in Wyoming like three years ago he

1991
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:11,230
you know that if you deposit or spend

1992
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,820
more than ten thousand of cash they have

1993
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:14,799
filed paperwork they filed the paperwork

1994
01:14:12,819 --> 01:14:16,840
and they looked at the dude they were

1995
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,869
like so he's an illegal alien who lives

1996
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:22,600
in the next state over curious why he

1997
01:14:19,869 --> 01:14:25,359
drove to Wyoming I mean everyone's

1998
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:31,180
favorite destination they had a blue one

1999
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:32,589
there right Chevy Tahoe but the story

2000
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,510
gets funnier funny when they first

2001
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:36,969
busted the taco shops there were a bunch

2002
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:38,560
of poyo sir Manos jokes yeah and now

2003
01:14:36,969 --> 01:14:40,480
that they've busted the distribution

2004
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,760
chain every psycho [ __ ] dude offense

2005
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:45,159
gilliam now there's rumor that they have

2006
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:48,280
attached it to El Chapo so I was eating

2007
01:14:45,159 --> 01:14:49,389
El Chapo veggie burritos ooh yeah yeah

2008
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:51,369
thanks El Chapo

2009
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:53,890
yeah I loved that the El Chapo trial

2010
01:14:51,369 --> 01:14:59,559
took place this is a weird edge during

2011
01:14:53,890 --> 01:15:02,020
the wall debate because every day in the

2012
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,640
press you would hear reasons for and

2013
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,739
against building a large physical

2014
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:08,140
barrier on our southern border and then

2015
01:15:05,738 --> 01:15:10,929
at night after the trial adjourned for

2016
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:14,289
the day you would read how major drug

2017
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:19,329
cartels shipped drugs and never ever did

2018
01:15:14,289 --> 01:15:21,760
these two conversations meet I'll let

2019
01:15:19,329 --> 01:15:24,159
listeners will research their various

2020
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,140
ideas and things involve wall won't stop

2021
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:27,880
that's [ __ ] there's a catapult

2022
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:30,219
yeah the catapults [ __ ] awesome

2023
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,739
there's a drone the wall doesn't stop it

2024
01:15:30,219 --> 01:15:34,449
no except your ability to own the land

2025
01:15:32,738 --> 01:15:36,250
that's underneath it's like a speed bump

2026
01:15:34,449 --> 01:15:36,880
that's all it really is for a cartel

2027
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,819
smell

2028
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,469
it's not even that it's just a thing

2029
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:43,719
like they're sending [ __ ] cocaine

2030
01:15:41,469 --> 01:15:47,619
here by the ton and submarines yeah

2031
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:48,850
they're in the entire train is drugs the

2032
01:15:47,619 --> 01:15:51,908
only thing that's not drugs is the

2033
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:53,350
[ __ ] wheels in the engine in no we

2034
01:15:51,908 --> 01:15:57,789
think the wall is gonna stop the train

2035
01:15:53,350 --> 01:16:00,429
the airplane the submarine no it's the

2036
01:15:57,789 --> 01:16:02,109
semis bringing it in to that just not

2037
01:16:00,429 --> 01:16:05,109
all of them get checked as well as other

2038
01:16:02,109 --> 01:16:06,880
ones like why tape one kilo to a person

2039
01:16:05,109 --> 01:16:12,130
when you could tape a million kilos to

2040
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:14,500
one train yeah so it's a pretty scary

2041
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:16,029
proposition there well now that you are

2042
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:18,969
can't make any money off importing

2043
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:20,738
cannabis you got to up your ante do you

2044
01:16:18,969 --> 01:16:24,158
think that's what happened do you think

2045
01:16:20,738 --> 01:16:26,500
that that's why disciple I should know

2046
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:30,269
things got worse in Mexico or not I

2047
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:32,619
don't know things have gotten stranger

2048
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:35,679
the cannabis farmers are still farming

2049
01:16:32,619 --> 01:16:37,599
drugs for the most part they're just not

2050
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:39,130
farming cannabis anymore in the

2051
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,449
traffickers are still trafficking drugs

2052
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:43,060
they're just not traffic in cannabis

2053
01:16:40,448 --> 01:16:45,069
anymore right and that has had some

2054
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:47,170
weird repercussions all the people that

2055
01:16:45,069 --> 01:16:51,009
used to make money on weed that are

2056
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:53,340
making money on weeding now are doing

2057
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:55,329
other various things to make money and

2058
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:57,279
like that was one of the weird negative

2059
01:16:55,329 --> 01:17:01,170
consequences that we kind of knew to

2060
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:04,899
expect but didn't like to talk about is

2061
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:08,590
look I bring this up a lot online but

2062
01:17:04,899 --> 01:17:10,500
the best guess for what the black market

2063
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:14,110
was coast to coast before legalization

2064
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:17,460
is thirty to sixty billion dollars a

2065
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:19,750
year just us domestic and that's

2066
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:21,639
Americans by thirty to sixty billion

2067
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:24,460
dollars for the cannabis each year you

2068
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:27,850
know all of that underground you got to

2069
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:29,800
imagine just how like if you imagine a

2070
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:31,659
root system how far those [ __ ] roots

2071
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,670
go to do thirty five to sixty billion

2072
01:17:31,658 --> 01:17:36,129
dollars a year to put that in something

2073
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:39,130
that you can picture cosmetics or thirty

2074
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:43,060
five billion a year so like all shampoo

2075
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:43,960
and eyeliner and [ __ ] is 35 billion what

2076
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:46,719
is Apple worth

2077
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:48,429
I was just Carrie I think somebody in

2078
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:49,630
the room would know that off the top can

2079
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:50,739
you compare that all Google if when you

2080
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:52,239
guys keep talking I'll find a

2081
01:17:50,738 --> 01:17:55,029
a company that is worth thirty five

2082
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:57,158
billion dollars Justin that's how I got

2083
01:17:55,029 --> 01:18:00,460
the cosmetics is because I looked up

2084
01:17:57,158 --> 01:18:02,948
like US domestic sales 35 billion or

2085
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:06,578
whatever kind of imagined cosmetics with

2086
01:18:02,948 --> 01:18:08,408
as much [ __ ] is my wife and kids by

2087
01:18:06,578 --> 01:18:11,679
well think of all the different stores

2088
01:18:08,408 --> 01:18:14,649
that you interact with on a monthly

2089
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:16,179
basis say that sell cosmetics in one

2090
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:20,498
form another from the gas station that

2091
01:18:16,179 --> 01:18:22,840
sells just blistex to the Sallie Mae

2092
01:18:20,498 --> 01:18:25,210
yeah Sally's that sells all that

2093
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:27,130
specialty hair dye [ __ ] like all

2094
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:29,109
different levels the manufacturing

2095
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:32,559
warehouse is the distribution trucks and

2096
01:18:29,109 --> 01:18:34,779
as much as all of that is like almost

2097
01:18:32,559 --> 01:18:36,940
it's all underground weighed minimum of

2098
01:18:34,779 --> 01:18:39,130
underground wheat and that's the minimum

2099
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:41,229
almost you stepped thirty to sixty yes

2100
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:43,569
so I mean we might not expect sixty but

2101
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:45,998
we could probably say forty five yep

2102
01:18:43,569 --> 01:18:48,219
it's forty five billion dollars

2103
01:18:45,998 --> 01:18:51,219
stretches way out apples worth a

2104
01:18:48,219 --> 01:18:52,599
trillion that's not they're twelve zeros

2105
01:18:51,219 --> 01:18:53,948
in that I think I saw I already went

2106
01:18:52,599 --> 01:18:55,029
past it cuz it blew my mind I didn't

2107
01:18:53,948 --> 01:18:56,919
want to focus too much I'm looking to

2108
01:18:55,029 --> 01:19:02,109
see what Netflix is worth now has a lot

2109
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:03,940
of zeros 1200 my bank account too

2110
01:19:02,109 --> 01:19:15,908
they're on the wrong end of the ones

2111
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:17,948
though yeah yeah great when when we

2112
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:21,189
moved this market into the legal market

2113
01:19:17,948 --> 01:19:22,629
we a lot of places specifically excluded

2114
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:25,238
people that had gotten in trouble or

2115
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:27,010
were overly involved previously and so

2116
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:30,459
all those people got [ __ ] out of a job

2117
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:31,900
and it did some weird [ __ ] guy was

2118
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:34,239
looking at arrest numbers the other day

2119
01:19:31,899 --> 01:19:38,049
in Colorado cannabis arrests are down

2120
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:40,529
like 6500 a year but the number of

2121
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:43,059
people we arrest each year has gone up

2122
01:19:40,529 --> 01:19:45,609
now some of that's the cop having free

2123
01:19:43,059 --> 01:19:47,769
time now but some of that's other [ __ ]

2124
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:51,598
too right I'm not saying weed cause

2125
01:19:47,769 --> 01:19:54,150
crime to go up but these are things

2126
01:19:51,599 --> 01:19:56,699
so uh this is a ramble cast I've kind of

2127
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:58,920
wondered hoping helmet if no more the

2128
01:19:56,698 --> 01:20:00,839
helmet we didn't make it but the the

2129
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,929
lack of the black market having the

2130
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:05,940
money of we'd yeah I get you no wait a

2131
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:08,219
step up your game now huh I gotta go I

2132
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:09,839
gotta go make my fifty bucks because my

2133
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:12,480
family's hungry well what do I do

2134
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:13,949
man go and steal something from Sears

2135
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:15,509
and it got weird cuz people

2136
01:20:13,948 --> 01:20:17,158
automatically assume like well the weed

2137
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:19,230
dealer just sells coke now and it's like

2138
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:23,368
well okay they could switch which drug

2139
01:20:19,229 --> 01:20:26,729
they sell but there are an equal number

2140
01:20:23,368 --> 01:20:29,059
of consumers of any other drug compared

2141
01:20:26,729 --> 01:20:31,428
to cannabis right look unless this

2142
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:33,300
mythical person opened a liquor store

2143
01:20:31,429 --> 01:20:34,319
something attached to this I kind of

2144
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:36,179
want to segue off of that because I've

2145
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:38,729
had this question for a little while do

2146
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:41,219
you think now that herb cannabis is

2147
01:20:38,729 --> 01:20:42,479
legal and kind of just out in the open

2148
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:44,069
it's just like drinking a beer in a lot

2149
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:45,419
of places nobody cares anymore if you're

2150
01:20:44,069 --> 01:20:46,289
in Colorado and you smell weed you don't

2151
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,849
even hesitate anymore

2152
01:20:46,289 --> 01:20:49,859
and a lot of places when you smell weed

2153
01:20:47,849 --> 01:20:51,599
you gotta go someone smoked and some

2154
01:20:49,859 --> 01:20:53,250
reefer playing Colorado it's just what

2155
01:20:51,599 --> 01:20:58,770
it [ __ ] smells like now yeah do you

2156
01:20:53,250 --> 01:21:06,679
think you smell what like the smells

2157
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:09,719
like do you think that that has made

2158
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:11,460
cannabis less desirable for the rebel

2159
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:14,578
kids and now they're going straight for

2160
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:16,170
something different because back in the

2161
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:17,670
day it was kind of it was no there was

2162
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:19,800
this different feeling of like him

2163
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:21,179
[ __ ] smoking a bowl on Drive and I

2164
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,619
totally shouldn't be doing this and now

2165
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:24,569
it's just I still shouldn't be doing

2166
01:21:22,618 --> 01:21:27,000
that don't smoke a bowl okay smoking a

2167
01:21:24,569 --> 01:21:32,279
joint well I'm walking down the mountain

2168
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:34,710
that's that sounds amazing let's do that

2169
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:39,809
okay with the dog and a pretty lady I'm

2170
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:41,819
just responsible lady it definitely was

2171
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:44,099
a rite of passage when we were younger

2172
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:46,469
yeah there's a thing going around now

2173
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:48,569
that's like in the 80s it was beer in

2174
01:21:46,469 --> 01:21:51,828
the 90s and the 2000s it was weed and

2175
01:21:48,569 --> 01:21:51,828
now it's getting vaccinated

2176
01:21:53,988 --> 01:22:00,539
it definitely wasn't especially when we

2177
01:21:56,908 --> 01:22:02,009
were teenagers like the first was did

2178
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:04,019
you steal a beer from your parents yet

2179
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:05,170
then it was you snuck a cigarette from

2180
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:07,630
somebody yet

2181
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:10,119
and then it was have you found weed yet

2182
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:12,250
yep and I don't know about you guys but

2183
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:14,229
like my first weed was literally [ __ ]

2184
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:16,569
thrown at me in seventh grade while I

2185
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:17,799
was at school in the hallway like I was

2186
01:22:16,569 --> 01:22:20,979
sitting there and was pelted in the

2187
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:22,810
chest with a bag of weed that literally

2188
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:24,639
[ __ ] happened Mike that's a story we

2189
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:26,200
were gonna have to have in full detail

2190
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:28,960
here on this podcast if not tonight in

2191
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:30,220
the very near future but like I didn't

2192
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,869
even have to seek out that rite of

2193
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:33,610
passage it was just sort of like I woke

2194
01:22:31,869 --> 01:22:35,109
up in line for the roller coaster yeah

2195
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:36,339
it's like you're just standing somewhere

2196
01:22:35,109 --> 01:22:38,170
and your friends are smoking a joint

2197
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:41,260
somewhere like we'd come from like are

2198
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:44,440
you gonna hit this yeah what are you

2199
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:46,119
guys but it it definitely wasn't right

2200
01:22:44,439 --> 01:22:48,519
of passage and that's going away slower

2201
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:49,840
and slower that's one of the compare and

2202
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,340
contrast with the Netherlands that

2203
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,310
people have brought up a lot is they

2204
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:57,220
have far less teenage and young adult

2205
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:58,570
drug use period and cannabis use even

2206
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:00,909
though they have stores that sell

2207
01:22:58,569 --> 01:23:02,619
cannabis to 18 year olds and it's

2208
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:04,329
because it's not that interesting how

2209
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:06,970
long do you think till walmart has

2210
01:23:04,329 --> 01:23:09,430
cannabis currently at Walmart you can't

2211
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:12,039
buy cannabis cannabis but you can buy a

2212
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:14,079
puff coke peak which is a vaporizer for

2213
01:23:12,039 --> 01:23:17,140
smoking cannabis concentrates you can

2214
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:20,470
currently by a volcano vaporizer which

2215
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:22,270
is just the Walmart online though yeah

2216
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:24,039
it's at the Walmart online store but you

2217
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:26,260
can find a puff coke peak and a volcano

2218
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:28,750
vaporizer you can find an oil slick pad

2219
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:30,310
you can get dab tools there in the last

2220
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:31,930
time I saw them they were in the impulse

2221
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:33,100

2222
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:34,780

2235
01:24:01,239 --> 01:24:06,369
but like the generation that's just a

2236
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:09,100
year or two younger than that guy they

2237
01:24:06,369 --> 01:24:11,349
don't like it's no longer a brass ring

2238
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:13,030
for them to wear at all it's just not

2239
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:14,890
being the dumb that older people do I

2240
01:24:13,029 --> 01:24:16,389
feel Walmart maybe a little too

2241
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:17,860
connected they have their roots or too

2242
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:19,000
deep there are there may be a little

2243
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:20,979
religious or a little

2244
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:26,979
turkey or a little to goody-two-shoes to

2245
01:24:20,979 --> 01:24:27,729
actually go booth perfect that's my

2246
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:29,799
point

2247
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:31,839
they're not for the can they may be they

2248
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:34,779
may lose more business by selling

2249
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,460
cannabis yep but then how many people

2250
01:24:34,779 --> 01:24:37,659
are they going to lose if they say we

2251
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,680
support cannabis they're one of the

2252
01:24:37,659 --> 01:24:39,250
largest they don't need to change

2253
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,530
anything

2254
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:42,670
honestly the Walmarts face the just

2255
01:24:41,529 --> 01:24:44,139
because we're talking about Walmart this

2256
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:46,090
has come up a million times with Walmart

2257
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:48,640
and they just stare the world down and

2258
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:49,810
go [ __ ] you it's cheaper here like when

2259
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,280
do you remember one that everybody was

2260
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:53,020
fired up because Walmart puts all the

2261
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:55,960
mom-and-pop people out of business there

2262
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:57,850
yeah everybody cared for a while and

2263
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,260
then it was cheaper Walmart's yeah until

2264
01:24:57,850 --> 01:25:01,390
they didn't want to go to Target Best

2265
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,560
Buy King Soopers and Barnes &amp; Noble on

2266
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:04,750
one trip they went to Best Buy and

2267
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,160
everything there as long as you can

2268
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:07,300
avoid the people out front trying to get

2269
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:10,899
your signature for some random [ __ ]

2270
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:13,239
every week you're just fine I really

2271
01:25:10,899 --> 01:25:15,670
don't think we'll see Canada's sold at

2272
01:25:13,239 --> 01:25:17,559
Walmart or the gas station or anything

2273
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:19,239
like that for at least the next 15 20

2274
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,220
years and who wants to buy that go to a

2275
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:23,380
dispensary go to over to apothecary and

2276
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:26,860
get some good [ __ ] yeah now but I mean

2277
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:28,779
it's coming I mean I it's it's just like

2278
01:25:26,859 --> 01:25:30,279
alcohol they didn't have that in the

2279
01:25:28,779 --> 01:25:32,349
thirties they didn't have it in stores

2280
01:25:30,279 --> 01:25:35,079
and I get that there was already like a

2281
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:37,300
way to get it and we love bars and all

2282
01:25:35,079 --> 01:25:40,630
this stuff so when it finally becomes

2283
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:43,150
legal there will be maybe specialty

2284
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:45,640
shops like the smoke shops you know

2285
01:25:43,149 --> 01:25:47,289
maybe it'll be like liquor stores you

2286
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:50,619
know the same thing but they do sell

2287
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:53,170
liquor at like Sam's Club has we're

2288
01:25:50,619 --> 01:25:54,670
definitely headed to a place in not so

2289
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:58,779
distant future where you can get really

2290
01:25:54,670 --> 01:26:00,520
mediocre marijuana products it just a

2291
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:02,710
convenience store we're definitely

2292
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,390
headed that direction I think it's

2293
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:06,730
inevitable

2294
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:09,610
you can already buy CBD hemp flour at

2295
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:10,839
very many head shops so yeah and I see

2296
01:26:09,609 --> 01:26:13,689
it getting into Walmart because Walmart

2297
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:15,789
cares about their shareholders and as

2298
01:26:13,689 --> 01:26:16,839
soon as the shareholders see oh [ __ ]

2299
01:26:15,789 --> 01:26:19,510
we're gonna make all sorts of money

2300
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:22,150
that's I mean that's all it is it's just

2301
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:24,310
an organization that size it would just

2302
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:25,719
be a small side line item but like they

2303
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:27,340
carry all kinds of [ __ ] they only make a

2304
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:29,890
few percentage points on and it's all

2305
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:31,750
the search small percentages all those

2306
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:34,119
small percentages add up to a big

2307
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:36,039
do big percentage my last bullet point

2308
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:36,970
that I've got written down here just

2309
01:26:36,039 --> 01:26:40,539
part of what we were talking about

2310
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:42,610
earlier I feel like I can see a

2311
01:26:40,539 --> 01:26:44,350
difference in this town in our town of

2312
01:26:42,609 --> 01:26:46,479
Pueblo just in the few years that

2313
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:49,660
cannabis has been here we've got some of

2314
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:51,489
the world's if not some of the country's

2315
01:26:49,659 --> 01:26:53,500
largest if not the world's largest legal

2316
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:56,380
cannabis production indoor and outdoor

2317
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:58,539
here in Pueblo Colorado people like to

2318
01:26:56,380 --> 01:27:00,789
do the shits on people back to work that

2319
01:26:58,539 --> 01:27:03,399
yes and you can see it in our community

2320
01:27:00,789 --> 01:27:04,689
we have I used to complain about the

2321
01:27:03,399 --> 01:27:06,849
food I still complain about the food

2322
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:08,469
options we were getting more better

2323
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:10,090
restaurants here we're getting some good

2324
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:11,710
food options here and I think that a lot

2325
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:13,930
of the cannabis money is bringing that

2326
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:16,119
here more people are coming here with a

2327
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:19,119
more open mindset more money is coming

2328
01:27:16,119 --> 01:27:20,380
here more educated type of ideal is

2329
01:27:19,119 --> 01:27:22,390
coming here this used to be known as

2330
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:23,529
being kind of a steel mill town where

2331
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:27,340
you can come get your ass kicked and

2332
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:29,409
drink a lot of beer absolutely it was it

2333
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:32,860
was still very much a steel town but we

2334
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:34,269
hadn't had a thriving steel industry for

2335
01:27:32,859 --> 01:27:36,099
thirty years at that point right

2336
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:38,140
oh the me the steel mill is still where

2337
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:39,579
most of the people a lot of people have

2338
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:41,200
some roots that's why a lot of the

2339
01:27:39,579 --> 01:27:43,059
people are here is that steel mill and

2340
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:45,340
that steel mill branches out to several

2341
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,539
other companies and I think this guy

2342
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:49,270
right it's probably worked for several

2343
01:27:46,539 --> 01:27:51,250
of them yeah I've worked for a couple of

2344
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:54,370
places that worked for the steel mill

2345
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:57,039
itself and then I worked for the place

2346
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:58,539
that they were supplying right so yeah

2347
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:00,069
so that mill does a lot of stuff here

2348
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:01,720
it's still got this town kind of had

2349
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:03,609
that mentality its hard-working let's

2350
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:04,930
get your hands dirty 20 business of them

2351
01:28:03,609 --> 01:28:06,369
didn't go to the bar right after work

2352
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:07,720
and get shit-faced and then get in a

2353
01:28:06,369 --> 01:28:09,220
fight and then go right back to work

2354
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,550
tomorrow like nothing [ __ ] happened

2355
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:15,159
but I see that the cannabis is making

2356
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:16,510
its changing it it's a little gentler or

2357
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:17,949
getting a little more culture we've got

2358
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:19,570
an Art Walk now we're getting a little

2359
01:28:17,949 --> 01:28:21,279
where I see a lot of evolution and I

2360
01:28:19,569 --> 01:28:23,079
think a lot of the money a lot of the

2361
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:24,789
intellect is coming from this cannabis

2362
01:28:23,079 --> 01:28:26,649
evolution it's bringing a great mindset

2363
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:28,420
it's making people want to work together

2364
01:28:26,649 --> 01:28:30,129
people that would have never been in the

2365
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:32,590
same industry or working together now

2366
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:34,480
people like everybody wants to work in

2367
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:35,980
the cannabis industry so you got the guy

2368
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:37,419
in the Grateful Dead shirt next WI and

2369
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:38,769
the Tupac shirt next to the guy with the

2370
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:40,329
Juggalo shirt all hanging out in the

2371
01:28:38,770 --> 01:28:42,220
trim room I'll listen into the Joe Rogan

2372
01:28:40,329 --> 01:28:43,750
podcast I'll listen him to grow from

2373
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:45,610
your heart all having a good time

2374
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:47,350
I just I see a difference in this town

2375
01:28:45,609 --> 01:28:49,299
it's more peaceful we've got some money

2376
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:50,980
now we've got some food options the

2377
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:52,000
potholes aren't as bad I know that

2378
01:28:50,979 --> 01:28:56,019
sounds crazy but they're filling

2379
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:58,000
potholes in this Pueblo was smart we the

2380
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:00,880
people that were in charge of allocating

2381
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,090
that money knew that they couldn't fund

2382
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:06,460
long term repeat [ __ ] with it like you

2383
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:08,170
can't hire cops because you're gonna

2384
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:09,970
need cops this year next year in two

2385
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:12,670
years and five years down the road and

2386
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:14,289
anything that reoccurs like that you

2387
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:15,670
can't count on cannabis because you

2388
01:29:14,289 --> 01:29:17,949
never know if the next presence

2389
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:20,260
president is gonna go nuts and enforce a

2390
01:29:17,949 --> 01:29:21,699
closure or something which is why I like

2391
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:22,270
teachers aren't getting funded with this

2392
01:29:21,699 --> 01:29:25,569
[ __ ] either

2393
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:27,670
but knowing that they decided to fund

2394
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:29,649
improvement projects the people like you

2395
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:31,899
and me would actually care about so like

2396
01:29:29,649 --> 01:29:33,069
a couple of schools got sidewalks where

2397
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:34,989
they didn't have [ __ ] sidewalks

2398
01:29:33,069 --> 01:29:39,159
leading to the school a couple of kids

2399
01:29:34,989 --> 01:29:40,630
got scholarships from kids are a couple

2400
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:45,340
of thousand kids in Pueblo now have

2401
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:47,380
received $2,000 a year from our cannabis

2402
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:49,420
taxes so that they can go to college or

2403
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:51,010
to help pay for that college it's not

2404
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:56,770
like $2,000 is gonna cover all the

2405
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:58,600
tuition but it helps a lot looks it's

2406
01:29:56,770 --> 01:30:01,270
there's some weird restrictions on it

2407
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:03,400
but like if you kid and you wanna go to

2408
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:07,270
either the local community college or

2409
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:10,210
CSU P it's two grand no questions asked

2410
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:11,470
no GPA required it's just because you're

2411
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:13,300
a local person this money's available

2412
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:16,590
and I know a several students that have

2413
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:19,060
used that money to stay in school but

2414
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:21,520
these projects actually help beat the

2415
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:23,110
road repairs help the the little

2416
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,630
improvements around the community help

2417
01:30:23,109 --> 01:30:26,439
if you look at the list of projects like

2418
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:29,260
there were some golf

2419
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:30,759
improved golf area golf course

2420
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:32,380
improvements I don't know why we're

2421
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:34,720
course left my head for a minute cuz you

2422
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:36,489
don't ever go to it but yeah I never use

2423
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:38,020
that and so I was a Gladstone why are we

2424
01:30:36,489 --> 01:30:39,399
doing that and then I kind of looked at

2425
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:41,800
the demographics and I wanna coop

2426
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:43,989
Webelos got a pretty heavy older

2427
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,850
population and they all love that [ __ ]

2428
01:30:43,989 --> 01:30:48,250
the golf course is so always packed when

2429
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:50,140
it's warm yeah like by all means make

2430
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:51,039
that five percent better so that they're

2431
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:54,100
five percent happy

2432
01:30:51,039 --> 01:30:55,710
let's go ahead that shit's helping it

2433
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:57,329
all over Colorado

2434
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:59,219
we're getting better entertainment here

2435
01:30:57,329 --> 01:31:00,390
as well because of it I think we're

2436
01:30:59,219 --> 01:31:03,029
since we have a different demographic

2437
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:04,980
here a little more money brings a little

2438
01:31:03,029 --> 01:31:06,599
more different demographic which brings

2439
01:31:04,979 --> 01:31:07,979
more options for entertainment we could

2440
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,539
spend a couple more bucks on a better

2441
01:31:07,979 --> 01:31:11,250
band to come a better comedian to come

2442
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:14,039
and it's happening so I see a difference

2443
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:17,760
I usually hear people that bring up this

2444
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:20,100
specific thing in a negative way but I

2445
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:22,530
really like it like I grew up in

2446
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:24,870
Colorado and whenever we would travel

2447
01:31:22,529 --> 01:31:26,099
before legalization when say people

2448
01:31:24,869 --> 01:31:28,130
would say hey where're you from if you

2449
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:32,010
said Colorado they'd go oh do you ski

2450
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:35,130
yeah and I don't or do you because it

2451
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:36,800
hurt me a lot when I was little so I was

2452
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:39,000
never a fan and it was always like

2453
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,679
annoying that people would ask me if I

2454
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,738
did this thing that my state was known

2455
01:31:40,679 --> 01:31:45,929
for that I hated and I'm happy when

2456
01:31:43,738 --> 01:31:47,459
people like oh the legal we'd place and

2457
01:31:45,929 --> 01:31:49,890
I'm like yeah feel free to ask questions

2458
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:51,779
I'll tell y'all about it yeah but I know

2459
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:55,850
a number of people that are annoyed with

2460
01:31:51,779 --> 01:31:57,599
that change but I like it it's beautiful

2461
01:31:55,850 --> 01:31:58,469
Clayton you look like you got something

2462
