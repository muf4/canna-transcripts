at elevations the dispensary in Colorado

54
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:13,539
Springs on Razorback today I was at work

55
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:15,789
and I received a text message that there

56
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:18,068
was a secret drop of some lemon Jeffrey

57
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:19,989
high cannabinoid full-spectrum extract

58
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:24,878
and also some high terpene full-spectrum

59
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:26,129
extract zipped up there after work and I

60
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,500
bought

61
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,169
[ __ ] all of it shot it to my friends

62
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,340
at elevations for they didn't even put

63
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:34,709
it on the shelf they waited for me to

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,360
get there and I scooped it all up just a

65
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,790
moment ago I took a DAB

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,880
so I heated the banger quite hot and I

67
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:43,500
took a dab of THC a I dumped some THC a

68
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,719
crystals on there and then after that I

69
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,889
dumped way too much weight like I come

70
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,020
out dude and then I gave it like a

71
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:53,609
little nudge and it just just poured out

72
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,570
and I was like fook was the only thing

73
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,020
on my brain but I was like I'm gonna

74
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:59,939
smoke that with the terpenes I poured a

75
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,370
big fat dollop of Heitor fiend full

76
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,590
spectrum extract onto the nail then on a

77
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,110
dabber I had some high cannabinoid

78
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,120
full-spectrum extract also with some

79
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,310
ambrosia and all of it was made from

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,629
lemon jeffery except the THC a was made

81
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,680
from another stream but everything else

82
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:18,150
came from some lemon jeffery the rig

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,530
still smells like lemons you can just

84
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,319
pull through the rig and it tastes like

85
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,509
lemon candy without any hash on it I've

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,250
been talking about the high cannabinoid

87
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:28,199
and high terpene full-spectrum ACTRA

88
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,050
extract now that I've got some of this

89
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,509
high terpene full-spectrum extract in my

90
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,010
hand let's talk a little bit about this

91
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:37,979
let's describe this little vial of stuff

92
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:40,229
to people it's a half DRAM vials the

93
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,879
unit of measure this size would be if

94
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:49,139
you don't know what that is how tall is

95
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:50,879
that mic without the lid it's half to

96
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:54,299
three quarters of an inch tall and the

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,319
lid is almost a third of the size of the

98
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,860
whole bottle and it holds a gram of

99
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:03,930
terpene high terpene full cannabinoid

100
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,610
full this is hard to say hi to repeat

101
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,219
full spectrum extracts in this one

102
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,620
container I was very well reasonably

103
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:14,099
priced does it look like really runny

104
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,370
honey possibly yeah or maybe thick

105
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,930
vegetable oil or thin vegetable oil

106
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,759
runny honey is a good description that

107
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,610
hits the color right on the mark and

108
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,670
it's way too runny for for actual honey

109
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,910
but it's got a light motor oil it's like

110
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,590
some 5w30 but real nice and clear it was

111
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,070
funny watching you try to dab it in

112
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:33,750
motion

113
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,728
well I poured it out of that container

114
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,978
into a banger a quartz banger and it put

115
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:41,050
in there and when I when the dad here

116
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,338
this is lacrosse yeah yeah there's a lot

117
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,408
of heat and a lot of liquid happening

118
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:45,218
but when the dad when it hit that it

119
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:47,680
fell

120
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:49,598
I think effervescent is the word my face

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,999
was filled with the flavors of lemon

122
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:53,978
Jeffrey there was I reached the maximum

123
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:55,449
of flavor that your face can take my

124
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:58,288
face was like that's such a good flavor

125
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:01,538
and then we go thats way too much of it

126
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:03,158
yeah I've seen you take huge dabs before

127
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:05,408
and you don't usually find them like

128
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:07,149
that yeah I had to keep I wanted to

129
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:08,680
finish the dad but I had to keep forcing

130
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:10,929
my lungs to like inhale that and they

131
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,759
were like but dude like it's like if you

132
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,199
put vapor rub on the tip of your nose

133
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,120
and then tried to take a DAB you're like

134
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,740
I'm having a hard time my lungs don't

135
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,288
want to breathe that in real heavily

136
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,848
right it was a great dad then I gave

137
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:23,228
Mike a similar dab I didn't put as many

138
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:27,519
things on there because I don't want to

139
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:29,680
kill Mike we're shooting for a tighter

140
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,149
more succeed show tonight so not getting

141
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,918
super baked was part of the goal

142
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:34,209
hopefully there aren't as many rambles

143
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,370
hopefully there's a little we're already

144
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,978
off to a rambly start yeah had to

145
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,499
explain these dads these dad's work is

146
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:46,508
so much fun folks we're so spoiled here

147

00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,110
and 15 there are rules that you have to

165
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:21,579
be inside the dispensary by a certain

166
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,080
time you have to be rung up by a certain

167
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:25,478
time I look like an [ __ ] because I

168
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,709
was pushing the [ __ ] lights like if I

169
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:28,240
didn't know what I want already they

170
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:30,338
might have been mad at me for going in

171
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,930
there at that last very second right

172
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:34,329
they've got to be closed all the way up

173
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,158
by what seven yes they have you last

174
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:38,918
person's got to be out the door locked

175
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:42,038
up by 6:55 writings if you're not in the

176
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:44,109
building by 6:20 you're a dick six 30s

177
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,250
yeah it was 632 ish when I was getting

178
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,810
out of the car and I got off work at

179
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,189
5:00 and just zipped up there so it took

180
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,110
me all that time to get there I didn't

181
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:53,530
stop for gas at in pee and everything

182
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:56,319
needed a couple of times

183
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:58,569
yeah good dab is working it made me

184
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,310
sweaty it made me made me very euphoric

185
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:03,819
Lehigh and it made me chatting still

186
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,350
taste it it's like lemon starburst like

187
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:07,149
I ate a whole bunch of lemon starburst

188
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,040
earlier and I've just got that wonderful

189
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:10,479
little after flavor you know the the

190
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,710
side of the lemon meringue pie where

191
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,000
it's a little more whipped cream and a

192
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:14,439
little less lemon that's kind of the

193
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,339
flavor they left in my mouth I think

194
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,040
nice

195
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:20,139
yeah lemon meringue dabs um I couldn't

196
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,090
have gotten my hash today if I did not

197
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,709
get my medical marijuana card renewed

198
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,689
yesterday now my card hasn't expired yet

199
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,310
but everybody in Colorado has been

200
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,110
trained to be very proactive on getting

201
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,230
their cards renewed because in the past

202
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,520
it has taken [ __ ] 10 to 12 weeks to

203
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,200
get your card when you send in the

204
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,979
paperwork it takes 12 weeks to get your

205
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,599
card back the CD Phe the the State

206
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,790
Department that sends them out just got

207
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,310
hammered in the press like a month and a

208
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,260
half two months ago because they were

209
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,360
backed up again and so I'm glad to see

210
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,500
that that backlog is gone yes they're

211
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,879
catching up I think they're about two

212
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,490
weeks behind right now but that's not

213
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,060
too far the problem the problem in that

214
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,590
is so let's say not everybody has a lot

215
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,000
of extra money you're running out of

216
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:02,529
funds you can't go to the Medical

217
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,089
Marijuana doc that's probably the bottom

218
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:05,859
of several people's lists you got lights

219
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:07,689
you got the [ __ ] car payment you got

220
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,370
the rent you got whatever food you're

221
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:10,779
gonna eat this week maybe somewhere on

222
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,949
there's the weed doctor at the end of

223
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,779
the month there's a lot of telling

224
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:22,750
information in the order of those items

225
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:24,729
folks lights blah

226
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,009
sometimes the lights are more expensive

227
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:29,259
than the rent in some instances I was

228
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:31,899
that usually people list stuff in order

229
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,490
of personal importance let's just crack

230
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:36,459
it we you're like man I can have lights

231
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:40,990
outside I don't need red alright we got

232
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:43,030
sidetracked already but soaps if you get

233
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,909
your medical marijuana card renewed at

234
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,889
the time that it expires there's going

235
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:49,539
to be a long time waiting before your

236
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,879
replacement card comes in and you're not

237
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:54,579
allowed to renew your card 30 days

238
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,080
before it expires so if it takes 32 days

239
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,550
for that card to come in your two days

240
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,660
without your medical marijuana card

241
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:00,939
which means if you're growing an

242
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:02,350
elevated count or an increased count

243
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,480
which your doctor can give you if they

244
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,070
do choose to do so

245
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,810
based on your condition you are now

246
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,639
illegal for a few days until your card

247
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:10,379
comes you cannot shop in a dispensary if

248
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,629
you need medicine until that card comes

249
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,820
it [ __ ] a lot of things up and it was

250
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:17,250
uncool it was just shitty it wasn't

251
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,899
working it was on it wasn't organized it

252
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,730
wasn't right there was a period of time

253
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,009
where it was on the backlog was almost a

254
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,740
year yeah which in practice meant you

255
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:27,569
got a free weed card for a year but at

256
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,149
that time you were allowed to use the

257
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,670
temporary pizza shop they had they had

258
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:34,440
to have different rules then now you

259
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:35,969
can't shop with temporary paperwork now

260
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,709
they're like bringing a purple card or

261
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,820
get the [ __ ] out well the the new

262
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:43,319
restrictions on when you can renew in

263
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,260
where like when you can shop if you

264
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,629
don't have your active card with you our

265
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,819
part of the reason that the CD phe took

266
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:52,500
heat in the press because because lots

267
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,720
of people need these cards to buy their

268
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,639
medicine and if the backlog is longer

269
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,160
than the allowed period to do it you're

270
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,720
screwing people badly absolutely and

271
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,069
people would come into the dispensary

272
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,449
when I was with green and healthy I

273
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,649
would take deliveries or I'd be there

274
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:05,669
shopping and people would come in with

275
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:08,159
their paperwork like hey I've been

276
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:09,778
waiting can I shop and the bud tenders

277
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,159
would have to say sorry he can't come in

278
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:12,958
here they don't have to turn them away

279
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,448
and that looks like [ __ ] they don't come

280
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,698
back even though it's the state's rule

281
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:20,219
and a rule that the dispensaries have to

282
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:21,539
follow to stay in business it pisses off

283
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,860
the consumer because they don't have

284
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,519
their medicine and they have to blame it

285
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,169
on somebody

286
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,399
and so they blame that dispensary that

287
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:27,899
won't let them shop there and they don't

288
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,879
come back you lose their business

289
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,190
because of their paperwork yep

290
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,528
so the good thing there is a positive

291
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,389
now I went to the medical marijuana

292
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:39,088
doctor yesterday my appointment was at

293
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,620
1:20 it's the weed doc so around 3

294
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,690
o'clock I finally saw the [ __ ] doctor

295
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,039
that's the bad that's the worst part

296
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,690
about going to the weed doctor is he

297
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,669
make an appointment for I made my

298
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,709
appointment for one they sent me my

299
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:52,259
reminder saying that it was at 120 I

300
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:54,659
showed up at 115 and at about 3 o'clock

301
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,360
I finally saw the doc yeah the

302
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:58,769
appointment took honestly 5 or 10

303
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,449
minutes because I've seen this guy 10

304
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:02,100
times we have a relationship wheeze a

305
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:05,250
bonafide we've got a bona fide

306
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,290
relationship he's like yeah yeah

307
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,600
basically the paperwork is way different

308
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:12,120
now there are way more specific

309
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,759
questions they ask how much cannabis you

310
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,649
use what type you use how you grow it

311
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,950
how much you yield per plant how many

312
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,450
hard

313
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,490
so you get per year.if that's gonna be

314
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,750
turned into edibles or concentrates how

315
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,820
many inch of how much of that you're

316
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,129
gonna use per day per hour they ask a

317
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,379
lot of [ __ ] and then also there is a

318
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:30,480
caregiver registry that you cannot

319
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:32,159
become a caregiver now on somebody's

320
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,050
paperwork unless you have a caregiver

321
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,149
registry number so if you're a caregiver

322
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:39,179
in Colorado you got to get your ass on

323
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,559
the caregiver registry that's easy just

324
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,449

328
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:52,019
pop make it really easy to find so I did

329
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:53,519
the basic paperwork and the lady behind

330
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,439
the counter goes he got enough of that I

331
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,819
can finish that out for you and because

332
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,350
it's all just a cut and paste she typed

333
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,970
it into the computer from there and then

334
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,100
filled out all the rest of the forms for

335
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,870
me just by cutting and pasting and then

336
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,340
I pulled out my phone and went to a

337
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,830
website that she gave me

338
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:10,080
I created a username I got an email I

339
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:13,379
logged in through my email on my phone I

340
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,930
created a template there was a draft

341
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:18,750
I saw the doc he approved all my stuff I

342
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:20,729
took my stamped paperwork to a desk with

343
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,779
the lady who took my credit card and ran

344
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,519
it through the Department of Public

345
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,559
Health and public and Health and

346
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,909
Environment website charged me 16

347
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,309
dollars and ten cents for the card

348
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:31,799
swiping to the state I paid the doc a

349
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:34,409
fee to get my doc visit plus my plant

350
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,269
count and then she turned in all my

351
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:38,519
paperwork by clicking a button on the

352
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:40,319
thing and then today one o'clock I got

353
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,730
an email saying thank you your new card

354
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
is activated so I've got a brand new

355
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,659
medical marijuana card two days it took

356
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,729
less than 24-hours to have my card

357
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:50,459
renewed and activated that's impressive

358
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,139
yeah I can print it off if I need to but

359
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,750
some dispensaries will take it right off

360
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,759
of my phone they say they should not but

361
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,350
some places will take it right off of my

362
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,730
phone I should print that out but my old

363
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,889
one doesn't expire for a month still

364
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,659
I've got three weeks right you were on

365
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:05,100
when I met the office one day at work

366
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,449
and I think about it I'm just gonna

367
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,879
print that [ __ ] out then I've got my new

368
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,040
card yeah I I made sure that I've got a

369
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,129
reminder setting my phone for a month

370
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,599
before my explains well the the reason

371
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:17,759
you need a month reminder now is because

372
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,290
the docs are so busy yep it takes a

373
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,419
month just to get into them Medical

374
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:23,699
Marijuana docum

375
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,199
are trying to receive an extended plant

376
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,210
count or any sort of special treatment

377
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,160
or anything like that a lot of people

378
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,960
ask just because I'm I got asked this

379
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:32,719
question today

380
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,089
I've got a friend with a child who is

381
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,370
under the age of 18 and is experiencing

382
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:39,890
some conditions and symptoms that would

383
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,889
be very easily treated by the use of

384
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:44,480
medical cannabis and I feel that it's

385
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:46,129
the way to go and they were like we're

386
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,629
ready to do it how do we do this they've

387
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,820
been apprehensive for a while because of

388
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,799
the law but with a card there's no

389
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,600
reason not to do it if you were under

390
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,549
the age of 18 you need to be seen by two

391
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,720
doctors to get your medical marijuana

392
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:59,659
card so you're gonna have to pay two

393
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,910
Doc's and I don't know of many places

394
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:03,829
that do two Doc's at one time the place

395
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:07,189
I go only has one doc on site there are

396
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,600
places send me an email if you really

397
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,580
need the info and I'll help you out but

398
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,330
I'm not gonna give any companies a shout

399
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:17,600
out on the show like that right now I

400
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:20,149
think the younger the patient the more

401
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,629
stringent it is if you for the the

402
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:27,320
really young kids coming to Colorado

403
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:29,000
it's got to be to specialists which can

404
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,709
be incredibly difficult for a lot of

405
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,958
people there are two people that two

406
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,489
places that I think may do it I just

407
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,259
want to make sure so I'm gonna research

408
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,149
that after the show I'll contact them

409
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:40,549
tomorrow or something it's not too hard

410
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,439
to just call them to local cable

411
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:45,169
information we have ones in Springs ones

412
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,760
in Pueblo just ask them if they've got

413
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,929
two Doc's on-site should I just say the

414
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,069
names dude I don't want to advertise but

415
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,569
it's helping people [ __ ] it I'm gonna

416
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,770
say I'm gonna say just to help people I

417
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,839
don't care these people aren't paying me

418
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:55,789
you can check out relaxed clarity and

419
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,580
Pueblo they may have two doctors on-site

420
00:14:55,789 --> 00:15:00,829
in a place called Medi Val in Colorado

421
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,240
Springs often has two docs on-site I

422
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,620
don't get paid for that I just want to

423
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,879
help you guys out if you need [ __ ] if

424
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,320
trying to get a kid a medical marijuana

425
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,000
card there's no reason to [ __ ] hold

426
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,650
anything back I'll share that info

427
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,958
that's that's worth the [ __ ] one kid

428
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:12,679
getting their card right one little kid

429
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,419
not having a seizure

430
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,099
it's worth that [ __ ] free shout-out to

431
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:18,169
those places Tom Ross - Jeff sent you

432
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,209
maybe they'll [ __ ] do something if

433
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:22,578
not whatever but getting your card is

434
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:25,189
it's the process with the doc is just as

435
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:26,989
hard extended plant counts are harder if

436
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,339
you're relying on going to the doc for

437
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,259
an extended plant count you don't have a

438
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:31,820
bona fide relationship with your medical

439
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,860
marijuana doctor or you're not getting

440
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,690
your medical marijuana card from your

441
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,310
regular physician which is always an

442
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,690
option if you have the balls to ask them

443
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:40,429
and you don't want to lose your patient

444
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,350
doctor relationship with some people

445
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:44,569
because some doctor will drop you

446
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,250
just for admitting that you use cannabis

447
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,280
or the idea so make sure you have a good

448
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,809
doc first but if you want to ascend a

449
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,069
plank out you need paperwork you have to

450
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:55,129
have some sort of proof that you've got

451
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,900
some sort of condition that the use of

452
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:59,149
medical cannabis would improve the

453
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:01,819
quality of your life that's got to fall

454
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,919
in the list of qualifying conditions so

455
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,320
but once you get that part done getting

456
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,120
it taken care of like registering with

457
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,650
the state and [ __ ] if you know how to

458
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,330
point and click on a Facebook page you

459
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:13,730
can register it and get your card done

460
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,129
I'm thrilled this streamlined it it

461
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:20,840
takes first couple processes we're I

462
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:22,639
mean it was so painfully slow I remember

463
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,149
the first time I waited in line in the

464
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,679
snow outside of a building in Denver it

465
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:29,029
took me about three hours to get there

466
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,500
because I drove in the snow and then we

467
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,809
waited outside of the building for about

468
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,549
another three hours saw the doc for

469
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:36,379
seriously seven seconds he goes what's

470
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:38,179
your claim to fame was what he asked he

471
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:40,009
doesn't say what ails you what hurts you

472
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,539
does what's your claim to fame and I

473
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:44,210
said man my knees are [ __ ] and he goes

474
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:46,009
sit down and he put a hand under my left

475
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,019
thigh and he said may I touch you and I

476
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:49,340
said yeah doc he put his hand under my

477
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,289
left thigh and he goes move your leg up

478
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,240
and I moved my leg up oh that's terrible

479
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:54,769
and he just went to writing that was my

480
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,690
first medical marijuana doctor

481
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:58,129
experience hears like yes is your money

482
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,960
green yes sir my money's green

483
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,720
I will take your money here is your card

484
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,190
and he handed me my paperwork and he

485
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,809

515
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,069
application [ __ ] yeah and then you've

516
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:06,769
got to wait 2 3 months for them to open

517
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:08,480
it the two months for them to process it

518
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:10,190

finally and then those cards the ink

523
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,700
wore off of them so a lot of people were

524
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:20,389
just carrying around red cards but I

525
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,980
have a card

526
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,480
the first batch was [ __ ] flimsy is

527
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,190
how they used to be like a hundred and

528
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,710
twenty dollars a pop yes the original

529
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,240
price now this the purple card that you

530
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,850
got from the state for the past few

531
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,309
years it's purple and it's real thin and

532
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:36,079
shitty plastic and the numbers just wipe

533
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,909
right off if you get it warm into your

534
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,059
hand is sweaty and you'll just take the

535
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:42,410
numbers right off I I've been to two

536
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:44,839
different shops that give you a

537
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,700
protective sleeve yeah how made and

538
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:49,129
yours is unprotected cuz they know it's

539
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,500
gonna be toast in weeks and the numbers

540
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,090
just stick to that in good shops know

541
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,640
that like if their customers card dies

542
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:58,009
they can't let them in and out anymore

543
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,600
right it's so yeah it's just protecting

544
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:01,640
your ability to shop they give you a

545
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,009
free sleeve I keep my medical marijuana

546
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,630
card mostly to shop at three specific

547
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:10,789
stores like mostly one or two stores but

548
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,400
sometimes it's two or three I like to be

549
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:15,529
able to stop and shop anywhere I'm at in

550
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,110
Colorado and that helps a lot it is

551
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:22,339
completely helped the protections it

552
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:25,429
provides I still really not rely on but

553
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:27,500

567
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,799
don't know that he believed it would

568
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,450
happen in his lifetime that was the fun

569
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,129
conversation I had all the time when I

570
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,740
was working a sales counter in a

571
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,010
dispensary was people that were my

572
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,480
parents age that were just blown away

573
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:07,450
that the thing that we're talking about

574
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,190
is teenagers finally really happened I'm

575
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,470
and they got to enjoy it before they

576
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,120
died these kids get to smoke weed and we

577
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,569
didn't even get to do it like it's

578
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,829
totally legal now who'd a thunk it I

579
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:19,899
knew it was coming I saw it

580
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:21,519
alright let's move forward a little bit

581
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,780

582
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,549

583
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:26,889
gotten really to a topic we love you

584
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:29,500
good man I feel bad for the recreational

585
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,940
shoppers because the recreational

586
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,470
dispensaries are kind of tourist traps

587
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,090
I've gone in there they're set up

588
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,410
completely different than medical shops

589
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:37,359
their price points are different it's

590
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:42,190
all geared differently everything's gear

591
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:43,509
different system yeah if you're if

592
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,250
you're a Colorado resident just go get

593
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:47,349

594

what they do

621
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:39,819

sent me the email about breeding that

623
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:42,879
we're getting away from breeding like

624
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,100
hardy plants and we're making a bunch of

625
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,960

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,519
also I owe a huge shout out to I'm not

631
00:21:56,259 --> 00:21:58,750
sure if I'm supposed to say your name

632
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,579
the reason I don't do that is because

633
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,599
maybe your wife listens to the show and

634
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:02,889
you're not supposed to be throwing money

635
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,689
around I don't know I try to respect

636
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,100
people's privacy but somebody

637
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,230
contributed to the patreon account

638
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:09,699
recently and they also sent me an email

639
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,640
and they said hey I would rather send

640
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,799
you a lump sum instead of just doing a

641
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,280
monthly payment on patreon I don't have

642
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,829
a method of doing that right now

643
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:21,079
but if that's what I got to do I'm not

644
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:22,369
going to deny myself of funding and I'm

645
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,619
not gonna leave money on the table so I

646
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:26,599
may create an account to make that an

647
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:28,099
option because if people want to throw

648
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,199
money at you you find a way to catch it

649
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:32,990
right would it be possible to just set

650
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,670
up a larger donation on patreon set it

651
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,710
up for monthly and then just cancel it

652
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,630
after one payment you probably could but

653
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,460
if I just went in like that seems kind

654
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,140
of complicated this they mentioned that

655
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,090
I should have a venmo and they're not

656
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,680
the first person to say that so I should

657
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,939
just go set up a demo account anyway and

658
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,310
then make a girl from your heart a

659
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,930
podcast of n mo page and then people

660
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:52,909
could help us out that way also don't

661
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,769
man I should also do one of those Amazon

662
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:59,600
links an affiliate link on Amazon but ah

663
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:01,730
um I'm busy I'm sitting here smoking

664
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,589
[ __ ] lemon Terps all day you've

665
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,539

accounts to manage right and I have a

667
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:10,220
full-time job everybody

668

669
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,700
large garden that's a small garden in

670
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,610
Three Rivers organics I don't want to

671
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,470
out you too much but it for a minute in

672
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:20,659
the recent past it was raining in the

673
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,640
exact space where we record no I talked

674
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,769
about on that pot on the podcast that on

675
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,450
the show yeah this this exact spot where

676
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:28,369
the MacBook is sitting is where the

677
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,559
puddle of water accumulated on this

678
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:31,879
table and yeah so every time I get

679
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,279
everyone Mike leaves and we get done

680
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:38,510
recording the the iPad will get peeled

681
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:40,430
off the table taken to another area all

682
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:42,140
this gear gets put away towards in a

683
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,670
waterproof safe place because I don't

684
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,500
trust this roof right now until I get it

685
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,120
fully repaired its patched and it's cool

686
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,369
for a minute but you got lucky none of

687
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,589
the gear got too toasted but all this

688
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:54,549
travel and rearranging and repacking and

689
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:57,559
restoring is gonna add to the way it's

690
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:58,819
been a [ __ ] and I say peel the iPad off

691
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:05,289
the table you guys because it's got so

692
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:05,289
much probably stick it to the wall as

693
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,779
much glass around and it's an iPad but

694
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:13,039
watch I want to try to move it off over

695
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:14,450
the table and see if it makes a noise

696
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:24,769
I'm gonna move the mic a little bit

697
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:26,539
toward it I think you guys probably

698
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:27,950
heard that that was serious sounded like

699
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:30,200
that snap was coming through my

700
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,830
headphones - that was the hash sticking

701
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,740
my iPad

702
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:35,569
to the table so yeah that's my life you

703
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,298
guys where the heck are we we're

704
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:39,740
thanking patreon contributors on

705
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:41,690
possibly making a venmo I think that's

706
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,609
where we were thank you that's

707
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,100
contributed it's so nice to have a clean

708
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,979
microphone cover to just you notice that

709
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:51,619
these are from China they came from from

710
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,960
Amazon and they smell like new shoes and

711
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:56,209
weirdness I remember like episode 12

712
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,679
where the first microphone covers were

713
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,960
really starting to smell like the locker

714
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,278
room and I was so happy when we started

715
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,409
rotating those out every now and again

716
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,509
but patreon contributors they're helping

717

more messages so I want to talk about

776
00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:00,038
when you're transplanting let's say

777
00:26:56,259 --> 00:27:01,778
you're taking a clone from aa if the

778
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:03,908
large grow where I work we run clones

779
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:07,058
and clone domes we put rapid rooters in

780
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:09,970
a tray we cut a clone into their dip it

781
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:12,190
in what's the purple [ __ ] clone ax then

782
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,690
stick it into the plug and then we put

783
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,570
the dome over it for like four days five

784
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,580
days and don't even [ __ ] touch it

785
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:20,528
then we water them lightly as needed

786
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:21,699
then we start I don't want to go over

787
00:27:20,528 --> 00:27:23,440
the whole clone thing that wasn't the

788
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,210
idea here well then we get roots

789
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,710
eventually we're gonna fast forward to

790
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,710
having reverse board two clones with

791
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,509
just enough to uh man it works

792
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,370
I have transplanted clones and plugs

793
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:38,798
with just one spaghetti coming out one

794
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:40,359
noodle yep one white healthy noodle but

795
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:41,619
if you got like four or five decent

796
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,119
noodles coming out you're ready to go

797
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:45,009
you can let them go a little longer if

798
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,898
you wanted to get like a little bit of

799
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:48,879
eggs a little more than that personally

800
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:51,129
but not like to put them into a bigger

801
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,409
pot and I liked it this is why I like to

802
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,990
do it because at that point I will get

803
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:58,149
some sort of root inoculate a powder

804
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,429
maybe something like great white shark

805
00:27:58,148 --> 00:28:02,829
something like a zoe's there's cheap

806
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,240
stuff there are like store-brand

807
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:05,678
products that you can buy that are

808
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,740
probably the same thing

809
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,450
there's mykos there's plus life if

810
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,940
you're gonna use plus life go light that

811
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,288
[ __ ] strong from vegetable ooh read your

812
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,940
labels and know what you use there's

813
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:17,859
Forge but I believe Forge will be

814
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,450
discontinued we've got about twelve bags

815
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:21,908
of forage left at the big grow and we're

816
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,649
using them sparingly but what I like to

817
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:25,539
do with these powdered root inoculants

818
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:27,339
when you take your clones out of the

819
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:29,349
clone dome and you're putting them into

820
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:31,028
soil so you get your pot and I like to

821
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:32,769
use a six inch net pot or something

822
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:34,058
maybe a small 1 gallon pot to put my

823
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:35,889
clones into so that you don't have to

824
00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:36,460
overwater too much dirt for a small

825
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,350
plant

826
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,360
save yourself some space save some water

827
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:42,009
let that [ __ ] get rooted in there and

828
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,750
get kind of kind of tight in there

829
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:46,569
before you up pot it but anyway before

830
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,880
it goes in there put in your dirt get it

831
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:49,569
packed in semi-tight finger it a little

832
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,280
bit to make a hole

833
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:53,619
for the clone and then I take that

834
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,660
rooting powder and just sprinkle it all

835
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:56,949
over the roots just rotate the clone a

836
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,810
little bit in your hands and just

837
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,430
sprinkle that powderized us yeah I just

838
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,049
dust them real good and then put that

839
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,580
clone in there and cover it up just like

840
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,529
normal and then when you get them all

841
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:07,750
done water it like normal like you would

842
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:10,089
put some fulvic acid in there maybe some

843
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,099
kelp extract of some sort a little bit

844
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:13,240
of nitrogen if you got any other if you

845
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:14,829
want to put some plus life or whatever

846
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,930
you used back in the water and do it

847
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:18,699
again go for it but I really think it's

848
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,380
helpful to inoculate the roots at the

849
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,120
beginning also when you're gonna

850
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,250
transplant from that small pot to a

851
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:27,039
bigger pot do it all over again fill

852
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,650
your pot put your fist in process just a

853
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,359
bigger yep you see those roots on the

854
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,460
outside and don't transplant until you

855
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,959
see roots on the outside of the smaller

856
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,370
pot when you see them gathering up out

857
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,100
there that's when it's time to go you

858
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:40,329
want it almost pushing to be like oh

859
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:41,469
it's been in there too long because

860
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:43,299
that's when you put it in the next pot

861
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,329
it's gonna explode it's gonna do oh it's

862
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:48,069
time just don't wait too long

863
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:49,779
right because you'll piss it off if you

864
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:52,089
wait too long but right when he gets

865
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:53,889
tight they take it out and just turn it

866
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:56,139
in a circle and just sprinkle root

867
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,360
powder whatever you're using those mykos

868
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,130
great white shark plus life Forge

869
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,269
there's a ton of them you guys I bet

870
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,220
there's a ton that I don't even [ __ ]

871
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:05,589
know about just sprinkle it right on

872
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,360
there and then pot it just like normal

873
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:08,799
and then feed it with healthy nutrients

874
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,229
put it under a good light put a fan on

875
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,789
it let it get some airflow get a healthy

876
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,430
I think a little dusting of the roots

877
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:17,230
would really improve your grow that's

878
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,539
one small affordable way just got to go

879
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,740
buy and wear a mask you guys just get

880
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:23,440
one if nothing else get one of those

881
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,779
cheap eye definer masks the [ __ ]

882
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,920
Asian bird flu mask dust the roots it's

883
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:28,240
[ __ ] good for your roots and good for

884
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,090
your plants and they will appreciate it

885
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,620
and then feed them stuff like plus life

886
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:35,409
throughout their veg phase in their

887
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:39,939
early flower phase happy roots will help

888
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:41,710
you out we teased Chris's email were 30

889
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:45,130
minutes in let's give him at least one

890
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:46,870
email and then we'll see how much time

891
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,760
we've got maybe we'll read his other two

892
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:50,259
or well maybe we'll just save time for

893
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:54,190
other listeners to get emails in the

894
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:57,309
show alright Chris I'm gonna pick on you

895
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:58,750
till the end of time alright Chris sent

896
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:00,279
me an email and it goes like this I

897
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,509
don't know if we should have been seeing

898
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:02,889
his [ __ ] name the whole time since

899
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:04,779
not what he signed it

900
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,540
maybe I'll just go put a bleep over it

901
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:09,819
I'm gonna have to do 37 bleep snow

902
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:11,409
because we said his name that's cool 30

903
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:16,389
minutes in my can edit the [ __ ] out of

904
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:18,190
this sorry dude it's not the name I said

905
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,290
I was saying his fake name the whole

906
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,700
time the email goes like this hey Ross -

907
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:23,200
Jeff I'm hitting you with a few

908
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,519
questions in a row tonight I was hoping

909
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,170
you could talk about your methods for

910
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,539
taking down a plant to keep those Terps

911
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:31,360
loud do you do a dark cycle pre-chopped

912
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:33,369
dry trim or wet trim we would love to

913
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,808
hear how you do it big fan of the show

914
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:36,399
I've been a listener for about a year

915
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:40,418
and a half now you definitely make my

916
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:43,210
mind-numbing 50-plus hour work week plus

917
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:45,040
hour a week day job a lot better sorry

918
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,390
that was hard to read big thanks for

919
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,460
putting out a quality podcast and

920
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:51,160
helping people learn something and have

921
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:54,400
a laugh while listening much thanks

922
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,500
sincerely so his question was can we

923
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,500
give him any tips on keeping the Terps

924
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,929
loud at harvest time let me start by

925
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:06,308
saying most definitely can yes I've got

926
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:08,679
tips all day the first tip is a little

927
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:11,109
advice that light destroys terpenoids

928
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:12,700
quickly so dark is always good for your

929
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:16,359
Terps keep the lights a little bit away

930
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:18,250
I loved that part of the question yes we

931
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:23,229
did the question was do you do a light

932
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:25,750
sigh a dark cycle before you harvest so

933
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,700
yes if you were going just for loud

934
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:30,730
Terps yes that will help you out it will

935
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,990
also in my opinion add to density don't

936
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,279
put them in the dark cycle when they're

937
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:36,370
super wet if you're gonna put them in

938
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,329
the dark let them get not dry but don't

939
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:39,939
put them in there when they're soggy

940
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:40,389
because dark and soggy is never a good

941
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,548
thing

942
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,870
that will could lead to problems I'll

943
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:47,019
let them get a little bit dry before you

944
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:48,519
put them in the dark yes white does like

945
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:50,650
I said light does kind of kill the Terps

946
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:52,240
so they are producing more trips the

947
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,350
Terps are getting louder like you asked

948
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,450
they're getting richer and stronger

949
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:57,279
they're developing more in the dark face

950
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:59,230
so if you do cut them down in a dark

951
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,690
phase there will be more true pains

952
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,429
present in your trichomes in your plants

953
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,919
and your flowers and your concentrates

954
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:07,390
so a dark phase is always good I like to

955
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,009
get it a little bit cold toward the end

956
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,480
that makes them dense up a little bit

957
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:13,179
also make some purple I think it kind of

958
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,529
makes them panic make sure you flush I

959
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:15,290
think you say something about that in

960
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,769
another email

961
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:21,619
so also the less you touch those plants

962
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:24,079
the better cut them down you ask wet or

963
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:26,179
dry trim I prefer a dry trim cut him

964
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:28,909
down hang him upside down touch him very

965
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:31,970
little okay let me back up a step

966
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,650
flush cut off all the family flush is so

967
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,850
important he's got another email about

968
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,240
that so we're just gonna do that one

969
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:37,279
next

970
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,960
but flush cut off all the families when

971
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,819
they start getting close to the harvest

972
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,200
time then put them in the dark without

973
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:47,210
those big fan leaves on there to let

974
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,549
them sit for 24 to 48 hours in the dark

975
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:52,220
cut them down hang them upside down

976
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:53,720
until the stems begin to pop and from

977
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,309
there you have to listen to the dry and

978
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,500
cure episodes because now you're drying

979
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:59,480
and curing more than harvesting but

980
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,160
that's where you get it that's where it

981
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,410
starts then you have to let it dry until

982
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,900
the sticks pop then you cut the buds off

983
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:08,450
of the sticks into a container and seal

984
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,490
that container and burp it appropriately

985
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:12,888
until the moisture is gone I like to

986
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:14,928
make it go really slowly if possible and

987
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,849
Colorado weed dries really quickly it's

988
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:18,889
hard to go slow here you're trying to

989
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:20,148
get chlorophyll out and keep terpenoids

990
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:22,010
in so you want to keep the right

991
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:23,989
temperatures and you want to keep light

992
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:27,470
away from it try to keep it semi cool

993
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:29,479
around 72 degrees 74 degrees is probably

994
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:31,638
right around where you want it maybe 77

995
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,710
don't go too high heat destroys chirps

996
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,628
light destroys terms so dry and cured it

997
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,960
properly handle it properly don't touch

998
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:38,418
it

999
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,590
plastic will start causing problems if

1000
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:42,619
you can keep it in glass containers

1001
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,960
that's recommended um what else can we

1002
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:47,509
recommend you dry trimming never use a

1003
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,220
trim machine I'm gonna get off on a side

1004
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,750
rant I [ __ ] hate trim machines the

1005
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,398
cannabis industry hates trim machines

1006
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,159
the only people that like trim machines

1007
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,259
are greedy growers and grow facility

1008
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,390
owners that want to make a lot of money

1009
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,950
trim machines mangle buds in my opinion

1010
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:03,559
this is all my opinion I could be [ __ ]

1011
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:06,259
alive but I yet to see one that does

1012
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,969
what it's supposed to without a serious

1013
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,860
detriment to the final product and

1014
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:12,529
another thing that a trim machine will

1015
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,490
never do I had a trimmer today find

1016
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,590
issues and buds

1017
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:17,119
if those buds got pulled aside they will

1018
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,800
never make it to the public that whole

1019
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,690
plant got Rhian spected because there

1020
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,240
was one small issue in one small area

1021
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:25,130
that part got Secor segregated and

1022
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,588
countered his waste and destroyed the

1023
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,539
rest of the plant was okay

1024
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:30,909
Dean I would smoke it I would smoke that

1025
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:32,829
myself so it got passed on and trimmed

1026
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:34,328
and taken care of a machine would have

1027
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:35,650
never seen that and that [ __ ] would have

1028
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:38,048
rolled down the line and got put into

1029
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,548
either our hash or our pipe or a jar to

1030
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:41,829
get sold and it would have embarrassed

1031
00:35:39,548 --> 00:35:44,228
us you cannot put a value on that

1032
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:47,528
quality control that a good well-trained

1033
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:50,108
educated trimmer brings to the table I

1034
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:52,298
mean when you say don't touch it I've

1035
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:55,630
been trimming with people and you look

1036
00:35:52,298 --> 00:35:59,170
over and there glove is just solid right

1037
00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:01,660
that means your man has half of what I

1038
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,548
grew is now on your glove yeah there's a

1039
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,679
stick on there just handle that stick

1040
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:08,079
yep yeah find yourself a stick to handle

1041
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,419
and don't manhandle the buds um

1042
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,859
I think we kind of answered that you're

1043
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,358
gonna have I would recommend you

1044
00:36:11,858 --> 00:36:14,949
listening to the drying and curing

1045
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,409
episode also but for the most part

1046
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:19,929
that's where the harvest Terps come in

1047
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:22,210
you cut it down in the dark you keep it

1048
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:23,768
dark cut it down keep it in the dark dry

1049
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,420
it really slowly when the sticks pop

1050
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:27,399
then you cut the buds off the sticks put

1051
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:30,548
them into a glass container and burp

1052
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,528
them i spurt I've got OCD I like to burp

1053
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:33,818
it at four hours tumble them around a

1054
00:36:32,528 --> 00:36:35,108
little bit get air in there cuz they're

1055
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:36,909
gonna be a little damp you might want to

1056
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:39,578
pull them apart put them back in the jar

1057
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:41,618
close it up burp I'm at eight hours do

1058
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:43,690
it again at sixteen then start doing it

1059
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:45,249
like every 12 hour do it eight for eight

1060
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,749
and then twelve so doing every twelve

1061
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:48,278
hours before it when you wake up before

1062
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:51,939
you go to bed every day burp these buds

1063
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:53,650
give them 15 20 maybe 30 minutes open

1064
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,259
you're not trying to dry them you're

1065
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:59,410
trying to let moisture escape the bud

1066
00:36:56,259 --> 00:37:02,139
but you want so when you close that jar

1067
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:05,018
a reaction happens there's oxygen and

1068
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:06,848
moisture and darkness and those create

1069
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:09,429
the perfect environment for the

1070
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:11,109
chlorophyll to start breaking down you

1071
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:14,048
create an acid in there is it aerobic or

1072
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:15,548
anaerobic acid it's with oxygen okay so

1073
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:16,989
you treat the anaerobic acid and there

1074
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:18,880
that starts eating it how the

1075
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:20,440
chlorophyll I believe you're correct it

1076
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,969
starts eating out the chlorophyll and it

1077
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,940
turns it into a vapor when you open the

1078
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:26,829
jar the moisture allows that to escape

1079
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,719
is how I think it goes I'm just reciting

1080
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:30,219
off the top of my head with no notes and

1081
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:32,019
sounds right so you have to have a

1082
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:33,849
little moisture in there to dry slowly

1083
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:35,228
to pull out that chlorophyll chlorophyll

1084
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:37,150
is what gives you the rough harsh taste

1085
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:40,349
turps are what give you that sweet

1086
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:42,599
delicious taste that burnt grain yeah

1087
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:43,949
yeah that's why uh that's why rosin

1088
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:45,509
always tastes like burnt popcorn if you

1089
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:48,509
overheat it and press it too hard you're

1090
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:50,010
just burning the Terps right there so

1091
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,420
there's more to this email I'm opening

1092

thought was like but everybody loved our

1129
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,960
super bake show there's one point in the

1130
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:12,719
show when I think I purposefully paused

1131
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,849
to edit and when I listen to back

1132
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,259
I didn't even edit it was like right

1133
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:18,750
here I need to edit the shows why I

1134
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,490
paused at one point I was like and here

1135
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,170
we go with the podcast and [ __ ] I

1136
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:23,879
didn't edit that at all I was listening

1137
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,740
back and my friend Elijah is like I

1138
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,890
don't think you did that right no like

1139
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:30,869
oops we recorded it it like we meant to

1140
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:32,909
hit record it like 9:30 we didn't

1141
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:36,659
actually end up recording until at well

1142
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:39,509
after 10:00 the video was the podcast

1143
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:41,429
was posted at midnight and by 4:00 a.m.

1144
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,320
I was getting tweets and messages about

1145
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:44,789
how good the show was nice I think it

1146
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,990
was a quick turnaround on that one

1147
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:48,150
that's fun when you post it and people

1148
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:49,799
listen as it goes up you know when the

1149
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,329
alert comes up on your phone we've got

1150
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,680
an awesome little community you've built

1151
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:54,009
all right do we want to read the next

1152
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:57,399
one from

1153
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,720
the message goes like this Gmail I'm

1154
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,099
gonna read too because I said his

1155
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,108
[ __ ] full name on the show and we may

1156
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:03,640
have to edit a few minutes out anyway so

1157
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:06,549
it goes like this hey Rasta Jeff I had a

1158
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:09,159
question about flushing in Coco do it

1159
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,740
that's my advice do you do just plain

1160
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:13,868
water plus a flushing additive or do you

1161
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:15,669
water with a small amount of Cal mag

1162
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:18,068
added in because of your Coco I heard

1163
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,920
that was given as advice also wanted to

1164
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:23,108
hear your thoughts on behind unpay CH

1165
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:27,280
water flush or pH in your flush in cocoa

1166
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:28,568
as well as soil like a pro mix alright

1167
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,180
there's a couple of things to touch on

1168
00:40:28,568 --> 00:40:33,009
there flushing in cocoa do you add just

1169
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:35,078
but before I go that far I want to ask

1170
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:37,990
and I want to address this

1171
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,119
are you flushing just at the end of

1172
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:43,058
flour because some people think that

1173
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,740
they need to flush their cocoa during

1174
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:46,510
the flowering cycle which I find

1175
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:48,219
unnecessary when I'm watering with cocoa

1176
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,619
and I'm growing with cocoa I add

1177
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:52,480
nutrients to every single watering Oh

1178
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:54,369
when I'm growing with cocoa some people

1179
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,199
feel the need at the end of week three

1180
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,579
to just run so much clean water through

1181
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:59,469
it and flush out the nutrients I don't

1182
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:02,950
feel the need to do that I like to have

1183
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:04,298
it in there cocoa has aloe I don't want

1184
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:06,219
to say this wrong because I'm full of

1185
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:09,429
[ __ ] there's a lot of good people in

1186
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:12,308
exchange [ __ ] doesn't bind to cocoa

1187
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:14,469
stick thank you for the slightly more

1188
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:16,420
scientific term for it doesn't hold the

1189
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:17,889
nutrients as well as dirt right you're

1190
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,659
not getting that same salt built it

1191
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:21,670
doesn't live like the dirt does it's

1192
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:23,318
it's real slick and it's oily and the

1193
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,389
nutrients and the salts will slide right

1194
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:27,969
off of it essentially it's more like a

1195
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:30,368
sponge that will hold stuff to fall out

1196
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:33,098
of and that's the idea so we're more

1197
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:35,019
able to feed more consistently so when

1198
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:36,609
I'm talking about flushing I am only

1199
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:38,409
talking about the final phase of

1200
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:39,909
flowering when you were trying to get

1201
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:44,440
the nutrients out just before harvest

1202
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:47,920
write a DNA and in soil or cocoa I don't

1203
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,380
recommend a mid cycle flush of any type

1204
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,349
unless you're seeing a problem and then

1205
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,930
if I do that I mix up a very specific

1206
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:58,150
batch of nutrients that I use and I

1207
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:59,710
flush every plant heavily with that

1208
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,660
until water is running out and then I

1209
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,608
know that most of the old nutrients are

1210
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:05,558
out and what's in there now is this mix

1211
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:06,090
that I trust and I know that's gonna

1212
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,920
make my

1213
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,110
it's happy that's what I put in there to

1214
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,420
fix a problem so now what I'm talking

1215
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:14,039
about flushing I'm gonna go to just the

1216
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,329
end of flowering right now is what I'm

1217
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:17,909
talking about Mikey look like you want

1218
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:21,090
to joke I was gonna ask are you do you

1219
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:23,940
recommend just watering the normal

1220
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:26,309
volume of water with clean or clean pH

1221
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,650
water or do you like to I think if it is

1222
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:31,759
flooding the plant we're like say you're

1223
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:34,440
gonna start flush today the plant gets

1224
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,370
six or eight or ten times its normal

1225
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:41,670
volume of water to kind of just force

1226
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:43,679
everything out it would be ideal to know

1227
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,690
exactly how much you can put through and

1228
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,069
what it takes but there are several ways

1229
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,050
to do it depending on your environment

1230
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:52,200
and your in your situation and your

1231
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:55,260
timeframe um let me write down something

1232
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:57,599
with my pen here which is funny because

1233
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,010
I'm writing down the word pen ah let me

1234
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,420
write a note to kind of get back to what

1235
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,710
you're asking but then I want to kind of

1236
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,720
read the email cuz you've got a side

1237
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,420
question that's gonna kind of put me

1238
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:08,250
onto that yeah um do you add you flush

1239
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,530
with just plain water or a flushing

1240
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,809
additive you can do a flushing additive

1241
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:15,300
if you want if you want to speed up the

1242
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:17,009
process if you only have seven days to

1243
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,450
flush put a flushing additive in there

1244
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:20,820
in the first day if you've got ten days

1245
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:22,049
of flush consider the flushing additive

1246
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,390
if you've got twelve to fourteen days

1247
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,490
it's not necessary what a flushing

1248
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:27,839
additive does it sugars when you add the

1249
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:30,569
sugars to the water and pour it through

1250
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:34,530
your grow medium sugars will help

1251
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:36,269
release bonded salts is basically what

1252
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,769
happens it's not a hundred percent what

1253
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:39,690
goes on there but the sugars will help

1254
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:41,429
release bonded salt in your rhizosphere

1255
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,750
which will help flush your plants and

1256
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:44,159
help speed up the metabolism of your

1257
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:47,429
plants that's the part why you would use

1258
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:51,089
that it's not necessary but it's helpful

1259
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:53,359
and if you've got it go for it um so

1260
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:55,710
just plain water works and then you say

1261
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,720
would you water with a small amount of

1262
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,300
cal mag added in because of the coco no

1263
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,889
i if I'm flushing this is why I wasn't

1264
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,410
sure if you meant flushing at the end or

1265
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:06,000
like at the end of week three and five

1266
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:07,589
or something like that know if I'm

1267
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,590
flushing I'm flushing I want it gone I

1268
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:12,750
don't want anything in there unless I'm

1269
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:14,550
using veg bloom I will go until the last

1270
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,860
five or seven days with some shine but I

1271
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:19,050
never said that out loud

1272
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,470
check out a veg bloom tech on Instagram

1273
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,420
for all

1274
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:22,949
the details on how to use shine properly

1275
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,470
because it's a great product they don't

1276
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:27,299
pay me to say that but it helps umm I

1277
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:28,769
don't put anything in there at the end

1278
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:33,300
of flush I'm flushing I want it all to

1279
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:35,639
go bye-bye um also I want to hear your

1280
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:38,130
thoughts behind unpay chirpy aged water

1281
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:40,679
during your flush if you can pH it if

1282
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:43,619
you've got the ability why not do it if

1283
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:45,210
you are flushing an outdoor plant that

1284
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,280
you've got a hundred gallon [ __ ]

1285
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,690
smart pot outside just put the hose on

1286
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,180
there and let it run do don't even try

1287
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:53,340
to ph that [ __ ] it's gonna take so much

1288
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:55,739
pH down you may not have a reservoir to

1289
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:58,890
do it it's outside you'll be okay

1290
00:44:55,739 --> 00:45:01,139
you don't have to pee there done nothing

1291
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:04,108
too bad is gonna happen but if you can

1292
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:05,670
pH it do it why not and some places

1293
00:45:04,108 --> 00:45:07,440
that's gonna be crazy important

1294
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:09,150
depending on your water that is true if

1295
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,099
your water is completely [ __ ] funky

1296
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,829
you are going to need to ph it if you've

1297
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:15,150
got we're very lucky here our water kind

1298
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:16,679
of tastes like [ __ ] it's got a weird

1299
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,960
flavor but if you test it it's really

1300
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,358
not that bad though the PP ends are low

1301
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,519
the pH is all right it's really not that

1302
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:25,679
bad so you can flush with water from

1303
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,820
here I don't know where you are a guy

1304
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,879
whose name I keep [ __ ] up and

1305
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:31,260
shouldn't say that again I don't I don't

1306
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,180
know if you can you if you got well

1307
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,000
water I don't know what you're using you

1308
00:45:33,179 --> 00:45:36,838
might want to pH that but let me recap

1309
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,608
and make sure I got all your stuff

1310
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:40,920
before I go onto the part that Mike made

1311
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:42,480
me write down with my brain plain water

1312
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,369
flushing additive if you're in a hurry

1313
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,980
but make sure if you use that flushing

1314
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:49,289
additive make sure you get at least one

1315
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,760
clean water rinse after that so that

1316
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,239
you're flushing additive isn't what you

1317
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,030
taste

1318
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:55,679
ah no I don't use cal-mag in my flush

1319
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:58,349
the only thing I would consider using

1320
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,690
during my flush would probably be shine

1321
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:04,500
from our friends at veg bloom also known

1322
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:07,730
as hydroponic research um pH if you can

1323
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,960
it's not necessary also wanted to know I

1324
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,579
may not be necessary sorry I don't want

1325
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,309
to mislead you it's not necessary for me

1326
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:17,159
want to know my thoughts behind on pH

1327
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:18,989
water and flush and soil as well

1328
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,329
soils much more forgiving if you've got

1329
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:23,459
decent water you're gonna want to run a

1330
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:25,469
lot more water through your soil than

1331
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,179
your cocoa to flush that out it's gonna

1332
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:30,419
be a lot harder to get everything out in

1333
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:31,469
the soil than it will to Coco but it

1334
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,230
depends on how much you're using

1335
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:34,789
honestly if you want a pH

1336
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:37,490
if you're going if you've got a big

1337
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:39,230
outdoor [ __ ] grow you might just want

1338
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:39,949
to run the hose so I wrote down

1339
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:43,969
something here

1340
00:46:39,949 --> 00:46:46,549
flushing either in cocoa or soilless mix

1341
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:49,459
or however you want to grow one thing

1342
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,970
you can do elevate your pot off of the

1343
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,510
ground

1344
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:54,799
um maybe use or put a trainer if this

1345
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,660
would work to put a tray under it just

1346
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,160
the little saucer catch the water that's

1347
00:46:56,659 --> 00:47:00,858
coming out of it as my point clean your

1348
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,480
vessel set the pot on a vessel of some

1349
00:47:00,858 --> 00:47:04,759
sort that is going to catch the water

1350
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,469
you need like a half inch of water maybe

1351
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,180
an inch of water coming out of the

1352
00:47:06,469 --> 00:47:09,679
bottom of your pot flush it flush it

1353
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:11,358
flush it until it's draining a lot until

1354
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:11,809
you see a bunch of water coming out go

1355
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:14,179
hard

1356
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:16,219
then catch some of that water and stick

1357
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:17,899
a nice e pin in there stick a ppm pin in

1358
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:18,949
there and see how much it's coming out

1359
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,900
of the bottom of your plant

1360
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:23,719
see how low you can get it if you're in

1361
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,400
cocoa you can get it really low and soil

1362
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:26,779
it's gonna stay up kind of higher just

1363
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,119
because there's stuff in the soil you've

1364
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,560
got natural stuff in your soil

1365
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,570
let's see hitting it all out so you

1366
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,460
rinse out all the soil right see how you

1367
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:36,350
see how low you can get it in that cocoa

1368
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,010
uh you should be able to get it fairly

1369
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:40,670
low

1370
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:42,350
maybe maybe test the cocoa when you get

1371
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:44,119
it run some water through it see what it

1372
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:45,739
ec is that before you put nutrients in

1373
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:47,539
it try to get it back to there before

1374
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:50,269
you flush I don't know if you can this

1375
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:52,130
is all one idea but I know what I don't

1376
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:53,389
want to say and I'm trying to think an

1377
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,340
arbitrary number but I don't want to

1378
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:57,019
give you a number of what my e sees come

1379
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,300
out at the end of the week when we Tet

1380
00:47:57,019 --> 00:48:01,579
we test every day when we water it my

1381
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,470
girl we catch the water every table gets

1382
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:06,139
wat that gets the EC tested the pH

1383
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:08,689
tested it should be in a certain range

1384
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:10,009
but I don't know what you're feeding I

1385
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:13,340
don't know what you're collecting in I

1386
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:15,800
don't want to give you a fake a false

1387
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:17,090
hope or a fake guideline so see what you

1388
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,650
I see how low you can get it in your

1389
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:20,660
cocoa see how much you can flush that

1390
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:23,119
[ __ ] out and see how low you can get so

1391
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:25,429
you gotta go get a p/e C meter or a ppm

1392
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,400
pen and see how low you can get it it's

1393
00:48:25,429 --> 00:48:30,618
all about the right tools yeah so that's

1394
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,650
my advice on flushing in just about any

1395
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:34,940
medium if you're using rock wool or

1396
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:38,059
whatever else type of hydro stuff like

1397
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:40,849
that flush you can flush about ten to

1398
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:42,739
fourteen days seven is maybe enough if

1399
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:45,108
you use some sort of product and you go

1400
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:47,118
really fast and I but I like ten to

1401
00:48:45,108 --> 00:48:48,769
fourteen days all right

1402
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,000
this next question should be pretty

1403
00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:54,079
quick but I want to proofread it um so

1404
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,940
he says hey I was just laughing to

1405
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,500
myself saying the Dain team was giving

1406
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,150
your strains a name that they made up I

1407
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,588
definitely don't agree with him doing

1408
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,900
that for reasons you stated on the show

1409
00:49:00,588 --> 00:49:05,029
but I'd love to hear even in a p.m. what

1410
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,800
names they added so it turns out one of

1411
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:08,810
them was called depth charge which was

1412
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,460
not my seeds it was another brand and

1413
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:12,230
then the other one that they just put a

1414
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,849
label on was they just called it Irie

1415
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:15,079
and it was the lemon Geoffrey to arise

1416
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:16,430
they just slapped the name on it and

1417
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:18,320
called it Irie which if they're gonna

1418
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:19,460
call it anything I guess I read about

1419
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,070
their other strains out there called

1420
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:26,570
Irie another breeder I used the name I

1421
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:28,849
Ryoji but yeah I that's all they did

1422
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:30,859
they just called it Irie so answer all

1423
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:33,140
three of your emails since I kept saying

1424
00:49:30,858 --> 00:49:34,400
your real name on the podcast hopefully

1425
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:38,750
let me leave that in so that I don't

1426
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,550
have to edit too much she's just getting

1427
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:43,039
the habit of saying every email is from

1428
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:45,260
rusty Shackelford yeah if you guys when

1429
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:47,719
you email me which you can do it grow

1430
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:49,970
from your heart at hotmail.com that

1431
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:51,919
should be like instead of hi Ross - Jeff

1432
00:49:49,969 --> 00:49:55,098
it should just be bold letters you can

1433
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,329
or you cannot use my name on the show

1434
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:58,940
there you go start your email with

1435
00:49:56,329 --> 00:50:02,240
what's up Rasta do or do not say my name

1436
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:05,088
on the podcast or just yet cuz that

1437
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:07,750
would help me I apologize if I busted

1438
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:09,980
you out before anybody else sorry dude

1439
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:12,050
keep sending emails that we absolutely

1440
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,010
love the questions yes send the emails

1441
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,839
to grow from your heart hit a

1442
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,630
