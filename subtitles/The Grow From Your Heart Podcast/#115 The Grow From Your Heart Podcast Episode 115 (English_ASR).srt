166
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,840
hash is all that is I saw that right off

167
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,370
right off the bat I thought there's no

168
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,079
way that that's possible they let that

169
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,699
ride for a few days but then they went

170
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,129
and they're like hey everybody it's just

171
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:14,879
ice so shout out for full and everybody

172
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:16,409
I should have pulled a guitar so if you

173
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,969
guys were blown away by that super clear

174
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,490
hash that was held up a few days ago on

175
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,690
Instagram a lot of people reposting it

176
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,610
was all over Facebook it was all over

177
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:25,680
the social media that was frozen water

178
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,300
you can make hash that clear it's easy

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,829
you're doing it in the freezer right now

180
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,819
probably if you live in the right part

181
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:32,279
of the country it's happening in your

182
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,599
backyard right now somewhere tonight

183
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,799
yeah it's going on right here in our

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,169
neighborhood so sorry to burst

185
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,598

186
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:41,609
ice so another social media thing that

187
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:43,589
has been really catching a lot of

188
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,229
attention lately there was a glass

189
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,489
convention in Las Vegas just recently

190
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:48,180
was it in Vegas I'm pretty sure those

191
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,848
Vegas anyway

192
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,150
there's a glass convention a an industry

193
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:57,449

over if you're at work put down your

199

knife somebody bought a hatch rig for

200
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:13,439
101 thousand dollars you can't even

201
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:20,370
believe that there's certainly overpaid

202
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:23,210
by a grand like hunter geez and this

203

guy's like hundred and one for that yeah

204
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:28,288
that's a lot of money for a hatch rig

205
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,199
you have if you're gonna you better be

206
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:33,509
smoking the best hatch ever and a lot of

207
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,249
it a lot of it actually if I remember

208
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:47,129
correctly when I was looking at did have

209
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:49,740
a it had a that was actually swings for

210
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:51,569
the planet oh I like that you said that

211
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,848
okay let's open up that floodgate I'm

212
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,870
gonna say this on my podcast about 5,000

213
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,399
people are gonna listen to this and I'm

214
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,379
sure at least 100 of them are gonna send

215
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,439
me dirty emails that rig is [ __ ] ugly

216
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:04,169
a hundred and one thousand dollars for a

217
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,088
really ugly I know you know I'm a

218
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:08,639
connoisseur of many other things comes

219
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:12,930
weed and flowers concert oil and all

220
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,300
that but that rig man it was it was all

221
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,360
over the place it looked like so it's uh

222
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,310
it's got a gaudy ass bass the bass is

223
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,110
this so one thing I should mention this

224
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,180
rig is covered in moons and if you turn

225
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,949
the rig around slowly it goes through

226
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,418
the phases of the Moon is something that

227
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:29,490
Debbie pointed out Scott Debbie shout

228
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:31,139
out to Scott Debbie and to Sagan glass

229
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,490
it's great work you guys I just think

230
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,990
it's ugly it's my personal preference

231
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,339
obviously enough people love it so don't

232
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,379
be mad at me for thinking it's ugly a

233
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,729
lot of people somebody paid 100 1000

234
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:40,799
dollars so it's obviously not a one

235
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,860
person love them love this [ __ ] out of

236
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,599
it way more than I hated it he loves it

237
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,100
100 and 1000 times more than I dislike

238
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,940
it I just think it's ugly but it's

239
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,690
poorly planned

240
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,820
the base is god-awful ugly it's got

241
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,650
moons glued to it on the base that's in

242
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,810
this odd shape it looks like the base

243
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,860
was just they made the top and they're

244
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:59,359
like when we need something big enough

245
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,509
to hold this up now so they made that

246
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,220
gaudy base and then they put a I think

247
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:06,529
the color would be called Stardust black

248
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,300
Stardust Faberge egg and if you guys

249
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,490
know anything about glass the fab age is

250
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:11,569
the artwork it's the way to go but they

251
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,889
made it out of a color of glass you

252
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,390
can't see through so you could barely

253
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:16,879
tell that it's a fab 8 it looks like a

254
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:21,710
grenade it's exactly looks like actually

255
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:23,570
okay I've got a picture here on my phone

256
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,400
somewhere I posted it up to social media

257
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,600
so it shouldn't be too hard to find but

258
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,909
we will pull this up for you to take a

259
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,350
look at but it looks like poorly planned

260
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:32,719
and then it looks like they just glued

261
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,610
moons around it to give it the moon vibe

262
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,259
that they were looking for and I said

263
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,240
that I wanted to buy it and just glue a

264
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:41,029
rocket to it just to complete the whole

265
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,860
space all right I found the bow look

266
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:44,120
there was the image right away so you

267
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,800
give me a minute to find the image cuz

268
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,500
Facebook likes to do that thing where it

269
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,629
jumps around I'm pulling it up I promise

270
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,009
here we go this is a rig that somebody

271
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:54,259
paid a hundred and one thousand dollars

272
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,789
for it's insane yeah it's beautiful it's

273
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:57,259
got some great colors to it but it looks

274
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:58,849
like something that les claypool

275
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:01,069
or Tim Burton would have put together in

276
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,050
my opinion that's a very good mother

277
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,650
ship is knowing that for a really clean

278
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:08,509
sleek smooth tight baller status look

279
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,399
their rigs are gorgeous and clean and

280
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:13,039
perfect and flawless and this thing this

281
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,289
doesn't come close yeah and you see I

282
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,849
like that Alan's not really into the

283
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:18,199
glass scene he doesn't he hasn't

284
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,720
mentioned anything about glass and the

285
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,190
time that I've known him he's looks cool

286
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,370
but he just does he already knows that

287
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,210
that doesn't fit the mother ship motto

288
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,009
mother ship I'll give you guys a shout

289
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,920
out though those new race car themed

290
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:32,480
rigs are the bee's knees bro there are a

291
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,099
couple of those that I really really

292
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,839
love I feel like I'm doing too much

293
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,279
pulling up stuff on the phone here but

294
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,900
I'll show you guys these race car rigs

295
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,350
because they are beautiful and I can do

296
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:47,179
editing if any of this gets carried away

297
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,589
hit man our mothership these rigs I'm

298
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,769
gonna try to describe it now since I'm

299
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:53,960
pulling it up so they took a normal

300
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:57,470
tourist rig which would be clear and

301
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,660
they have used yellow glass on one

302
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,580
portion and blue glass on another and it

303
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,049
looks really sleek and it's super smooth

304
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,870
and they call it the race car series

305
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:05,669
this is a

306
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,470
Klein and where the client function

307
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:09,028
happens they used clear glass to make a

308
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,920
window so that you can see the water

309
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:12,600
bubble in them that is actually pretty

310
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,629
cool yeah I really loved the race car

311
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,339
series so shout out the mothership glass

312
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,929
they do not like that expensive piece

313
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:23,150
but I really love the the race car

314
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:23,149
series so I apologize solid with the

315
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:31,049
it's just a tight look is that rig

316
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:32,278
levitating in that picture it seems that

317
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:33,899
way I wondered if I was the only one

318
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,519
that noticed that shut up to mothership

319
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,959
I don't know how you made that happen I

320
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,519
should probably stop talking about

321
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,139
mothership since I'm sponsored by hitman

322
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,490
glass buy yourself a hit alright so we

323
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,740
all agree that that rig was way

324
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,750
overpriced right oh yeah I agree

325
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,310
for me it definitely was I think

326
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,899
everybody at this table does financially

327
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:54,929
well we're all kind of in the the legal

328
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,699
cannabis industry yeah what's uh what's

329
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,709
the most money that you would find

330
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:06,390
acceptable to pay cash for a rig at this

331
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:07,830
point in your life okay alright you're

332
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:09,028
gonna have to go to a trade show and

333
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,180
pick up a hitman because that's the only

334
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:13,278
way you're gonna find one for a price no

335
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:15,329
everyone gives me [ __ ] all the time

336
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,769
they're glad they're glass they break

337
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,170
you smoked hash out of it I understand

338
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:21,389
yeah at 250 I think you're gonna go to

339
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:22,740
50 and you're not a dabber so I'm gonna

340
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,860
buy a nice ball or a good pipe at that

341
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:29,220
point alright that's reasonable hey guys

342
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,620
I want you to send me a tweet to @g fyh

gonna buy a rig what you would find it

345
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:36,899
to be a reasonable budget are you in the

346
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:38,490
hundred and one thousand dollar range or

347
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,069
you over here like Carlos with one

348

00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,149
wanted to talk about since everybody at

373
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,629
the table is into the legal cannabis

374
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,919
industry you were kind of making I

375
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:39,330
should we should back up and talk about

376
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,370
kind of how we ran into each other I

377
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,389
have known you since I was the budtender

378
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,639
at met amar did such a long time but but

379
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:49,740
that was 2008 when we got closed yeah

380
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,419
you were one of our first patients that

381
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,029
would come in spend some time buy

382
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:55,589
medicine from us yeah when you came did

383
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,470
you come in when it was in the apartment

384
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,570
upstairs I did okay so you got to see it

385
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,769
evolve from that guy's couch we don't

386
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,450
talk about that guy's name on the show

387
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:05,579
we leave names out to protect the

388
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,900
innocent but we went from that guy's

389
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,310
couch and then it went to the middle

390
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,189
floor and then we moved it down to the

391
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:14,299
main floor and then we busted out and

392
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,300
went hardcore for a while

393
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:21,809
2008 is when that shop was really

394
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,280
booming 2007-2008 so yeah 2008 is how

395
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:25,859
long I've known this guy so he used to

396
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,240
shop at the dispensary they which Tom

397
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,830
sex and pretty much handed the keys to

398
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,860
me and it was like here you go run the

399
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:34,470
shop so yeah since then we've both

400
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,500
gotten into that shop was legal quasi

401
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,210
illegal I don't know how legal that yeah

402
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,610
it was such a gray area we called it the

403
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,230
wild wild west I was growing urban the

404
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,610
house and tom was growing herb at the

405
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,490
house and we would take it put it on the

406
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,919
shelves and then customers would show up

407
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,450
with a backpack and you know it'd be

408
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,860
like I just need to talk to Jeff and

409
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,970
they'd send him back and they'd come

410
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,529
talk to her and they'd be like look at

411
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,759
all this weed I grew do you guys want to

412
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,019
buy it and so we just buy it if it was

413
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,309
good enough and they wanted a reasonable

414
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,110
price we could buy the weed from them

415
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:04,169
and put it on the shelves at that point

416
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,789
in those days the good old days yeah I

417
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:08,849
think the herb was a little bit better

418
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:10,250
back then I agree yeah Boutique badges

419
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,600
are much better than these large-scale

420
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,399
yeah and I work in a large-scale girl

421
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,690
it's a different type of thing it's a

422
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,610
tool it's a totally different monster

423
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,750
the airflow is different the temperature

424
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,980
that's one of the things I've noticed

425
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,080
about everything is that commercial

426
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,200
growers are just oh my god they're just

427
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,180
it seems like I can't believe how weed

428
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,379
back in the day was so much better and

429
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,659
it was

430
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:33,419
people working with almost no budget

431
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:35,129
compared to people who have millions you

432
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:38,159
know I think in a lot of that is because

433
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:40,230
the passion the industry evolves the

434
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,269
rules evolve to where only people with a

435
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,289
million dollars can play in the cannabis

436
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,909
game right now you have to have a

437
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:46,709
million dollars to get involved in the

438
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,809
cannabis game to have a legal shop and

439
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,940
to grow a grow that supports that shop

440
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:53,339
to be able to open and have a clean

441
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,050
environment to build your grow and a

442
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,450
retail environment and to hire a staff

443
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:59,309
and to get product and to get insurance

444
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,610
and to get security security is so

445
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:03,989
expensive to open any type of anything

446
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,899
marijuana Enforcement Division regulated

447
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:09,210
every square foot where people can go

448
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,100
needs to be covered by a camera if

449
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,750
there's a doorway they want a camera on

450
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,399
both sides of the door so that if they

451
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,690
look at two camera views on the monitor

452
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,730
they can see you leave one room and

453
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,590
enter the other room flawlessly there

454
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,480
can be no gaps in your travel on the

455
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,889
cameras so it cost you a million bucks

456
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,560
and get into the industry nowadays and

457
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:27,990
what sucks about that is people like you

458
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,029
and I we have heart we got mad heart you

459
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,110
know what I mean we've been doing this

460
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,549
before we should even admit we were

461
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,879
growing in our basements we were getting

462
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:37,049
it on and so we've got heart we don't

463
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,639
have a million dollars because we had to

464
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:39,809
hide we had we were growing weed we

465
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,039
weren't going to college we weren't

466
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:42,000
running a car dealership we weren't

467
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,589
doing whatever these other guys are

468
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,500
doing so we had to make our own money

469
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,930
and now that we've got it your

470
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,220
headphones are right no I'll tell don't

471
00:16:48,929 --> 00:17:00,029
so good all right I'll tap them and

472
00:16:50,220 --> 00:17:06,539
they'll start working No maybe 17

473
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:09,750
minutes mine just went on alright guys

474
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:11,279
don't ever buy the ha0 for headphone

475
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,960
amplifier from livewire if your guitar

476
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,639
Center and they offer you that give them

477
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,019
a dirty look and buy the one that's $20

478
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,000
more expensive it'll be well worth your

479
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:18,750
time guys that's my recommendation all

480
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,130
right so we're talking about this

481
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,359
industry if you don't have a million

482
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,950
dollars you can't get into the cannabis

483
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,839
industry but Louis and I Carlos and I

484
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,190
have mad passion we wouldn't be able to

485
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,720
buy a shop right now and set that up

486
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,309
because we've been growing weed and

487
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,569
living like that you got to kind of hide

488
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,859
when you're a cannabis grower back in

489
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:33,119
the day we couldn't have all the money

490
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:34,139
that we had we had to hide that we

491
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,250
couldn't go open a store because we

492
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,390
couldn't talk about how'd you make this

493
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,490
money I grew weed right

494
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,170
young download on TV so the people that

495
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,210
are able to open shops now are guys that

496
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,740
have had other businesses that were

497
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,150
doing other things and no offense to

498
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,740
those guys but they don't have the heart

499
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,240
that somebody like you and I have about

500
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,859
the industry we need to work in this

501
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,329
it's a business to them if they have an

502
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,649
accountant and a lawyer and then the

503
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:57,329
master growers are the guys that are

504
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,330
just supposed to go grow their employees

505
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,599
you sound better when he's talking to

506
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:07,569
you so what I was kind of getting out a

507
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:09,939
little bit is right now master growers

508
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:11,439
and head growers I'm called the lead

509
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,730
cultivator as my official title I hated

510
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,870
the word master grower so we changed I'm

511
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,230
a lead cultivator I'll lead the

512
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:19,809
cultivation team we're making hella good

513
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,670
money like we're being paid fat chunky

514
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,169
salaries as lead cultivators in this

515
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,150
industry right now people that have been

516
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,470
at it for I've been growing cannabis for

517
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,300
over 20 years I've been involved in the

518
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:32,890
cannabis industry or the cannabis scene

519
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:34,269
for Wow 25 years well I have to think

520
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,670
about that I've been messing with weed

521
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:38,589
for 25 years any guys there's a big

522
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,840
difference between being like a weed

523
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:42,039
grower and a cannabis giver caregiver

524
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:43,389
and being in the industry if you're not

525
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,859
paying taxes on it you don't have some

526
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,720
kind of cannabis Emme deregulated

527
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:48,459
license you can't say you're in the

528
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,230
industry in Colorado you're just growing

529
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,880
weed now that's kind of yeah the new

530
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,620
standard we're gonna make here you can't

531
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,640
say I do this in the industry you're a

532
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:57,279
grower you're underground

533
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,500
get on paper come join us it's fun pay

534
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,700
taxes do it correctly but so what I'm

535
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,440
saying is the people that own the

536
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,150
industry they have all kinds of money

537
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,710
now so I think the people like myself

538
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,019
that are making good money we better

539
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,700
stick to it we better make a fat resume

540
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:11,200
you guys that are trimming making I know

541
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,970
trimmers that make anywhere between 10

542
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,710
and 20 bucks an hour if you're making

543
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,539
good money trimming start documenting

544
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,920
how many hours you've been trimming if

545
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:19,509
you're using a trim machine if you're

546
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,970
using the satellite if you're using the

547
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:23,440
Ripper document how many hours you use

548
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,720
on that put that as part of your resume

549
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,370
if you know how if your applicator

550
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,470
certified that goes on your resume

551
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:32,229
because in the future this is gonna turn

552
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,670
into just a basic job unfortunately

553
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,980
people like Alan said over here it's a

554
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:38,170
business yeah that way owners aren't

555
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,299
gonna want to pay the next set of

556
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:43,000
growers my salary the people that come

557
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,950
after me are not gonna get paid what

558
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,299
this group of growers are getting paid

559
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,400
it's gonna start tapering off because

560
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,470
what I think creates a high dollar

561
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,690
product is

562
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,700
is an illegal product since it was

563
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,769
illegal it was highly in demand but

564
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,029
there wasn't any supply now it's legal

565
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:58,440
we could grow the [ __ ] out of it we

566
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,629
don't have to hide why are we charging

567
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,610
so much for it it's only for production

568
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,450
once we catch up with production which

569
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:05,069
won't take too long

570
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,259
we're building their greenhouses going

571
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:08,730
up every single day so once we catch up

572
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:10,859
the production I see prices going down

573
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,690
and then the producers are going to

574
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:14,548
start being paid less and less trimmers

575
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,058
aren't gonna get hired on for 15 an hour

576
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,158
anymore

577
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:19,619
the industry is gonna taper off it'll be

578
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,789
any other agricultural it'll find more

579
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:25,139
temporary staffing going on it probably

580
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:28,109
but getting back to the leaf cultivator

581
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:31,230
like any industry I do will believe that

582
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:33,000
if you can show someone that you are

583
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,159
worth your money you can get a higher

584
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,589
wage for it if you can go in there and

585
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,000
you can increase production and show

586
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:41,730
them that you can do it you can bring it

587
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,440
up 10 15 20 percent you'll still have a

588
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,120
competitive edge over someone else

589
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,558
absolutely able to present that

590
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,918
absolutely you make good recommendations

591
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,879
of absolutely documenting your history

592
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,860
and what you've been able to accomplish

593
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,320
and it's gonna make a lot of differences

594
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,969
as this industry does change and that

595
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,740
works and into any industry document

596
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,240
what you're doing have proof it's just

597
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,609
harder in the cannabis industry but as

598
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,288
we are revolving a lot of guys like us

599
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:06,089
we're ahead of the game so stay ahead of

600
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:07,769
the game and document that stuff don't

601
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:09,269
get stuck in your bubble and write down

602
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:11,129
everything that you're learning and that

603
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,418
goes on a resume if you can eat like I

604
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,740
said if you can use the satellite that

605
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,780
goes on your resume if you can use the

606
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,548
obidos that goes on your resume if you

607
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,649
can run a sweet leaf extractor that goes

608
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:22,889
on your resume because eventually you

609
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,870
guys you're not gonna so Allen brought

610
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,759
up a good point you can impress them and

611
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:29,548
you can jump in and make a few a few

612
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,379
more dollars on your salary but a lot of

613
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:33,389
those guys a lot of those jobs are taken

614
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,130
by guys like us I got a jump on it so

615
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,390
it's the next wave of people all the all

616
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,400
the rock stars are kind of doing that

617
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,809
now you're gonna have to be a badass to

618
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,980
get that kind of a salary in the future

619
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:43,558
I think that's my opinion

620
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,029
yeah I agree with you on on that a lot

621
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:48,058
it's still gonna come down to networking

622
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:51,210
to ivy and other industries networking

623
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:54,000
was important you have to have those you

624
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,740
know those crossover relationships but

625
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,440
nothing like this industry have I ever

626
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,450
experienced the word so I use the word

627
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,940
incestuous it really is

628
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:06,450
you have to know someone a lot of

629
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,880
instances to get I get in the door now I

630
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,029
was pretty fortunate I've got hired on

631
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,320
I've only been in the industry about

632
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:16,160
well eight months and I think I've been

633
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:18,569
badged and I've worked at a couple other

634
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:22,920
facilities starting at the ground level

635
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:26,849
literally and I did walk into one place

636
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,560
and with my crossover skills and my

637
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:30,359
resume I was able to get in there

638
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,549
but I've had to work and hustle to learn

639
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:34,829
this industry oh yeah but it does matter

640
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:37,019
a lot on if you can name drop a little

641
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:38,639
bit I think it helps a tremendous amount

642
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:41,759
more so in this industry I can

643
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,040
completely testify to your statement I

644
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,440
would not be in the position I'm in if I

645
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,119
weren't I earned it honestly I earned I

646
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,190
earned the spot but if I did not know

647
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,379

them before we put them in a jar and

694
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:28,119

little crowded it's starting to get the

725
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:40,659
rents going up it's getting a little bit

726
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:43,839
full they have an abundance of Labor for

727
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:47,200

735
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:01,000
want to get into the industry because

736
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:02,259
they think it was like high school where

737
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,549
everybody just sits around the topes

738
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:05,170
around the table or something and it

739

short-lived industry cash register has

810
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,308
to come out right at the end of the

811
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:27,569
night there you go

812
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:29,099
yeah you can't do that if you're too

813
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:30,599
high so what do you think of this whole

814
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:32,308
hash scene the way that we all just

815
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:33,750
smoke it shits on a hash or was it like

816
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:36,660
that at all in Arizona or is that just

817
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:38,609
kind of a Colorado thing well you know

818
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,960
what I didn't I wasn't in the industry

819
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:42,509
down there so okay I tell you how much

820
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,058
how much people were what they were

821
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:48,480
doing you guys enjoy it up here and I

822
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:51,210
think if I was gonna get Alan's probably

823
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,400
some like some some bubble hat or some I

824
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,220
hats and Bobo hatches my sanity I've got

825
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,660
I've got bubble I've got crumble I've

826
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:03,929
got nine thousand different kinds of

827
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:12,690
hash the old school stuff you're the guy

828
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:14,940
oh wait I need the rig you need him in

829
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,950
our buddy journeys he's come across as

830
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,870
very well-spoken and very intelligent so

831
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:22,500
far let's let him continue that

832
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:24,959
reputation on the show we won't turn him

833
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,429
into a bubble or a puddle we won't do

834
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,860
that to him on this podcast I'm not

835
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:29,910
gonna twist his arm here I'm heating up

836
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:32,428
the highly-educated

837
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,919
this one's the duality male you know I

838
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:38,940
do have to say your step when I

839
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:42,390
participated when it wasn't legal as a

840
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:47,640
younger man I had one of the old Hobbit

841
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:48,750
bongs that I used to smoke my wonderful

842
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,370
ex-wife

843
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:55,890
now she's wonderful because she's an act

844
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:58,139
yes awesome but I love you the glass

845
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,809
where they have here I mean to sit here

846
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,730
you don't have to really smoke to

847
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:04,379
appreciate the art or the craftsmanship

848
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:09,569
in it you don't have to do that it is

849
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:12,450
really pardon me you can see why someone

850
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:17,379
who asked the budget may spend the money

851
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:20,798
on on one you know art is subjective

852
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,780
and it it's not jumping back to what

853
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,190
we're talking about earlier and when I'm

854
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,798
sitting here looking at what you have on

855
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:29,620
the table I mean there's three beautiful

856
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:34,660
pieces well thank you to hit man's and

857
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:36,449
then a piece from elevate I think it's

858
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:41,220
so trip we have glasses changed like

859
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:43,390
what maybe the last ten years I remember

860
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,269
just going into the glass shop it was

861
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,620
kind of like so so you know and then now

862
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:51,119
this suit seems like the glass shops

863
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:53,829
just explode you follow the dab the dev

864
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,928
Dev seen all that other things there's

865
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:58,149
something about being a grower I I

866
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:59,950
caught myself falling into it when you

867
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,200
harvest you have too much money for a

868
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,360
minute and like any young guy that has

869
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,100
too much money and a big ego and [ __ ]

870
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:08,199
going on you got to go buy something and

871
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:10,990
I don't do the gold chains I don't do

872
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,700
rims on my car the thing I like to do is

873
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,980
smoke ash and listen to good music so

874
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,140
I've got a slammin stereo system I got

875
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,150
really good headphones on and I've got

876
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,380
really nice hash toys so that's every

877
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,179
harvest I would go buy something

878
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,309
ridiculous like this was one of my first

879
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:26,350
good harvest and we were talking about

880
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:28,539
those like a harvest that I grew this

881
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:29,889
one here I just drew some extra herb I

882
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:32,048
was like I'm gonna set up this room and

883
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,580
that extra room bought me that rig was

884
00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:36,099
pretty much what I pulled out of there

885
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:37,689
extra you know so stuff like that we're

886
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:43,269
gonna go buy a rig and sort of bind rims

887
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:44,769
and gold chains much better oh yeah and

888
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,329
if you have gold chains and Air Jordans

889
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,650
are your thing [ __ ] Rock'em I'd

890
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:50,168
rather have a hit man rig you can come

891
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,610
hit my rig you look stylish doing it I'm

892
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:53,679
not worried about looking that styling I

893
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:56,379
like skate shoes and Dickies nice and

894
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,298
easy for me what's the new one that you

895
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,860
got there this is called the hit man

896
00:31:58,298 --> 00:32:01,359
short stack and so when we're hitting a

897
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:02,829
little earlier so shun it again to hit

898
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,899
man Doug you shot it to Ryan a hit man

899
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:05,798
glass hey Ryan you got the rig I was

900
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,850
supposed to tell you when I got this

901
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,980
it's here dude I've got it

902
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:10,659
I forgot this Andy that email but thank

903
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,759
you it's kind of clogged up we should

904
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:16,240
clean it that's something I could talk

905
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:18,129
about how to clean your rig good that is

906
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,558
a good chunk there's probably a half

907
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:22,059
gram of just buzz stuck in there yeah

908
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:23,769
and that's just it's a very intricate

909
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:25,149
piece to be trying to I'm gonna have to

910
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:28,690
dissolve it really well with rubbing

911
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:30,390
alcohol so get you some 91% isopropyl

912
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,160
alcohol just fill the rig

913
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,200
as high as you can with alcohol let it

914
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,810
sit for a few and then pour a little bit

915
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,730
of kosher salt in there the kosher salts

916
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:39,659
real rough and then shake the [ __ ] out

917
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,000
of the rig cover the holes with your

918
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,600
thumbs and shake the [ __ ] out of it

919
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,190
don't drop it

920
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:45,569
do it over the carpet do it over the

921
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,309
couch if you feel like you're clumsy and

922
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:48,480
just shake the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of it

923
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:50,339
it'll scrub it up real good and then

924
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,019
rinse it with hot water a few times let

925
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:53,339
it cool off then you're ready to dab

926
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:54,779
again if you do it right you know

927
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:57,449
actually one of the things I noticed is

928
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:58,589
if you give it a decent one I'm about

929
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,900
that what that piece is a pretty

930
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:02,159
intricate but I noticed that once when

931
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,110
you're done if you want to leave it nice

932
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:13,080
and streak free you give it another

933
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:14,729
rinse with the alcohol and let it that

934
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,899
was a super good tip right there for all

935
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,759
you glass nerds when you're done

936
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,250
cleaning your rig Carlos got a lot of

937
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,240
