40
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,680
renewed um dude the process has gotten

41
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,879
super simple um I pretty much called

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,720
made an appointment I showed up they got

43
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,679
me in at my schedule appointment time

44
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,200
that's the first time that's ever

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,118
happened at a medical marijuana doctor

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,200
uh they got me in there they got me seen

47
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,078
they got my uh it's a it's not a license

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,240
you guys it's it bugs me for some reason

49
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:49,759
because we don't nobody here has a

50
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,199
marijuana license it's a medical

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,478
marijuana recommendation from a doctor

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,880
uh it's not a prescription it's not a

53
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:58,078
license so he writes out a

54
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,599
recommendation for you and then um you

55
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,398
know I was debating on if I wanted to

56
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,718
talk about this or not on the table in

57
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,439
the doctor's office there's just a

58
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,239
little sign and it says increased plant

59
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,519
count will require records and then

60
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,280
there's a dollar sign and then an amount

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,000
of plants and then another dollar sign

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,519
and an amount of plants and if you uh

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,759
provide records and you tell this doctor

64
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,680
that you are in need of a higher plant

65
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,878
count he will increase your plant count

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,000
for a small fee so if you're not a

67
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:24,719
Colorado resident and if you're not

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,318
familiar with all that what that means

69
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,039
is when you go to this doctor when you

70
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,280
get your medical marijuana card you are

71
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,719
now um allowed to grow six plants in

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,400
your private residence these doctors are

73
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,759
now able to write in recommendations

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,719
that you are able to grow more cannabis

75
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,120
and possess more cannabis than the

76
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,080
original six but to do that you've got

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,719
to bring a little bit of doctor note uh

78
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,440
some sort of History some sort of record

79
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,680
saying that something's wrong with you

80
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,079
and you also have to pay a fee so uh for

81
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,480
a small fee I walked out of there with a

82
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,599
handsome plant count I won't talk about

83
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,799
the numbers on the show I don't really

84
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,919
have a huge plant count I don't need

85
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,080
that many I just wanted to be safe so

86
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,199
and I went for what he would give me

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,440
just see if he would do it and I got the

88
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,878
highest he offered there so uh that was

89
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,519
super easy uh I wanted to talk about the

90
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,199
benefits of doing that um the reason I

91
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,799
did it is because of course I grow and I

92
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,798
want to keep my grow protected with my

93
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,120
medical marijuana card um that allows me

94
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,840
it gives me a little bit more safety I

95
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,319
feel like and also uh the recreational

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,439
shops are really high priced if you were

97
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,518
to buy a gr of hash at a recreational

98
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,359
shop it would cost you probably twice as

99
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,519
much as it would at a medical shop so uh

100
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,319
I keep my medical marijuana privileges

101
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,239
intact a lot for that because sometimes

102
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:38,598
I do run out of shatter and I have to go

103
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,680
I go up to green and healthy wellness in

104
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,479
Colorado Springs and I purchased grams

105
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,760
of hash uh from our friends hunt and uh

106
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:47,759
the Jordans and the John's up at uh

107
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,719
green and healthy wellness so that's a

108
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:53,039
good reason to keep my uh medical

109
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,479
marijuana card intact uh so I talked

110
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,000
about the benefits I talked about the

111
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,318
process and I talked about the cost I

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,878
feel like I cover the medical marijuana

113
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:00,679
card experience it was super easy this

114
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,120
time I'm not going to uh say the

115
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,360
doctor's name or anything on the podcast

116
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,519
but if you like his information just

117
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,120
email me it's grow from yourheart

118
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,158
hotmail.com and I'll get you that doctor

119
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,120
he is in PUO Colorado so if you're

120
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,120
looking for a doctor in pelo I've got a

121
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,438
recommendation for you uh let's move on

122
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,759
to my next topic I really want to get to

123
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,839
the grow lesson but I've got a few

124
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,079
things written down that I want to cover

125
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,159
um this is just kind of a personal thing

126
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,879
I keep seeing a lot of people talking

127
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,720
about the temperature of their eail um

128
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:31,120
the enail is the little box it plugs

129
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,960
into the wall that's got a a an LED or

130
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,280
an LCD display on there it's usually an

131
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,918
LED right little LED light display uh

132
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,079
shows numbers and then it's got an up

133
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:39,639
and down switch on it you can make the

134
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,319
temperature hotter and cooler and then

135
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,560
the one I have actually has a USB port

136
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,719
in it so that you can charge your iPhone

137
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,959
or whatever kind of phone you got on

138
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,240
there but then it's got a little cord

139
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,000
that comes out and it attaches to the

140
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,079
nail and it heats up the nail for you

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,918
all the time so that's the enail then

142
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:55,599
your dab nail is always hot right uh the

143
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,599
temperature on your

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,360
nail does not match what the numbers on

145
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,680
that box say that's what I'm trying to

146
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,879
get to here that's going to be my point

147
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,439
a lot of people say they've seen

148
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:08,560
pictures of my email and right now it's

149
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,319
flashing at 852 uh it's jumping between

150
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
uh 850 and

151
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,639
852 and honestly if you tried to take a

152
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,360
dab with that at 852 degrees I feel like

153
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,160
that'd be too hot but that is not a

154
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,120
representation of degrees that is simply

155
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,080
a setting on the box I don't think that

156
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,720
and maybe there is one brand maybe one

157
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,800
or two brands that does this but I don't

158
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,720
think that that coil is sending the the

159
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,560
temperature to that nail and all the way

160
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,120
back to there and telling it that it's

161
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,439
860° that is more of a setting like a

162
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,680
like if you turn your volume on your car

163
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,759
stereo to 11 you're not putting out 11

164
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,800
anything you're just on 11 you know that

165
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,360
11 is like I know that my car stereo I

166
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,120
could crank it up to about 28 before the

167
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,080
subwoofer starts sounding like complete

168
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,959
crap so I know that 26 is my ideal temp

169
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,079
on my car stereo it doesn't mean I'm

170
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,719
putting out 26 anything in particulars

171
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,800
it's just the level where it is and

172
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,919
that's what I think your enails are

173
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,439
doing uh we have established that the

174
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,959
860 I'm seeing on my screen right now on

175
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:10,360
my LED is actually a frequency that is

176
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:13,079
being put out and that's what's being

177
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,800
measured by that number so you got to

178
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,279
keep in mind that that number has to

179
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,038
travel all the way down the cord and

180
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,399
then it has to get to the coil and that

181
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,000
coil is the heating part that coil has

182
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,198
to heat whatever type of nail you're

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,800
using I'm using this new Highly Educated

184
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,919
uh it's the enil insert which one is it

185
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,840
it's got the name printed on it let me

186
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:35,519
read it I I knew the name until I

187
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:37,000
started talking it is the the H adapter

188
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,758
so I'm using that one so you've got to

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,399
heat up this Barrel shaped piece and

190
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,120
then the head of the nail heats up after

191
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,799
that cuz the Heat's got to travel so for

192
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,079
it to know what the exact heat is on the

193
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,160
head of that nail would be kind of kind

194
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,439
of ridiculous to ask of that device so

195
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,199
my point is that number doesn't match

196
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,360
the head of the nail you guys that is a

197
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:00,080
frequency or a dial setting so when you

198
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,439
find the ideal number just remember that

199
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,038
ideal number and that's kind of where

200
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,038
you want to be you're not actually

201
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,918
getting at 856 de or I've seen some of

202
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:09,719
them said perfectly 710 because people

203
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,120
think that's the perfect temp that

204
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,080
number is not correlating to The Nail

205
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,280
you guys so when you see my pictures and

206
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,598
it's at 850 quit bitching at me I think

207
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,000
that's my point here all right I have

208
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,360
another topic written down but the

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,439
iPhone has locked me out here we go uh

210
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,120
the next one oh the pesticide issue man

211
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,598
we talked about this a little bit um in

212
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,160
a previous episode I talked about about

213
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,079
some of the dispensaries that got in

214
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,080
trouble and I saw a quick article I'm

215
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,318
scrolling through my phone here I should

216
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,519
have been a little more

217
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,520
prepared people are kind of upset about

218
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:45,598
this pesticide issue and here is what I

219
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:47,878
saw this was all over um it was all over

220
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,680
social media websites today it says uh

221
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,599
pesticide violations were issued to the

222
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,918
following recreational marijuana grow

223
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,079
facilities and then it lists mindful

224
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:59,198
Green Solutions evolutionary Holdings

225
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,079
Green Cross Colorado MMJ America organic

226
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,158
green

227
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:06,158
altitude East treatments r i n and Sweet

228
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:08,120
Leaf all violators were using Eagle 20

229
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:10,759
and petroleum based fungus side that is

230
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,598
harmful to humans and animals altitude

231
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,800
East treatments was also using Mallet

232
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,759
and avot both harmful to humans and

233
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,759
animals Green Cross Denver was also

234
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,680
using Mallet many of these violations

235
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,598
are well known and then it goes on to

236
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,959
talk about a lot more stuff you know I

237
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:25,800
don't know the original source of that

238
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,198
because I've seen it cut and pasted on

239
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,439
so many different social media sites

240
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,759
that I don't know who to give credit to

241
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,038
that but uh these guys were spraying

242
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,399
Eagle 20 on plants and then selling

243
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,479
those buds to people and the weird part

244
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,759
here is MMJ America just won a Cannabis

245
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,639
Cup so what's going on with that these

246
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,600
guys are did they enter their Eagle 20

247
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,080
Laden buds into the Cannabis Cup or are

248
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,519
they growing separate cups or separate

249
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,120
crops and entering that and not even

250
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,080
giving the public a chance to go buy

251
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,919
that because I suspect that that's what

252
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,399
some of the shops do so these uh plants

253
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,838
have been taken off the market those

254
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,600
plants will never make it to harvest and

255
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,320
those buds will never be sold to

256
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,680
customers or patients but I'm sure that

257
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,000
there was medicine or product that did

258
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,958
make it out of the door and has been

259
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,519
treated with Eagle 20 or whatever else

260
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,518
they were listing here that we

261
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,278
definitely should not be consuming if

262
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,959
this were to happen to if these were

263
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:19,278
tomatoes and they discovered that these

264
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,719
people had been spraying tomatoes with

265
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:24,399
these products the Tomato farmer or

266
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,680
distributor or whoever's in charge at

267
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,320
that point would have to go make some

268
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,039
sort of a press release and apologize

269
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,360
they have to be held accountable

270
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:33,078
this would have been a much larger deal

271
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,959
if this would have been another

272
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,399
Agricultural Product or a Horticultural

273
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,759
product and what's ridiculous is the

274
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,440
Cannabis industry makes so much money

275
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,200
that they should have been kind of on

276
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,399
top of this and been doing the right

277
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,800
thing anyway like we're getting legal

278
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,200
cannabis here and then we're trying to

279
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,519
set the pace here and then they're going

280
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,120
to go and do [ __ ] like this which really

281
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,600
puts I don't know kind of a black eye on

282
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,679
the legal cannabis industry I don't know

283
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,079
I think that the people that were

284
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,559
leading the industry should have been

285
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:03,239
more responsible with our industry all

286
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,518
right so I can't say to not shop at

287
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,440
those stores or anything like that do

288
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,679
what you want to do but I would

289
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,640
definitely pay more attention to where

290
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,278
my medicine is coming from and I would

291
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,480
pay more attention to what's going in my

292
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:14,078
medicine all the more reason you guys to

293
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,839
grow your own cannabis that's my

294
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,919
solution that's what I think all right

295
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,440
I've got a couple of more notes what

296
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,319
else did I want to get on to actually

297
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,360
we're going to let's just get right to

298
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,480
it I want to talk about growroom

299
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,120
scheduling you guys uh we're 10 minutes

300
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,120
into the show already and I have got a

301
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,039
lot of notes here so this is probably

302
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,639
going to end up taking us a couple of

303
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:37,039
episodes here honestly so we're going to

304
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,958
get through the veg process today and

305
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:42,759
then the next lesson will be uh planning

306
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:45,359
your flowering Cycles so I wrote a whole

307
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,078
bunch of stuff and honestly it took me a

308
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,200
little bit to get this together because

309
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:50,679
uh and I'm going to apologize right now

310
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,519
I know that the last few episodes have

311
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:54,519
been a little wonky I seriously had a

312
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,360
major concussion and I can't focus to

313
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,959
write long uh long things like I used to

314
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,278
Long lessons and [ __ ] it's coming back

315
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,239
to me slowly but it takes me a little

316
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,000
more effort and a lot more time to focus

317
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,480
and write down [ __ ] so please bear with

318
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
me but the lessons are coming back

319
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,399
things are getting better I know that

320
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,040
things have not been the way they should

321
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,200
be with the show but I have not been the

322
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,958
way I should be so I couldn't bring you

323
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,278
the show you needed I'm getting my [ __ ]

324
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,078
back together which means the show is

325
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:20,480
getting its [ __ ] back together too I

326
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,399
apologize for being kind of slacking off

327
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,959
but I didn't even know when you get a

328
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,519
head injury you don't know what the

329
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,838
hell's going on and it's crazy weird so

330
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,320
uh I'm getting back to it and the show's

331
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,560
getting back to it so let me prove that

332
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,760
to you here is what I have written and

333
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,159
uh I have got a lot here I think I'm

334
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,679
going to try to read it off the computer

335
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,120
because the phone screen is Tiny let's

336
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,838
pull up the same thing here on the phone

337
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,399
same thing on the computer does it match

338
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,680
no this one's not updated all right

339
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:49,440
we're just going to read it off the

340
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:51,599
phone it goes like this so an average

341
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,040
grow should take about 100 to 120 days

342
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,639
maybe 150 days total in the soil before

343
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:58,639
harvesting drying trimming and curing

344
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,120
our goal our goal is to provide our

345
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,919
plants with optimal conditions

346
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,480
appropriate feedings careful training

347
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,319
and selective pruning in order to

348
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,240
produce the finest medicine we can offer

349
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,920
to our patients or clients I think that

350
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,480
every day in each cycle is an

351
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,759
opportunity to show the plant some love

352
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,920
and help your crop reach its full

353
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,198
potential I feel like each feeding each

354
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,958
application of teas bug sprays folar

355
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,919
feeding and any interaction with your

356
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,879
plants is your chance to make sure your

357
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:25,159
crop reaches your client's expectations

358
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,958
and the plants full potential a great

359
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,838
way to improve your crops is to start a

360
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,359
solid growth schedule today I want to

361
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,160
talk about two different schedules a

362
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,480
grower should be on top of the first

363
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,039
schedule will be the basic planning of a

364
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,159
crop from seed to clone all the way up

365
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:40,240
to harvest time I want to discuss the

366
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,198
phases of growth from a small Clon or

367
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,120
seedling into vegetative growth into the

368
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,039
flowering phase I want to break down the

369
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,519
flowering phase into trimesters and talk

370
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,759
about what the plants are doing and what

371
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,440
they want through the flowering phase I

372
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,838
will also talk about what you could be

373
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,199
doing at each phase to improve your

374
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,120
Harvest um I wrote here that if I can

375
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:00,120
get you through 120-day grow lesson in

376
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,399
this episode I'll just start my I'll

377
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,919
start my discussion on planning a

378
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,600
schedule that keeps your grow space

379
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,000
producing as much herb as possible with

380
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,600
as little downtime as possible uh this

381
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,639
of course will take multiple lights in

382
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,480
at least two small grow spaces but

383
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,399
setting up a small Perpetual grow to

384
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,800
keep yourself supplied with head stash

385
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,120
is probably easier than you think I

386
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,559
realize now that I've written way too

387
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,078
much for one episode so this is

388
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,319
definitely going to be broken down you

389
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:24,799
guys so here's where we get into it

390
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,399
before you begin your grow I suggest

391
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,799
getting yourself a planner and making a

392
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,120
schedule in advance you can be flexible

393
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,039
uh because cuz these are plants but try

394
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,440
to stick with your plant if you can uh I

395
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:37,198
also suggest taking a lot of notes you

396
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,160
guys take a lot of notes don't wonder

397
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,198
what you did to that plant to make it so

398
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:45,399
special write down what you did so that

399
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:47,679
you know all right so uh here's where

400
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,440
I'll describe the uh phases of growth

401
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,838
and time frames of our plant I said that

402
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,399
this grow is going to take about 100 to

403
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,959
120 days if you want to go larger plant

404
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,919
you can go up to 150 I've seen people

405
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,719
take a lot longer that's the veg period

406
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,919
is what you're going to make your

407
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,440
difference there so we'll start off with

408
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:04,599
seedlings or clones right and that's

409
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,120
going to take about 14 days to be in the

410
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,480
seedling phase I think about 14 days

411
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,720
when you start germinating it from the

412
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,278
day you germinate it uh till the day

413
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,440
it's like a little plant it's about 14

414
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:16,439
days we're going to call that 14 days a

415
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,320
clone takes about 14 days to root and

416
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,320
get ready to be a plant so I'm going to

417
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,959
say seeding and clone phase is about 14

418
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,040
days the veg growth depends on your goal

419
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,000
you guys if you want to veg if you're

420
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,639
going in small pots you can veg for two

421
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,360
weeks if you're going to go into larger

422
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,240
pots you you can veg I've seen people

423
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,959
veg for 30 45 days I've also seen guys

424
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,320
veg for 60 days some of the outdoor

425
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,638
plants that people veg for the the early

426
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,560
start of the year before the outdoor

427
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,360
season I've seen people veg plants for

428
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:45,439
four or five or six months to put them

429
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,560
outside so what's going to happen is

430
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,920
your plants are going to get bigger and

431
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,319
bigger and bigger the longer you veg so

432
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,639
we're just going to go for a short veg

433
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,360
in this one so your flowering phase I'm

434
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,159
going to go for a 9we flowering phase

435
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,879
most of the plants I work with are about

436
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:01,719
9 to 10 weeks uh n weeks is a good

437
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,600
number because that gives us three

438
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,480
trimesters of three weeks each to talk

439
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,839
about I can talk about my theory of the

440
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,759
trimesters on the

441
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,240
plants um so yeah that that'll help us

442
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,360
out so we got 14 days in seedling 63

443
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,560
days in flowering you're looking at 77

444
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,639
days there that gives us about 30 days

445
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:22,758
to veg and fix any problems so uh let's

446
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,879
just basically start a short grow from

447
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,839
Cedar clone uh this is kind of the the

448
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,720
grow I'm going to talk about now is

449
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,680
basically the type I would of grow I

450
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,440
would do if I were searching through a

451
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,958
10 pack of seeds to find the keepers in

452
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,079
the pack so for this I would usually use

453
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,838
like a three gallon pot or a 5 gallon

454
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:42,599
pot and I would use I don't know

455
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,959
probably like between nine and 16 just

456
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,278
depends on how small I'm going to keep

457
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,838
the plants and how tight I want to cramp

458
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,318
them in the space under the light this

459
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,199
just one light is all I'm talking about

460
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:52,559
right now so if we start from seeds or

461
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,159
clones the only difference will be the

462
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,799
first two weeks really once the Clones

463
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,039
root and the seedlings take off

464
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,159
everything I'm talking about is going to

465
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,559
work the same for seeds and clones if

466
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,318
you're working with seeds you'll have to

467
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,679
be sure that you eliminate the males

468
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:05,679
before we get too far into flour but

469
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,958
that's going to be your major

470
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,318
difference um so let's start with this

471
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,838
we'll say this is like if we're starting

472
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,759
day one we'll say start day one right

473
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,800
now so today would we we would cut our

474
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,680
clones and start uh germinating our

475
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,278
seeds I'm not going to do any lessons on

476
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:19,599
germinating seeds or cutting clones

477
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,879
because I'm pretty sure I've covered

478
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,800
that in past episodes uh if you need to

479
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,759
refresher course uh go back and listen

480
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,799
to those or if you guys want a brand new

481
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,000
episode on that email me and I will go

482
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,758
back and listen to the old episode and

483
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,879
I'll try to do an update for you but

484
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,959
only if enough people ask for it that

485
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,198
episode's out there so it should work uh

486
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,119
so we cut our clones and we started our

487
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:39,838
seeds for day one uh this is where you

488
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,318
want to Mark the date get out your grow

489
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,639
calendar and Mark it today is day one uh

490
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:45,360
for clothes and seeds I recommend a

491
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,120
24-hour light cycle you guys to start

492
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,759
the first couple of weeks uh the first

493
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,639
few days are just a waiting game pretty

494
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,680
much if you're waiting for seeds they'll

495
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,759
pop up they'll pop up from whatever

496
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,359
medium you've put them in in like 48

497
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,639
Hours hopefully or maybe it'll take him

498
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,639
a couple days to start growing to the

499
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:02,480
light I suggest putting your seedlings

500
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,120
into I use beer cups like Solo

501
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,240
cups uh put those put your seedlings

502
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,479
into the cups with a light potting mixes

503
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,519
with plenty of drainage and holes in the

504
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,400
bottoms of the cups of course uh once

505
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:13,720
your seedlings have developed a nice tap

506
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,319
route of like about an inch to three

507
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,078
inches long that's when you want to

508
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:19,558
throw those in your dirt so clones will

509
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,838
be lazy but they'll root around 10 to 14

510
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,199
days some of you guys are going to take

511
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:23,838
a little longer to get your clones to

512
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,600
root uh it's all about a healthy mother

513
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,318
plant a good rooting environment uh be

514
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,798
patient and if it takes you more time to

515
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,399
get your clones rooted just plan that

516
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,119
into your next run give yourself an

517
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,280
extra week or an extra 5 days whatever

518
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,519
it takes and then you'll start learning

519
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,558
how to keep healthy your mother plants

520
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:39,079
you'll start learning how to clone

521
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,240
better and you'll speed up your cloning

522
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:42,399
time it'll get better uh take a lot of

523
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,519
extra clones at first because they're

524
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,480
going to die if you're not good at

525
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,079
cloning if you're new at this take

526
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,440
extras CU you will lose some and don't

527
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,639
be sad about it uh so after several days

528
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,000
let's see where was I the seedings

529
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,000
ceilings are going to start growing tall

530
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,240
and skinny in the first few days after

531
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,839
several days they'll develop their first

532
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,558
true leaves by this time the Clones are

533
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:01,918
rooted and ready for cups and the

534
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,158
seedings will be small plants and

535
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,000
catching up to the clones so I wouldn't

536
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,799
feed the seedings until about 7 to 10

537
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,640
days in and when you do feed them focus

538
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:12,119
on root inoculant and building a good

539
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,400
root base for the plants uh I like a

540
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,399
worm casting tea or something like that

541
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,480
maybe something like great white uh you

542
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,320
can use ogt uh something something that

543
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,798
focuses on rude inoculant you want uh

544
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,639
trichoderma uh yeah you guys hopefully

545
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,480
you've caught on to what I'm talking

546
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,880
about by now we've talked a lot about

547
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,079
root inoculant with sha so I would feed

548
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,240
the Clones the same thing when you put

549
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,240
those into cups uh I definitely like to

550
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,558
feed my clones and my seedlings a lot of

551
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,079
rote inoculants to get that soil uh

552
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,519
funky and get the roots fat fat uh the

553
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,639
better Roots the better the fruits is

554
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,879
what I say all the time so by now I feel

555
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,520
like we should be putting our clones

556
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,960
into cups and starting week three if

557
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,119
everything went correctly uh we fed the

558
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,440
plants once uh this makes me feel like

559
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,719
everything is one lesson now now that

560
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,080
we've gotten to week three and the

561
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,240
clones and the ceilings are caught up I

562
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,199
feel like there won't be much difference

563
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,839
between the clone the seedling clone and

564
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,440
the seedling that was hard to say uh the

565
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,000
seedlings May grow more quickly because

566
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,400
they have what we call seed Vigor but

567
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,159
that's not always the case if you have

568
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,519
good clones um I've seen some clones out

569
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,840
grow seedlings before and it's been kind

570
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,038
of surprising so all we've done up to

571
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:16,158
this point is pretty much plant our

572
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:18,240
seeds and clones uh we've gotten our

573
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,640
starter plants into cups and we've fed

574
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,679
them some worm tea or some rude

575
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,120
inoculant maybe some great white maybe

576
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,960
some ogt uh something like that to get

577
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,319
them started um and now I'm going to

578
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,440
call this the beginning of veg some

579
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,960
people may may call it preeg because we

580
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,519
haven't gone into our big pots yet but

581
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960
I'm going to call it veg starting now

582
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,359
now that we've gotten out of the cloner

583
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,159
now that we're not little baby seedlings

584
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:42,879
anymore I'm going to say we're into veg

585
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,200
so the veg State can last as long as you

586
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,600
want uh the longer you veg like I said

587
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,679
earlier the larger your plants are going

588
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:52,158
to get uh the veg phase is where we do

589
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,400
90% of the topping training and pruning

590
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,880
of your plants uh we kind of did a

591
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,080
lesson on topping and stuff like that

592
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,919
but I plan to do another episode uh all

593
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,879
about improving your crops and improving

594
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,919
your improving your yields and things so

595
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,799
that'll come in handy um also your

596
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,120
plants are going to take up 90% of the

597
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:10,400
nitrogen that they use through their

598
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:12,479
entire lives during the veget vegetative

599
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,919
phase of their plants uh people tend to

600
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,599
really Overlook the veg phase and they

601
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,280
focus only on the bloom phase because

602
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,558
that's when you can see your buds but uh

603
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,240
the veg phase is just as important and

604
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:23,798
so is your veg space you guys a lot of

605
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,279
people don't spend the time building a

606
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:28,240
proper veg room and uh it really would

607
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,480
help you out if you if you teach those

608
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,279
kids how to run before you put them on

609
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,599
the track they'd be a lot better

610
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,798
performing kid so I feel like if we use

611
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,240
each day as a chance to prepare the

612
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:40,400
plants for Bloom our crop will look much

613
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,839
better at Harvest Time uh my veg phas

614
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,440
for my example of this grow is going to

615
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,399
be short you guys gosh give me one

616
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,640
second I'm going to press pause and take

617
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,640
a drink I'll probably take a dab while

618
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,880
I'm there excuse me for one second all

619
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,320
right guys I feel like we are at the

620
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,200
beginning of veg is where I left off so

621
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,720
I like to feed my plants uh the first

622
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,840
day of each week Mondays are usually my

623
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,279
feeding day for my personal crops for me

624
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,158
starting everything on on a Monday helps

625
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,960
me keep track of everything so on the

626
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,840
first day of EG I would feed my plants a

627
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,558
nice base nutrient a light humic acid uh

628
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:10,839
some potassium silicates to build strong

629
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,119
cell walls and I would also keep

630
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:14,678
focusing on root development we

631
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,278
shouldn't need any CAG or anything like

632
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,080
that for the first couple of weeks

633
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:19,200
everything should be cool so for the

634
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,678
first couple of weeks your plant should

635
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
be cool in the cups but we're going to

636
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,640
have to plant them into larger pots

637
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
pretty soon uh you don't want to see

638
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,559
them get root Bound in those cups and

639
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,120
they'll also get tall and skinny we want

640
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,519
them to Bush out a little bit so when we

641
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,519
put them into a larger pot they'll start

642
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,200
bushing out so it's also a good time to

643
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,720
adjust your lights uh from 24 hours to

644
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,759
an 186 uh schedule you want them on for

645
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,200
18 hours off for six uh plants like a

646
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,640
rest period and it's also going to save

647
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,360
you money on your energy bill so now

648
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,360
you've got your plants into cups they're

649
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,558
nice and healthy uh they're starting to

650
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,959
kind of grow a little bit they've got

651
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,480
nice Roots we're about 3 weeks in I

652
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,919
think uh by the fourth week is when we

653
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,400
should start putting everything into

654
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,679
larger pots uh if we leave them in the

655
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,159
cups too long they're going to get root

656
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,440
they're going to start getting stretchy

657
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,278
and also when you put them in bigger

658
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,720
pots they can go a little bit longer

659
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:06,359
without needing water so that'll help

660
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,798
you out too so if you're going to veg

661
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,639
for a couple extra weeks and you have

662
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:11,720
time for time and space go for bigger

663
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,240
pots uh for my example we're just going

664
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,839
to do a quick crop and we're going to

665
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,798
use three gallon pots and they'll be

666
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:19,759
just fine um so carefully put everything

667
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:20,879
from your cups into a three gallon pot

668
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,000
or a larger pot whichever you're going

669
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,200
to use um and I think I've talked about

670
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,519
transplanting I think I've talked a

671
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,960
little bit about doing that so if you

672
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,119
guys need help transplanting let me know

673
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,159
and I'll talk more about that but I'm

674
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,038
pretty sure I've covered it so carefully

675
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,679
put everything into a larger pot and

676
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:37,440
feed them um we should be about week

677
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,278
four maybe into week five by now you

678
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,720
guys I hope you started doing these into

679
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:43,400
into pots around week four I hope you

680
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,200
didn't wait too long so feed them and

681
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,960
you're going to feed them a strong dose

682
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,759
of rud inoculant of course we're always

683
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,519
going to do that through veg right up to

684
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,079
uh kind of the start of flour feed them

685
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:54,960
a veg based nutrient I use uh if I'm

686
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:57,599
using bottled nutrients for this I would

687
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,360
recommend Botanicare pure blend Pro soil

688
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,399
formula the grow formula uh they don't

689
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:04,839
pay me to say that it's just what I use

690
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,038
uh I would use some humic acid in there

691
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,519
uh for this grow for my recommendation

692
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,679
if you're using bottles I would say

693
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:13,158
liquid karma from Botanicare I would use

694
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,120
a fulvic acid which uh organicare sells

695
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,760
a liquid fulvic acid that works great

696
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,038
for this um I would use some Cal magag

697
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,720
at this point you guys you're going to

698
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,400
start needing some calag in there a very

699
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,159
light dose of Cal Mag to start because

700
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,519
your babies um aren't ready for it just

701
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,400
yet possibly and I don't want you to

702
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,480
burn them so be careful with that cow

703
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,880
mag but it's about to be time I would

704
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,079
also recommend something to feed the

705
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,880
microbes uh basic molasses or something

706
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,839
like Humbolt honey or something like

707
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,240
that uh hybri would be good uh anything

708
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:45,439
like that with a lot of uh molassy type

709
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,759
stuff there so uh now our plants are in

710
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,600
their final pots they've been fed these

711
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,400
plants can be topped or super cropped or

712
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,278
manipulated into a screen of green or

713
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,559
whatever you have planned for them uh

714
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,159
just make sure that if you're going to

715
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,278
do any topping or pruning uh do that

716
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,278
about 10 10 to 14 days before you start

717
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,960
flowering the plants your plants need a

718
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,119
little bit of time to recover after

719
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,919
you've topped them uh plants are apical

720
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,439
dominant which means they want to top so

721
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,759
after you've cut the tops the hormones

722
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,960
have to move around it's got to move

723
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:13,278
hormones around and you want those

724
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,240
hormones built up in the tips of your

725
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,038
plants before you flower them it's

726
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,599
really helpful for your plants if you

727
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,679
start topping stuff and pruning things

728
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,918
and then flower right away you're just

729
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,400
going to make little tiny Buds and

730
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,880
confuse the [ __ ] out of your plant

731
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,440
you'll be disappointed so now that we

732
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,760
are in our bigger pots and we fed

733
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,880
everything I'm going to say we are in

734
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,119
full veg mode uh we have our plants in

735
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,600
the finishing pots things have been

736
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,959
topped and super cropped we've got our

737
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,119
lights on a veg schedule of 18 on and 6

738
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,360
hours off we should be feeding a solid

739
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:42,119
veg recipe at the start of every week

740
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,158
and watching for any signs of bug

741
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:46,479
problems um it'd be a good idea to start

742
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,799
a bug prevention regimen by now if you

743
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,919
haven't already started spraying or

744
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:51,960
doing something to keep the mites away

745
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,600
uh NE oil is a great way to prevent bugs

746
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,240
while you're in veg but do not ever

747
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:59,038
spray a flowering plant with neem oil uh

748
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,839
one application of NE on a flowering

749
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,079
plant will ruin the entire thing the

750
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,398
flavor will be miserable if you make

751
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:07,199
extracts they will taste like neem oil

752
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:09,000
uh just please don't do that you guys

753
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,440
don't spray anything on your flowering

754
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,640
plants uh any bug sprays or anything on

755
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,798
your flowering plants if you're going to

756
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,960
spray stuff on flowering plants make

757
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:21,960
sure it's a well well thought out fol

758
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,480
your feed please uh so um yeah I think I

759
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,558
can hold write a whole separate rant on

760
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,240
Pest Management in another episode so I

761
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:28,720
said that we should feed on Monday of

762
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,480
every week right that's my opinion I

763
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,720
like to feed on Monday I mix up

764
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,960
nutrients uh I mix up a nice reservoir

765
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,679
of nutrients and feed the plants uh

766
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,960
every Monday they get a nice healthy

767
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,038
feed and then usually by Wednesday or

768
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,519
Thursday they need more uh they need a

769
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,839
water so I'll just feed them clean ph

770
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,599
balanced water with no nutrients in it

771
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,639
I'll just feed them that and then on

772
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,759
Monday again I will give them nutrients

773
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,640
and then the next time that they're

774
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,278
thirsty probably that next Wednesday or

775
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,840
Thursday they will get a fully organic

776
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:00,919
worm tea that I have brewed for like 36

777
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,038
hours I'll put worm castings in there

778
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,278
I'll put grok Kashi in there I put a

779
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,798
little bit of uh dragonfly Earth

780
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,519
medicine the Lush roots in there put a

781
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:12,759
little bit of fish hydr slate I put some

782
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,839
sea crop um and then I'll feed my plants

783
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,240
that and they get fed teas probably

784
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,839
twice in veg and probably three times

785
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,278
during the flower phase and I think it

786
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:22,798
makes a huge difference because I make a

787
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,798
a pretty awesome tea that Sean taught me

788
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,558
how to make I really think it makes a

789
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,879
difference so that's kind of my feeding

790
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,278
idea I don't think I've ever broken down

791
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,919
my week to week feeding schedule I don't

792
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,398
want to be responsible for your weekly

793
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,880
feeding I kind of want to let you

794
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:37,319
experiment and find what works for you

795
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,679
but if you've got questions about

796
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:41,519
specific nutrients uh let me know and

797
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,360
I'll do my best to figure out how to

798
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,960
incorporate that into your growth for

799
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,319
you that's going to take a lot of work

800
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,798
so like I was saying earlier we can veg

801
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:51,079
as long as we want for my example we're

802
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,558
going to veg for about 30 days you can

803
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,319
top and manipulate the plants as much as

804
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,038
you want while in veg did I already read

805
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,678
this no but I would stop talking about I

806
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,480
would stop talking topping about two

807
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,960
weeks before flowering my short crops

808
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,399
don't really get much uh topping and

809
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,399
pruning you guys if I'm running a seed

810
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:07,359
crop and I want to see what the

811
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:08,879
seedlings are I really don't uh top much

812
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,079
I take two clones from each plant just

813
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,278
before I flow it I clean up the bottoms

814
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,199
just a little bit uh and then once I

815
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,720
flow or I clean up the bottoms once I

816
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,558
flower but my small crops really don't

817
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,558
get much topping or pruning I try to let

818
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,879
the get the test crops just in and out

819
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,359
quickly so I can see what I'm working

820
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,880
with cuz if I've got a bunch of boys in

821
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,398
there or if I don't see the traits I'm

822
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,679
looking for then I just want to get that

823
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:30,278
out of there and scrap it as soon as

824
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,080
possible I'm looking for specific traits

825
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:35,640
at this point so uh for the next 30 days

826
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,000
while we're in veg basically we need to

827
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,880
watch for bugs watch for problems and

828
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,398
keep the plants as healthy and happy as

829
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,039
possible so I suggest checking each

830
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,479
plant every single day I know that

831
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,359
sounds ridiculous but however many

832
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,159
plants you've got you should be in there

833
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:51,359
you should touch every plant every

834
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,840
single day that's how you know you're

835
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,879
growing from your heart that's how you

836
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:57,038
know you've got solid medicine that

837
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,640
doesn't need to be sprayed with Eagle 20

838
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:59,798
that's how you know that if you do see a

839
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,440
problem you'll be on top of it and

840
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:03,278
you'll be able to cure it you'll be able

841
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,399
to solve the problem before it gets out

842
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,000
of control that's super important being

843
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:10,678
a good Gardener so I suggest checking

844
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,319
each day and make notes of what you see

845
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,240
uh if you see anything that stands out

846
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,639
to you make a note of it if it's good if

847
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,000
it's bad if it's weird if you're not

848
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:22,320
sure if it's new if it's questionable

849
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,679
make a note and don't forget because I

850
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,398
know you're going to say I'll membership

851
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,640
the notes are in my head dude we're

852
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:29,000
potheads we're pot growers we're dabbers

853
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,200
you're going to forget you're going to

854
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,159
forget something write it down and when

855
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,600
maybe one day you're going to want to

856
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:36,360
run a business and the guy with the

857
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:37,519
notes will get the opportunity to run a

858
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:39,119
business over the guy with a head full

859
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,399
of [ __ ] and ideas you've written

860
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,599
something down that shows you've done

861
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:43,879
something the other guy's like I

862
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,439
remember doing this the people that are

863
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,880
hiring you to be their Master gr at

864
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,120
their dispensary don't want your hopes

865
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,840
and dreams in your head they want to see

866
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,639
it on paper if you take notes you got

867
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,959
something that's documented and now that

868
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,399
it's legal you don't have to worry about

869
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,159
it I understand you old school Growers

870
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,639
didn't want any notes I get it but now

871
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,080
you can so uh so set a date for your

872
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,000
flowering cycle is what I think you

873
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,599
should do uh decide how long you want a

874
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,079
veg set a date for your flowering cycle

875
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:09,278
and then commit to that and veg for that

876
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,519
long get your plants trimmed up get them

877
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,038
pruned get them topped if you're going

878
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,759
to put them in a screen of green like

879
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:16,119
Spence taught us about put them in the

880
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,599
screen of green and get them nice and

881
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:18,879
happy and then we'll get them ready for

882
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,879
the flowering

883
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,480
cycle uh I've gone for 30 minutes and I

884
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,559
don't think I can get enough of the

885
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,679
flowering cycle to make it worth your

886
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,158
listen in to this episode so I think

887
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,720
we're just going to start wrapping up

888
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:34,640
the show at 30 minutes you guys really

889
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,159

890

891
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,360
attention deficit disorder so we're just

892

911
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,120
like to say him about I kept saying as

912
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,839
was 90% dude I'm about 85% back I keep

913
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:20,599
noticing um sometimes I'll say the wrong

914
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,199
word in a sentence the other day I told

915
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:25,240
somebody that I was going to um eat this

916
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,720
banana and I was actually holding a

917
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,278
burrito and I didn't even realize that I

918
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,038
I kept saying banana but it was a

919
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,519
burrito and they corrected me and I said

920
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,558
yeah this banana is tasty and they're

921
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:37,440
like it's a [ __ ] burrito dude so I

922
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:40,119
realized I was doing that um I was

923
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,080
describing something that was uh purple

924
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:45,239
and I called it orange and I know I did

925
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,359
that but I don't uh yeah so there's

926
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,278
stuff like that that's going on in my

927
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:49,599
head that's still a little bit Goofy and

928
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:51,519
