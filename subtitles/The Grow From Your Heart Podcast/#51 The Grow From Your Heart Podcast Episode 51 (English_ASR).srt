comedy store in Los Angeles where most

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,120
of our favorite comedians seem to have

173
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,918
gotten their start at least at least

174
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,360
went through there for a time yeah I I

175
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,240
really enjoyed his comedy last night man

176
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,038
he tore it up so I have never seen or

177
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,680
paid attention to Steve Simone on the

178
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,879
way up Clint told me that Steve Simone

179
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,000
was the opening act dude Steve Simone

180
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,800
was amazingly funny he's a mostly clean

181
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,439
comic he didn't I don't think he ever

182
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,280
said [ __ ] he might have but I mean it

183
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,439
was in passing I think it was something

184
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:15,638
where it was it was so fun he just he's

185
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,399
a ball of energy and he's still in sixth

186
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,000
or fifth grade yeah you know what I mean

187
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,159
he pulls on his shirt he's a 35-year-old

188
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,879
sixth grader yeah it's great it's kind

189
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,039
of cute it's adorable as a girl man

190
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,159
watching him wiggle around all

191
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,639
uncomfortable but comfortable you know

192
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,240
like like he's got all that attention

193
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,879
that he wanted but now he's like no [ __ ]

194
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,038
I've got the attention and he starts

195
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,079
wiggling but he tore it up he crushed it

196
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,399
was real fun and then uh shout out to

197
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,598
Chris sharpener for uh hosting that show

198
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,478
too that was great he was hilarious yeah

199
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:44,000
uh I like that the openers get that

200
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,959
short little set because then they just

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,839
do that highlight set and they get out

202
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,879
of there I think that's kind of smooth

203
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,719
it's a good show yourself offce uh and

204

00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,799
going to try not to talk too much about

00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,000
respectful about this conversation but

416
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,278
it's your health that I'm talking about

417
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
and it's your private [ __ ] so interrupt

418
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,480
me whenever you feel necessary and chime

419
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,159
in when you want um Angela used to dab

420
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,959
with me like a [ __ ] Champion dude

421
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,278
Angela used to smoke fat joints she

422
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,078
would roll joints the size of my middle

423
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:03,600
finger and I've got a big middle finger

424
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,078
and her and I would smoke them just to

425
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,440
the Dome and then she'd roll another one

426
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,039
and smoke we'd smoke half of that and

427
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,240
then put it out and smoke it

428
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:14,559
later so she was a heavy smoker um one

429
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,759
day she had a mean headache and somebody

430
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,039
did the hippie pressure point where they

431
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,440
squeeze between your forefinger and your

432
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,639
thumb there's a little spot in there

433
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,880
that all your old hippie friends will

434
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,320
tell you if you squeeze that and rub

435
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,759
that a little bit your headache will go

436
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,120
away so one of our silly hippie friends

437
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,199
did that and she completely blacked

438
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,240
acted out uh eyes did a little

439
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,838
fluttering and she hit the floor and

440
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,079
when she came to she was really

441
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:40,079
disoriented and kind of groggy and it's

442
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,519
been labeled a seizure is what everybody

443
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:45,319
any medical person has called it and so

444
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,440
she went home uh she got home from work

445
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,600
and what's the first thing you want to

446
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,000
do after that you want to go [ __ ]

447
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,839
smoke a joint after you just had some

448
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,159
traumatic [ __ ] like that happen to you

449
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,920
and she tried that and uh she told me

450
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,679
that she felt like she was tripping

451
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,439
she's like I'm hallucinating I'm seeing

452
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,359
[ __ ] and she put a blanket over over her

453
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,279
head and laid down on the couch in the

454
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,039
fetal position and wouldn't talk to me

455
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,399
for like an hour yeah she was hating

456
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,919
life and this is the girl that I've seen

457
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,000
take half gr dabs and laugh at me she

458
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,479
used to make fun of Adam we would smoke

459
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,720
and Adam would tap out and want to go

460
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,959
home and she'd be like come on [ __ ]

461
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,320
smoke a joint I smoked like two grams of

462
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,278
wax to myself a day around about I'm

463
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,480

464
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:23,679
little closer there you go you're great

465
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,959
I'm sming you a little louder so we can

466
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,239
hear you she said that she used to smoke

467
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,039
two grams of wax a day by herself and

468
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,399
her and I hanging out together we'd kill

469
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,799
ate the hash in a day just on a normal

470
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,720
day just her and I smoking yeah yeah so

471
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,799
she went home and smoked one joint or

472
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,480
one dab or whatever and was freaking out

473
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,958
and she thought maybe it's just today

474
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,920
you know she gave it some time and went

475
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,838
about her life but she still had a

476
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:46,639
headache and didn't feel right and so

477
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,720
she smoked more weed and every time she

478
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,079
would smoke weed she would just get

479
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,800
ridiculously high it was like hanging

480
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,078
out with a high fifth grader you're like

481
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,039
you got to tuck her in and get her

482
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,359
something to eat and I'm not talking

483
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,278
[ __ ] like it's really what was happening

484
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,759
to her she went from a pro to Clint yeah

485
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:01,439
just we had to babysitter when she would

486
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,639
get high and she'd get super anxious a

487
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,160
lot of anxiety from smoking weed so we

488
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,120
found a few strains that would work

489
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,480
better the Platinum OG was working well

490
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,879
and the Girl Scout cookies was getting

491
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,360
her too high but it was the kind of a

492
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,519
more comfortable high for her it seemed

493
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,800
like so she didn't feel really it was

494
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,198
it's been about a month and she really

495
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:20,000
did not feel good a few days ago it's

496
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,159
been about a week right yeah and she

497
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,360
felt like [ __ ] this only happened a week

498
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,278
ago oh no uh the part I'm getting into

499
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,240
now that this that was probably a month

500
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,919
or two ago when the seizure incident

501
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,879
happened and the longer than that it's

502
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,679
been like 3 months now and I only know

503
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,120
because I like really want to get high

504
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:39,679
like I used to yeah yeah like I do it's

505
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,639
affecting her it's kind of it's

506
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,758
affecting her a lot like even when I'm

507
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:48,079
uh not smoking my anxiety is just super

508
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,199
shitty yeah and not being able to SM she

509
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,919
obviously you kind of Jones for some

510
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:53,159
smoke because it's ritualistic it's not

511
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,639
just wanting to get high her and I used

512
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,078
to pass a joint back and forth and lay

513
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,919
around and smoke a joint together it was

514
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,519
like it just feel good feels good to get

515
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,838
stone and smoke

516
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,240
and like it being sick and not being

517
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,759
able to smoke the medicine that she

518
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,439
relied on it's driving her crazy I can

519
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,640
[ __ ] see it it's making her kind of

520
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,079
Grouchy so we go we call my friend Joey

521

532
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,000

534

538
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,759
we got to the car I'm trying to be

539
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,160
discreet here but we got to the [ __ ]

540
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,000
car and she wasn't going to wait she

541
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,038
rolled up a joint and she started

542
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,519
smoking it and she got about halfway

543
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,519
through the joint and I looked over like

544
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:57,839
you're smoking like a lot of weed over

545
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,720
there for someone that has panic attacks

546
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,558
for smoking weed and she looked at me

547
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,960
and she goes I am high and smiled about

548
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:09,519
it and I was like oh oh [ __ ] okay and

549
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,679
it's working yeah it was definitely so

550
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,119
for myself I've smoked a lot of CBD

551
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,080
cannabis and I've written it off because

552
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,678
it didn't seem to really do anything for

553
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:19,399
me it didn't do I want to get high when

554
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,159
I smoke pot I want to feel that psych

555
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,038
that psychedelic it's slightly I don't

556
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:23,480
even know what to call it that head

557
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:25,400
change I want to be [ __ ] high I want

558
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,400
to get high when I smoke weed and CBD

559
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,880
doesn't do that so I've written it off

560
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,798
if they're like this is a high CBD KNE

561
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,280
strain I'm like well I'm not going to

562
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:33,038
smoke it I'll let you smoke it cuz you

563
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,519
have pain enjoy it cuz I'm just wasting

564
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:38,158
that dab or that joint mhm and so I know

565
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,240
it's helpful for patients but watching

566
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,120
her it changed our entire day just she

567
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,440
smoked that joint and half of another

568
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,678
one and then I smoked half of one with

569
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,519
her and uh I had taken a couple dabs we

570
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,840
stopped to smoke on the drive and I we

571
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,639
pulled over and got out and did a little

572
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,519
hike and [ __ ] and I took a couple dabs

573
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,679
but then after I smoked that joint it

574
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,200
felt like my dab high was kind of

575
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,759
diminished it was like n you're not as

576
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,840
high as you used to be and I was like

577
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,839
why am I getting mellow but it made me

578
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:08,038
higher for a really long time and we got

579
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,439
giggly we both got kind of and I don't

580
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,319
get giggly from smoking weed but uh

581
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,038
smoking that joint of CBD after a couple

582
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,879
of dabs changed uh dabs don't give me an

583
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:17,960
ey high when I I miss when I smoked weed

584
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,679
back in the day my eyes would get all

585
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,919
droopy and I'd be like damn I'm stoned

586
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,400
dabs don't do that to me but the CBD

587
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,080
weed totally put that back it did that

588
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,600
so I think I'm missing something when

589
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,119
I'm dabbing I think I need to smoke more

590
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,480
flowers and I think I ALS also need to

591
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,798
incorporate more

592
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,000
CBD excuse me I'm getting clogged up

593
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:38,679
yeah do you feel like uh CBD is like a

594
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,480
like a not not to call marijuana like a

595
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,759
a hard drug or anything but do you feel

596
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,159
like CBD is a drug unto itself like THC

597
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,839
is a drug and then C CBD is a drug um

598
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,840
like you you like when you get your

599
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,959
tolerance going for THC maybe that's not

600
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:54,639
the same tolerance you would have for

601
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,519
CBD right it's a different compound yeah

602
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,880
so it's affecting a CBD receptor instead

603
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,599
of a THC receptor which is also a canab

604
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,960
receptor but it's going to affect you

605
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,639
differently yeah well that sounds like

606
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,240
something that that people should be

607
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,520
aware of like no it's not just marijuana

608
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,640
it's like no you need to kind of know

609
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,440
what's in that like or what style it is

610
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,080
completely because now we're going to

611
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,519
focus on finding her a lot of CBD

612
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,798

the last like 3 months have been for

700
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,359
sure um I'm pretty sure if I smoked this

701
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:14,359
before work that I would have felt

702
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,959
better then that you wouldn't have I did

703
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,558

704
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,919
through yeah pretty much okay so why

705
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,558

708
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,440
hippie [ __ ] hand technique and he's

709
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:30,918
kind of sympathetic still so you should

710
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,120
play that card whenever you can yeah

711
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,720
I'll be like you're the one who did it

hippie magic damn Vulcan hand

714
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,679
grip that's basically what it is I'm

715
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,599
going to take a dab while you want to

716
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,440

721
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,440
what I'm just it's a Saturday night and

722
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,240
there's a UFC fight and there will be

723
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,960

724
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,159
yeah so I'm just going to chill out hang

725
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,400
out with the listeners maybe you guys

726
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,278
are smoking maybe you're not um I think

727
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,360
that's the best part about this uh

728
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,119
podcast is it's just information you

729
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,278
know and they Jeff's doing a good job of

730
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:15,119
trying to make it uh fun and educational

731
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:17,159
I know you're making it educational um

732
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,759
finding that borderline that's that's

733
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,840
the tough part is because you guys can

734
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,000
ramble on about a lot of stuff but

735
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,720
that's like you said earlier is maybe

736
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm the guy that because I don't know a

737
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,600
lot about this stuff even the questions

738
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,798
between uh CBD and THC like I just don't

739
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,519
know yeah I guess I should talk more

740
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,519
about CBD um I don't have a book or I'm

741
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,558
not even going to pull up a website I'm

742
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:39,278
just going to kind of spat out of my

743
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:42,918
head uh CBD is a cannabinoid I think

744
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:45,240
it's pronounced canabidol um it works

745
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,960
more as an analgesic and

746
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,519
anti-inflammatory it's known to have

747
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,038
antibacterial properties it's really

748
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,000
well known for and this is a good segue

749
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:56,640
it's really well known for stopping

750
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,720
people who have Tremors and seizure type

751
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,159
disorders or conditions I won't even

752
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,399
call it a disorder that's a condition

753
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,799
calling it a disorder makes it sound

754
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:04,719
like you're [ __ ] condemned or

755
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:07,759
something yeah uh this people with

756
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,240
seizure conditions so I was telling a

757
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,319
random story that I will tell on this

758
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,759
show in a second I was telling a story

759
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:15,519
to a friend who is a paramedic and she

760
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:19,278
said that

761
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:22,639
CBD stops an electrical firing in your

762
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:25,278
brain that causes seizures so that is

763
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,759
awesome yeah and so it that's going to

764
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,319
be really helpful for anybody with

765
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,079
seizures uh CBD definitely makes me

766
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,278
hungry that's why I'm not smoking that

767
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:35,319
bowl it like my first or second hit off

768
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,599
of CBD my stomach

769
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,480
goes so if you got some cancer and

770
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,959
you're not eating from the chemotherapy

771
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,759
dude smoke some uh canonic that stuff

772
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,840
makes me starve like we went to lunch

773
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,919
and then smoked right after lunch and I

774
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,558
was like we got to go back in

775
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,320
there yeah when I'm full I'll get hungry

776
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,480
from smokeing the canonic yeah that

777
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:00,918
stuff just makes you want to eat um

778
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,200
made my I can play guitar longer I've

779
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:03,480
noticed that I got a new guitar for

780
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,360
Christmas and I've noticed if I play too

781
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,839
long my wrist and my forearm fingers

782
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,879
hurt I don't I can just keep going now

783
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,959
and I may just be building up endurance

784
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,559
but I don't feel any pain from it I

785
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,759
would cramp up after a while and now I'm

786
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:18,558
not so this CBD stuff is instead of like

787
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:20,960
the head high that I normally get where

788
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,918
I'm just flying through the cosmos now

789
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,720
it's more of a body high is that what

790
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,080
you're saying or you you would probably

791
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,759
experience a body high because you're

792
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:32,319
really uh low to to any canids but

793
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,038
people that have smoked a little bit it

794
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,798
just goes straight to pain I feel like

795
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,119
it knows where the pain is it's like oh

796
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:38,398
your arm hurts I'm going to drive right

797
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,199
up to your arm I'm going to park here

798
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:42,038
let out my little CBD paramedic so we're

799
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,240
going to work on your arm or your head

800
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:46,158
or your neck and shoulders cuz she's had

801
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,599
a lot of weird symptoms lately sorry I

802
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,360
cut off my description of what canabidol

803
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,000
is but it's a cannabinoid it's the

804
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,240
opposite of THC it's the the one that

805
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,359
goes down instead of up and it's I think

806
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,240
it tastes like cherries I definitely

807
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,839
think that a lot of herb that has uh CBD

808
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,720
in it and extracts made with CBD they

809
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,558
often have a cherry um like a cherry

810
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,960
Hall's cough drop or a luden's kind of a

811
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,839
taste to it that's what I've always

812
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,000
thought of CBD I'm high in random uh

813
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,558
I've talked about how it affects me it

814
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,480
makes me hungry it made me really mellow

815
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:16,038
it made me kind of smiley like put a

816
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,240
grin on my face like a giggle and then

817
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:20,200
uh here's a really uh a random story you

818
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,278
ready for this one over there oh gosh I

819
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:26,440
know where this is going yeah so uh we

820
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:27,919
had a long day we went to Springs and

821
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,840
bought some cannabis which is an hour

822
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,080
drive away we went to lunch and then we

823
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:35,639
uh came home and like two beautiful

824
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:39,199
people do we uh we got

825
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:42,159
naked and uh we were both loving what we

826
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,399
were doing um and after about an hour of

827
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,440
us giving it to each other I kind of

828
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:50,759
looked at her like um I love what you're

829
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,600
doing but I'm never going to finish like

830
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:56,158
this is perfect you've done everything I

831
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:57,398
love and this is not going to happen

832
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,440
like nothing's wrong and she kind of

833
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:00,879
looked at me like me too and I'm going

834
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,320
to embarrass you but it usually doesn't

835
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,240
take much for her to be done like she

836
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,639
gets three to my one cuz she's a girl

837
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,120
and I'm not complaining but I mean I

838
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,000
didn't even see one she's obvious when

839
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,959
it happens I didn't see one and I was

840
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,278
like well she's not either and so she

841
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,880
goes I think that CBD and I was thinking

842
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,960
it right as she said it she goes I think

843
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,399
that CBD weed killed it and it was the

844
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,798
whole time it was happening it was like

845
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,639
I was almost there so it was [ __ ]

846
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,480
amazing the entire time but it just

847
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,720
wouldn't there was no Grand Finale yeah

848
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,480
no Grand Finale there and I was like

849
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,079
it's not you and she's like it's not you

850
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,399
so we so I talked to my paramedic friend

851
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,398
and she said that that same electrical

852
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:41,558
firing in your brain that causes a

853
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:44,798
seizure is the same one that causes you

854
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:47,200
to orgasm oh [ __ ] and by smoking CBD you

855
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,599
pretty much just turn that sucker off

856
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,399
and she said that opiates will do it

857
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,759
times 10 she's like good luck getting a

858
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,199
boner on opiates I was like huh never

859
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,960
really I'm not really into opius but

860
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,798
okay she said it just straight turns off

861
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,240
that electrical firing mechanism in your

862
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,000
brain to where you'll never come never

863
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,720
like she said you probably could but

864
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,880
like you know it's going to take a lot

865
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,120
more effort than what I I really like

866
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,480
her I didn't want to try that hard

867
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,759
well like a gallon of sweat later I yeah

868
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,519
my legs were sore and I was kind of

869
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,960
sweaty was and I'm hungry yeah I was

870
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,679
like you're cute as [ __ ] and this is

871
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,720
great but I'm I'm going to take a rain

872
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,519
check you know like can I I've had to do

873
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,440
that before that's whiskey dick for me

874
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,200
though yeah well no I guess I'm not

875
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,200
finishing today I had CBD dick dude it

876
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,558
was it was working but it just wasn't

877
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,840
you got that CB dick there's been a few

878
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:38,000
times he won't even smoke my CBD weed

879
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,678
for that reason well yeah we're going

880
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,119
out to dinner something he's like hey uh

881
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,120
I'm not going to smoke that wink

882
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,359
wink uh honestly part of the reason I

883
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,839
don't smoke it is because we bought a a

884
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,359
limited Supply and I don't need to waste

885
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,359
it it doesn't do much for me other than

886
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,959
make me hungry and not make me nut so

887
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,038
what's the price comparison on it you

888
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,079
know that dispensary is very completely

889
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,079
fair and it's uh they have three

890
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:03,519
different price points of that herb and

891
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,798
it averages at $200 an ounce but it's a

892
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,000
medical only shop oh I feel you yeah so

893
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:08,960
you have to have a medical card to get

894
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,839
in there but $200 an ounce is a very

895
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,798
good price yeah because she works at a

896
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:15,839
dispensary and did you sell an ounce

897
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:19,240
today uh no we barely ever because it's

898
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,918
like 560 out the door or something J

899
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,120
after taxes and everything yeah after

900
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,120
tax that's you have to buy a little

901
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:28,000
white bag that locks to even carry your

902
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:29,479
ounce out in it's like the first

903
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,759
accessory you didn't even like you're

904
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,240
going to because you have to have that

905
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,640
to leave the dispensary because that's

906
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,759
childproof that's how the dispensary

907
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:40,038
watches their ass wow yeah that's that's

908
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,839
weird I didn't know that that's so they

909
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,240
actually have to sell you that bag or

910
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,720
they that's kind of like given with the

911
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,278
560 uh that's with the 560 but they

912
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,399
could some dispensaries charge you for

913
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,359
that is that with the 560 um well we

914
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:54,558
have the childproof bottles and then we

915
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,319
are supposed to charge for the bags for

916
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,200
edibles but most of the time we just

917
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,678
give them to people because they're a

918
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,840
lot of stuff yeah recreational is

919
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,080
expensive they stock up at that shop the

920
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:07,319

921

why Jeff doesn't drive when he's like

1164
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,880
cashed that's because uh Jeff's kind of

00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,519
an ambassador for uh as I see it like

1166
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,039
with this podcast and stuff like that

1167
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:57,039
you're trying to make weed as acceptable

1168
00:39:54,039 --> 00:40:00,000
as possible yeah and you know yes you

1169

1170
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,719
dreads but you don't need to be making

1171
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:09,358
the the classic mistakes that every

1172
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,358
stoner movie like showcases like oh he's

1173
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,960
so stone that he can't get off the couch

1174
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,920
or oh he's seeing six Shades of Gray or

1175
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,000
something like that because he he smoked

1176
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,440
himself color blind or some [ __ ] I don't

1177
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,119
know it's just yeah it's the dude wears

1178
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,358
my car effect where everybody's an idiot

1179
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,920
what kind of brought it up was there was

1180
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:28,960
traffic was going crazy up ahead of us

1181
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,440
and I wasn't sure what happened and I

1182
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,800
said uh pay attention to which which way

1183
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,800
the turn signals go and Clint found that

1184
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,119
to be some sort of Genius [ __ ]

1185
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,359
observation yeah because that the mile

1186
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,920
ahead I can see the turn signals

1187
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:42,159
flickering and I know if I need to start

1188
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,480
going left or right now because I'm just

1189
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:44,639
going to copy the turn signals and I'll

1190
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,400
be in the proper lane instead of

1191
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,318
fighting for it when I get up there yeah

1192
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,079
getting cut off by two Priuses was not

1193
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:53,480
cool that dude you weren't supposed to

1194
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:55,680
talk about that on the show I was passed

1195
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,400
by a [ __ ] Prius and it felt very

1196
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,519
emasculating

1197
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,000
bomb car though you're asking for it

1198
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:06,318
yeah that's true that's true happened

1199
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,639
twice that's a Prius dude I know that

1200
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,279
was the best part God anyway so yeah

1201
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,199
turn lights are turn signals are going

1202
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,720
on up ahead and I was just as stoned

1203
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:17,118
enough to go oh that was really smart

1204
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,118
man yeah and that's that I was like well

1205
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,559
I got to pay extra attention and be more

1206
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,440
a little more on top of it because I've

1207
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,920
got dreadlocks to my ass I'm woring an

1208
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,599
ivy genetics Colorado Cannabis t-shirt

1209
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,358
the car reeks of dink even though the

1210
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:31,680
herb is in the back of the car in the

1211
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:33,119
backpack in a bag it just reeks uh I I

1212
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:34,598
look like a pothead and I don't want to

1213
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,720
be pulled over on the side of the road

1214
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,760

this stupid pothead high as [ __ ] did

1216
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,359
something dumb I don't want that because

1217
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,599
I will scar the community I feel like

1218
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:45,239
and this is what kind of brought this up

1219
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,280
I feel like I kind of represent I've

1220
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:48,719
chosen to represent the community not

1221
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,960
just myself there are a lot of us that

1222
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,480
do it but I'm one of the people that

1223
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,199
have chosen to speak out and put myself

1224
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,240
in the spotlight for cannabis and I need

1225

was it was it was something where weed

1231
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,480
was dangerous because we're

1232
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:34,239
indoctrinated with that through dare and

1233

all this stuff yeah well back in the day

1234
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:39,039

00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:12,400
could I I've been sober from alcohol for

1277
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,960
eight years and I had to quit I had to

1278
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,119
quit because I had a real problem with

1279
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,920
it fortunately I didn't get withdrawals

1280
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,200
when I decided to quit but I do know

1281

I don't it's been so long you're just

1283
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:26,399
over it and would rather forget that

1284
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,559
part I was literally 22 years old when I

1285

quit drinking wow yeah well I mean when

1286
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:33,720
you started at like 14 but that was the

1287
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,920
thing is you could get alcohol alcohol

1288
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:37,598
was you could get it it's just like

1289
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,880
cigarettes were back in the day it was

1290
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,400
like weed was when it was illegal you

1291
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,880
could get weed you're never going to

1292
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,480
stop you from getting what you want yeah

1293
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,838

if you look at alcohol commercials they

1297
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:56,118
make you think that if you drink dois

1298
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,799
you are the most interesting man in the

1299
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:59,358
world I don't always drink drink dois

1300
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,839

00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:07,800
different than working medical uh the

1358
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:10,039
novelty like definitely wears off kind

1359
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,640
of quickly and then it just becomes a

1360
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:14,279
job a little bit but it's still um when

1361

00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,960
strength I was skeptical of it I didn't

1397

believe it would work and then uh one

1398

1503
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,358
color comedy on Facebook about a local

1504
00:52:08,798 --> 00:52:12,400
comedian being a hack and every comedian

1505
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:14,798
in PUO thought I was talking about

1506
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,160
them the people that you just listed are

1507
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:19,400

that's I hope they all heard that

1510
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,000
Southern Colorado comedy is is really

1511
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:28,039
pushing forward with our own senses of

1512
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,599
humor um you you might not like me but

1513

1517
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:39,640

00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,519
everybody gets so uh and amped around

1586
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,440
like celebrities but I really do feel

1587
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:02,358
like Ari shaffir is a celebrity he's put

1588
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,599
in so much work to get to where he's at

1589
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:06,679
and his special was so good and his

1590
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:08,559
special just came out so you know you

1591
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:09,838
would have thought like all these guys

1592
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,119
that listen to his podcast would have

1593
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:13,039
been all up on his nuts but everybody

1594
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,640
was just kind of like yeah we're just

1595
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:17,239
you're just a guy and that's how he acts

1596
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:18,879
and he had a sweet sweater on he didn't

1597
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:20,159
