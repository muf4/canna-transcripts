[ __ ] having flour on the shelf right now

57
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280

58
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,040
dispensaries are picked pretty clean

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,478
yeah yeah a lot of shelves are pretty

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,680
empty lately and

61
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,840
what's there's been kind of

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
disappointing so

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,520
um having somebody that had several nice

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,919

a pleasure to find excellent i never

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,479
thought i would see empty shelves at

67

this time of year and i haven't seen

68
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,199
something like that

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,719
in a long time it's scary going into the

70
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,318
dispensary right now with minimal

71
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,000

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,960
doesn't go unnoticed when i start

170
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,560
thinking about

171
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,399
the past and the future you're always

172
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,918
involved so thank you bro

173
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,519
it's been like a decade now we've been

174
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:14,879
building it we have been playing

175
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,839
together for quite a while and it has

176
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,439
been a good time

177
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,038
it has been a good time been some scary

178
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,800
moments some rocky roads but we always

179
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,800
seem to do pretty well together

180
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,240
moving into the old place i found some

181
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,000
relics from way

182
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,439
back in the origin days and they all

183
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,720
make me smile

184
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,478
did you see the smile which is when you

185
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
said relics i got excited

186
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,680
finding finding spots for them in the

187
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,918
new house is a lot of fun

188
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,560
cool old business cards and old pictures

189
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,038

190
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120

excuse me if it does happen

214
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,560
a lot of listeners have been asking for

215
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,639
guidance

216
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,478
on how to get into legalization how to

217
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,639
start joining city council meetings

218
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,240
basically where do i start to get to

219
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,240
where you guys are now

220
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
mike and i understand and appreciate and

221
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,720
are grateful for the fact that we're in

222
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,239
a location

223
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,479
where we can drive to a store that's

224
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
four minutes away and pay cash money

225
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,240
for the top quality concentrates and not

226
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,600
have to worry about police taking it

227
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,120
from us getting arrested

228
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,039
anything it's we've got a lot of freedom

229
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,800
here we enjoy it so

230
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,000
mike has been given the opportunity to

231
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,680
put together what i'm calling the

232
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,879
legalization presentation just because i

233
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,000
like silly [ __ ] like that

234
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,360
but i gave him some time to put

235
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,399
something together and i'm giving him

236
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,759
the format

237
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,519
i'm gonna try to stay out of the way and

238
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,639
not over talk you but i'm just gonna

239
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,799

240
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,879

242
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,879
white mike's legalization presentation

243
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,918
have at it brother

244
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,639
thanks bro um listeners before we dive

245
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,000
into this

246
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:19,038
it's kind of hard to know how far

247
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,519
to go into some of these topics

248
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,959
um i've been studying legalization or

249
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,758
the idea of it

250
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,560
in one way or another for like 20 years

251
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,960
so there's

252
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,720
a lot of different talking points and

253
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,839
arguments just sort of rattling around

254
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,840
in my head

255
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:39,119
i've tried to hone it down to

256
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:42,159
sort of the key starter package for

257
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,759
what is anybody who's interested need to

258
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,800
know

259
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,240
to be effective arguing for legalization

260
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
in their area

261
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,240
i hope i've done a good job in narrowing

262
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,639
it down

263
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
if you want more information or would

264
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,240
have appreciated less information you

265
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,120
can hit me up on social media

266
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,960
um it's at nemopunk15 on twitter or you

267
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,478
can find me on facebook at pueblo for

268
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,878
sensible cannabis laws

269
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,240
or you can get a hold of me by emailing

270
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,960

271
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,720
links provided in the show notes perfect

272
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,638
thank you mike so

273
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,160
legalization um

274
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,000
if you're getting into this argument

275
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,639
right now you're lucky

276
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,038
uh you've got a lot of good data to pull

277
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,918
from

278
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,959
you've got a lot of other people's work

279
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,478
to build on

280
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:33,198
and study and sort of repurpose for your

281
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,198
own arguments

282
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,719
despite like 80 years of propaganda in

283
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,120
[ __ ] and drug war nonsense that's

284
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,040
been built on top of cannabis

285
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,480
um we've got a lot of positives working

286
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,120
in our favor

287
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,879
and our favor during for this argument

288
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,360
um

289
00:08:52,879 --> 00:09:00,240
prohibition as a concept is just crap

290
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,480
um going back the first prohibition this

291
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,320
is one of my favorite arguments i steal

292
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,879
it from a guy named neil frank

293
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
franklin who's the founder of a group

294
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,399
called law enforcement

295
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
against prohibition so a group of

296
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,559
ex-cops and judges that

297
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,320
just saw prohibition in action and can't

298
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,000
tolerate it anymore so they formed a

299
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,560
group to fight it

300
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,559
um and his uh his little comment was the

301
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,759
very first prohibition is

302
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,039
um god telling adam and eve don't eat

303
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,838
that apple

304
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,958
and god was the cop he only had to watch

305
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,000
two people

306
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:37,039
and that apple got eight quick

307
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,120
that's just how it goes um there's a

308
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,799
little human nature in that story too

309
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,959
not only does prohibition not a very

310
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,039
good policy and it's hard to enforce

311
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,278
but it's sort of human nature to go oh

312
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,759
don't touch that

313
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,480
you know it's just you tell us not to

314
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:55,120
and the first thing our brain does is

315
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,720
i wonder why oh i'm gonna try it and

316
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,679
find out why

317
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,600
um and so when little old me when they

318
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,199
instituted dare when i was in fifth or

319
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,079
sixth grade or whenever they gave it to

320
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,920
us

321
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,278
the first thing everyone in my class

322
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,559
thought was

323
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,240
well they're probably telling us about

324
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,799
this because it's fun we should go find

325
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,120
it and try

326
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:17,759
yeah that's exactly what i thought and

327
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,000
i thought it was weird then and when i

328
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,319
was in college in

329
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,600
saw some studies where they looked at if

330
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,360
dare worked

331
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,000
and they found that the dare that we

332
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,320
went through was zero to negative two

333
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,759
percent effective

334
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
so for every hundred kids that went

335
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,278
through the dare i went through

336
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
two of them that wouldn't have gone out

337
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:40,559
to look for drugs were like

338
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:44,319
we should probably go try some drugs so

339
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,639
um if you're looking to get in

340
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,480
and start arguing against cannabis

341
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,519
prohibition in your area

342
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,240
know that you're not alone and that

343
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,000
it's not a craziest argument as it might

344
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,560
originally seem

345
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,679
especially if you come from a lot of the

346
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,119
the propaganda

347
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:06,319
that we grew up in and then i know

348
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,560
for a fact is still pretty prevalent

349
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,720
around the country even in the us right

350
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,159
now where it seems like legalization is

351
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,600
right around the corner

352
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:18,799
but it seemed like that since 1970

353
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,680
and we're still not there

354
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,359
so first prohibition is a terrible

355
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,278
policy on its own right

356
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,000
second cops were never meant to protect

357
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,600
you from you they were protect to

358
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,159
protect you from me

359
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,920
like if i go beat up jeff the cops can

360
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,838
arrest me for beating up jeff

361
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,439
but if i beat up me and i tell the cops

362
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,240
i kick my own ass they're just going to

363
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,399
look at me and go

364
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,600
what do you want us to do about it and

365
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,639
it's the same thing with

366
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,278
drug laws the trying to

367
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,199
catch somebody who doesn't want to be

368
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:53,278
caught and doesn't want to report

369
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,320
the other people involved it's just a

370
00:11:53,278 --> 00:12:00,159
really hard crime to solve

371
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,160
because nobody leaves a typical pot deal

372
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,759
upset somebody wanted to buy some

373
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,799
marijuana somebody wanted to sell some

374
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,919
marijuana

375
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:10,479
those two connected and both left happy

376
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,919
or at least not disgruntled

377
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,240
unfortunately it doesn't always work

378
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,879
that way because prohibition isn't

379
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,240
doesn't create a awesomely safe

380
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,519
marketplace

381
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,720
but in theory both parties are there for

382
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,440
their own ends and

383
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,120
those ends get met quickly and everybody

384
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,040
goes home happy

385
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
um it's not like an assault where

386
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,719
there's somebody that got their ass

387
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,039
kicked that's salty about it right

388
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,000
no victim no crime is what you're saying

389
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,439
very much so

390
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,559
and immoralists or prohibitionists

391
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,800
love to paint you know it's a moral

392
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,159
failing or some sort other nonsense on

393
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,759
the why

394
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,600
smoking a joint in the privacy of your

395
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,399
own home should be really really

396
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
terrible and

397
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,240
a crime that needs to be prevented

398
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,639
punished

399
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,639
punished

400
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,720
and when you start breaking down

401
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,320
especially now where

402
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,240
i mean colorado's been legal for

403
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,720
eight years now the law passed in 2012.

404
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,560
um all of 2013 was a planning year

405
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,240
stores have been open since 2014 that's

406
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,958
six years we've had dispensary

407
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,039
retail dispensaries we've had medical

408
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,958
dispensaries since 08

409
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,958
cali's had medical dispensaries since

410
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:26,078
2000

411
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,119
that's 20 years now and society hasn't

412
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,159
tipped over it

413
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,278
it hasn't gone insane

414
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:36,078
try as they might you can't pin

415
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,120
a lot of mayhem on legal cannabis that's

416
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,278
why

417
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,600
canada followed colorado and in

418
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:46,159
washington state in legalization

419
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,159
so is uruguay so is mexico now i believe

420
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,440
we're clearly headed towards a world

421
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,600
where

422
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,600
cannabis is legal and

423
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,399
at this point there's a lot of good data

424
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,839
that you can draw on to make your

425
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,759
arguments

426
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,279
much more impactful than mine were when

427
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,958
i started

428
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,320
because when i started a lot of this was

429
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,239
theoretical

430
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,240
and so when you were trying to explain

431
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,879
to people that if there's a legal market

432
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,720
the black market kind of goes away

433
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,320
they look at you funny and now you can

434
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,560
show them that that's where seven

435
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,760
billion dollars worth of cannabis sales

436
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,919
comes from and

437
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,679
the legal market around the us right now

438
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,519
those aren't new customers

439
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,599
their existing customers spending

440
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,039
dollars they would have spent anyway

441
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,959
they're just choosing to shop in a

442
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:36,559
regulated market now seven

443
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,078
billion it's that's an old number even

444
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,439
it's probably nine or 11

445
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:45,359
now and that's just the legal market wow

446
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,240
um good estimates on the

447
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,159
like it's it's easier to know like the

448
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
size of the cosmetics market or the

449
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,559
dental market in the us

450
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,599
because the sales figures are easier to

451
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,919
track

452
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,360
than it is with the illegal business is

453
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,198
but yeah

454
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,720
um the dea has been putting out

455
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,078
estimates every year

456
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,040
for i mean since the 70s estimating the

457
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,919
size of

458
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,240
of different drug markets in the u.s and

459
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,958
they

460
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,440
put the u.s cannabis market somewhere

461
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,159
north of 35 billion

462
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,160
um and that's a really old number my

463
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,799
guess is it's closer to

464
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,958
50 to 60. wow and those are those are

465
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,319
prohibition dollars and so there's a

466
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,239
huge

467
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,000
markup because it's an illegal product

468
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,639
but if you figured about a third of that

469
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,879
so 25 30 billion dollars

470
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,198
is what the the u.s market is

471
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,198
potentially for legal cannabis

472
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,879
and right now the legal market's about

473
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,958
11 billion strong i think

474
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,360
10 or 11. it's a lot of money so there's

475
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,399
a lot of black market money still on the

476
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,839
table for the legal market to scoop up

477
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,759
but when i was first making this

478
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,680
argument

479
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,278
it was hard to get all that information

480
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,599
in front of people the internet didn't

481
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,600
exist like it does today even

482
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,199
um you didn't have people like me

483
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,600
coaching you on podcasts

484
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,120
the data wasn't there yet even in

485
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,800
libraries you had trouble finding books

486
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,839
about it so

487
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,039
um i mean the landscape is vastly

488
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,800
different now

489
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:19,198
and that all plays to our benefit um

490
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,838
even if you're you're arguing to someone

491
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,758
who is staunchly

492
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,759
anti-legalization they've been exposed

493
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,720
to a lot of these arguments and talking

494
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,639
points

495
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,959
and know that you're not just a crazy

496
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,039
hippie shouting nonsense

497
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,319
um because that's kind of what it felt

498
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,439
like when when i

499
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,720
started um there was a real sense that

500
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,160
you had to overcome the chi chin chong

501
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,720
kind of veil that automatically got

502
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,559
thrown over you as soon as you said

503
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,240
i'm here to talk about cannabis they'd

504
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,119
go hippie

505
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,919
yeah you just immediately uh you had to

506
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,480
overcome

507
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,240
tons of [ __ ] um because you were the

508
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,480
cannabis guy

509
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,680
and it that's not so true anymore it's

510
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,798
still true it's just not

511
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,798
nearly as true as it used to be and

512
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,918
you've got a lot more firepower and it's

513
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,798
way easier to back it up now

514
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,799
for example

515
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,438
um one of the things you're going to

516
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,880
want to do if you're

517
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,120
you're going to start arguing for

518
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,240
legalization in your area

519
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,719
my biggest tip for you is to just learn

520
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,919
and read and watch as much as you can on

521
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,079
cannabis

522
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,720
cannabis prohibition if you just type in

523
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,519
cannabis documentaries into youtube

524
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,079
you're going to find dozens of good ones

525
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,918
same thing with netflix

526
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,798
grab a pen hit pause real quick go grab

527
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,720
a pen

528
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,000
some examples that you're definitely

529
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,120
going to want to familiarize

530
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,919
yourself with if you haven't already

531
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,599
the union uh subtitled the business

532
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,240
behind getting high

533
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,159
you can find that on youtube for sure

534
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,000
same thing with a documentary called the

535
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,320
culture high

536
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,640
um i'm pretty sure waiting to inhale is

537
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,839
still available on youtube if it's not i

538
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,240
know you can find it

539
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,119
searching on the internet for a minute

540
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,200
um

541
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,439
if you're more of a reader check out a

542
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,000
book called my medicine by a guy named

543
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,279
urban rosenfeld

544
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,319
fantastic book gives you an insider's

545
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,879
view

546
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,038
of the very earliest days of medical

547
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,679
marijuana in the u.s

548
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,279
and it's a story almost nobody knows

549
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,480
about

550
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,759
and when you tell people they think

551
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,279
you're [ __ ] with them like the

552
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,000
federal government's run a medical

553
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:39,759
marijuana program since 1982

554
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,119
where they mail people um tins

555
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:45,679
with i think it's 11 ounces per 10

556
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,359
in pre-rolled joints like even saying it

557
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,919
right now it sounds like i'm making [ __ ]

558
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,678
up

559
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,679
but it's real you can go on youtube you

560
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,360
can see the tin you can see the joints

561
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,360
you can hear the testimonials from these

562
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:58,719
people

563
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,000
um there's a lot a lot of history to

564
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,480
draw from now that just wasn't

565
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,079
accessible when i started

566
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,839
um so absorb read and learn

567
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,319
everything you can and get used to

568
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,000
thinking

569
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,319
the arguments that you're hearing people

570
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
make in terms of

571
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,240
where you would like to see the law

572
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,798
change so if you're watching a

573
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,359
documentary say the union

574
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,359
a lot of it's said in british columbia

575
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,879
uh i think that one's from 2004

576
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:32,159
2007 and so at the time

577
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,640
one of the the hot spots for cannabis

578
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,679
production was british columbia

579
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,520
and one of the desirable selling points

580
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,798
for flour in the country was this is

581
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,798
from british columbia

582
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,519
and so the whole documentary sort of

583
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,120
details what the black market's like

584
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,119
in that point in time and

585
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,639
as they're talking take the numbers

586
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,199
they're saying and apply them to your

587
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,919
town or your city or your state

588
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,919
and when you start conveying this

589
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,840
information to other people in your area

590
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,480
and pointing to different data sets that

591
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:09,439
are publicly available

592
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,558
those arguments are extremely impactful

593
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,600
when you can say

594
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,319
you know our town has 160 000 people in

595
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,759
it

596
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:20,079
if we were to legalize marijuana

597
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,000
the numbers say that we would be making

598
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,119
around you know a million a year

599
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,359
between sales tax and licensing fees

600
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,439
and if we allowed production as well

601
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:33,038
we'd be looking at another million or so

602
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,080
in excise tax and all of a sudden your

603
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,440
city councilman

604
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,599
who didn't really want to listen to the

605
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,519
stoner guy again today

606
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,678
is thinking well that's two and a half

607
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,960
million dollars that i could put towards

608
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,080
this pet project or that pet project

609
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,200
um and all of a sudden

610
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,319
you've got them hooked into your

611
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,319
argument a little bit better

612
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,559
while you're reading and learning and

613
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,000
watching everything you can on cannabis

614
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:03,200
and prohibition also check out

615
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,919
local meetings in your area i always

616
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,400
recommend

617
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,480
start local if you've never argued in

618
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,159
front of a governing body before don't

619
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,839
start at a state legislature

620
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,400
it's very intimidating start at a town

621
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,158
meeting or a city council

622
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,640
these meetings are open to the public

623
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,480
and because there's a playground

624
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,919
in the whole world's upside down because

625
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,480
of covid

626
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,440
all of these are open on the web now and

627
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,599
they're very easily accessible

628
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,960
two minutes on google and you're able to

629
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,678
find

630
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,319
when your city council or town committee

631
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,480
or whatever they're called meet

632
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,480
what time of day the meetings are how to

633
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,079
view them remotely

634
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,519
and watch a lot of that like as much as

635
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,079
you can stomach

636
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,639
and i it's most boring [ __ ] you'll ever

637
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,119
see

638
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,559
um it's sort of my super power is being

639
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,839
able to sit through these meetings and

640
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,839
not die

641
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,839
um that's a great skill set that i bring

642
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:05,759
to the cannabis community

643
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,319
but uh if you want to go down to city

644
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,599
council

645
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,678
and say city council we should break

646
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,918
with a hundred years now of tradition

647
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,480
and legalize cannabis

648
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,280
here's why and you want that that

649
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:23,120
message to be well received

650
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:25,038
and appreciated your best bet

651
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,119
is to watch a lot of city council

652
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,200
meetings or if you want to do a state

653
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,079
assembly a state assembly meeting

654
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,360
and get used to how those are meetings

655
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,639
are run

656
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,439
what the flow is what all the procedures

657
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,759
are

658
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,360
who all the players are who does what

659
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,879
who says what

660
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:50,000
what order things happen in um

661
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,000
i've seen a lot of people go and

662
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,159
look very foolish because they go with

663
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,158
zero

664
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,679
preparation and a hundred percent

665
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,480
passion

666
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,519
and it's the taking the time and sitting

667
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,599
through

668
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:09,119
meaning after meaning about zoning code

669
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:11,279
and fire code and watching the little

670
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,639
old lady speak about people speeding on

671
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,678
our street

672
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,000
or the loud music at night or

673
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,759
watching the the big city presentation

674
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,038
where a whole block of people have come

675
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,200
down to

676
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,359
to rally because too many garbage trucks

677
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,720
go down their alley every week

678
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,759
you really get a feel for how your city

679
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,759
runs

680
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,919
who the important players are who the

681
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,400
decision makers are

682
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,640
and the more you watch the more you

683
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,600
learn what those people care about

684
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,520
so you can really tailor your arguments

685
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,879
and make them effective

686
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,558
um say somebody's really passionate

687
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,760
about the police

688
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,678
and they want the police to reinvest

689
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,720
more time into

690
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,840
more important type crimes you can point

691
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,558
out that in colorado a state with 5.7

692
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:05,918
something million people we have 6 000

693
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:09,038
fewer marijuana arrests per year now

694
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,799
and that's those six thousand hey i

695
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,558
caught mike and jeff smoking a joint

696
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,839
behind the arby's

697
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,038
and i had to you know handcuff him pat

698
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,839
him down put him in the back of the

699
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,720
squad car

700
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,399
take them to the jail process them it's

701
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,960
just a minor offense we do some

702
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,720
paperwork we take some pictures

703
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,840
there they go home seven hours later

704
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,558
takes about three hours of the officer's

705
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,959
time

706
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,480
we don't do that six thousand times a

707
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,000
year now

708
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,000
and that those man hours add up

709
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,679
like if you do the math the normal 40

710
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,759
hour work week is 2080 hours a year

711
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,080
and that's if you work five days a week

712
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,839
40 hours a week

713
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:56,639
or not five days a week but 40 hours a

714
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:58,879
week and 52 weeks a year it's 2080.

715
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,960
six thousand arrests at two or three

716
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,000
hours per arrest

717
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,519
it's 12 to 18 000 man hours we just

718
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,440
freed up

719
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,960
and how many rapes can you solve in that

720
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,240
time how many murders can you solve in

721
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,679
that time

722
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,919
um if you're

723
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,840
you somebody is on the other side of

724
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,799
that particular coin and is fired up

725
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,240
about

726
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:24,000
police abuse of power 90

727
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,679
of the videos where the cop pulls

728
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,880
somebody over and decides to [ __ ] with

729
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,840
that somebody

730
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,440
it starts with jeff i smell marijuana in

731
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,399
your car would you please step out

732
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,360
it's it's always i smell weed they never

733
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,400
smell meth

734
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,918
they never smell heroin they they rarely

735
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,960
smell alcohol

736
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,799
it's always i smell weed and if

737
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,159
i smell weed is no longer a reason to

738
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,679
[ __ ] with people

739
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,679
it just takes that off the menu

740
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,000
if somebody's got a passion project

741
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,158
where they want to fund something

742
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,359
the data is there now where you can look

743
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,919
up and say

744
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,119
there's this many people in our city if

745
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,759
we use the numbers

746
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,319
in colorado and there's no reason to say

747
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,480
they don't

748
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,079
shouldn't apply to say new york or

749
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,440
wyoming or

750
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:14,720
or australia that our

751
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,320
area could likely see this much money

752
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,319
coming in every year

753
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,639
and we can put that towards whatever we

754
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,480
want and all of a sudden you've got a

755
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,120
bunch of people who started off

756
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,240
not wanting to even listen to you now

757
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,278
they're thinking about

758
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,440
you know we're already buying and

759
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,880
selling the pod like everybody who wants

760
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,759
it gets it here

761
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,480
prohibition is such a terrible policy

762
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,640
that it's

763
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,558
literally created a marketplace where

764
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,278
every high school has a distribution

765
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:46,000
center

766
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:47,919
yeah like you couldn't dream up a worse

767
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,759
distribution system than the one

768
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,440
prohibition created

769
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:52,879
if you were trying to keep drugs out of

770
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,798
the hands of people who shouldn't be on

771
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,679
drugs

772
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,000
i agree it's just prohibition's bad on

773
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,840
in

774
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,278
every way and

775
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:07,199
the more you learn about the history of

776
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,119
cannabis prohibition

777
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,440
the medical effects of cannabis the

778
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:14,158
health effects of cannabis

779
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,759
um what's happened in states since

780
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,520
they've legalized or since they've

781
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,278
allowed medical

782
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:23,440
and how much it costs to try to enforce

783
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:27,038
all this and prohibit it

784
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,038
it gets really easy to to start

785
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,720
okay i listened to this meeting for 10

786
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,558
hours i figured out what this guy and

787
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,399
this guy really care about

788
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,240
i know how to sway their votes my way

789
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,158
now i just have to tailor the argument

790
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,919
like so

791
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,679
and so it's just it's really just about

792
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,440
doing your prep work and

793
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,600
and knowing who your target audience is

794
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,679
and then getting comfortable

795
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,678
and if you watch the proceedings enough

796
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,720
you'll get comfortable enough to know

797
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,200
when

798
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,000
and how to do your five-minute spiel on

799
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,360
why

800
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,880
your area should legalize pot

801
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,558
it's really just about the prep work and

802
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,640
you're lucky the documentaries now are

803
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,319
good

804
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,399
they didn't even exist when me and jeff

805
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,359
were starting yeah you guys are spoiled

806
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,239
now

807
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,519
and you're welcome we have some fun

808
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,278
notes we got here

809
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,278
just to give you all some fun numbers to

810
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:21,759
think about

811
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,079
um in 2019 the state of colorado like i

812
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,038
said

813
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:30,359
5.7 million people we collected

814
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:33,599
302 million 458

815
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:37,199
426 cannabis taxes

816
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,000
in 2019 and every report i've read this

817
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,640
year says

818
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,759
our sales numbers are way higher during

819
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,960
covid

820
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,440
so we're gonna crush that number next

821
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,319
year this year

822
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:53,919
302 million dollars yep

823
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,678
um new york for example has got 8.3

824
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:00,000
million people

825
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:03,519
almost 8.4 they're looking at

826
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,398
a projected revenue of 436 million a

827
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,038
year

828
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,678
if they get on the legalization train

829
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,759
they

830
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,399
haven't yet they're they continually

831
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:14,240
fumble the ball trying to craft the

832
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,278
perfect legalization model

833
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,399
rather than letting uh what's the phrase

834
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,038
they're letting the

835
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,879
perfect get in the way of the good so

836
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,398
rather than making any progress they

837
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,240
keep talking about how next year they're

838
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:30,879
going to make the perfect leap forward

839
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,278
um we did the cop hours that we could

840
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,278
save

841
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,119
different ways you can argue for

842
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,278
legalization in your area

843
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,119
if you don't want to go sacrifice

844
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,679
yourself on the alternate city council

845
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,678
like i did

846
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,240
writing op-eds to your local paper or a

847
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,679
larger paper

848
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,960
is super super easy to do

849
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,278
some things you should know that will

850
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,399
make you more confident

851
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:01,038
every newspaper has an op-ed section

852
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:04,639
and they're desperate for free content

853
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:06,720
so the odds your letter gets published

854
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,559
are pretty good if you follow a few

855
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,079
really simple rules

856
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,918
if you click on their submission

857
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,278
criteria which will be easy to find on

858
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,960
their papers website

859
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,558
you can go to the denver post click the

860
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,200
opinion section

861
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:22,079
and if you scroll to the bottom there

862
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,640
will be a tab that says

863
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,480
submit an op-ed and it'll tell you

864
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,000
here's your word limit

865
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,360
don't cuss don't make it personal

866
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,880
and if you do that there's like an 85

867
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,000
percent chance they'll publish your

868
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,399
letter doesn't matter what it's

869
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,319
about you could be bitching about the

870
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,879
ducks at the city park

871
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,519
or the people driving fast down your

872
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,278
street

873
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,519
or different marijuana laws in your area

874
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,798
and another important piece of

875
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,119
information

876
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,879
most newspapers have no way to double

877
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,798
check

878
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,278
who your name is on the bottom of the

879
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,440
letter and so i can write a letter and

880
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,599
say my name's jeff

881
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,798
and they'll publish it saying jeff wrote

882
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,719
it and then jeff will call me and be

883
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,158
like what the [ __ ] dude

884
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,399
if you're gonna submit a letter under my

885
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,240
name tell me yeah

886
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,158
but you don't have to use your name

887
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,440
there's famous examples of people in our

888
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,840
history who wrote

889
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,519
wonderful impactful op-eds to the paper

890
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,278
under pseudonyms like benjamin franklin

891
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,480
famously did it

892
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:28,398
um but op-eds are really

893
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,558
kind of oddly powerful um it's 2020 and

894
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,239
we're we all decided to be dumb

895
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,398
and so most people can't tell the

896
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,359
difference between

897
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:39,119
a fact investigated report and an

898
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,918
opinion letter

899
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,439
and so your opinion letter to the editor

900
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,038
is already going to have more

901
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,880
impact than it probably should because

902
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,919
it's an opinion

903
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,399
but nobody can tell that anymore

904
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,559
um and the other thing with the writing

905
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,119
op-eds is they get picked up they get

906
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,639
they get if uh they get a lot of clicks

907
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,319
on the local paper they'll get picked up

908
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,640
by the national outlet

909
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,439
and other people will discuss it and all

910
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,679
of a sudden

911
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,759
elected officials are being asked did

912
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,640
you see the op-ed in sunday's paper that

913
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,240
you know from

914
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,679
from ross to jeff that said we should

915
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,880
legalize weed

916
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,759
what do you think about that mayor and

917
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,000
all of a sudden

918
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,319
it's a major news story that's that's

919
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,839
generating more than just

920
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,398
people saw it and got to read your

921
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,398
arguments

922
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,599
my other big tip is stay informed as

923
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:33,038
much as possible

924
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:36,719
on what's going on in your local area

925
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,720
in your state and nationally

926
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,720
especially if you're regularly arguing

927
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:43,839
for legalization

928
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,839
and that's really what it takes

929
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,440
the places that haven't moved in the us

930
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,240
anyway

931
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,759
on legalization are almost exclusively

932
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,359
places now

933
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:58,960
where someone in elected office

934
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:01,278
has to submit a bill to change the law

935
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,960
the general public can't put a petition

936
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,319
together and get it on the ballot

937
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,159
themselves

938
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,158
so you've got to convince somebody that

939
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,278
holds elective office

940
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,080
to submit the change for you and you do

941
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:17,759
that by pestering the [ __ ] out of them

942
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:20,798
and every day every week every month

943
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,759
however often you can send that person

944
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,798
an email

945
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,720
call their office hey it's me again

946
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,398
just wanted to remind you if marijuana

947
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,159
were legal we'd have an extra this much

948
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:33,359
in the state budget this month

949
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,440
have a nice wednesday um

950
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,798
hey i saw you wanted you know more money

951
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,960
for snow removal in

952
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,398
in district one next year but you can't

953
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,759
find in the budget

954
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:45,199
i know how you could just contact me

955
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,839
next month

956
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,440
just keep sending emails keep calling

957
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,240
keep pestering those people

958
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,000
and if you make your arguments short

959
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,038
concise

960
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,240
and tuned to their cares and their wants

961
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,759
and needs

962
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,120
you're going to have an impact and it's

963
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,519
not going to take as long as you think

964
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,518
you will

965
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,839
we're so lucky now we've overcome so

966
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,519
much of the [ __ ] that we

967
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,519
and baggage that we've been carrying in

968
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:14,559
this movement for so long

969
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,398
the internet finally freed up enough

970
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,878
information i think

971
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,719
i agree the show's like this dude shows

972
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:23,440
like this

973
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,480
um i think that's about what i've got

974
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,960
straightened

975
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,159
or lined out so far what uh any

976
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,079
questions for me jeff

977
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,679
you know the only note i wrote down and

978
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,039
this is kind of it's related

979
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,559
do you have any favorite activists that

980
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,320
we should follow or listen to or people

981
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:40,639
that can give us some guidance

982
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,399
um definitely follow marijuana moment

983
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,000
you can subscribe to a newsletter you

984
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:44,719
can check in with the website you can

985
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,760
follow the

986
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:50,959
those guys on twitter

987
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,639
fantastic cannabis reporting um

988
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,199
russ belleville if you're really into

989
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,480
data russ is one of the best

990
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:01,679
data miners i've ever seen um

991
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,000
it's like a dog with a bone radical rust

992
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,639
will

993
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,480
dig into some talking point like a

994
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,480
[ __ ] honey badger

995
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,838
and then post all the data for free to

996
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,079
his website awesome

997
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,199
um and so if if there's a marijuana

998
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,599
talking point that

999
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,879
you really want to deep dive data on but

1000
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,240
don't really

1001
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,640
feel like doing all that legwork

1002
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,319
yourself you can check in with radical

1003
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:23,519
russ and see if he's already done it for

1004
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,280
you and wants to point you in the right

1005
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:28,960
direction

1006

prohibition or leap

1012
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,159

the country every year

1014
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,118

1015
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:51,759
all sorts of stuff not just prohibition

1016
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,519
being horrible policy but

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,079
is it time to start wrapping up the

1035
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:26,239
uh this is going to be all the talking

1036
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,359
parts i want this can definitely be part

1037
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:31,598
one

1038
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:34,480
um i've got some little notes down like

1039
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,039
let's say mere jeff me and jeff are in a

1040
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,240
city called pueblo colorado

1041
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:44,000
our population is about 160 000.

1042
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,759
um our little city that has

1043
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,358
eight dispensaries and this wasn't this

1044
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,560
number is from when we only had seven up

1045
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:53,358
and running in 2018.

1046
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,559
we see better than a million in taxes

1047
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:56,880
and fees

1048
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,679
and that's not production or excise tax

1049
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,358
yet

1050
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:03,679
that's just seven stores

1051
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,960
doing their daily business paying sales

1052
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,960
tax on it

1053
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,280
and and paying their licensing fees to

1054
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,800
operate it's an insane number

1055
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,320
it's a million bucks that goes into the

1056
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,000
economy

1057
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,519
yeah that's a new fire station right

1058
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,119
that's close to you could at least build

1059
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:17,599
this structure you build a damn fire

1060
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,240
station

1061
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,280
you're welcome it's uh

1062
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,319
i don't know i don't know what to find

1063
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,240
it's one of those things when you get

1064
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,280
into when you get into city and state

1065
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,239
budgets

1066
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,760
the numbers get really big quick and and

1067
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,039
like colorado's pulling in

1068
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,160
300 300 million plus in marijuana taxes

1069
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,920
every year and it's

1070
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,358
one percent of our state budget um

1071
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,280
and those two numbers in your head are

1072
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,799
kind of hard to hold at the same time at

1073
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,720
least if you're me

1074
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,560
um because 300 million dollars like if i

1075
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,399
had that personally like

1076
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,159
my life would be kush for forever even

1077
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,240
if i did dumb [ __ ] ex

1078
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,679
expensive dumb [ __ ] every day 300

1079
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,358
million is enough to get me through all

1080
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,838
the days i'd be competitively

1081
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,639
trying to spend through that money but

1082
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:02,400
it uh

1083
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,838
at the state level it doesn't go that

1084
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,000
far when you figure out how much a

1085
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,559
highway costs to build or a school

1086
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,039
system costs to maintain

1087
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,199
um it's the law large numbers when

1088
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,400
there's this many of us

1089
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:19,838
um [ __ ] just costs a lot

1090
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,680
and so when you're making especially the

1091
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,440
economic argument

1092
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,799
keep in mind that it's not going to be a

1093
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,320
golden parachute

1094
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,200
kind of magic bullet but that money can

1095
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,280
do so much good like here locally

1096
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,519
a huge chunk of the money we collect

1097
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,440
goes towards scholarships

1098
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,800
where any kid can get um

1099
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,720
it's a couple of thousand i think it's

1100
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,560
four thousand now any kid

1101
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,118
local kid that graduates high school in

1102
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,880
pueblo can apply for a scholarship and

1103
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,480
get like four grand

1104
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,320
as long as they go to one of the local

1105
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,358
colleges and we're opening it up so that

1106
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,400
it can be any college in the u.s

1107
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:57,759
i wish they would have done that

1108
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,200
originally more kids wouldn't have been

1109
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,440
able to benefit

1110
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,439
but uh it took a minute for the program

1111
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,639
to really get up and running and really

1112
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,920
get funded

1113
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,879
but now they're giving away almost i

1114
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,838
think 700

1115
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,519
000 a year in scholarships and that's

1116
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:17,519
for a community like pueblo that's

1117
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:19,119
huge yeah um we had a couple of middle

1118
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,159
schools down here

1119
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,838
where they didn't have sidewalks and so

1120
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,559
it was just

1121
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:26,960
like a road where the cars drive and

1122
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,320
then

1123
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,240
field and there's houses and it's kind

1124
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,039
of in the middle of a

1125
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,799
semi-suburban area but they hadn't

1126
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:40,000
gotten around to having the money to

1127
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,400
pave the sidewalks yet and so

1128
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,639
in a very real way kids were walking in

1129
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,680
the street with bus and car traffic to

1130
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:47,920
get to school every day

1131
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,679
the kids that walked and rode their bike

1132
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,280
had to do so on the same road as the

1133
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,319
buses and [ __ ]

1134
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,040
super unsafe but it was all we could

1135
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,039
afford

1136
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,800
until we legalized pot and we had some

1137
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,519
extra revenue laying around that wasn't

1138
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,800
already

1139
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,318
earmarked for some desperate need and

1140
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,880
now those schools have nice safe

1141
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,960
sidewalks that's awesome

1142
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,480
a couple of parks got refurbished and it

1143
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,800
doesn't it's like ooh

1144
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,920
a park but like for the people who use

1145
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,119
that that's huge

1146
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,880
yeah like i've got a two and a

1147
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,400
five-year-old the little park up the

1148
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,640
street that i drove by and never

1149
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,000
considered for 35 years

1150
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:27,118
that [ __ ] is vital now

1151
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,800
vital like sunshine and water vital yeah

1152
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,880
oh yeah

1153
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,200
and marijuana taxes can pay to keep that

1154
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,318
up and keep the equipment decent

1155
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:38,639
it's uh the way that you can use that

1156
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:40,559
money is really big because it's

1157
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,559
it's brand new money it's not money

1158
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,960
that's already allocated you don't have

1159
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,799
to take it from jeff to give it to mike

1160
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,960
it's brand new money coming into the

1161
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,359
flow that you can allocate anywhere you

1162
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,720
want

1163
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,119
and then there's a bunch of ancillary

1164
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:53,598
money like not only is there sales tax

1165
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,519
but

1166
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,359
you and i have a job like how many

1167
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,079
people work in the cannabis industry in

1168
00:40:57,358 --> 00:40:59,598
our town

1169
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,599
all of those people are now employed

1170
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,640
they now buy dinner they now buy

1171
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,640
groceries they now

1172
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:07,598
buy from the dispensary they're able to

1173
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,000
do [ __ ] 1300 1400 people in pueblo like

1174
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,039
it's a

1175
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,159
shitload of jobs yeah um

1176
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:18,159
it's a massive amount of investment

1177
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:21,598
uh when uh when an area goes legal

1178
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:23,519
um in pueblo here i think it was 50 some

1179
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,838
million in investment that first year

1180
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,838
than 2013.

1181
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:29,279
52 million i think was the number in

1182
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,358
just one year

1183
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,880
in economic investment down here so what

1184
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,598
that meant for

1185
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,400
the electricians and the hvac techs and

1186
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,400
the

1187
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,599
the drywall crews and the roof and crews

1188
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:47,440
all those guys um i mean

1189
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,440
2012 wasn't exactly an economic boom

1190
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,599
time either was 2013.

1191
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,760
and so this money flowing into colorado

1192
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,240
honestly saved a lot of small

1193
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,560
contracting businesses it turned our

1194
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,519
town around it made trinidad colorado a

1195
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,838
different town

1196
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,358
that place used to be dusty and barely

1197
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:04,960
existing and no disrespect

1198
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,199
it was falling apart it was old and

1199
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,720
dying there's a ton of replication

1200
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:13,358
exactly that um you can just

1201
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,799
google what mary legalpot did to

1202
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,078
trinidad colorado

1203
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,599
yeah there's uh at least one

1204
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:25,440
really good interview with their sheriff

1205
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,920
where he states i didn't like the idea

1206
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,119
i was kind of against it but my hand was

1207
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,318
forced

1208
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,960
and it's revitalized the town

1209
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:37,119
um places that went from like an annual

1210
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,880
budget of a couple of thousand

1211
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,880
have a budget of a couple of million now

1212
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,280
what's before a little pocket above

1213
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,000
colorado springs the one with only two

1214
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,680
shops

1215
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,838
uh two stores in it manitou springs yeah

1216
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:56,078
um is this little gem in colorado where

1217
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,239
it was like locals it was the the cool

1218
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,200
spot to take your date when you were 25

1219
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:00,479
in colorado

1220
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,559
a little hippy spot a little mountain

1221
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,119
hippie town

1222
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,199
wonderful food great scene great place

1223
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,079
to hang out in the spring and fall

1224
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:11,439
but super duper poor falling apart

1225
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,560
crumbling

1226
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,400
hadn't seen reinvestment or or a tax win

1227
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,159
fall in 30 years 50 years some [ __ ]

1228
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,440
there's there are two marijuana stores

1229
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,358
that they allow

1230
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,760
and the taxes they bring in have paved

1231
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:29,598
like most of the streets

1232
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,520
it's it's really really cool to see and

1233
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,599
the crazy thing is is this is all

1234
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,000
business that's already happening

1235
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,318
it's it's not business that we have to

1236
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,880
invent it's it's just removing it from a

1237
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:40,960
black

1238
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,559
untaxed and unregulated market into a

1239
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,199
legal one

1240
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,159
and man you can do so much good with

1241
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,480
that money

1242
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,000
this town is better this town wasn't a

1243
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,519
super shitty town it was kind of on the

1244
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,039
verge of like is it going to make it or

1245
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,440
is it going to fall apart

1246
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,679
and when cannabis came people like i

1247
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,599
said all those 13 1400 people they got

1248
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,519
jobs but not only did they get jobs but

1249
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,599
there are owners and investors that show

1250
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,440
up in their bmws and porsches

1251
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,640
they come here and they want to eat here

1252
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,240
and they don't want to eat at all the

1253
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:09,118
old and no offense the old restaurants

1254
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,239
they were here i'm not going to list

1255
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,200
them i was going to bash some of them

1256
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:11,838
but they don't want to eat at those

1257
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:13,439
places

1258
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:14,880
they want the fancy [ __ ] so now the

1259
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,159
riverwalk area's got all kinds of new

1260
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,599
fancy restaurants

1261
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,199
now the north end of town where we go

1262
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,559
shopping has all kinds of new cool

1263
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,159
places because the owners

1264
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,159
and their wives and their kids all want

1265
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,519
to go shopping and do fancy [ __ ]

1266
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,960
some of the owners are ladies too i just

1267
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:28,318
made it that all the owners are men i

1268
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,880
apologize for that a lot of them are

1269
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:30,000
ladies

1270
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,160
but they want to go shopping they want

1271
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,679
to get their food so we're getting more

1272
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,879
stuff here because of cannabis

1273
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:36,559
things used to close at like eight

1274
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,920
o'clock now you get till 10 here i know

1275
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,279
that's not extravagant but you get until

1276
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,559
10 to get food now

1277
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,920
this is one of the things that [ __ ]

1278
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,679
with me so much when i moved here

1279
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,720
everything closed at 7 30.

1280
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,399
yeah but uh little by little and ice

1281
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,838
legal cannabis has so much to do with

1282
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,800
this and it's

1283
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:55,039
it's not like it was a magic bullet his

1284
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,599
pueblo was on a slow decline and had

1285
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,440
been for 30 or 40 years

1286
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,640
since the steel mill went from employing

1287
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,760
50 000 to 1.5 000

1288
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,879
um since then the town's been on a slow

1289
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,520
decline

1290
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,400
and legal cannabis we're on a slow

1291
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:12,400
incline now

1292
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,920
we're slowly working back up every

1293
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,680
couple of months

1294
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,079
[ __ ] gets a tiny bit better um

1295
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,759
look every six months you'll notice oh

1296

1301
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,119
whole city's coming back and it's

1302
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,480
legal cannabis is the lifeblood doing it

1303
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,640

south 45 minutes north of us yeah pueblo

1312

1321
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,679

uh jobs the people that have jobs in the

1331
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,119
cannabis industry would be doing

1332
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:21,838
that a lot of us would just be doing

1333
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,200
crime

1334
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:27,199
it's that it's huge demographic yeah

1335
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,239
yeah we went from the black market to

1336
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:30,159
doing it on a

1337
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,679
on a time clock paying taxes doing it

1338
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,639
under cameras

1339
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,440
it's it's there's no good count on how

1340
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:37,759
many people

1341
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,440
the the black market for cannabis

1342
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,599
employs

1343
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,838
but if you take the numbers i was given

1344
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,880
earlier the 35 to 50 billion dollar

1345
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:46,960
range that's

1346
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,720
the the same size as the cosmetics

1347
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,800
market in the u.s

1348
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,078
so if you think about all the lipstick

1349
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,920
and the eyeliner

1350
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,800
and the the rouge and the lip gloss and

1351
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,838
the [ __ ]

1352
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,599
shampoo and lotion and all that and you

1353
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,759
take all the people it takes to make

1354
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,440
all those products and to market those

1355
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,760
products and distribute them

1356
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,079
and put them on store shelves and to

1357
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,560
check you out at the register and

1358

1359
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,039
all that same amount of people but

1360
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,118
they're illegal pot growers and dealers

1361
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:22,639
and traffickers and

1362

1393
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,759
[ __ ] nervous dude

1394
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:38,960
it just it's my favorite example when

1395
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,359
people

1396
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,358
try to attack legalization in colorado

1397
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,358
because one of the

1398
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:48,400
the negative numbers that's gone up a

1399
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:50,159
little is the grow busts

1400
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,160
um over the last couple of years since

1401
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:55,358
the legalization the cops are busting

1402
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:57,519
a larger number it grows but uh

1403
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:59,279
possession and consumption arrests are

1404
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,920
down by six thousand

1405
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,160
and so it's it went up by like 150 but

1406
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,280
it went down by 6 000.

1407
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:09,279
um but uh they talk about

1408
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,920
growing pot in the house in a trap house

1409
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,240
like it's a new concept

1410
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,480
it was so common it was a [ __ ] hit tv

1411
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,519
show back in 2006. we got a clip

1412
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,119
from the busts that i have seen uh

1413
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,199
what is it televised or talked about on

1414
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,559
the news broadcasted shared whatever

1415
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,639
there's a word for it that i'm missing

1416
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,400
it'll come to me uh from what i've seen

1417
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:29,679
most of those are from people who came

1418
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,960
from other places

1419
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,639
because they thought let's go to

1420
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,599
colorado weeds illegal they didn't even

1421
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,679
bother to

1422
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,880
they didn't read the rule book they

1423
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:38,318
showed up and they hung up lights and

1424
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,599
[ __ ] planted a bunch of seeds or

1425
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:45,440
bought a bunch of clones and got

1426
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,440
going didn't realize legal doesn't

1427
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,839
the black market operates the that's how

1428
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,520
they produce their product is they

1429
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,239
they try to grow it somewhere where they

1430
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:57,440
don't think anyone will know or care

1431
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:59,439
and i guess in florida because a lot of

1432
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,519
growers when they first started busting

1433
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,440
illegal house girls were from florida i

1434
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,079
wasn't going to say but i let you do it

1435
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,720
they published down in the papers in the

1436
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,359
news

1437
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,959
published colorado legalized uh cannabis

1438
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:14,318
but they didn't smart

1439
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,159
in my word had six months of meetings

1440
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,239
where everybody in town learned what the

1441
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,759
rules were gonna be first

1442
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,439
so they thought they could get away with

1443
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,720
just renting the place and filling it

1444
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,559
with plants

1445
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,480
everybody that saw it was like wait a

1446
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,640
second i don't remember no

1447
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,000
city meeting or no notice saying they

1448
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,400
were going to put a marijuana business

1449
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,119
there i that that that's shady

1450
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,318
just stand out like a sore thumb they

1451
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,400

1452
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:43,079
just an update a fire department cost

1453

00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,199
of

1496
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,720
a lot of the baggage that came with it

1497
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,078
um

1498
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:00,239

homework you you won't have

1500
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:04,239
too much of a an uphill battle becoming

1501
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,519
a candidate

1502
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:09,759
cannabis advocate um know that once you

1503

do it that's sort of your cross for life

1504
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,119
though

1505
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:15,440

1508

my picture on the front of the newspaper

1512

um one of the very first times i went

1513
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,000
and spoke at a public meeting

1514
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,000
they had me on the very front page of

1515

the chieftain the next [ __ ] morning

1516
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,559
oh man how nerve-wracking

1517
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:43,040
yeah it was just a reminder that the the

1518
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,119
squeaky wheel gets greased

1519
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,558
so i love waking up to text messages and

1520

1523
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:51,519
picture of me looking blazed as [ __ ] at

1524

1526
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,480
picture of me

1527
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:57,759
a lady resigned at city council she's

1528
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,599
like i'd like to announce today that

1529
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,520
this is my last meeting i am resigning

1530
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,760
i'm stepping down from my position

1531
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,119
and a lot of people uh i didn't i wasn't

1532
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,240
too involved in city council but i knew

1533
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,079
at the time that people

1534
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:10,000
hated her i was like i've seen posters

1535
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,359
about basically [ __ ] this lady

1536
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
and she just quit and so i made this

1537
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:15,679
face of like oh [ __ ] she just quit

1538
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,280
and they took a picture of me right as i

1539
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:18,239
was like oh damn that [ __ ] just quit in

1540
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,000
front of everybody

1541
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:21,279
and they just posted that picture on the

1542
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,358
[ __ ] newspaper and i was like oh

1543
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,400
that's a dumbass picture of me

1544
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:30,639
it's that whole incident

1545
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:33,039
taught me a lot about local politics

1546
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,719
one of our local trash companies and

1547
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:37,440
it's not like they're a special business

1548
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,879
so they had magic resources or a lot of

1549
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,679
people or employees

1550
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,280
to pull up on it was just two or three

1551
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:44,399
people that got really pissed about

1552
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,480
something

1553
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,838
and spent enough time on facebook and

1554
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,599
talking to people in their life

1555
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:53,279
to to get 25 or 30 people to show up on

1556
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,400
on monday night

1557
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:59,519
like every other monday night for like

1558
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,559
seven or eight times and so it took a

1559
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,480
couple of months

1560
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,319
it took a lot of people showing up over

1561
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,318
and over and over again

1562
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:08,079
but after two or three months of this

1563
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:11,519
group showing up every week

1564
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,839
or every other week when they met um

1565
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,599
their message got hurt and i think three

1566
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,159
people resigned

1567
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,920
like it was a major overhaul of city

1568
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,000
government at that point

1569
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,240
um in retrospect i really should have

1570
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,079
gone for one of the open seats

1571
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:28,078
but uh i told you

1572
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,358
it really taught me that politics is all

1573
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,839
perception

1574
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:39,039
and if you can get it doesn't take that

1575
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:42,318
many if you can get

1576
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:44,318
15 or 20 or 30 people to show up

1577
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:46,079
and if you can all do something the same

1578
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:46,880
you'll really scare the [ __ ] out of

1579
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,200
people

1580
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,480
so if we can all wear neon green

1581
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,519
t-shirts or

1582
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,079
royal blue t-shirts they don't even have

1583
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:55,280
to say

1584
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,280
something you don't even have to take

1585
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,079
the time to throw a stencil across

1586
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,200
it and print like we don't like how you

1587
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,960
haul trash or

1588
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,439
legalize pot or whatever on them they

1589
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,119
can just all be neon green

1590
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,798
and hi you know me and all the people in

1591
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,440
matching shirts behind me are here to

1592
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:11,280
say

1593
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,639
we should legalize pot and we're going

1594
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,400
to come back every week and say that

1595
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,798
until you do

1596
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,000
and the first week everybody's like sure

1597
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:19,759
you are

1598
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,519
in the next meeting everybody's like oh

1599
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,119
they came back he

1600
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,280
and by the fifth meeting they're like

1601
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,519
[ __ ] like what happens

1602
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,280
if more people start showing up is

1603
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,280
because the news was talking to that guy

1604
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,720
before the meeting

1605
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,359
and you know i i saw him last

1606
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:38,318
after the last meeting on the news too

1607
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:40,480
all of a sudden

1608
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,838
your little group and whatever your

1609
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,400
issue is is getting

1610
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:49,519
major major time during the conversation

1611
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,519
and that's when [ __ ] really changes um

1612
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:53,679
colorado tried to legalize before we got

1613
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:57,280
it done and we failed hard

1614
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:59,199
and but we moved the conversation and

1615
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,559
now that we are where we are as a

1616
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:04,000
country

1617
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:05,839
like you're there it's if if places like

1618
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,559
new york and new jersey can convince

1619
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:10,798
their legislators that

1620
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,240
getting legalization done in one form or

1621
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:14,239
another

1622
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:16,959
is important even if we don't get it

1623
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:18,959
perfect we can always go back and adjust

1624
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,000
if we can get movement in one or two

1625
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,440
more states we

1626
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,119
we're it's over we're there

1627
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,318
