65
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,930
been getting a lot of requests for

66
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:31,020
detailed information about my feeding

67
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,700
mix and my nutrient recipes I mentioned

68
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,469
before that I use veg bloom as a base

69
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:36,479
I've mentioned that I add in some new

70
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:38,069
millennium products since I went on the

71
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,929
dude grow show and mentioned my mix

72
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,180
since I mentioned some of my mix on my

73
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,150
podcast I get at least two or three

74
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,120
emails every single day asking about my

75
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,030
mix so in the future I will do a fully

76
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,950
detailed episode on what I'm using for

77
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,449
veg bloom and new millennium and a

78
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,458
couple of other things I'll give you

79
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,439
some very good ideas some very thorough

80
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,719
information on my nutrient mix and

81
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,639
options for your setup when I do

82
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,500
episodes that are really in-depth like

83
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,239
that and I feel like a lot of people are

84
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,849
going to cling to every word and follow

85
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,830
my advice very closely I do my best to

86
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,289
make sure to give accurate information

87
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,790
so this episode will take me a little

88
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:16,738
bit of time to put together but it will

89
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:19,469
be worth your wait so in the near future

90
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:22,139
you will get a nutrient recipe episode

91
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,030
that is mainly focused on what I mix in

92
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,219
a home grow and in a commercial

93
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:27,699
environment now please keep in mind I

94
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,410
said it's going to take me a little bit

95
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,089
to create those episodes they are going

96
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,520
to be very detailed I want them to be

97
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:35,289
very accurate so please be patient but I

98
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,539
will make it worth your wait all right

99
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,250
now let's move into this email that I've

100
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,379
got sitting here in front of me recently

101
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,600
I did an episode about carbon filters

102
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:46,089
and carbon filter placement we got a

103
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
great email from a listener who wanted

104
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:49,779
to add on some advice to that

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,509
information and I definitely encourage

106
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:54,399
and welcome updated information if I say

107
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:56,199
something on the show and you agree or

108
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,659
disagree or if you've got something to

address is grow from your heart at

117
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,199
hotmail.com this listener sent the email

118
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:19,360
that goes like this hey Rasta Jeff I

119
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,979
listen to the carbon filter episode and

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,650
I thought I would chime in with a couple

121
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,410
of things I am any location that

122
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:28,659
requires absolutely zero smell and they

123
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,420
put zero in all capitals so they mean

124
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,340
zero smell which in my experience is

125
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,410
pretty difficult to achieve yes if

126
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:38,019
you're growing dank herb zero smell is

127
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,490
difficult to achieve even veg plants put

128
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:41,620
off a very distinct aroma

129
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,780
it smells like growing vegetation as

130
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,000
soon as you flip the flower you start

131
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:48,250
putting off that dank aroma so sometimes

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,680
it is pretty difficult to achieve zero

133
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,199
smell with a carbon filter we can

134
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,519
minimise aromas with careful duct tape

135
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,889
and careful caulking we can absolutely

136
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:59,379
minimize aromas this person has some

137
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,719
great contributions it says even with a

138
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:03,790
24 inch carbon filter for a six-inch fan

139
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,980
I was catching a whiff of sweet dankness

140
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,470
outside of my discharge point which

141
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,180
happens to be outside for me which now

142
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,850
that means a lot of people have access

143
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,930
to that smell maybe you've got it near a

144
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,850
part of the house where you think no

145
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,530
one's gonna go there but you never know

146
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,540
what happens sometimes the kid hits a

147
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:21,369
baseball it bounces three times it lands

148
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,629
right there by that duct or that vent

149
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,340
that little kid runs over there to get

150
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:26,290
the baseball and he goes damn it smells

151
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:28,449
dank over here little kids nowadays know

152
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,860
what dank weed smells like you're busted

153
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,259
it only takes something simple and

154
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,300
stupid like that so zero aroma is the

155
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,459
goal for this listener and here is some

156
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,770
of the advice that they sent us it says

157
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:41,560
one of the ways I corrected the issue

158
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:44,229
was to use rope caulk easily found in

159
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,480
Home Improvement Center to seal all of

160
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,220
the joints in my ductwork this is super

161
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,590
important and then I added another

162
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,290
carbon filter at the discharge point

163
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:55,539
just in case so this guy's got air going

164
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,220
in through a carbon filter and also out

165
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,650
through a carbon filter at the other end

166
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,950
so he is double scrubbing the air and is

167
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:04,449
also using rope caulk on every joint so

168
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:06,639
you're typically going to have your

169
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,469
carbon filter and then your blower you

170
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,210
need to caulk between there then you

171
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,530
will have your blower and probably some

172
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:14,079
duct work you will need to caulk between

173
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:16,000
the blower and the ducting wherever that

174
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,300
ducting attaches you need to caulk that

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,089
as well if you have more parts caulk all

176
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,600
of that if you've got a grow light with

177
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:27,250
glass between the bulb and the canopy so

178
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,840
that that grow light is sealed too you

179
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,240
can move air over and cool those lights

180
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:34,239
you probably need to seal all of that up

181
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,699
with caulking as well if zero aroma is

182
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,978
your goal you cannot be too careful I

183
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:41,319
would put some type of sealant on every

184
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:43,779
joint VIN I would wrap that again with

185
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,939
duct tape just to make sure if zero

186
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:48,189
aroma is the goal we want to go extreme

187
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:50,439
and make sure that zero aroma escapes

188
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:52,240
this grow space now when I was talking

189
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,069
about sealing up the light we need to be

190
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,750
careful if we have got a ducted light

191
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:58,089
hood we need to carefully seal that

192
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,240
glass think about it this way you've got

193
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:03,099
plants directly under that light and you

194
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,960
were blowing air over that light if

195
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,150
there is a gap where air can get in or

196
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,889
out that is a spot for aroma to

197
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:10,509
essentially get sucked right into that

198
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,819
and blown right out of your grow space

199
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:16,060
that did not get filtered we want any

200
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:17,918
air that enters that tube that exit path

201
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,079
to run through that filter at the

202
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,449
beginning and have no chance of entering

203
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,490
the grow room or collecting more air

204
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,610
through gaps on the way down that tube

205
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,740
then this listener also places another

206
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,320
carbon filter which I'm sure he's using

207
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,899
more sealant on that joint as well at

208
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,490
the very end at his exit point now if

209
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:38,588
you don't have another carbon filter at

210
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,049
that end I highly recommend some sort of

211
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:43,360
a screen at least a pantyhose or some

212
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,579
type of thin cover just to prevent

213
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,019
anything from coming in your ductwork I

214
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,850
don't know how high off the ground your

215
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:51,220
ductwork is I don't know how low your

216
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,839
ductwork is but I have seen weird [ __ ]

217
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,060
happened with duct work that was not

218
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,329
covered I have seen birds fly into duct

219
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:57,248
work

220
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:58,988
it was up high I've seen snakes and

221
00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:00,790
reptiles climb into ductwork that was

222
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:02,259
down low I've walked into a grow room

223
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:03,639
before that's got sealed lights and

224
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:05,230
there was a snake just chilling in the

225
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:06,579
grow hood because it was warm as [ __ ]

226
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,199
and that snake was a loving life right

227
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:09,849
there he just climbed right down the

228
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,838
ducting climbed into the light hood and

229
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,670
just chilled out like hey this is

230
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,809
beautiful here and it was a pain in the

231
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:15,578
ass to get him out because we had to

232
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:17,169
undo all the ducting just to get to him

233
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:19,269
then some [ __ ] had to reach in there

234
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:20,828
and get a snake out don't put yourself

235
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:22,178
in that position you don't want a snake

236
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:24,008
in your grow room you don't want a

237
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:25,838
reptile in your grow room make sure you

238
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,399
seal the end of that ducting also

239
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,139
insects like to come up there it's nice

240
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,639
and warm they feel that warm air coming

241
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:32,769
out they think it's warm it's got to be

242
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,389
nice in there it's probably the Sun

243
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:36,039
setting it's getting colder outside they

244
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,298
look there's still Sun in there and they

245
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:38,588
want to go in there and find some food

246
00:09:37,298 --> 00:09:40,778
or maybe find something to mate with

247
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:43,449
they want to go where the warm is don't

248
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:45,129
invite them cover that [ __ ] up also if

249
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:47,078
you were using one of those portable air

250
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:49,329
conditioners that has the ducting in and

251
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,248
the ducting out cover the ducting on

252
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:53,378
that with something but make sure you

253
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:55,298
use something that does not restrict the

254
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:57,009
air flow because you will ruin that air

255
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:58,958
conditioner it needs to be covered with

256
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:01,089
something that allows air flow but will

257
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,188
not allow pets to come in or out a very

258
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:05,589
thin screen something with a very fine

259
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:07,509
micron mesh I like to use those HIPPA

260
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,309
filters they saw them in many different

261
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,048
sizes you can cut them to size and then

262
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,428
you can just use a staple gun to staple

263
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:13,778
them right wherever you need them put a

264
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,730
little duct tape over the edge so it

265
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:17,619
stops fraying but make sure you cover

266
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,839
all your ins and outs we don't need bugs

267
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:21,369
coming in we don't need bugs climbing on

268
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,829
our plants and we certainly don't want

269
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:25,569
some sort of reptiles in our grow room I

270
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:26,769
don't know maybe you do but if you do

271
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:27,909
want a reptile in there you probably

272
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:29,918
brought it in there already you don't

273
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:31,509
want to just showing up on [ __ ]

274
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:33,399
surprise that's gonna freak you out so

275
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:36,009
cover up your [ __ ] be careful but the

276
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,230
point is make sure to not let any aroma

277
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,938
escape that grow room so on all of the

278
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,579
stuff I talked about on the previous

279
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:44,828
episode replace all of those seals with

280
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:46,688
some type of sealant or some type of

281
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:48,519
caulking this person recommends rope

282
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,980
caulk and he says you can get it at any

283
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,659
hardware store I would put a nice solid

284
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,970
layer of rope caulk then I would also

285
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:57,879
cover it with duct tape just because

286
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,559
I've got some solid OCD now there is a

287
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,139
little bit more to this message it says

288
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:04,480
personally I like this setup because if

289
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:06,730
one filter starts to fail the other will

290
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,278
help to minimize the odor until I can

291
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,759
fix the problem hey man I like the

292
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:11,110
mindful

293
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,939
and I like the fourth thought great

294
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,129
thinkin it goes on to say I have not

295
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,990
experienced any negatives to running two

296
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:18,429
filters no I don't think you will as

297
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,870
long as your blower is able to handle it

298
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,469
there will be that will be a [ __ ]

299
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,720
good idea

300
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,690
then it says safe discrete and odorless

301
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,820
has no price tag that is the truth that

302
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,519
extra carbon filter that stronger blower

303
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,528
is way more affordable than a lawyer way

304
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,299
more affordable than bail and way more

305
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:36,220
affordable than having a felony on your

306
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:37,990
record for the rest of your life so buy

307
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,509
that extra carbon filter and do the

308
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,909
extra work he wraps up the message with

309
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:45,490
made sure to hug my mom on mom's day and

310
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:46,838
then he signed it with the milkman hey

311
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,089
milkman thank you for the great message

312
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,639
and thank you for the great contribution

313
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,949
to the podcast I do appreciate updates

314
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,240
and information like that and again if

315

anybody out there would like to send me

316
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,829
an email my email address is grow from

317

contributions all right I've got one

320
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:07,599
more email in front of me then we're

321
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,430
going to get to the YouTube comments

322
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,750
I've never read YouTube comments before

323
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,719
on the show we're gonna start that on

324
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,339
this episode this email goes like this

325
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,019
it says hey I can't thank you enough for

326
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,180
the incredible content and knowledge

327
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:20,948
that you share that's a great way to

328
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:22,629
start a message it goes on to say I

329
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,609
learned something each and every time

330
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,990
that I listen to one of your shows and

331
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,699
that is the point that's what I'm trying

332
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,889
to do so that makes me feel good knowing

333
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:31,838
that I'm reaching my goal it goes on to

334
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,089
say I've recently started my first grow

335
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,370
it's turned into a slightly controlled

336
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:38,949
disaster that's oftentimes how first

337
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,049
grows go he says but finding your show

338
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:43,000
and documenting my grow gave me a lot of

339
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:45,039
great knowledge that I can take forward

340
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,230
to make the next one more successful

341
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,448
that is the perfect attitude you learned

342
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,069
how to [ __ ] up a grow now you can learn

343
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:52,328
how not to [ __ ] up a girl you got to

344
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:54,129
start somewhere man so you've got the

345
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:57,009
great attitude you were on the right

346
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:58,720
path it goes on to say I recently signed

347
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,789
up for the four dollar and twenty cent

348
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,940
level on patreon if you're going to

349
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:06,189
shout me out use darren w that would be

350
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,230
appreciated i'm in a legal country but

351
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,930
my work would likely frown upon micro

352
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,399
interest whether it's legal or not all

353

left this comment six days ago the comic

399
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:41,769
goes a lot like this you're the man RJ

400
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:44,919
and RJ stands for Rasta Jeff

401
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:46,990
he says you help so many I was the same

402
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,669
way in school but the way you teach is

403
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,068
super engaging and what he's referring

404
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:53,259
to is in an episode I said that I hated

405
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:54,818
school but I love to learn so I had to

406
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,919
find a way to entertain myself while I

407
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:58,899
was learning so he agrees he was the

408
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,578
same way but the way that I teach is

409
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,438
super engaging that means a lot to me

410
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:04,269
thank you he goes on to say thank you

411
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:06,639
for all of your efforts and a huge thank

412
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:09,129
you for all the awesome genetics sudhir

413
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,379
so welcome those compliments mean a lot

414
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:13,028
to me so that makes it all worth it all

415
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:15,220
the hard work all the late nights

416
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:17,019
podcasting all the frustration all the

417
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,670
research all the writing all the time

418
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,798
all the energy that this makes it worth

419
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:22,389
it right here it goes on to say I've

420
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:24,548
popped mini beans but all have been

421
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:27,039
bagged seeds so I finally got my hands

422
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,990
on some legit beans and man everyone is

423
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,998
right when they say genetics are the

424
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,249
most important part and yeah I

425
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:36,069
definitely can't agree with that after

426
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:37,600
this grow I'm on at the moment keep it

427
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,099
up and I'm

428
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,720
glad you finally got some quality

429
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,639
genetics and I'm sure you're going to

430
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,920
see a huge difference in vigor and

431
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,600
performance and also just knowing what

432
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,789
you've got what you're working with will

433
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,860
make the grow so much easier and so much

434
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:52,599
more enjoyable so I hope you enjoyed the

435
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,269
new genetics and I hope those come out

436
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,339
beautifully for you and I also hope to

437
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:59,289

438
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:01,300

somebody who called themselves smoke why

443
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,600

512
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,779
is learning from this little podcast

513
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:39,279
that means a lot to me I am teaching

514
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:41,319
people who were going to school for

515
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,149
plant science degrees that makes me

516
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:44,558
proud that lets me know that I'm really

517
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,880

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,600
school man keep going I know school can

520
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:51,429
be a struggle I did not enjoy school

521
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,199
like I said earlier I love learning

522
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:55,330
school is just not the environment for

523
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,429
me there are more great comments this

524
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:59,349
one says hey Rasta Jeff just curious

525
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:01,840
about your thoughts on using a sorbic

526
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:04,389
acid to neutralize chloramine in tap

527
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,699
water that may be effective in a small

528
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,259
grow but now you've got a sorbic acid in

529
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,360
your water I think your pH is gonna be a

530
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:12,730
little bit out of whack I think our O

531
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:14,589
filtration may be the best if not the

532
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,860
only way to effectively get that out for

533
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:19,839
commercial production our next comment

534

00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,819
got more great comments this one says

550
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:53,710
I've bought I read genetics from Oregon

551
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:55,899
elite and hella dank both have good

552
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:59,259
service but Oregon elite has freebies

553
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,690
now hella dank has freebies also have no

554
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:03,099
fear get your gear I've never said that

555
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,140
before that's catchy I'm gonna keep

556
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:07,480
saying that the next comment is

557
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,429
somebody who calls themselves the Lynx

558
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,039
grows and shows that's a cool name it

559
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:14,920
says is bebop the same cross as blue

560
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:18,369
raspberry truffle no it is the exact

561
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,170
opposite bebop is a rise cross the

562
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:21,969
blueberry cookies the male was the

563
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,759
reverse blueberry cookies and the seeds

564
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,700
are feminized the blue raspberry truffle

565
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,069
the male was the arize and those seeds

566
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,600
are regular so it is the exact opposite

567
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:32,829
I hope I said that correctly because I

568
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,939
don't have any notes in front of me and

569
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:35,199
I tried to keep all that [ __ ] straight

570
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,740
but I think you guys know what I mean

571
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,000
they are opposites the comments keep

572
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,620

602
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:39,759
to hear that my sponsors and my vendors

603
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,200

things properly so that's a great

605
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,130
complement to them then there's a

606
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:47,259
comment here on the episode I did about

607
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,240
mushrooms in Denver it says you can take

608
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:51,400
too many I ate about an ounce one night

609
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,200
well that yeah that is too many that may

610
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,730
be too many for a lot of people went

611
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,370
into seizures and started vomiting

612
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,500
profusely obviously lived and was fine

613
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,789
but the rest of that night sucked dick

614
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,169
yeah that sounds like a miserable

615
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:05,259
experience that comes from our friend a

616
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:08,230
be my advice there don't eat a goddamn

617
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:10,298
ounce of mushrooms I'm a soldier I like

618
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,220
a spiritual experience I like to go

619
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:15,700
heroic and ounce of mushrooms just

620
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,569
sounds like a bad idea the next comment

drop a line and let you know how the

648
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:08,079
dark period worked out for me the buds

649
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:10,298
plumped up and the trichomes multiplied

650
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,538
