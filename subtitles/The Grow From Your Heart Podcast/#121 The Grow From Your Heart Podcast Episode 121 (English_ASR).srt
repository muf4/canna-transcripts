planned for Denver over the 4/20 weekend

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,519
Denver said no they did not issue the

50
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,100
permits that were needed high times

51
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:25,969
response was to move the cannabis cup to

52
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:28,189
Pueblo Colorado yeah that's where we are

53

here because of research there you go

76
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,659

117
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:29,079
a it's good at unique smell very unique

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,418
smell I don't even know how to describe

119
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,069
that uh it almost reminded me of a

120
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:34,448
specific terpenoid I can't remember

121
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:39,490
which one we decided it smelled like

122
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:40,900
anymore blend a little little Lin Ahlul

123
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,400
thank you for the heads up there I can

124
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,349
never remember the name of Lin Elul it's

125
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,388
always the one that I forget there herb

126
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,729
smells like it's got a lot of Lin Ahlul

127
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,840
in it anyway we're choking over here cuz

128
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:52,959
we're getting high I'm smoking some

129
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,759
perfects our death star wax shadow to

130
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,949
the Terp ex crew all right we're gonna

131
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,469
do a podcast about selecting a male

132
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,240
plant for breeding if you're if you're

133
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,919
trying to breed some seeds there are a

134
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,530
few things to look for in a male plant

135
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:07,930
so let's say you buy yourself a 10 pack

136
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:09,129
I would do it to 10 packs if you're

137
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,449
trying to do a female hunt to find a

138
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:12,430
male but not everybody's got the room

139
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:14,139
try to do at least two 10 packs there's

140
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,389
power in numbers when you're hunting the

141
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,769
more plants the better I agree 20 to 50

142
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,168
is a good number right you can usually

143
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:22,779
find super plants in 20 to 50 just

144
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:24,490
astounding keepers they stand out yeah

145
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,739
and if you can't do that many at a time

146
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,019
just do them in phases do 10 find a

147
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,478
keeper out of that 10 do 10 more find

148
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:32,889
the best out of those 2 or that yeah out

149
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:34,629
of those 10 and then you got to to stack

150
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:36,009
up against each other keep doing it

151
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:37,930
until your room is full and it's not

152
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,909
eliminating [ __ ] that's right I even

153
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,918
sometimes I do it from seeds right out

154
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,120
of the gate you can kind of tell you

155
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:43,959
know you have those seeds that just look

156
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,610
like they're gonna have a hard time

157
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,598
they're gonna struggle and you can tell

158
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,150
whenever they open the shell they have

159
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:50,469
the little tiny leaves or sometimes are

160
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:51,909
mutated or doesn't look as strong or

161
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,180
vibrant as the others I just go ahead

162
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,310
and chuck them as a breeder as somebody

163
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,840
who is I've read a lot of plants and if

164
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,579
you were looking for a male plant you're

165
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,989
going to have to learn to get rid of

166
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:04,329
some plants and not be too attached to

167
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,590
your babies be ruthless yes be ruthless

168
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,649
these are not humans these are little

169
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:08,869
baby plants and you were

170
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:10,668
creating the future of cannabis if you

171
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,668
do not pull those ugly little [ __ ]

172
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:15,709
you are going to ruin and [ __ ] up and

173
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:18,319
you're gonna [ __ ] the progression of

174
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,728
cannabis that's exactly the genetics

175
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,079
down yes you are and we don't want to do

176
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:23,060
that we're breeding to improve the

177
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,769
genetics so if you have a plant you

178
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,089
start a bunch of seeds you got a couple

179
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:27,589
that are kind of wonky looking you got

180
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,719
one with the [ __ ] up leave don't be

181
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:33,109
afraid to get rid of it right as they

182
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,310
grow keep a good eye on them so before

183
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,800
we get to that part let's talk about

184
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,600
what the male plant is going to bring to

185
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,879
our breeding project when we hit a male

186
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,120
plant with pollen - a female plant that

187
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,610
accepts pollen that has pistols it's

188
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,459
going to create seeds that are going to

189
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,590
have traits of both plants what is the

190
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:53,689
male mostly going to bring to the table

191
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:57,109
here I feel like it's going to bring a

192
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:59,449
lot of the pest resistance and a lot of

193
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,580
the vigour and a lot of the shape that's

194
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:03,410
it that's a literally a lot of what it

195
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:04,758
is the hybrid vigor and in and without

196
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,430
that male side of the family you really

197
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,620
can't catch that true hard vigor like

198
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,050
that um I always tell people all the

199
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,788
time you know you can't create you know

200
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:18,860
Halle Berry's by eliminating half

201
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:20,899
gameful I like the way you put that

202
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,340
people catch on there alright so yeah we

203
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,009
need the male to bring back good

204
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:26,509
structure and the resistance I think a

205
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:28,098
lot of the flavor comes from Mama it

206
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:29,990
comes from the girl so when you're

207
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:32,329
looking for structure and shape a lot of

208
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,090
it is gonna come from the boy so now we

209
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:37,519
could talk a little bit about what to

210
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:40,339
look for in a male plant I keep saying

211
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,109
the structure I like a male plant if

212
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,369
you're breeding a sativa you're gonna

213
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,229
want one that gets a little bit taller

214
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,329
the meals are always gonna when you're

215
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:48,859
when you're in veg the males are always

216
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:51,259
gonna start taking off a little taller

217
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,150
their goal is to get above the females

218
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:55,009
so that when they pollinate their pollen

219
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:57,079
falls down on to the girl so that's a

220
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,728
good hint when they're growing in veg

221
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,560
look for that one that's taken off that

222
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,240
might be a boy for you absolutely

223
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,269
so you're looking for if you've got a

224
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,158
sativa you want the one that keeps not

225
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:08,149
too tall and doesn't take off too much

226
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:10,939
because you don't want to make your

227
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:11,989
progeny skyrocket immediately but you

228
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:14,089
want to find the one that's the right

229
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,400
shape of you almost want to find what

230
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:18,348
you want your girls to look like you

231
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,000
want the boy to look the shape to be

232
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:21,979
what you want your females to look like

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,290
what I think I'm trying to say so fine

234
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,670
look for that you want tight clothes

235
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,379
note spacing you don't want a whole

236
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,300
bunch of gaps between your branches I

237
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:31,969
don't like it when a plant spits out

238
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,288
really long branches like Tahoe say the

239
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,389
oh geez that was about to come right out

240
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:36,949
of my mouth the og family the whole

241
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,449
family over there on that side even

242
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,830
grape stomp Orochi and some of the other

243
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,509
ones that are hybrids most of them take

244
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,009
off because the boys like you're saying

245
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,110
the structure it comes from the male is

246
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:46,789
a perfect example Joseph the Joseph male

247
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:51,259
that gage uses everything they crossed

248
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:52,639
that great male by the way but it comes

249
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:54,259
out tall a lot of the times you get

250
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,850
mostly dominant phenotypes of stretchy

251
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,529
plants because the stretchy stretchy

252
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,019
with little popcorn balls coming off

253
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,370
everywhere it's a dominant og male and

254
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,990
that's that's what's going on there it's

255
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,179
that structures taken over the dominance

256
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,820
from that male plant in this do G

257
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:09,529
dominance and that og is always the

258
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,060
cushions have always had had that

259
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,740
dominance and it really there's an

260
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:14,389
Afghan Heritage's it's just a traceback

261
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,740
it's recessive Afghan genes that are

262
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:17,059
really strong and they're always gonna

263
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,740
come forward and breed true unless you

264
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:20,299
find a dominant gene from a different

265
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,399
side of the family that breeds just as

266
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:24,439
hard like something from blue dream for

267
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,149
example a good example of a good

268
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,770
breeding parent or white widow used to

269
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,389
be a really good breeding parent spread

270
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,639
the white widow with two other strains

271
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:33,289
and it does very well that's exactly and

272
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:36,740
that's what you're doing at that time

273
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:38,480
you take another s'ti of genotypes from

274
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,669
different parts of the world Brazil

275
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,700
South America things like that and then

276
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:45,979
diversifying them against things like og

277
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,990
cush is which are originally derivative

278
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,120
afghan places like that then mostly

279
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:54,379
purged into california east coast places

280
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,940
with coastlines and then out out a lot

281
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:58,399
of the stuff that started off in the

282
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,540
dutch genetics has those real thin

283
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,689
leaves because it was all bred for

284
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:04,579
indoor cultivations a lot of brazilian

285
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,380
institute genetics and in nepal and

286
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,080
things like that and Nepalese genetics

287
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:11,990
Moroccan genetics you see a lot of Spain

288
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,180
a lot of Spanish genetics that's where

289
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,799
you see an influx of that in Netherlands

290
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,909
so I wanna give a shot at the gauge

291
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,250
between genetics since we were talking

292
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:20,929
about the grape stopper OG there those

293
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,789
guys finally took home a cannabis cup

294
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:24,349
for the grape stopper good work guys

295
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:28,969
nothing but love and respect for egauge

296
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,050
congrats m4k mk4 and key play the whole

297
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,209
true they kind of help me get a little

298
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:33,469
start in the cannabis industry so much

299
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,899
much love much respect

300
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,550
for that so yeah look for something that

301
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,990
doesn't get too tall too crazy if you're

302
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:40,609
looking for an indica if you're trying

303
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,009
to breed an indica male find the

304
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,440
shortest stoutest [ __ ] dias one you can

305
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,230
find probably with those big fattest

306
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,360
leaves you can find the what there's

307
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,560
dinner-plate leaves if you can camp out

308
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,450
under those leaves if you can almost

309
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,069
make a hammock under those leaves that'd

310
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,350
be a sweet male to breed with if you're

311
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,120
looking for a nice indica plant so you

312
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,120
want something with nice nice tight

313
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,620
closed node spacing so if you can find a

314
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,810
male plant you got a flower about you

315
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,519
guys so you got to fetch them out start

316
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:08,959
looking for note their structure in veg

317
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,000
watch what they do you don't have to get

318
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,850
them too tall take a clone off of them

319
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,159
label the clone that matches the so

320
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,250
clone a to plant a clone be to plant be

321
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,809
flower your plants out see what they do

322
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,070
if you've got females and you're looking

323
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,449
for males you can just go ahead and toss

324
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,290
the females or you can finish them out

325
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,300
and have some buds

326
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:27,980
I will take my male plants and flower

327
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,870
them all the way out to see what they do

328
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,120
all the way to like seven eight maybe

329
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,679
nine weeks into flower I want to see if

330
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,029
they're gonna produce trichomes I want

331
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,009
to see if they're gonna produce a whole

332
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,659
bunch of pollen I want to see if they're

333
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:41,269
just some plants will only produce a

334
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:43,639
little bit of pollen as a breeder you

335
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,350
can see which pollen will be so there's

336
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,750
kind of grainy pollen I don't feel like

337
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,190
that pollens worth a [ __ ] it's the pre

338
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,500
pollen it's the pollen before your

339
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,270
plants actually start busting out that

340
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,769
real grainy dusty [ __ ] I don't think

341
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,029
that is good you want to let that if

342
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:58,250
you're gonna collect pollen let that

343
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,850
fall let that get away and then collect

344
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,620
that like it's about 14 days into the

345
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,810
pollen e pollination that's about 10 to

346
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,279
14 days into when they bust open that's

347
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,049
one of the really good pollen starts

348
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,100
coming out it's a little softer little

349
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:12,079
smoother to the touch

350
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,000
plants fully mature and in the flower at

351
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:20,270
that point yeah hormones are going and

352
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,980
over dirt he's doing it yeah so if

353
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:23,870
you're playing is producing trichomes

354
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,310
and a whole bunch of resin and has the

355
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,250
perfect structure you want to breed with

356
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:29,839
that I like to rub the stem and smell

357
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,389
the stem of my plants when my favorite

358
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,030
thing ah if it smells like puke it's a

359
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:36,799
good thing all those plant when you for

360
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:39,889
some reason to win it's got a hint of

361
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:42,409
bar trash can and vomit but that's a

362
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:43,759
good male to believe with it to me

363
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:45,289
that's it a lot of that when you smell

364
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,730
that stem and if he if the male you can

365
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:47,120
go across the board and say you have a

366
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,250
bunch

367
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,480
in a row from your phyno hunt that

368
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,250
you're doing put them all next to each

369
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,539
other sit down smell each one of them

370
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,460
side-by-side make sure you're cleaning

371
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,169
your hands each time fear really good

372
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,730
profile what each one's doing usually

373
00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:00,709
the one that stinks the worst is the

374
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,399
best one you use yeah typically and then

375
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,200
you judge

376
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,970
narrow it down by smell and then narrow

377
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,620
down by structure sight use all your

378
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,360
senses don't don't eliminate anything

379
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,250
you know feel free to take a leaf and

380
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,230
snap one off and taste the stem a little

381
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,309
bit if it's sour and tart tea and stuff

382
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,930
a lot of the times and you're using

383
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:16,789
hardly no nutrients at all it's a good

384
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:18,559
thing it's telling you I got a lot of

385
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:21,049
terpenes I got a lot to add to the table

386
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,459
and they're definitely the bail is

387
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:25,189
definitely going to contribute to the

388
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,259
flavor I think the mama definitely over

389
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,480
overwhelms the flavor category but the

390
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:32,539
male is going to contribute to the

391
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,009
amount of flavor you don't just use any

392
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:36,769
old male you want to use the best one

393
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:38,480
you can at any and all costs you know so

394
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,860
if you know that that's just one of

395
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,220
those things that we look for I think

396
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,810
yeah see so if you best a ten pack of

397
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,519
seeds you probably find you know maybe

398
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:48,679
five males hopefully you know five

399
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,028
females five males you're gonna toss two

400
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,979
of those right away one of them's gonna

401
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:54,458
be funky one of them's gonna be a runt

402
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:58,490
so those go away now you got three I

403
00:13:54,458 --> 00:14:00,139
think that I never use no I know I

404
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,539
personally know that I never used that

405
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,338
first plant to show me male flowers I

406
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:06,019
don't like to take that first one he's

407
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:07,910
too dominant I feel like he's going to

408
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,620
do too much to my breeding he's gonna

409
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:12,708
all the plants are gonna look like that

410
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,209
one if I've got three of them I kinda

411
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,519
would lean toward the third one to

412
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,958
flower if I've got five if I had five

413
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,458
males that worked well probably that

414
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,109
third or fourth one would be the one

415
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,269
that I would use I wouldn't go right for

416
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,490
that first one that busted out it's too

417
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,079
obvious me I always choose it honestly I

418
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,690
when I'm doing my breeding I always

419
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,339
choose it on it like like based on what

420
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,380
the mothers doing what I'm trying to do

421
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,360
if I'm trying to say like if I'm out

422
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:36,889
crossing like a blue dream or a sativa

423
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,300
or something close to it has a longer

424
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,620
flowering time and I want to come in

425
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:41,179
with an indica and actually shorten its

426
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,389
flowering time than then that's when I

427
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:45,739
would choose a male that it's bust out

428
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,569
first because I want to take that flower

429
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,490
and Tommy cut it really cut it down with

430
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,129
that dominant male yeah that's perfect

431
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:54,080
thing good but but if you say you have a

432
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:55,639
little indica dominant but you want to

433
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,580
make it a true hybrid and you want to

434
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,949
make it go a little bit long

435
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,690
in the garden say more if it's a 7/8

436
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,580
week and you want it to go more like 8 9

437
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,350
maybe 10 ish or something like that then

438
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,480
that's you know another reason you'd go

439
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,790
with a longer flowering male same same

440
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,259
same instance vice versa and don't be

441
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:13,449
afraid to have plants that flower for a

442
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:15,490
long time you guys I know 9 10 and 11

443
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,379
week sounds like scary flowering times

444
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,629
but I've flowered plants for 14 and 15

445
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:21,580
weeks and what happens is amazing once

446
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,679
they get that right that's far in the

447
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,780
Sour Diesel is a good example of that

448
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,189
going that long 1011 weeks on it but

449
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:28,389
it's well worth it in the end I mean

450
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,490
you're getting a connoisseur product

451
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:32,019
that you can't get anywhere else and the

452
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,789
test results will show you the rest for

453
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,990
and the harvest weights come through it

454
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:36,549
makes it well worth it

455
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,919
but I had an African landrace that

456
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:40,809
didn't have a name and it grew colás I

457
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,729
cut it down at week 14 and the coals

458
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,929
were bigger than my legs I think I think

459
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,620
it's the biggest complication with all

460
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:48,969
growers uh young to old is patience yeah

461
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,129
I think it's the hardest thing we all

462
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,350
have to overcome just in life that's it

463
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:55,360
in general that's it all right I got to

464
00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:02,800
take a drink I'm about to choke and then

465
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:06,159
we're gonna keep this moving all right

466
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:08,109
I'll let it that part out I was gonna

467
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,029
beat Boxster oh man you should have out

468
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,440
have been friends I might not even edit

469
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:14,019
it now since you're beatbox and I might

470
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,660
just leave that part right there all

471
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,980
right what else you want to add to that

472
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:19,719
bro you got anything you want to add to

473
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,100
just talking about selecting a male that

474
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,200
we pretty much covered I mean use all

475
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,149
your senses you know and breathe for a

476
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,860
purpose that that's is the biggest thing

477
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,049
breed for purpose I cannot stress

478
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,029
nothing for purpose all because if it's

479
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:32,529
good and you want to bang it together

480
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,089
with something else that just looks good

481
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,379
just don't do it just because to do it

482
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,389
or don't do it because you got a cool

483
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:39,009
name lined up do it be do it for purpose

484
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:40,210
do it for purpose we see too much of

485
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:42,759
that in the industry every day that you

486
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:45,160
get you know create the strain come up

487
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,090
with the name lastly yes and if you do

488
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:51,459
make something and it sucks okay so

489
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,810
let's say you make a stream you take

490
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,610
whatever you've got this mail and then

491
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:57,669
you've got this prized female you throw

492
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,240
pollen all over it you let it go so once

493
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,459
you pollinate

494
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,019
it's gonna take you you know sit about

495
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,340
six more weeks until the seeds are ready

496
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,230
maybe six or eight more weeks before we

497
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,209
can chop that plant down I let the

498
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,680
plants dry until they're crispy at that

499
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,910
point I just chop them down let them get

500
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,318
super crispy and then I just rub them

501
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,048
and the seeds fall out then I go

502
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:16,328
all the seeds then I blast the material

503
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:18,278
into oil honestly but so then you got to

504
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,599
grow those seeds yourself I would

505
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:21,638
recommend you grow a hundred of them

506
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,958
just at least germinate a hundred of

507
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:25,240
them right away and see what they do

508
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,669
before you give any of them away to

509
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,710
anybody germinate a hundred of them veg

510
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:33,639
out at least fifty and flower at least

511
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:36,069
25 of them dry um Kyurem smoke em see

512
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:37,719
what they do if it sucks flush the seeds

513
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:40,480
down the toilet get rid of them feed

514
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,220
them to your birds it's human we all we

515
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,409
all make mistakes and you can only

516
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,329
control what you're doing so much it's

517
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:48,190
not its nature I would say nature you

518
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:50,109
can only control so much of what you're

519
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,580
doing the rest is left in her hands yeah

520
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:52,658
and sometimes things just don't want to

521
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:55,089
breed together I made a stream that

522
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:58,179
totally sucked it produced giant colas

523
00:17:55,089 --> 00:18:00,189
that tasted amazing but it would not get

524
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:07,929
you high at all you could smoke the

525
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:10,840
entire crop and dues no high at all my

526
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:12,220
main thing was a breeding we had one

527
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,558
recently that came out was a Dante's

528
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,669
Inferno he was a big hit for a lot of

529
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:16,808
people because a lot of people through

530
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:18,129
our connoisseurs smokers out there

531
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:20,138
they're like like growing things like

532
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:22,449
Grinspoon and other other strains out

533
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:24,459
there that are just absolutely 100%

534
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,710
top-grade connoisseur weed they yield

535
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,110
like crap you know Girl Scout cookies I

536
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,579
mean it's not a known for is yield it's

537
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,709
known for its power and flavor

538
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:34,750
it hasn't every sweet funk taste well

539
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,639
that's it and you're not growing that as

540
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,659
a cash crop you know you know a lot of

541
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:39,189
the times you're growing that for

542
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,169
personal and if you do you are growing

543
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:48,519
it for cash crop you have a lot home in

544
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:51,220
a lot of lights what were we even

545
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,720
talking about to get a snails but anyway

546
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,329
I did have what something I wanted to

547
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,269
add to the RAL terpenes breeding for

548
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:59,829
Terps um want one of our perfect ones

549
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,569
it's coming up now it's gonna be one of

550
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:05,079
our big frontrunner is the s-1 version

551
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:07,089
of our blueberry fuel um this cut that

552
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,558
has amazing terpenes it's off the it's

553
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:10,329
just off hey it's hard to explain it's

554
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,678
really really hard to explain its it's

555
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:14,439
got a little bit everything in it and

556
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,970
the reason that is is because when

557
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,288
you're choosing males and females and

558
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,940
you're doing that breeding work you know

559
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:20,589
actually look at the terpene profile if

560
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,929
you don't know and you can get it tested

561
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:24,220
spend the 40 50 75 bucks whatever it

562
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:26,169
takes get it tested

563
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,519
paperwork to back your stuff up if

564
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:29,620
you're in a legal state you should be

565
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,298
able to test and the more widely it's

566
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:33,129
becoming nowadays you have literally

567
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:34,720
half the country now we're 50/50 and

568
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,220
it's taken over and you should be able

569
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,308
to get it tested by someone somehow

570
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,100
somewhere forums you know use your

571
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:42,849
connections to reach out and then get it

572
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,829
done you know

573
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,899
it makes a big difference I mean you can

574
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,269
find out like a terpene profile and then

575
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,159
try to match it up with something that

576
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:53,440
absolutely would complement those

577
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,900
terpenes but doesn't have them like our

578
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,580
very fuel you have blue dream which is a

579
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,320
good clone only a good breeding parent

580
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:01,449
breeds true it breeds solid it doesn't

581
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,889
isn't it's known the breach table I've

582
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,630
read a couple good strains with it you

583
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,700
know you can pop one hundred two hundred

584
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,169
seeds and you might get one or two harm

585
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,169
ease out of it just because it breeds

586
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:13,150
that stable and and it usually takes the

587
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,799
dominance of things but when you breed

588
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,419
it would was something like Oh Gees and

589
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,859
diesels and things like that you had a

590
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:19,809
whole different terpene profile that

591
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:21,158
really complements the blueberry muffin

592
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:22,960
II Hughes and the blend and the

593
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,370
creaminess of the Blue Dream it just

594
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,600
stands out and everybody creates a whole

595
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:28,119
nother animal and then you don't even

596
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,589
most people when you smoke it with them

597
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:31,329
first tell them what it is lastly they

598
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:33,459
did never even what a guest it came from

599
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:35,349
blue dream that's the thing they look at

600
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,179
it never would have thought and taste it

601
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:38,918
never would have thought and it just

602
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:40,870
peels them back it's got you know

603
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,788
diesels it's got oh gee tones it's got

604
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:46,298
blueberry tones it's got creamy tones in

605
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:48,038
it and just that's all I could say I

606
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:49,150
think I've smoked some of that with you

607
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,440
before I think you brought that last

608
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,059
time and it was definitely a tasty

609
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,730
strain if that was what you brought for

610
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:56,349
me to smoke so I've noticed everything I

611
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,940
breathed to the Blue Dream I've never

612
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:59,678
used it as a mail obviously because it's

613
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,450
a clone only and it's a girl but

614
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,880
everything I've read to it it has made

615
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,380
huge colas everything you put to it

616
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,240
that's it that's a - that's why I love

617
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,190
work that's why we did the og cross on

618
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,099
it typically was dudx to gain a little

619
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,570
bit extra you wanna yeah because oh jeez

620
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:15,939
our lanky and stuff I was trying to put

621
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:17,740
more i bred grateful dog to the Blue

622
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,320
Dream and I call it the Blue Heeler and

623
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,700
my point was to put more vigor to the

624
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,500
Grateful dog just make it a little bit

625
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,400
bigger a little chunkier but I'm not a

626
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,538
fan of the flavor of Blue Dream that

627
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,330
it's a girl it's a girl wheat it's a

628
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:32,890
stripper weed it is it's real it's kind

629
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:35,048
of like a bland blueberry it's real

630
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,940
muffiny and real creamy it's like it

631
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:39,109
tastes like Jiffy muffins

632
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,059
okay like in the oven when you get the

633
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:42,859
jib alright put the blueberry man and it

634
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:44,389
kind of has that aroma blueberry muffin

635
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:46,579
e blueberry air freshener

636
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,820
instead of candies there like that

637
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:51,710
blueberry marker yeah oh man I miss that

638
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:54,349
smell the markers in class you just gave

639
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,000
me a weird flashback but yeah yeah and

640
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:56,899
I'm not a fan of that so I put that to

641
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,089
the Grateful dog

642
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,740
and it made it more pungent and more

643
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:03,799
more piney and then it brought out a

644
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,589
bottom layer of fruit i bred it to the

645
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,629
king Kim Cross the grape stopper OG and

646
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:11,599
we call it the wall it's the blue

647
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,210
stopper but uh that one made it much

648
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,129
stinkier and that the kink in grapes na

649
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,690
/ OG made little tiny popcorns and now

650
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,210
it makes Spears since we put it to the

651
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,740
blue dress yeah tell people all the time

652
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,809
you know I've know you've had it I know

653
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,029
it's been around for a long time held 15

654
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,379
years now but don't count it out as a

655
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:28,879
breeding mother with hybrids you know

656
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,900
don't see blue dream on the label and

657
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,280
automatically turn it away because

658
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,440
you're probably passing up a really

659
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,180
really good cross I know a lot of people

660
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,500
that do not like blue dream at all

661
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,820
shadows are those guys they know who

662
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,769
they are not gonna see your names on the

663
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:41,269
show hold up boys I don't know a lot of

664
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:42,559
the nightmare lines people fell in love

665
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:43,700
with and things like that the reason why

666
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,980
they called it nightmare where do you

667
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:49,340
think nightmare dream I mean put two and

668
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,380
two together people didn't even know no

669
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:53,539
yeah mini Tom like no there's no blue

670
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,890
dream in there alright so something

671
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:57,700
important I should mention this is uh

672
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:00,380
this is kind of a breeding by eye

673
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,509
technique here you could make Eliel

674
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,920
charts you could take a whole bunch of

675
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:05,869
notes you should take a whole bunch a

676
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,240
whole bunch of notes either way but this

677
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:10,909
is kind of just a breeding breeding with

678
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,339
love grow from your heart sort of do it

679
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,779
by your eye old school sort of thing

680
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:18,019
we're breeding with a lot of experience

681
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:20,089
here so I think if you find a good male

682
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:21,829
you're gonna want to do a Fino hunt of

683
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:23,750
at least twenty seeds you're gonna want

684
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:25,490
to find one with a good structure you

685
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,000
want it to look you want it to have this

686
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,380
shape that you want the babies to have

687
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,390
find one that makes a resin if you can

688
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,770
find one that makes a whole bunch of

689
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,420
pollen if it doesn't make enough pollen

690
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:37,730
you're not gonna make enough seeds

691
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,009
find one with real close node spacing

692
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:42,349
find one that smells real good

693
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:44,509
try not to select the very first one

694
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:47,119
that goes into flower and shows you that

695
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:49,430
it's a boy definitely do not use any

696
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,799
male plants that show any sign of her

697
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,500
effort ISM male plants can hermaphrodite

698
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:56,599
also you'll see pollen sacks you'll see

699
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,279
little mail sacks popping out and then

700
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,589
right out of the sides you'll see female

701
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:02,180
pistols come out yeah it's not those

702
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:04,339
aren't nut hairs

703
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,289
that's a hermaphrodite plant you got to

704
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:10,579
cut [ __ ] Bruce Jenner down and get

705
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:12,799
rid of it yeah I just said that I am

706
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:14,509
afraid you're out of there we ain't

707
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,740
trying to have no none of that [ __ ] in

708
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:17,480
the grow room you got to get rid of it

709
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,160
that will create lots of problems in the

710
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,079
future you do not want to breed

711
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,029
hermaphrodite into your plants that's

712
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:24,669
right that is not a good that's the

713
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:27,799
exact opposite of what we're aiming for

714
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:29,630
so um yeah and then pay attention that

715
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,009
pollen you guys and when the pollen does

716
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,290
start spitting you don't want that first

717
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:34,819
grainy sandy pollen you want that the

718
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:35,779
pollen will when you catch some of it

719
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:37,220
and put it in your hand and rub it in

720
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:40,099
the palm of your hand it'll feel smooth

721
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,019
and silky it'll feel real nice and then

722
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:44,659
when you leave the grow room even have

723
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:46,670
to hose yourself down get a mister like

724
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,080
a sprayer and spray it like a pump

725
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,490
sprayer like you'd almost used to pump

726
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,319
pesticides get one of those and just

727
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,210
spray yourself down and wash your hands

728
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:55,099
because time or work truly great as

729
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,450
chlorine and safe for everything plants

730
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:58,129
animals beef there you go that'll

731
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,200
deactivate any palm that you've got on

732
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,610
you and then if you are going from that

733
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,440
pollen room and do a room that has

734
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:05,119
female plants you can always hose them

735
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,680
down as you walk in just hit them with

736
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,569
the sprayer and they won't receive

737
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,890
pollen for a little while just trying to

738
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:11,480
prevent that pollen from getting onto

739
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,610
your females if you don't want to breed

740
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,620
because if you have a male plant in the

741
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:19,219
house or in the room or in the facility

742
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:21,319
with your females it's going to try to

743
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,250
get pollen everywhere one thing I've

744
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,799
noticed where you could tell me if

745
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:27,259
you've recognized this I've got separate

746
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,759
breeding rooms I've got an upstairs in

747
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,200
the downstairs area and an area over

748
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,480
here an area over here that I've got a

749
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,700
male in one area and females in a

750
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,400
totally different area I've noticed when

751
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,049
I've got girls and a flowering male in

752
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,000
the same house the girls get a little

753
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:43,700
stickier and they flower a little more

754
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,920
quickly do you think those girls know

755
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,930
there's a male around somewhere good

756
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,240
question that is a good question it goes

757
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,799
into some of my forté lighting and it

758
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,420
actually yeah they do

759
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,599
they know because of infrared lighting

760
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,100
okay plants use infrared lighting to see

761
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:59,179
around them that's why you have natural

762
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,159
spacing in the woods

763
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,570
that is why trees naturally spaced

764
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,130
themselves out naturally weed out

765
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:05,689
smaller ones below them and around them

766
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,278
and you typically go into the woods and

767
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,600
new pine tree forts and things like that

768
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:09,648
and they have an equal spacing between

769
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,949
yeah they do

770
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:15,668
that is why ok infrared lighting my

771
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:18,200
horny horny girl plants no there's no

772
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:20,240
blowing as load they know she's I don't

773
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,399
want somebody I think there's pheromones

774
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,109
I believe as well okay I would believe

775
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:25,638
that because well they can take in co2

776
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:27,500
and they can they breathe out carbon

777
00:26:25,638 --> 00:26:28,908
dioxide you know there's always a

778
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,980
constant intake between oxygen and

779
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:34,190
carbon dioxide battling back and forth

780
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,319
back and forth right and in a lot of

781
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,058
their annual plants so they built over

782
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,918
thousands and millions of years beyond

783
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:41,628
Earth they have built defense mechanisms

784
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,980
to try to breed that is their purpose

785
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:44,869
that's why they're hermaphrodite

786
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,970
honestly Fenny buddy remembers the first

787
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,768
Jurassic Park allegation say nature will

788
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,589
always find a way and then y'all said

789
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:53,329
you have eggs that is why because nature

790
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:54,619
will always find a way and you're

791
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:56,028
talking about something that is on a

792
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:58,128
total different level than what you

793
00:26:56,028 --> 00:27:01,159
think it's mind-boggling to think how

794
00:26:58,128 --> 00:27:04,369
you know an evolution sense how far

795
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,990
ahead some plants are then then what we

796
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:07,398
are you know we tend to think we are the

797
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,859
kings of the world you know weird sin of

798
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:11,959
the universe every day its weak but

799
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:14,148
really if you look at an ant if he was

800
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,950
our size you could lift your house right

801
00:27:14,148 --> 00:27:17,239
yeah they can lift like five hundred

802
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,129
times under natural weight and it's

803
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:24,859
riding a smile at you with one oral in

804
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:26,269
your house because that's really what it

805
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:28,099
is you know it's really more about

806
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,419
perception than anything you just [ __ ]

807
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:31,638
with all the listeners heads mothers

808
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:32,720
visualizing ant lifting up my house and

809
