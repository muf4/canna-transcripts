7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,940
into these old episodes let me make the

8
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:23,300
disclaimers I like to make um I've

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,859
learned a lot in 200 episodes ah I think

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,118
it's been about three years which means

11
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,559
I've learned a lot about growing I've

12
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:29,570
learned a lot about podcasting I've

13
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:31,519
learned about a lot about life if I say

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,799
something in these episodes that I have

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,089
contradicted myself with just keep in

16
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,500
mind that [ __ ] changes this is an

17
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,230
ever-changing industry and ever-changing

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,730
project this will always be changing

19
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:42,199
that's why I do a podcast and do not

20
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:44,808
write a book so I may say some things

21
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,059
that have been updated I may contradict

22
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:48,039
myself over time [ __ ] changes they'll

23
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:50,439
hold it against me

24
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,549

25
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,988

130
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,659
phenotypes everybody here is a pretty

131
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,340
experienced grower so what everyone i'll

132
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:35,800
have a lot of input i should explain

133
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,569
what a phenotype is it's the first thing

134
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,530
i'll take one step back we will explain

135
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:43,930
a genotype the offspring of two parents

136
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:46,269
will make genetics and that genetic

137
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,709
makeup is the genotype out of that

138
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:50,500
genotype there will be various

139
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:53,739
phenotypes the best way I can think of

140
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,629
to compare it would be when your parents

141
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,218
make kids they don't all look the same

142
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:59,139
your dad's probably tall your mom's

143
00:05:57,218 --> 00:06:00,579
brother a little shorter one of them's

144
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,340
got blond hair one of them's got dark

145
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:04,389
hair when they make kids sometimes they

146
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,619
come out with kids with blonde hair

147
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,848
sometimes you come out with kids with

148
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,459
dark hair sometimes you come out

149
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:10,899
blue-eyed sometimes they come out brown

150
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,509
plants are gonna do the same thing and

151
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:16,029
that's to be expected

152
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:17,439
there are ways to minimize those traits

153
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:19,659
or bring out traits that you're looking

154
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,939
for but for the most part when you're

155
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,350
making seeds in the beginning the seeds

156
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,790
that most of you guys are able to get

157
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,550
your hands on what a lot of the breeders

158
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,610
are selling you aren't going to be f1 f2

159
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,800
s or f3 s there are very few breeders

160
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,569
going far further than f4 there's one

161
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,900
guy in of that bragged about f5 which is

162
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:40,149
really cool really respectable so you're

163
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:41,349
gonna see a lot of variation I just

164
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,929
talked a lot I feel there's a lot of

165
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,760
echo I feel like I've talked a lot about

166
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,459
variation in phenotypes and a lot of f1

167
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,589
and stuff so in f1 when you take two

168
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:52,449
plants a male and a female plant those

169
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:54,549
are now your pea ones when you breed

170
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:57,279
them the seeds that come out of that are

171
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,230
f1 that's the f1 generation you're gonna

172
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,668
have a lot of variety there some stuff's

173
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,950
gonna look like mom some stuffs gonna

174
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:04,029
kind of look like the dad you're gonna

175
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:06,039
get a lot of switching then you're gonna

176
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,359
get stuff way in the middle between the

177
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,730
mom and the dad you'll get that perfect

178
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,949
hybrid and that's a lot of times the one

179
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,360
that everybody is looking for then a

180
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,740
little further you'll make an f2 if you

181
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,110
take if you find a sweet male and a

182
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,400
sweet female out of those F ones and you

183
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,310
breathe those together you're gonna make

184
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:24,339
an f2 f2 is where you come up with

185
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:27,069
something that we call transgressive

186
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:30,029
segregation which means and Jesse smiled

187
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:33,819
when I mentioned this free show transit

188
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:35,909
transgressive segregation is when your

189
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:38,829
actual progeny which is your offspring

190
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,810
outperforms the parents so if you take

191
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:42,699
two seeds a male and a female and you

192
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,680
cross them and that plant that comes out

193
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,870
is way more badass than the parents you

194
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,329
have just experienced transgressive

195
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,680
segregation so the f2 level is where you

196
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:53,050
really want to buy the seeds if a

197
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,550
breeder selling those seeds a lot of us

198
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,470
don't really let you know what we're

199
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,540
giving you which F level how far it is

200
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,700
that's kind of personal stuff it's kind

201
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,900
of breeding secrets but those F 2's are

202
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,560
awesome if you can get ahold of those

203
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:06,549
that's where a lot of cool [ __ ] happens

204
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,389
so we're gonna kind of back up a little

205
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:12,550
bit the variation a lot of us at the

206
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,228
table seem to love the variation we do

207
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,629
what is called a feed ohan we buy a pack

208
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:18,389
of seeds you grow that whole pack is

209
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,250
usually ten seeds

210
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,659
and you look for if you're not gonna

211
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,310
breed you eliminate the female so

212
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:28,320
hopefully you've got else the males

213
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:30,420
thank you thanks I'm good thanks for

214
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,500
watching my back so you got to pull

215
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:37,350
those males and then you keep it going

216
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,750
to catch my breath also keep the females

217
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,610
going you try to find the good ones you

218
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,019
look for the traits that those are

219
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,210
putting off early on you could tell

220
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,539
structure speed of growth there's a

221
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,670
bigger leaf size you can tell kind of if

222
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:55,699
you get a more indica or sativa leaning

223
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:55,699
phenotype note spacing there you go

224
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,680
that's gonna lead to a lot of what its

225
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:18,480
gonna really smell like in the end yeah

226
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:20,219
sometimes early resin production get the

227
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:27,930
frosting if things are going real well

228
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:29,370
okay you want to require let's just this

229
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:35,120
thing over here talked about this

230
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:37,740
headphone thing shorter stocky plants

231
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,029
necessarily I usually like more indica

232
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:57,600
plants that's why I'm you looking for

233
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:59,789
you can you know figure out whether or

234
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,350
not your plants gonna be well depending

235
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:04,379
like sometimes I grow plants under a

236
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,970
scroll net so like the link your plants

237
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,919
you'll get will be better for a strong

238
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,810
net in my opinion and then you're you

239
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,089
know shorter stockier plants over your

240
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:14,669
just freestanding plants that you can

241
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,440
stake down and don't have to give too

242
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:20,789
much support besides that but you know

243
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,500
bigger smells and then I look for like

244
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:24,509
especially if I know what it's coming

245
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,629
from you can look at like your leaf sets

246
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:28,220
and see if they start matching parents

247
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:30,049
yeah stuff like that then you can know

248
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,910
which parent you've got a guy all right

249
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:33,589
you said some sort of interesting that

250
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:35,269
leads me to another point doing the

251
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,649
pheno huh run in a pack of seeds and

252
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:38,659
looking for that fee know that you like

253
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:39,799
both of these guys grow difference

254
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:45,110
everybody in this room droves a

255
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:47,029
different style I don't do any I like to

256
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,480
run a seven gallon so those plants you

257
00:10:47,029 --> 00:11:40,459
guys are worried about waving around

258
00:10:49,480 --> 00:11:44,090
early on in life some variation to talk

259
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,150
about s1 s1 s1 is when I do a lot asked

260
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:49,670
ones that's a feminized seed essentially

261
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:51,559
or usually like if I take my grateful

262
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:54,559
dog to grateful dog clones of the same

263
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:57,259
plant reverse one throw that pollen on

264
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,449
the other one in flower those seeds are

265
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:01,519
not a new it's not a new breed it's just

266
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,280
an s-1 I've selfed it and made seeds of

267
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,990
that same thing so that's an s-1 I find

268
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,059
that those a lot of people hate on

269
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,919
feminized seeds but if an s-1 is done

270
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,299
properly and I want to hear your guys's

271
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,579
opinions cuz you've been growing my see

272
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:15,259
it's a little bit do the s1 seemed to

273
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:26,389
mirror their parents a little bit more

274
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:29,090
than the regular was but it came out so

275
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:30,919
different there's so much like it's like

276
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:38,780
one of his original parents was it the

277
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:42,769
Kabletown I think it o female that I use

278
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:44,149
in the Kabletown cross I gave him the

279
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,129
first handful of seeds I made out of

280
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:48,588
that to run for me just to say thanks

281
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:50,480
but yeah I saw that in the pictures I

282
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:51,830
could see the Grateful dog but if you

283
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,740
knew that it was that white widow mom

284
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,720
you could see her I've got buddies

285
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,350
running it now and I can look at them

286
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,120
from you know four or five weeks

287
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:08,210
complaining and you can see in the

288
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:10,100
structure and then in the leaf is

289
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:20,389
leaning toward you can almost keep that

290
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:22,129
one full boss he makes dank water hash

291
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:23,960
and grows that stream like a pro so good

292
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:28,250
work bro thanks for doing my my seeds

293
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:31,310
justice what is your experience with

294
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:34,970
destitute I said compared to say f2 if

295
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:37,639
you know mine answer the S ones come out

296
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,320
I would say 50% of them look like mommy

297
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,850
and then the other fifty are a little

298
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,830
weird and you know that's hard to say

299
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:49,180
for a breeder but they it's not a

300
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:51,290
natural it's cousin [ __ ] essentially

301
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:52,759
I'm not supposed to say that word of the

302
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,289
podcast anymore but there's no better

303
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:59,620
way to put that it's that's cousin

304
00:13:54,289 --> 00:14:05,000
[ __ ] as to come out even more uniform

305
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:08,419
more uniform but they're even more

306
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,679
uniform once you get into that and I

307
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,209
didn't realize I was doing something

308
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,489
unique when I was doing it I took the

309
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:16,730
same grateful dog the original female

310
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,129
and Kate kept taking the clone and using

311
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,450
that reversed female to make seeds again

312
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,639
and then making another generation

313
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,560
almost inbreeding it and I've gotten it

314
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,049
so far that those come out like clothes

315
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,239
those grateful dog sees no current the

316
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:31,009
s4 generation I think is kind of what it

317
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,970
would be I don't know a lot of people

318
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:33,100
that have done it so I don't know how to

319
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,470
label incest

320
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,029
or have come out there like clones of

321
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,740
each other growing seeds from clone

322
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:49,299
which is kind of nice for a breeder to

323
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:51,870
achieve in a feminized see eventually be

324
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:51,870
very popular

325
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:57,850
[Music]

326
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:59,800
you always find weird that's why I ask

327
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,759
because I don't think I've ever grown an

328
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:14,919
s2 that I know of so you know I've grown

329
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:18,490
up to 3 or 4 B x3 I'm at the point I

330
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:21,879
don't know if I want to back cross it

331
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:25,570
one more time because I'm pretty happy

332
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:27,519
with what what I got from it or if I

333
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,030
want to start in crossing it and start

334
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:35,019
making I guess would be a f1 f2

335
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:36,819
generation D nom and so on percentage of

336
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:40,389
those seeds now are coming out to be

337
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,160
what you have in mind well there's

338
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:46,269
there's two different phenotypes and I

339
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:48,579
really like components there were some

340
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:50,350
less desirable phenotypes and I worked

341
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,210
them out I believe on the BX 2

342
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,159
generation when I when I made the trees

343
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:58,480
so I'm in the threes of just the one

344
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:10,870
phenotype I called one-night stand and

345
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:13,300
it's the hazy the other one is just the

346
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,149
Depot dug and it's real but you know as

347
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:19,659
a Kim dog stabilization project so it's

348
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,539
a lot like Kim D a a little bit like

349
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:25,269
diesel a little bit more more more

350
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:27,189
unique thing or not unique but different

351
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:30,009
things slightly different than Kim D but

352
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:33,130
a lot like it so as we're thrown around

353
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:35,000
a lot of crazy terms here and my bad our

354
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:37,528
bad

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,600
they'll catch up we inspire them to

356
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:41,039
learn stuff if you're lost google it if

357
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,730
you want to or just keep listening and

358
00:16:41,039 --> 00:17:32,329
eventually this episode but we're saying

359
00:16:44,730 --> 00:17:42,210
will sound like okay if you want you in

360
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:45,000
for myself I like the explanations if I

361
00:17:42,210 --> 00:18:15,829
have a problem that's the first book hey

362
00:17:45,000 --> 00:18:19,529
bro no no no no this one was written

363
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:22,619
early 80s but the title is how to grow

364
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:25,950
or in the first chapter how to grow a

365
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:29,369
million pounds of skunk weed or so

366
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:34,139
but they're talking about pounds of UK

367
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:37,589
pounds so yeah they'll Thomas I keep on

368
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:39,000
to say my Googler is out of reach right

369
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:40,319
now so we'll just keep the conversation

370
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,990
rolling for sure

371
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:46,138
my favorite is at this point in my life

372
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,480
is Google so um you gotta sort through a

373
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:50,579
lot of [ __ ] but you learn where the

374
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,429
reliable sources are and when you see

375
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:55,470
one of their articles pop up he knows

376
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,970
and most the time I think they're

377
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,528
probably referencing all these great

378
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:03,509
books hopefully read three or four

379
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:05,669
articles on Google yeah think about what

380
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,138
you're gonna do go smoke a fat joint and

381
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:14,519

that's a great example there's a black

427
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,369
cherry Kim phenotype and then there's

428
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:03,400
the space clean dominant phenotype that

429

black cherry Kim or no black cherry soda

430
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,980
sorry bitrate in your dress black cherry

soda phenotype that's domina - that is

432
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,269
very noticeable you'll know if you've

433
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,450
got it about twenty days into flower you

434
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:17,740
can tell turn off the lights and turn on

435
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,390
the normal lights and look from the

436
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,670
underside of the calyx and you'll see

437
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:28,300
the purple for sure known phenotypes

438
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:30,640
yeah DJ shorts low DJ short said that he

439
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:32,500
put that flow out that he released that

440
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,290
clone that's in Colorado he said he let

441
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,809
that out

442
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:38,180
everybody what was possible with those

443
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:39,710
seats what the potential of flow was so

444
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,500
that cut that we all have supposedly

445
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,940
came from DJ short shout out DJ short I

446
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,029
have learned a lot of stuff from deep

447
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:52,400
yeah I like that he's doing the free

448
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:54,379
weed show a lot more a lot of I've

449
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,940
learned a lot from just listen to DJ on

450
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:09,050
that show that's great to hear that he's

451
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:11,029
not Canadians actually no I leaned up on

452
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:12,619
the mic like you're ready to go I'm hand

453
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:16,779
on the designer read your questions so I

454
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:19,399
can thank you some [ __ ] to say do you

455
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:20,720
this is why is variation happening and

456
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,040
useful we talked about kind of why it's

457
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,750
happening because we're bringing a male

458
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,460
and a female and now they're making

459
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,930
babies and we don't want all the babies

460
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,569
to look the same in the world that's how

461
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,940
plants survive so how do you find that

462
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:36,710
variation to be useful do you want that

463
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:39,860
stuff I mean different free knows gives

464
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,090
you you know like we talked about on a

465
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:43,819
previous episode we talked about how

466
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:46,819
many Dino's you should keep in a seat

467
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:48,139
pack so you know that's where you would

468
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:50,029
want to keep a couple different

469
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,190
especially if it's a seat pack that is a

470
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:54,740
hybrid you know something like that

471
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:58,460
where you can get multiple variations of

472
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,960
your parents so I enjoy you know the

473
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,059
different variations like some plants

474
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:07,160
grow faster some plants you know have

475
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:18,589
more side branching you know some plants

476
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:27,920
grow straight up people look for waiting

477
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:29,449
stupid clones well did something to the

478
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,250
water around here or something cuz

479
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,529
everybody's clones everybody that I know

480
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,940
in this circle of growers was like my

481
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:37,200
clothes bro clothes bro

482
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,970

were all calling each other like you

486
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:49,230
[Music]

487
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:51,329
yeah what was going on it had to be

488
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:53,640
something in the water something in the

489
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:55,829
water it seems like every year this

490
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,390
happens about this time it's good to

491
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:59,038
know and also if you guys are indoor

492
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,179
growers in Colorado be prepared to be

493
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,349
[ __ ] for a couple of months because

494
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:21,960
nobody's gonna buy your product because

495
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:28,528
every other day with a really big burger

496
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:31,319
looking pretty nice yeah yeah yeah it's

497
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:33,058
a really neat greenhouse a lot of really

498
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:34,139
cool fluorescent lights I said I talked

499
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:35,700
about that place on the show if

500
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,140
anybody's gone by and taking cool

501
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,880
pictures of that greenhouse I talked

502
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:48,179
about tweet me some pictures I'd love to

503
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:53,850
see it how often do you get to do a few

504
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:55,919
no huh bro not as often as I'd like to I

505
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:57,538
wish I could go from seed every single

506
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,450
time but I have some other plants I have

507
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:03,028
to maintain and you know best way to do

508
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:07,890
that is clone and run clones and you

509
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:11,398
know I keep - Lance yeah yeah the

510
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:14,340
patients this winter I'm planning on

511
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:17,009
growing pretty much exclusively seed so

512
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,658
other than just mother maintenance so

513
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,460
have you ever ran a whole pack of seeds

514
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:22,110
and not gotten anything worth keeping

515
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,528
yes me too

516
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:27,000
you yes you're running you've your shops

517
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:27,390
got a nice amount of seeds going right

518
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,099
now

519
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:34,259
yeah I bet you've got high hopes for

520
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:35,730
that if you don't find a couple of

521
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,808
keepers of each one it's gonna feel like

522
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,700
a lot of work for nothing

523
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:40,259
already it's looking like there's a

524
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,480
couple that are setting themselves apart

525
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:44,640
from the others so it's pretty promising

526
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,700
and how many how many days enter those

527
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,740
they

528
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,900
there is still sighs I think they're on

529
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,269
day 23 in [ __ ] building your pictures

530
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,590
they look great check them out guys he

531
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:56,389
looks great on Instagram he's got some

532
00:26:54,589 --> 00:27:04,939
stylish glass and some stylish plants

533
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:06,650
then he takes the biggest herbs this

534
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,769
might be a friendly it's a personal

535
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:12,170
challenge than that I was talking it

536
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:14,509
might have been the last one I'm going

537
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:30,560
to put the gigantic thing to arrest for

538
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:32,420
myself because I'm getting old I think

539
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,159
what I actually said was that my lungs I

540
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,200
realized my lungs have so many inhales

541
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,940
and exhales and I think taking a grab

542
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,880
dab it's just like you're just using up

543
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,350
cat lives when you do that two breaths

544
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:54,650
you could have had but instead you

545
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:58,219
smoked a gram of hash especially that

546
00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:00,410
many but I mean what better way to do it

547
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,150
than taking a hit hash at least you

548
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:15,700
weren't breathing in concrete dust or

549
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:15,700
something that might have been my fault

550
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:27,169
off the honey hole even shoutout

551
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,559
suspense for bringing the Heylin honey

552
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:32,269
hole all right

553
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,529
this conversation has gotten off-track

554
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:34,910
because I'm dab down what else do you

555
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:36,259
want to talk about about phenotypes you

556
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:42,230
guys okay I got a question

557
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:44,160
I like to order backseats considered

558
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:47,809
like CT find in

559
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,759
like mostly yes once over he would say

560
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:52,559
you don't know the parent yeah it's

561
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:56,009
probably just an [ __ ] what if you

562
00:28:52,559 --> 00:29:12,869
know the parent but you don't know what

563
00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:13,980
the male was plants from there sorry so

564
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:16,169
mom spilling your beans

565
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,150
that's how Sola actually makes feminized

566
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:20,130
seeds he takes a female and flowers her

567
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,540
for too long okay and then after she

568
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,190
goes like if you got a nine week strain

569
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:25,769
he lets it go for thirteen and about

570
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:28,200
week thirteen Oh

571
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:34,019
gathers it on the next crop that he

572
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,430
makes you can smoke those buds do most

573
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,259
of the plant just leave enough of it to

574
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,539
her mouth and spit out Paul Anthony

575
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:40,829
smoke the rest even if you can't smoke

576
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,849
it you could definitely probably extract

577
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:43,529
it there you go

578
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:52,199
yeah have you heard of his fire

579
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:54,450
technique make sense yes I understand

580
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,009
this theory where he's coming from what

581
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,170
the forest fire no I bet his math is

582
00:29:56,009 --> 00:30:01,799
more organic than mine yeah that's

583
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,330
that's pretty hardcore don't want to

584
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,039
smoke the flowers of the plants that I

585
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:13,079
have reversed you don't want to smoke

586
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:16,069
those you can smoke is that I don't

587
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:18,689
trust smoking yeah

588
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:32,059
chem dog was backseat guys so don't ever

589
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:35,190
doubt backseat could be aggregation

590
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:38,940
performance it will because you don't

591
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:41,220
know what the parents were well a girl

592
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,419
you know the person who was managing the

593
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,028
room could have a good idea

594
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:49,839
that's about I mean I've seen people on

595
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:53,558

when they try to cut that out of there

615
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,600
sorry about the torch you guys if you're

616
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,950
wondering it's not for me to take a bath

617
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,779
- I'm gonna take a sip of something and

618
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:56,808
take a DAB anybody got anything snazzy

619
00:31:44,779 --> 00:32:06,589
to say any breeding projects right now

620
00:31:56,808 --> 00:32:09,440
Jesse I'm I'm really happy with px3 of

621
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:13,669
depo dog so I think I'm on like a whole

622
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:26,019
bunch of seed of it and maybe get it to

623
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:30,429
the public so it's old-school Amsterdam

624
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:34,460
I don't really have a whole lot of

625
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:36,050
heritage on it but it's a I don't know

626
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,630
the producer of it but it was a scone

627
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:41,269
case I believe it was a freebie from an

628
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,309
old amsterdam seat back but had really

629
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:48,319
really heard early resident production

630
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:51,079
and it was a young case so the initial

631
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,839
reason I used to din the cross was he

632
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:56,750
was very different than Kim D and it was

633
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:59,389
very easy to spawn out the phenotypes

634
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:02,029
over leaning garter towards him so I

635
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,640
kind of used it as a tool to make the

636
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:07,279
Kim line more pure so glad that Kim was

637
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,040
discovered yes yes that's my favorite I

638
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,009
stay restrained hands down like a

639
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:21,259
allocate you know I need I need a Kim

640
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:23,210
for back fat Kim D even can be for Jesse

641
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:25,069
we can trade we can trade if you're in

642
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,160
Colorado and you're an adult we can do

643
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:31,460
this yep maybe we can find some seeds or

644
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:34,960
something for you I've got a pretty cool

645
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,960
Girl Scout cookies cut so

646

664
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:39,679
I think it's whoa goddamnit

665
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,240
[Music]

666
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:50,869
yeah I think it's bloke we're trying to

667
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:56,629
front what are you growing now bro

668
00:35:50,869 --> 00:36:00,750
Platinum cookies animal cookies blue

669
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:04,140
haze cookies and cream cookies and cream

670
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:19,949
that one that come cookies and cream I

671
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:23,269
wanted that that was but starfighters

672
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:23,269
rare dinosaurs

673
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:40,309
talking about that and then I have a

674
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:43,349
female hunt going right now by the way

675
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:45,029
which sucks everybody if you have timers

676
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:46,829
that have more than one program make

677
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,269
sure you go through your programs and

678
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:51,360
make sure there's no extra timers

679
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:54,170
shailen so that's cool you can catch it

680
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,170
but I caught it

681
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:00,369
[Music]

682
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:09,360
no I saw but it was just weird because

683
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,809
there was no off timers just on but I've

684
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:15,809
been in my room it's not on those fancy

685
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:17,639
digital timers so when you reset your

686
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:19,259
timer guy just reset it the whole days

687
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:21,150
like yeah just did recent and clear it

688
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,980
out don't just try to go and read set

689
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,530
everything actually hit the button

690
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,969
default that [ __ ] but I think they'll

691
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,470
be fine I've had a couple that are just

692
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:31,969
growing right through it and it didn't

693
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:34,529
matter to it so kind of happy with those

694
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:37,399
likes are you running you doing that

695
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,510
drunk over an 11 13 talk to offers

696
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,950
that's actually a good way to stress

697
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,660
test your plants I was mentioning this

698
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:44,399
this is since our fee no topic kind of

699
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:46,690
got side rails here we ran out of [ __ ]

700
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,269
to talk about I think

701
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:51,429
I stress test my plants before I breed

702
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:52,659
with them I'll take a female and put her

703
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:54,190
in a room I'll take a bunch of them like

704
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:55,960
I've got four or five new clones I'll

705
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,130
put them in the room and I'll run it on

706
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,260
twelve twelve for two weeks

707
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,358
and then about day fifteen I'll turn it

708
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,460
off for 24 hours day fifteen I'll turn

709
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,500
it on for 24 hours and then I'll put it

710
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,699
back on the opposite 1212 so if I was

711
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,530
coming on at ten in the morning now I'm

712
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:10,539
coming on at 10:00 at night I'll run

713
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,910
that for a few more days just watch them

714
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:31,779
grow freaked out then I'll put it back

715
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:33,608
into the normal some same goes for males

716
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,230
but I don't want to give away too many

717
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:37,210
secrets so we'll just leave it at that I

718
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,730
like your dad yourself yeah meal stuff

719
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:42,760
is all that's all proprietary stuff that

720
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:45,219
you keep on the down-low well at least

721
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:51,609
you want people breeding with a bunch of

722
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:52,959
armed ass males females the top clusters

723
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:54,578
are too close together to look like they

724
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,889
got fur between it start to look like

725
00:38:54,579 --> 00:39:01,329
like a [ __ ] willow or something a fox

726
00:38:56,889 --> 00:39:03,429
tail sort of that [ __ ] just want those

727
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:10,180
big juicy balls and I will never say

728
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:12,879
that about what kind of traits we look

729
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:19,899
for in a meal no we won't

730
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:21,940
oh we totally yes well maybe eventually

731
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,139
like on absolute like 500 once

732
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,010
everyone's listen for a long time it

733
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:25,420
loves us what do you doing over there

734
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,670
Spence that looks dangerous this is

735
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:31,059
being a power all right status fire of

736
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:44,200
plastic he just puts it down like I

737
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:45,699
already know how this [ __ ] ends for 35

738
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:47,019
minutes you guys got anything you want

739
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:49,799
to talk about on a podcast anything

740
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:49,800
you've ever wanted to say

741
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:59,090
everyone just kind of shakes their head

742
00:39:53,269 --> 00:40:01,639
and goes that's good because that's what

743
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:04,250
everybody came to this show for thing I

744
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:05,868
look for is I grow mostly indoors so I

745
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,510
like type plants that respond well to

746
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:10,519
topping and super cropping so I can get

747
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:16,930
a nice even canopy versus having a lot

748
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:19,579
of overgrowth I remember that's

749
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:21,858
phenotypic expressions that is a very

750
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:27,199
phenotypic expression so things like

751
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:30,519
purpling even some strains it's kind of

752
00:40:27,199 --> 00:41:03,829
because if you have an unhealthy plant

753
00:40:30,519 --> 00:41:05,179
but I had something really great to say

754
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:13,489
and then backed up from the microphone

755
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:14,899
back down or not okay the notes are done

756
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:16,098
but oh we sent all the stuff on my notes

757
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,950
you're looking over here like what can

758
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:27,800
we say yeah it's um you're thinking like

759
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:29,509
a press pause well you think daddy said

760
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,330
don't be afraid to kill off those plants

761
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:34,339
that are not performing yes and when I

762
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:37,159
do for you know types it's all Fino

763
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:40,009
hunts I usually do probably like a

764
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:41,598
couple seed packs now just one and it's

765
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:44,510
kind of survival of the fittest for me

766
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,950
because seeds I like to not really like

767
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,839
feed them too much I kind of like to

768
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:49,639
just let them see which ones are gonna

769
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,099
do their thing until I have to start you

770
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:54,170
know giving it food um so yeah like I

771
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:56,030
kill ones that if it's gonna get

772
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,430
overgrown as a seat it's probably gonna

773
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:00,490
get overgrown as a plant so I just get

774
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:02,500
rid of it right

775
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:04,868
getting rid of it just makes your hunt

776
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,000
smaller more now you can focus on other

777
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:08,559
things instead of now you have one less

778
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,179
plant yeah it's like picking players for

779
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,829
the team you don't want those slow

780
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:26,588
runners or the guy that can't shoot you

781
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:32,259
don't want me on your team we're talking

782
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:32,619
about sports on a weed podcast see you

783
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,270
there

784
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:36,430
I should be at the secret Cup I think

785
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:38,019
I'm going with low cabs so that should

786
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:45,368
be a good time when I think that

787
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:46,630
September since you're playing with that

788
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:48,869
carb cap we're gonna give a huge

789
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,880
shout-out to the man task rock these uh

790
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:53,588

791
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,700
pieces are dope you don't even know

792
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:59,230
about this [ __ ] right here we recording

793
00:42:57,699 --> 00:43:01,358
this one because I was out of town when

794
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:04,150
we should have recorded this so we're

795
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:06,489
pre recording but this stuff is new and

796
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,710
they look good bro the color is not

797
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:10,239
coming off it's looks just like the

798
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,619
other carb caps I like it good work

799
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:19,239
brother shout-out task rock and

800
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:25,539
highly-educated titanium that's the word

801
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:27,699
but I'm not certain be a little more

802
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:33,940
variation in it I believe if that was

803
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:38,439
the process and ice I mean I have no

804
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:40,300
doubt task is uh you know top quality

805
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,369
[ __ ] so he's got a very high quality

806
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:47,719
anodization process

807
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:47,719
[Music]

808
00:43:52,838 --> 00:44:12,248
oh hey guys thanks for bearing with a

809
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:13,509
bunch of potheads I know we tried to

810
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:16,209
have a phenotype discussion it feels

811
00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:19,440
like we covered a lot see if we can name

812
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:24,150
off any other famous

813

[Music]

822
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:25,868
jeez okay yeah lately I think oh geez

823
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:36,150
just a sticker or a reader for dollar

824
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:38,499
signs you know yeah the original ones

825
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:40,180
from according to the story there's a

826
00:47:38,498 --> 00:47:41,338
bunch of different phenotypes of the

827
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:43,710
genotype

828
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:56,068
I don't know underdog that's a good

829
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:58,619
story think there's another podcast it's

830
00:47:56,068 --> 00:48:27,528
called the show they did an episode all

831
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:27,528
about it's because they have their own

832
00:48:27,588 --> 00:48:51,659
because there seems to be just pulled

833
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,858
that out of knowing it's easy to

834
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:55,608
remember pothead thinks

835
00:48:52,858 --> 00:49:00,478
have you ever drawn any th seeds

836
00:48:55,608 --> 00:49:03,259
actually oh yeah I grew sage and sour is

837
00:49:00,478 --> 00:49:05,248
a freebie okay I didn't really like

838
00:49:03,259 --> 00:49:11,400
that's just my opinion

839
00:49:05,248 --> 00:49:15,689
I've heard that called old man's one

840
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:18,010
cops yeah yes sage I did like it I know

841
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:21,670
it's an acronym but it does have a

842
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:35,500
let's see gee I take you to mental

843
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:38,200
probably now I like cush and I said

844
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:40,239
never spoke like a true cam or a really

845
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:42,189
really good Sauer I smoked some showers

846
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,569
but not like there's a Sour Diesel cut

847
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:45,639
that goes around here have you smoked

848
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:47,680
any of that I think I grew it like her

849
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:50,889
and I smoked it it just still wasn't a

850
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:54,039
fan of it I don't know I might be

851
00:49:50,889 --> 00:49:59,679
looking for a different salary no taste

852
00:49:54,039 --> 00:50:03,340

friend Josh from a lot of labs rolled a

858
00:50:17,769 --> 00:50:21,099
joint of that [ __ ] one night at a party

859
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:22,269
and there were a bunch of breeders in

860
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:23,108
the room and they all gathered around

861
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,300
that joint

862
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:30,159
yeah so for a bunch of breeders to tear

863
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:33,690
your joint that was not mine was hoping

864
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:36,489

it'd be hard to in the winter it'd be

00:53:29,449 --> 00:53:32,059
hard for me to have a vegetarian

905
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:43,700
restaurant because I'd just be so

906
00:53:32,059 --> 00:53:45,590
disappointed by the produce I think

907
00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:47,299
that's probably one of the downsides of

908
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:54,559
the cannabis industry now if you want to

909
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:58,370
build a greenhouse there's yeah that's

910
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:02,889
my retirement plan is but not for full

911
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:08,690

1220
01:11:02,729 --> 01:11:07,799
ugly ass up there when they were filming

1221
01:11:04,939 --> 01:11:08,829
they would put decent-looking people up

1222
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,470
front

1223
01:11:08,829 --> 01:11:13,600
a sexy young lady and a guy showed up

1224
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:14,980
and they had no problem telling those

1225
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,110
people sorry you have to move and they

1226
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:19,269
would reseach you and then this girl in

1227
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:21,489
like a tangerine or melon colored shirt

1228
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:23,320
with giant boobs and a lot of makeup and

1229
01:11:21,489 --> 01:11:24,939
you could tell she was they go out front

1230
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:26,199
row and they just walked her right up to

1231
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:28,839
the front row and put her in the front

1232
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:32,439

1234
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:36,729
and they kind of got put up towards the

1235
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:39,550
front but then they slowly move them

1236
01:11:36,729 --> 01:11:41,979

1237

01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:49,180
before the doors were supposed to open

1240
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:51,039

1308
01:14:48,689 --> 01:14:52,500
comedian it was really but you could

1309
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:54,739
still see yes he's been doing comedy for

1310
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:57,869
a while oh yeah but you could see

1311
01:14:54,739 --> 01:14:59,460
another step when you watched Joe Rogan

1312
01:14:57,869 --> 01:15:01,500
not to say that Tony inch cliff wasn't

1313
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,640
great because that's that's what I like

1314
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,979

1315
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,750

I'm a little fish in a little pond quit

1318
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,869
being a like get better but that's what

1319
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:14,369
I get to see like when we bring guys

1320
01:15:12,869 --> 01:15:17,039
down and they've been doing it for like

1321
01:15:14,369 --> 01:15:18,960
five years eight years ten years you get

1322
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:22,800
to see like oh that's where I want to be

1323
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:24,449
right but seeing Tony I don't know how

1324
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,210
long he's been telling jokes I know he's

1325
01:15:24,449 --> 01:15:28,569
30 he said yeah you listen to the Joe

1326
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:32,109
Rogan experience

1327
01:15:28,569 --> 01:15:34,989
well yeah that but he also said it when

1328
01:15:32,109 --> 01:15:39,039
he was talking about being did he do as

1329
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:43,449
a knit cap bit yeah because he was like

1330
01:15:39,039 --> 01:16:02,170
I'm a thirty year old man and I listen

1331
01:15:43,449 --> 01:16:05,800
to him on Tony Rogan but it was no but

1332
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:08,680
Tony edgecliff was on par yeah defconn

1333
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,360
he's got some really good jokes but and

1334
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,630
I mean not only that but you say Joe

1335
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:14,619
Rogan killed it I mean as a comic to be

1336
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:17,170
up there for an hour

1337
01:16:14,619 --> 01:16:18,939
Jesus yeah you know and I mean him

1338
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:31,390
talked about it afterwards you know he

1339
01:16:18,939 --> 01:16:33,099
was really nervous like nervous he's

1340
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:34,210
like what [ __ ] and he kind of went off

1341
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:36,280
on her for a minute and when he came

1342
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:38,500
back to the set he was on point from

1343
01:16:36,279 --> 01:16:40,719
then on I think that heckler kind of

1344
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:41,770
helped him out kinda helped him and it

1345
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:44,619
brought the crowd and him together

1346
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:46,720
before before that there was a barrier

1347
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:49,000
between the performer and the crowd was

1348
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:51,579
called cameras yeah yeah that tension in

1349
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,560
there affected our laughter and his

1350
01:16:51,579 --> 01:16:57,279
performance but once that heckler all of

1351
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:58,960
that we became one yeah yes I do Tony

1352
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,130
Hinchcliffe and you guys can laugh your

1353
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,199
asses off if you want

1354
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:07,510
is Tony Hinchcliffe slightly remind you

1355
01:17:02,199 --> 01:17:09,429
of Ania Lujan really mellow calmness you

1356
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:11,500
can't shake him nerves of steel just

1357
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:15,460
kind of feels like you know he's kind of

1358
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:17,680
always up here slightly a hipster I

1359
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:20,100
don't I don't know what I I looked at

1360
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:23,500
him and I I didn't think that he felt

1361
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:25,750
like like he was having fun he just

1362
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:27,579
liked his sense of humor is so like yeah

1363
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:29,590
that's kind of like this and so it just

1364
01:17:27,579 --> 01:17:31,239
it wasn't I wish he'd have been having

1365
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:33,159
more fun while he was telling his jokes

1366
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:34,809
they did invite him back for a weekend

1367
01:17:33,159 --> 01:17:36,500
so we got to pay attention to when Tony

1368
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:38,060
Hinchcliffe is concerned

1369
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:41,029
yeah I'd love to see I'd love to see

1370
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:44,720
more than he probably did 20 do about 15

1371
01:17:41,029 --> 01:17:45,800
when we saw ya oh let's talk a comedy I

1372
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,869
guess I'm gonna keep going

1373
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,480
Sunday night I went to the oddball

1374
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:52,729
comedy fest the oddball comedy tour with

1375
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:54,679
Hardwick that was amazing

1376
01:17:52,729 --> 01:17:56,779
was he like headlining it was he was

1377
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,700
actually second louis c.k headlined

1378
01:17:56,779 --> 01:18:00,859
there were nine comedians I think there

1379
01:17:58,699 --> 01:18:02,420
were Brody Stephens was the host and he

1380
01:18:00,859 --> 01:18:03,889
said nine comedians and he must have

1381
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,060
been one of the performers that he

1382
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:07,220
counted because I can't think of who

1383
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:09,140
they are the others were it was Brody

1384
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:13,010
Stephens Whitney Cummings

1385
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:17,090
Chris Hardwick Demetri Martin Hannibal

1386
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:18,409
Buress Sarah Silverman I'm gonna forget

1387
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:23,060
somebody because I'm on the spot Marc

1388
01:18:18,409 --> 01:18:27,229
Maron already somebody and then louis

1389
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:29,360
c.k who was before Joan Rivers it might

1390
01:18:27,229 --> 01:18:30,979
have been Joan that set was quite stale

1391
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:38,689
I'm gonna google it because I feel bad

1392
01:18:30,979 --> 01:18:40,039
missing somebody on that list I'm

1393
01:18:38,689 --> 01:18:43,609
looking for I really want to get it

1394
01:18:40,039 --> 01:18:46,430
right so I feel bad it was just I mean

1395
01:18:43,609 --> 01:18:47,689
Red Rocks seems like I've been down

1396
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:57,829
there yeah but it definitely I saw the

1397
01:18:47,689 --> 01:19:00,409
picture disease was great I think

1398
01:18:57,829 --> 01:19:02,210
everybody got 15 minutes but I think

1399
01:19:00,409 --> 01:19:04,130
Louie may have gotten it seemed like

1400
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:06,380
Louie did 30 minutes and if you're a

1401
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:08,569
comedy fan we've gone on for a minute

1402
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:11,150
but you'll get this part every single

1403
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:13,729
second of Louis cent was calculated he

1404
01:19:11,149 --> 01:19:15,979
knew where to were to breathe he knew

1405
01:19:13,729 --> 01:19:18,649
where to take a couple of steps I don't

1406
01:19:15,979 --> 01:19:20,059
see and I'm not a comedian but I paid

1407
01:19:18,649 --> 01:19:22,009
enough attention to you guys I'm friends

1408
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:23,450
with all you comedian guys and I've paid

1409
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:26,119
enough attention to what you say and so

1410
01:19:23,449 --> 01:19:28,460
I get it now and I could feel every

1411
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:30,319
minute of him he crushed it always be

1412
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:32,149
crushing was Louie's motto that's

1413
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:33,979
[ __ ] awesome he was killing it dude

1414
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:35,599
on it I need to see him now

1415
01:19:33,979 --> 01:19:37,929
yeah that just just to see his

1416
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,340
mannerisms but you've performed you know

1417
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:43,100
it's also performance you understand

1418
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:44,829
like when the singer does it in this

1419
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:47,560
note it sounds a lot better than the

1420
01:19:44,829 --> 01:19:49,390
right no that's like one octave fret

1421
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:52,150
higher or the drummer my thing is to

1422
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:53,770
play less if overplay as a drummer than

1423
01:19:52,149 --> 01:19:55,719
you sound like you're insecure when you

1424
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:57,370
learn to get older and play less notes

1425
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:00,490
it's when you sound better and I think

1426
01:19:57,369 --> 01:20:03,039
Louie has learned each note perfectly

1427
01:20:00,489 --> 01:20:04,239
Louie and honestly not to sound like an

1428
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:06,310
[ __ ] he was one of the comedians I

1429
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:07,719
was not most excited to see yeah

1430
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:08,740
haven't you seen him before no I've

1431
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,570
never seen though he can't perform

1432
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:12,519
before I've never seen any of those guys

1433
01:20:10,569 --> 01:20:14,739
perform live before it was so I got to

1434
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:17,770
see Nev the world's best ah

1435
01:20:14,739 --> 01:20:19,689
Aziz was good really high energy stuck

1436
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:21,670
to the same joke basically the whole

1437
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:24,219
time still told like a story with a lot

1438
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:27,130
of tag lines and a lot of callbacks so

1439
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:29,740
that was cool Hardwick I was being this

1440
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:32,859
affects my podcast hosting I listen to

1441
01:20:29,739 --> 01:20:34,899
Nerdist afton i watch @midnight

1442
01:20:32,859 --> 01:20:37,569
I followed Hardwick since the frickin

1443
01:20:34,899 --> 01:20:39,429
singled-out days so I know he's from

1444
01:20:37,569 --> 01:20:41,710
Denver I know how he used to play in a

1445
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:44,470
band with Furman called by a hardened

1446
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:45,819
firm he comes out of Red Rocks and he

1447
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:47,829
puts his hands up in the air in there

1448
01:20:45,819 --> 01:20:50,439
and he's like Red Rocks and I could see

1449
01:20:47,829 --> 01:20:52,390
the 15 year-old boy in him that's wanted

1450
01:20:50,439 --> 01:20:54,069
to do that since the first time he

1451
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:56,380
touched a guitar I was like that was his

1452
01:20:54,069 --> 01:20:57,609
dream just he's he just combed his pants

1453
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,650
I could see it that's [ __ ] awesome

1454
01:20:57,609 --> 01:21:01,559
yeah and I kind of got to share that

1455
01:20:59,649 --> 01:21:03,579
with my friend Chris Hardwick through

1456
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:05,770
podcasting and that relationship that

1457
01:21:03,579 --> 01:21:09,130
that stalker relationship that you feel

1458
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:11,230
like you have with oh I did feel like

1459
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:14,230
that with Joe Rogan like I felt like

1460
01:21:11,229 --> 01:21:16,239
this is my buddy performin yeah and and

1461
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:18,189
I've known him and then I wanted like as

1462
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:19,719
he was walking off the stage I wanted to

1463
01:21:18,189 --> 01:21:22,899
shake his hand and stuff I was just like

1464
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:24,640
also like he's not a guy you know yeah

1465
01:21:22,899 --> 01:21:26,739
and that's a weird thing to like have

1466
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:29,020
this relationship with people that like

1467
01:21:26,739 --> 01:21:30,699
is a one-sided relationship yeah but I

1468
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:32,650
could see that like I would probably do

1469
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:34,960
the same thing with Hardwick just be

1470
01:21:32,649 --> 01:21:37,089
like I felt pride for him go to my

1471
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,949
buddies just crushed it at Red Rocks cuz

1472
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:42,279
he was awesome he did a great great set

1473
01:21:38,949 --> 01:21:45,099
his set was he's kind of a pervert dude

1474
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:46,659
he did he did a joke and I don't want to

1475
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,670
blow his bit but half of his bit was

1476
01:21:46,659 --> 01:21:51,399
about [ __ ] your mom that's funny yeah

1477
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:53,470
yeah and for Hardwick to go that route

1478
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:55,659
it was funny for me that's pretty great

1479
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:57,699
Demetri Martin did his thing Demetri

1480
01:21:55,659 --> 01:21:59,319
Martin yeah he surprised me how funny he

1481
01:21:57,699 --> 01:22:01,119
was my date that I took with me she

1482
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:03,670
loved him that's who she went to see so

1483
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:06,279
that was good we got to chuckle at that

1484
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:08,350
DJ Drama is a killer DJ by the way he's

1485
01:22:06,279 --> 01:22:10,029
the one that ran music between the

1486
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:11,560
comedians and then we took a 15-minute

1487
01:22:10,029 --> 01:22:13,840
intermission there's about a 30 minute

1488
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,550
intermission I believe if you do comedy

1489
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:19,170
for too long he burnout you're funny oh

1490
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:21,640
yeah we stood up and danced for a few

1491
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:23,440
Hannibal Buress was great he did his

1492
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,960
thing he made a joke about Colorado

1493
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:30,460
having the ugliest crowd it looks like

1494
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:32,109
you all came from a hike probably all

1495
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:33,550
just did and he made a joke about who

1496
01:22:32,109 --> 01:22:35,839
was the white guy that broke down out

1497
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:38,918
here and decided let's build a venue

1498
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,918
[Music]

1499
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:44,800
like I said Marc Maron was good his

1500
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,239
closer was solid but you could tell he

1501
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,980
was frazzled and didn't know what to do

1502
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:50,829
with 15 minutes

1503
01:22:47,979 --> 01:22:53,199
Marin's used 2:45 to whittle Maron down

1504
01:22:50,829 --> 01:22:54,850
to 15 minutes is kind of like you gotta

1505
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:56,109
give him time to get out on the stage

1506
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:57,640
and sit down at the edge of the stage

1507
01:22:56,109 --> 01:22:59,559
and get pissed off about something yeah

1508
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:03,460
and then he gets into that Marc Maron

1509
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:06,160
thing 15 I didn't feel he was good his

1510
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:07,569
closer was hilarious like I won't blow

1511
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:10,090
anybody's been on purpose but his closer

1512
01:23:07,569 --> 01:23:13,779
was great Sarah Silverman surprised the

1513
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:16,150
[ __ ] out of me her set was great but she

1514
01:23:13,779 --> 01:23:19,359
is funny like she is naturally funny you

1515
01:23:16,149 --> 01:23:27,069
could just tell Whitney Cummings [ __ ]

1516
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:28,179
yells her set at you and it's what it

1517
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:30,279
feels like the whole time it feels like

1518
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:33,039
you're being barred with jokes she was

1519
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:34,539
funny but it was a bit [ __ ] too much

1520
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:36,670
for me just saying the way she delivered

1521
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:38,409
him yeah it could have been better she

1522
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:43,300
forgot she had a microphone and she had

1523
01:23:38,409 --> 01:23:45,159
to yell she was she was roman-style TV

1524
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,449
shows like when she's on TV she doesn't

1525
01:23:45,159 --> 01:23:49,539
feel like she's speaking she feels like

1526
01:23:46,449 --> 01:23:51,069
she's over projecting to me too much and

1527
01:23:49,539 --> 01:23:53,829
then Brody Stephens needs medication

1528
01:23:51,069 --> 01:23:55,269
Bernie Stevens was the host Brody take

1529
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:57,939
your medicine buddy I love you I respect

1530
01:23:55,270 --> 01:24:00,409
you too deep calm down Brody Stephens

1531
01:23:57,939 --> 01:24:02,089
[ __ ] harness that [ __ ]

1532
01:24:00,408 --> 01:24:03,259
like I don't know man maybe you smoke

1533
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:04,639
too much of that good Colorado a week

1534
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:07,159
but if that show you were [ __ ] losing

1535
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:09,529
your [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm not a huge fan of

1536
01:24:07,158 --> 01:24:12,170
Brody Stevens yeah it's just not my

1537
01:24:09,529 --> 01:24:14,899
thing but personal preference there well

1538
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:16,310
it's just like anything like I'm I'm so

1539
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:18,349
glad that there's some people that don't

1540
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:19,909
like my comedy because if everybody

1541
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:23,000
liked it it'd be like wow that was that

1542
01:24:19,908 --> 01:24:24,319
was that's not right everybody's as

1543
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,939
[ __ ] up as me that doesn't make any

1544
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:27,939
sense nobody wants another Dane Cook

1545
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:31,460
[Music]

1546
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:43,670
wants to that's gonna be funny it's

1547
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:47,360
gonna be hilarious I make sure that

1548
01:24:43,670 --> 01:25:08,869
nobody's coming to my shows like like

1549
01:24:47,359 --> 01:25:10,189
they don't know when I do stuff podcast

1550
01:25:08,869 --> 01:25:11,899
about consuming cannabis growing

1551
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:13,219
cannabis cannabis education we should

1552
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:16,309
probably talk a little bit about

1553
01:25:13,219 --> 01:25:17,840
cannabis especially but I think our

1554
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:18,889
listeners enjoy getting a little inside

1555
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,449
of our heads in a little bit of our

1556
01:25:18,889 --> 01:25:22,250
world and knowing what's up with us I

1557
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:24,379
like like I said that Chris Hardwick

1558

1570
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:48,019

any ideas for women in cannabis it feels

1574
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:55,219
sexist a guy doing a show all about

1575
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:56,600
women in cannabis so anything I come up

1576

and will be weird so ladies send me some

1578

well I hate this your weed that you got

1619
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:58,630
now but that's fine to keep in a

1620
01:27:56,890 --> 01:28:00,369
sandwich baggy but when you upgrade and

1621
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:01,659
he gets a quality weed from somebody

1622
01:28:00,369 --> 01:28:02,769
that's a good caregiver that likes you

1623
01:28:01,659 --> 01:28:04,139
and doesn't want to see you smoking that

1624
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:06,340

1711
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:40,400

1712
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,599
Walmart's on either side of town and

1713

01:32:46,189 --> 01:32:52,429
out let it dry and then yeah it's it's

1717
01:32:50,329 --> 01:32:53,840
good in there and that's that's perfect

1718
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:56,150
for an eight you know especially like a

1719
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:57,170
fluffy eight yes you gotta wait until

1720
01:32:56,149 --> 01:32:59,179
you got to make sure your weeds dry

1721
01:32:57,170 --> 01:33:03,500
enough to go into a jar at sea that's

1722
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:05,000
what this podcast thing when my weed

1723
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:06,680
what I'm hearing and drying my weed I'll

1724
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,899
leave it a little bit extra moist for my

1725
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:10,730
personal so that I almost have to open

1726
01:33:08,899 --> 01:33:12,019
yes I do smoke flower still people don't

1727
01:33:10,729 --> 01:33:13,759
believe that I still smoke weed I do

1728
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,900
it's not always dabs but I'll leave my

1729
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,430
weed a little moist where I gotta open

1730
01:33:14,899 --> 01:33:18,199
the jar take the buds out and set them

1731
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:20,420
down for 10 or 20 minutes before I can

1732
01:33:18,199 --> 01:33:21,859
actually roll a joint with it that's

1733
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:23,720
just my personal if it's a production

1734
01:33:21,859 --> 01:33:25,399
crop for my patients I'm a caregiver and

1735
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:26,449
the herb that's gonna get delivered to a

1736
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:28,639
guy later on tonight

1737
01:33:26,449 --> 01:33:30,529
that stuff's dry it's been cured and

1738
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:32,630
it's dry it's ready to go into his jar

1739
01:33:30,529 --> 01:33:34,039
he'll keep he's getting half so it's

1740
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:35,690
probably gonna go in a mason jar

1741
01:33:34,039 --> 01:33:37,640
it'll be sealed up and he'll just he'll

1742
01:33:35,689 --> 01:33:39,199
probably pull out a little baby food jar

1743
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:41,150
worth for himself every couple of days

1744
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:42,319
when he needs it he hides the mason jar

1745
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:44,199
away from the family and has that in a

1746
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:46,789
safe place and keeps his charges pocket

1747
01:33:44,199 --> 01:33:49,550
and that will also if your weed is

1748
01:33:46,789 --> 01:33:51,859
really dry that may bring back some of

1749
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:53,690
the moisture in the crispest a good

1750
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:54,949
topic if your weeds really dry I see a

1751
01:33:53,689 --> 01:33:56,839
lot of people trying to put fruit and

1752
01:33:54,949 --> 01:33:59,659
[ __ ] in there don't do that you're gonna

1753
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,770
bring pathogens and molds it doesn't

1754
01:33:59,659 --> 01:34:02,649
take a lot of moisture to start molding

1755
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:05,020
up a jar if you leave it in there long

1756
01:34:02,649 --> 01:34:07,029
this company does not pay me [ __ ] but I

1757
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:09,820
do highly recommend Oh Bovada or a

1758
01:34:07,029 --> 01:34:12,369
Boveda human a pack it's a great product

1759
01:34:09,819 --> 01:34:14,198
off your weeds a little bit too dry or a

1760
01:34:12,369 --> 01:34:15,880
little too moist even you put the proper

1761
01:34:14,198 --> 01:34:19,238
Bova too humid a pack in with your herbs

1762
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:21,800
and it will properly moisten your herb

1763
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:24,898
to the moisture content that is desired

1764

right now it's the humidity the perfect

1767
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:43,150
around 67 or 76 it's somewhere in

1768
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:45,940
between there yeah well exactly there

1769
01:34:43,149 --> 01:34:47,529
are humidors for marijuana specifically

1770
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:51,579
the name because I want to give them a

1771
01:34:47,529 --> 01:34:54,039
plug either but they're shiny metal

1772
01:34:51,579 --> 01:34:56,170
they're cans they got a blocking seal to

1773
01:34:54,039 --> 01:34:57,939
them so it's and they come in all shapes

1774
01:34:56,170 --> 01:35:01,420
and sizes that's if you're you know the

1775
01:34:57,939 --> 01:35:04,809
high roller you're the pro I see people

1776
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:06,579
use them to transport cannabis for the

1777
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:08,949
campus cups and stuff like that you know

1778
01:35:06,579 --> 01:35:12,250
they'll basically have four or five of

1779
01:35:08,948 --> 01:35:13,809
the big pound storage ones and there's

1780
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:16,060
three of them in a backpack and they're

1781

you know and it's completely you know no

1783
01:35:19,029 --> 01:35:23,500
one ever knows because it's completely

1784
01:35:21,219 --> 01:35:25,779
sealed yeah you know still scary mark

1785
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:27,310
that has your package or humidifier

1786
01:35:25,779 --> 01:35:31,649
package that he's talking about that

1787
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:34,600
keeps it all at the same same humidity

1788
01:35:31,649 --> 01:35:35,829
and it doesn't really tell you what it

1789
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,409
keeps it at it says that it keeps it

1790
01:35:35,829 --> 01:35:41,260
within a certain range of ambient

1791
01:35:38,408 --> 01:35:42,579
humidity so yeah they have so many

1792
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:44,350

1804
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:14,619
not too damp and you're not afraid to

1805

get mold in it you can put your herb in

1806
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:18,449
a vacuum sealer bag and

1807
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:19,890
Keem steal that [ __ ] vacuum sealers

1808
01:36:18,449 --> 01:36:23,099
aren't too expensive the bags are too

1809
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:24,930
expensive seal it up label it market

1810
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:27,300
some people DJ short says to put it in

1811
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:28,770
the freezer at this point my dad always

1812
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:31,560
did my dough in a brown paper bag and

1813
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:32,850
then stick it put it in a bag put it in

1814
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:34,260
a brown paper bag and stick it in the

1815
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:36,120
freezer because that way none of the

1816
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:37,530
light would get in threat yeah I was

1817
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:38,789
gonna say that also keep your jars and

1818
01:36:37,529 --> 01:36:40,019
stuff in a dark place when you're not

1819
01:36:38,789 --> 01:36:41,640
smoking them if you have the opportunity

1820
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:46,980
or if you can get an opaque jar to cut

1821
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:48,329
white out a large you're good if you got

1822
01:36:46,979 --> 01:36:51,119
you got an ounce recorder pound keep

1823
01:36:48,329 --> 01:36:52,680
that out of out of the white really good

1824
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:55,739
about that question now that took a lot

1825
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:58,590
longer than I was thinking it would in

1826
01:36:55,739 --> 01:37:00,960
jars if you keep stuff in jars for

1827
01:36:58,590 --> 01:37:02,579
longer than I do obviously so would you

1828
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,739
go in there once a month and kind of

1829
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:05,699
dump it out now once it so once I feel

1830
01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:07,199
like we're gonna do a whole episode

1831
01:37:05,699 --> 01:37:08,460
about drying and curing once that

1832
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,960
process is ended

1833
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:11,520
once drying and curing is done you can

1834
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:12,899
put it in your jar just leave it it's

1835
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,520
almost better to leave it because every

1836
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:16,170
time you open it you're introducing

1837
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,940
oxygen and you're changing the gases

1838
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:19,980
that are in the plants the plants are

1839
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:22,859
actually releasing ammonia's and

1840
01:37:19,979 --> 01:37:24,149
chlorophylls I haven't studied for this

1841
01:37:22,859 --> 01:37:25,289
part so I'm gonna say wrong [ __ ] and a

1842
01:37:24,149 --> 01:37:26,969
lot of people are gonna correct me but

1843
01:37:25,289 --> 01:37:30,630
suppressing gases inside of there and

1844
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:32,730
you're exchanging those gases if you've

1845
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:34,500
quit introducing more gases the

1846
01:37:32,729 --> 01:37:35,909
decarboxylation and the changes will

1847
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:37,470
stop happening starches will quit

1848
01:37:35,909 --> 01:37:38,819
becoming sugars everything will stay

1849
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:42,300
right where it is all right it's like

1850
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:44,489
opening opening a food product you just

1851
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:45,480
get stale eventually cuz change same

1852
01:37:44,489 --> 01:37:47,849
thing will pretty much happen with your

1853
01:37:45,479 --> 01:37:49,619
weed yeah I've talked about this on the

1854
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:51,060
show before I like mine a little bit

1855
01:37:49,619 --> 01:37:53,430
drier because I put mine through a

1856
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:55,680
grinder and still get the kief off of

1857
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:57,930
those but under the you know my my

1858
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:00,119
grinder so I like it when I bring it

1859
01:37:57,930 --> 01:38:02,310
home I'll sit it in the jar and just

1860
01:38:00,119 --> 01:38:04,949
leave the the lid half on half off for

1861
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:06,780
12 hours and then put the jar you know

1862
01:38:04,949 --> 01:38:08,399
the lid back on it's still moist inside

1863
01:38:06,779 --> 01:38:11,609
the butt a little bit but it's that

1864
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:13,710
outer stuff is flakier and i could you

1865
01:38:11,609 --> 01:38:15,329
know get a little more a little more

1866
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:17,069
sticky you get a little more flavor out

1867
01:38:15,329 --> 01:38:19,350
of it but it's a little stickier you

1868
01:38:17,069 --> 01:38:21,509
don't let it dry out so much its burns a

1869
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:23,610
little bit better there you go I grow

1870
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:25,110
culture you got a question answered

1871
01:38:23,609 --> 01:38:26,369
Clint came over and asked a great

1872
01:38:25,109 --> 01:38:28,859
freaking question after you

1873
01:38:26,369 --> 01:38:31,920
that was nice yeah he also asks since

1874
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:33,420
he's a new smoker he asked so I hope you

1875
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,190
wrap that up how to story we'd put it in

1876
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:36,960
a jar baggies are cool but the baggie

1877
01:38:35,189 --> 01:38:38,339
has static electricity and it's stealing

1878
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,680
all your [ __ ] and all your [ __ ] sticking

1879
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:42,480
to it so keep in a jar enough jug of

1880
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:44,789
some sort all right if you have to be

1881
01:38:42,479 --> 01:38:46,919
sneaky they smell skunk proof bags that

1882
01:38:44,789 --> 01:38:50,039
are smell proof they also at Highgrove

1883
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:52,350
Pueblo they offer a duffel bag style bag

1884
01:38:50,039 --> 01:38:54,539
and a backpack that they claim is smell

1885
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:57,060
proof I have not tested it am i putting

1886
01:38:54,539 --> 01:38:58,590
any products in it but they claim such

1887
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:59,730
and they're they're decently priced so

1888
01:38:58,590 --> 01:39:01,590
if they work that's worth it

1889
01:38:59,729 --> 01:39:08,309
there's also stash cans and things like

1890
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:10,409

the IRA genetics only surefire way that

1923
01:41:01,159 --> 01:41:04,279
I think I know how to get past a drug

1924
01:41:02,899 --> 01:41:05,839
test that has worked for me multiple

1925
01:41:04,279 --> 01:41:09,590
times when I was a heavy smoker

1926
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:12,350
I actually went sixty-three days without

1927
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:13,850
smoking cannabis at one point and took a

1928
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:16,010
pee test I was trying to get a badass

1929
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:17,840
job I was promised a job sixty-three

1930
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:19,730
days if could not pass I was still hot I

1931
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:23,119
was drinking cranberry juice killing the

1932
01:41:19,729 --> 01:41:24,799
water test my family was mad at me like

1933
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:25,970
you [ __ ] it up even smoking pot and I

1934
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,500
was like honestly I went to ranking on

1935
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:29,150
the rocks and didn't smoke weed like I

1936
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:31,729
quit from the fourth of July puffed down

1937
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:33,139
and then for 90 days after that or 63

1938
01:41:31,729 --> 01:41:34,789
days after that I didn't smoke and still

1939
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:36,440
could not get this job that I wanted I

1940
01:41:34,789 --> 01:41:38,420
told that my was like I haven't smoked

1941
01:41:36,439 --> 01:41:39,889
in 65 sixty-three days and they're like

1942
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:41,149
sorry you still didn't I was like can

1943
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:42,650
you give me 30 more days and they were

1944
01:41:41,149 --> 01:41:45,289
already hiring for the position so it's

1945
01:41:42,649 --> 01:41:47,509
gone [ __ ] but so the next thing we need

1946
01:41:45,289 --> 01:41:50,329
to take a pee test I could not risk it

1947
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:54,230
might be even going in the cup honestly

1948
01:41:50,329 --> 01:41:56,539
so your best bet is to use fake piss

1949
01:41:54,229 --> 01:41:58,809
because they are not checking for fake

1950
01:41:56,539 --> 01:42:01,850
piss or piss they're looking for THC

1951
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:03,080
crystal meth opiate ecstasy whatever in

1952
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:04,730
our case hopefully guys if you're

1953
01:42:03,079 --> 01:42:06,019
listening to my show hopefully the only

1954
01:42:04,729 --> 01:42:08,419
thing they're gonna find in your pee is

1955
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:12,080
some [ __ ] medicine some cannabis but

1956
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:13,789
that's not my spot to judge ah so they

1957
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:15,979
sell a product that is straight-up fake

1958
01:42:13,789 --> 01:42:17,149
piss it is designed to be fake piss it's

1959
01:42:15,979 --> 01:42:18,619
usually it's some kind of a head shop

1960
01:42:17,149 --> 01:42:19,639
around here there's a couple spots you

1961
01:42:18,619 --> 01:42:21,619
can go you guys don't know where they

1962
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:23,480
are if you live around here yeah yeah

1963
01:42:21,619 --> 01:42:24,260
there's two spots unendorsed either one

1964
01:42:23,479 --> 01:42:25,489
of them they gonna work out of

1965
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:26,170
sponsorship if they want me to say their

1966
01:42:25,489 --> 01:42:29,260
names yes

1967
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:29,260
[Music]

1968
01:42:29,329 --> 01:42:33,929
you get this fake P and it's got a

1969
01:42:32,039 --> 01:42:36,029
thermometer on the side of the container

1970
01:42:33,929 --> 01:42:39,420
the bottle has a thermometer on it it

1971
01:42:36,029 --> 01:42:40,859
should come with a it's a glove warmer

1972
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:42,359
for the winter you crack the thing open

1973
01:42:40,859 --> 01:42:43,559
if you put your glove put it in your

1974
01:42:42,359 --> 01:42:45,509
gloves and it warms your hands in the

1975
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:48,570
winter it comes with one of those if it

1976
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:50,789
doesn't you got to go buy one so what I

1977
01:42:48,569 --> 01:42:52,349
do this is how I surefire passed more

1978
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:54,719
than one drug test I get this product

1979
01:42:52,349 --> 01:42:56,010
and I microwaved it for seven seconds in

1980
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:59,279
my microwave and that made it a little

1981
01:42:56,010 --> 01:43:01,530
too hot so I took a sock and I cut the

1982
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:03,000
sock off and I stapled it to the inside

1983
01:43:01,529 --> 01:43:06,090
of my boxers to where it looked like it

1984
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:08,550
was my dick swinging I put that warmed

1985
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:12,300
up bottle of microwaved fake piss in the

1986
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:13,829
sock I could tell that it was gonna be

1987
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,510
warm enough I went too long in the

1988
01:43:13,829 --> 01:43:17,340
microwave the thing got down you needed

1989
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:19,230
between 96 and a hundred degrees where

1990
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:20,670

1991
01:43:19,229 --> 01:43:22,769
let it cool down you guys let me

1992
01:43:20,670 --> 01:43:26,039

1993
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:29,639

1996
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:37,679
piss taking you to a lab and you should

1997
01:43:35,729 --> 01:43:40,529
be going into a closed area where you

1998
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,520
can pull out your dick and go right but

1999
01:43:40,529 --> 01:43:45,929
they wash your hands and check your

2000
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:47,580
pockets so I got this swing in the

2035

maybe it'll help you out don't worry

2040
01:44:52,979 --> 01:44:59,908
squirt pull out this little bottle and

2041
01:44:58,140 --> 01:45:00,929
just stick it out of the pee hole you're

2042
01:44:59,908 --> 01:45:02,069
flying stick your hand in there and

2043
01:45:00,929 --> 01:45:03,359
stick your thumb out so it's like a dick

2044
01:45:02,069 --> 01:45:04,198
because if they're standing behind you

2045
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:05,880
or something you're gonna have to be

2046
01:45:04,198 --> 01:45:08,698
smooth stick your thumb out make that

2047
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:10,170
look like your dog fart always for

2048
01:45:08,698 --> 01:45:14,759
during a pee test if someone's watching

2049
01:45:10,170 --> 01:45:16,079
that's just mandatory I squeeze the

2050
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:21,989
bottle the first time I did it into the

2051
01:45:16,079 --> 01:45:23,250
little sample Cup tip it up so that you

2052
01:45:21,988 --> 01:45:25,229
don't make a bong sound when you're

2053
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:31,140
[ __ ] doing that or for it right at

2054
01:45:25,229 --> 01:45:31,979
that point I screw the cap on to take

2055
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:33,960
you back in your underwear

2056
01:45:31,979 --> 01:45:35,099
okay don't wash your hands leave the cup

2057
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,300
there like you're supposed to and hope

2058
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:37,530
that you just put enough at the right

2059
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:39,739
temperature fake piss in there so that

2060
01:45:37,529 --> 01:45:43,229
fake piss worked for me more than once

2061
01:45:39,738 --> 01:45:45,029
fake piss don't trust my friend I will

2062
01:45:43,229 --> 01:45:46,529
say his name his girlfriend pee in the

2063
01:45:45,029 --> 01:45:59,759
cup and that's how they found out that

2064
01:45:46,529 --> 01:46:01,619
my buddy was pregnant he's got kids I

2065
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,000
don't even want to ask any questions so

2066
01:46:01,619 --> 01:46:05,969
we're not trying to mask it we're trying

2067
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,679
to replace it there's plenty of things

2068
01:46:05,969 --> 01:46:08,880
you can drink eat or whatever to take

2069
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:10,649
and all they've done is upset my stomach

2070
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:12,239
and give me diarrhea and by the time you

2071
01:46:10,649 --> 01:46:13,769
get to the lab you got a piece so bad

2072
01:46:12,238 --> 01:46:16,139
that your pee is clear and they go this

2073
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:19,350
is diluted we can't even test it yeah

2074
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:22,199
yeah so if it comes through you and if

2075
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:24,570
you smoke like Adam and I do I dab at

2076
01:46:22,198 --> 01:46:33,960
least a half a gram a day you could

2077
01:46:24,569 --> 01:46:35,549
honestly probably quit for 15 days I

2078
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:38,039
don't want to quit smoking weed though

2079
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:40,770
and it's just a random that's gonna come

2080
01:46:38,039 --> 01:46:42,448
up you know yeah so I don't want to quit

2081
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:44,010
if I wanted to quit I wouldn't have

2082
01:46:42,448 --> 01:46:46,119
started then you should you should

2083
01:46:44,010 --> 01:46:48,369
definitely get prepared I mean that's

2084
01:46:46,119 --> 01:46:50,019
best options that I've heard and then I

2085
01:46:48,369 --> 01:46:51,789
would just keep hand warmers on the

2086
01:46:50,020 --> 01:47:21,190
ready like I'd start wearing shirts with

2087
01:46:51,789 --> 01:47:23,109
pockets and like I'm not gonna use we've

2088
01:47:21,189 --> 01:47:24,429
got a 40 minutes 41 minutes you guys

2089
01:47:23,109 --> 01:47:27,279
want to you want to do one more question

2090
01:47:24,430 --> 01:47:31,020
I got one more but I bet we could go on

2091
01:47:27,279 --> 01:47:31,019
for quite a while about it if we do it

2092
01:47:31,289 --> 01:47:36,130
[Music]

2093
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,989
well the question was what kind of

2094
01:47:36,130 --> 01:47:40,060
lights are you using for each phase of

2095
01:47:37,989 --> 01:47:40,539
growing all right that could be really

2096
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:42,900
long

2097
01:47:40,539 --> 01:47:46,840
oh it could be really simple yeah so

2098
01:47:42,899 --> 01:47:48,009
quick rundown I've been oh I I know I

2099
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,480
started off doing a bunch of grow

2100
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:50,650
lessons and we got sidetracked because

2101
01:47:49,479 --> 01:47:53,079
Jesse came over and started doing

2102
01:47:50,649 --> 01:47:54,279
outdoor grow stuff we started talking

2103
01:47:53,079 --> 01:47:55,420
about all kinds of other stuff we kind

2104
01:47:54,279 --> 01:47:56,619
of lost track of the grow lesson the

2105
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:58,090
promise to get you caught up on those

2106
01:47:56,619 --> 01:47:59,289
there's just so much [ __ ] going on that

2107
01:47:58,090 --> 01:48:00,039
it's hard to even catch up we get

2108
01:47:59,289 --> 01:48:03,100
sidetracked

2109
01:48:00,039 --> 01:48:04,510
just busy season it's such a great year

2110
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:05,980
to do a podcast there's been so much

2111
01:48:04,510 --> 01:48:09,220
cannabis news and stuff to talk about

2112
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:10,539
that's true yeah Jesse will be here in a

2113
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:14,140
couple of days and we're gonna work on

2114
01:48:10,539 --> 01:48:16,180
finishing up the drying and curing

2115
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:17,230
episode so that'll definitely be fun but

2116
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:20,230
what kind of lights do I use that's

2117
01:48:17,229 --> 01:48:22,029
where I was for seedlings and stuff

2118
01:48:20,229 --> 01:48:24,939
that's just starting simple t5 s are

2119
01:48:22,029 --> 01:48:27,789
fine a lot of guys for essence correct

2120
01:48:24,939 --> 01:48:29,349
yeah it's t5 fluorescent sy t fives are

2121
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:31,180
the little skinny bulbs so they name on

2122
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:33,550
t5 - the skinny ones and ta - the bigger

2123
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:35,170
ones just what size they are so I keep

2124
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:37,590
my seedlings and my clothes under t

2125
01:48:35,170 --> 01:48:39,489
fives until they're good and rooted

2126
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:40,420
depending on which room they're going

2127
01:48:39,489 --> 01:48:42,099
and what I'm trying to do with them

2128
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:43,480
sometimes they'll stay under t fives and

2129
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:45,579
tell flowers if I'm just doing a three

2130
01:48:43,479 --> 01:48:47,199
gallon pot of a little plant and the

2131
01:48:45,579 --> 01:48:49,090
reason why you run T fives is not only

2132
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:50,829
because of the heat but because it's it

2133
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:51,880
you can get closer to the plant right

2134
01:48:50,829 --> 01:48:54,100
you put them right on the plant and

2135
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:55,270
they're more energy efficient than a big

2136
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,680
lie and I don't think that the plant

2137
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:58,240
really needs a thousand watt light when

2138
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:58,479
it's a baby you can just give it enough

2139
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:00,010
to

2140
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:01,449
and that spectrum they sell to different

2141
01:49:00,010 --> 01:49:03,599
color bulbs if you get the blue ones

2142
01:49:01,448 --> 01:49:06,219
those keep your plants short and squat

2143
01:49:03,599 --> 01:49:07,328
that's what we want for van and until

2144
01:49:06,219 --> 01:49:08,708
your plants are two and a half three

2145
01:49:07,328 --> 01:49:09,908
feet tall that's plenty of light don't

2146
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:11,738
keep them too crowded and they're given

2147
01:49:09,908 --> 01:49:13,029
plenty of space with the t5 s but yeah

2148
01:49:11,738 --> 01:49:15,788
it's difficult

2149
01:49:13,029 --> 01:49:18,309
I've seen people flower with t5 s I have

2150
01:49:15,788 --> 01:49:19,658
two it's not impressive but if you're in

2151
01:49:18,309 --> 01:49:20,949
Tennessee where you're not supposed to

2152
01:49:19,658 --> 01:49:22,448
be drawn weed and you can't get a big

2153
01:49:20,948 --> 01:49:24,158
light built that's gonna be better than

2154
01:49:22,448 --> 01:49:25,719
buying weed officer on the street and

2155
01:49:24,158 --> 01:49:28,478
I've seen some people grow some pretty

2156
01:49:25,719 --> 01:49:30,969
dank stuff okay you know with it so to

2157
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:32,619
start I like the other T fives once you

2158
01:49:30,969 --> 01:49:35,288
get a little bit larger I will throw

2159
01:49:32,618 --> 01:49:37,719
them under I go straight to the thousand

2160
01:49:35,288 --> 01:49:40,090
watt metal halide for fetching I've got

2161
01:49:37,719 --> 01:49:41,170
a nice bedroom with metal halides in

2162
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:44,078
there to keep them kind of close to the

2163
01:49:41,170 --> 01:49:45,729
plants the hoarder looks I think it's

2164
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:46,929
the blue I forget which one they make

2165
01:49:45,729 --> 01:49:48,670
for it's the hoarder looks like they

2166
01:49:46,929 --> 01:49:51,399
make for vegging the blue one that's

2167
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:53,708
awesome for vegging or deluxe makes a

2168
01:49:51,399 --> 01:49:55,238
high-pressure sodium that is red that's

2169
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:56,920
super awesome for flowering I like to

2170
01:49:55,238 --> 01:49:59,518
switch to that now with tear when you

2171
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:02,920
step from the t5 to the bigger lights

2172
01:49:59,519 --> 01:50:05,769
how just give us a range on like how far

2173
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:09,849
you want to keep them you know I as far

2174
01:50:05,769 --> 01:50:11,110
as close as you can get them within you

2175
01:50:09,849 --> 01:50:11,920
don't want to you know you kind of want

2176
01:50:11,109 --> 01:50:14,558
to get them as close as you can without

2177
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,779
burning the plants but there is a range

2178
01:50:14,559 --> 01:50:19,090
around a thousand watt light bulb they

2179
01:50:16,779 --> 01:50:20,590
is the unusable light for the plant it's

2180
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:22,208
just too intense and it's the wrong

2181
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:23,889
spectrum so you have to back up about a

2182
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:24,368
foot and a half two feet from the bulb

2183
01:50:23,889 --> 01:50:25,809
okay

2184
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:28,598
it's probably your best bet all right

2185
01:50:25,809 --> 01:50:29,979
but only the tops of your plants are up

2186
01:50:28,599 --> 01:50:31,538
there so the bottoms of your plants you

2187
01:50:29,979 --> 01:50:32,949
got a there's a lot of factors to keep

2188
01:50:31,538 --> 01:50:34,538
in there but about a foot eighteen

2189
01:50:32,948 --> 01:50:35,799
inches to a foot is probably about as

2190
01:50:34,538 --> 01:50:37,840
close as you really want to get unless

2191
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:39,309
you've got some amazing cooling it off

2192
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:40,690
you've got really well ducted and

2193
01:50:39,309 --> 01:50:44,199
ventilated lights then you can get them

2194
01:50:40,689 --> 01:50:45,609
ten eight inches but sometimes that that

2195
01:50:44,198 --> 01:50:47,379
bursts of light coming right out of

2196
01:50:45,609 --> 01:50:49,808
there isn't what the plants really want

2197
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:51,489
that will kind of stress the plants and

2198
01:50:49,809 --> 01:50:53,349
change the flavors and kind of do a few

2199
01:50:51,488 --> 01:50:54,939
things that if you want a certain effect

2200
01:50:53,349 --> 01:50:56,949
that's how I achieve one effect when I'm

2201
01:50:54,939 --> 01:50:59,169
trying to do something is light stress

2202
01:50:56,948 --> 01:51:00,879
to plan a little bit but I don't want to

2203
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:03,840
tell too much about that so I'm vegging

2204
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:05,800
under the t fives I'm moving to the

2205
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:08,170
metal halides and then I go to high

2206
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:09,760
pressure sodium Stu finish a long time

2207
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:11,349
ago I tried an experiment using high

2208
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,739
pressure sodium and metal halides and I

2209
01:51:11,349 --> 01:51:15,130
honestly

2210
01:51:11,738 --> 01:51:16,988
get the best flavors using a mixture the

2211
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:19,480
different spectrums yeah yeah using like

2212
01:51:16,988 --> 01:51:22,268
in the red I got for high pressure

2213
01:51:19,479 --> 01:51:23,649
sodium with with a 1 metal halide right

2214
01:51:22,269 --> 01:51:24,670
in the middle of the room and all the

2215
01:51:23,649 --> 01:51:25,868
plants in the middle of the room were a

2216
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:29,139
little more dense had a little more

2217
01:51:25,868 --> 01:51:30,969
flavor I learned that by running the old

2218
01:51:29,139 --> 01:51:33,460
reflector cultic rozilla it holds two

2219
01:51:30,969 --> 01:51:35,260
bolts I put a 600 sodium and a 400

2220
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:37,210
howlite in there and everything in that

2221
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:39,159
little tester came out dank some of the

2222
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:40,748
pictures I'm headband on my facebook or

2223
01:51:39,158 --> 01:51:43,058
actually from that Hut it was amazing

2224
01:51:40,748 --> 01:51:45,729
yeah I've seen this picture Super Dave

2225
01:51:43,059 --> 01:51:51,670
is that his headband yours I did not

2226
01:51:45,729 --> 01:51:53,768
make it no okay actually I got to talk

2227
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:55,840
to dr. dank today or mr. dank today the

2228
01:51:53,769 --> 01:51:57,340
creator of the golden goat in a little

2229
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:58,989
conversation on Facebook that was kind

2230
01:51:57,340 --> 01:52:00,069
of nice because I did not create golden

2231
01:51:58,988 --> 01:52:01,779
goat a lot of people try to give me

2232
01:52:00,069 --> 01:52:03,238
credit for that mr. daint created golden

2233
01:52:01,779 --> 01:52:05,380
God I simply put it into seed I

2234
01:52:03,238 --> 01:52:06,998
effeminate I reversed the female made a

2235
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:11,679
meal out of it put the pollen on another

2236
01:52:06,998 --> 01:52:13,389
female yes it's a date cut so I made

2237
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:14,498
seeds out of the golden goat they just

2238
01:52:13,389 --> 01:52:16,980
want to give credit to the guy that made

2239
01:52:14,498 --> 01:52:19,090
it thank mr. dank he did that not me

2240
01:52:16,979 --> 01:52:20,198
thanks mr. dink to let me use it he

2241
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:23,429
actually gave me permission to put it

2242
01:52:20,198 --> 01:52:25,868
into seed and he said all he wants

2243
01:52:23,429 --> 01:52:28,868
everybody deserved good genetics that's

2244
01:52:25,868 --> 01:52:31,118
part of why I started making seeds so I

2245
01:52:28,868 --> 01:52:34,058
usually do fluorescence halide sodium's

2246
01:52:31,118 --> 01:52:36,729
a lot of people will ask about LEDs I

2247
01:52:34,059 --> 01:52:48,460
used to knock an LED light but my friend

2248
01:52:36,729 --> 01:52:49,899
Nancy kills both look frosty and I was

2249
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:51,609
just about to see she's running a lot of

2250
01:52:49,899 --> 01:52:54,509
stuff that's from other growers not even

2251
01:52:51,609 --> 01:52:57,460
me that looks amazing just as well

2252
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:59,679
what's the one that she's guys in DB

2253
01:52:57,460 --> 01:53:01,300
Cooper it's just giant nuggs it looks

2254
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:02,769
really nice yeah yeah

2255
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:08,519
it's he's doing a great job with the

2256
01:53:02,769 --> 01:53:08,519
grows well talking about lemon growers

2257
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:15,908
individual that could probably you know

2258
01:53:14,498 --> 01:53:17,319
put a paragraph in that you could read

2259
01:53:15,908 --> 01:53:19,238
yeah there we go

2260
01:53:17,319 --> 01:53:20,939
support those women growers for sure

2261
01:53:19,238 --> 01:53:23,579
what Clint says

2262
01:53:20,939 --> 01:53:25,799
I like that you gotta have an approach

2263
01:53:23,579 --> 01:53:27,359
as a comedian and one time Clint told me

2264
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:35,760
go on the chauvinist route and I

2265
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:37,559
believed him it's it's the it's really

2266
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:39,930
easy and that's why I don't like it

2267
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:44,520
yeah is because it's for me it's easy to

2268
01:53:39,930 --> 01:53:47,579
write those jokes it's just not fun it's

2269
01:53:44,520 --> 01:54:01,560
just an easy target I'm saying women are

2270
01:53:47,579 --> 01:54:03,359
easy targets I'm gonna do some plugs

2271
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:04,620
Clint has a lot of [ __ ] to plug tell us

2272
01:54:03,359 --> 01:54:06,000
about your Facebook's your Instagram

2273

hate mail

professional comedian coming to pueblos

2290
01:54:41,069 --> 01:54:45,719
like it's not like oh but it's like you

2291
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:47,310
guys are gonna miss it and I don't want

2292
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:48,840
anybody to miss it like oh I didn't even

2293
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:51,239
hear about that you know I heard like

2294
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:53,869
one of my favorite bands Baroness have

2295
01:54:51,238 --> 01:54:56,639
you ever heard they're like a metal band

2296
01:54:53,869 --> 01:54:58,649
one of my favorite bands and my buddy

2297
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:01,469
Paul who does comedy with me told me

2298
01:54:58,649 --> 01:55:03,448
yeah we had them back in like 2000 come

2299
01:55:01,469 --> 01:55:06,060
through and play some house show they're

2300
01:55:03,448 --> 01:55:08,519
[ __ ] huge they're like a huge band in

2301
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:10,320
metal and they're just like I missed it

2302
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:11,310
and that's that's why you miss it though

2303
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:12,929
is because you don't know what's

2304
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:14,340
happening yeah and there's not enough to

down there everyday it seems like though

2311

2402
02:04:29,710 --> 02:04:34,659
do with a really popular new lighting

2403
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:36,070
systems I don't even know the news I'm

2404
02:04:34,659 --> 02:04:39,079

2405

2407
02:04:44,359 --> 02:04:52,219
Label Black Label nutrients are they 50%

2408
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:52,850
off 10% above cost 10% above cost so

2409
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:54,170
whatever

2410
02:04:52,850 --> 02:04:55,490
check it out guys whatever they paid for

2411
02:04:54,170 --> 02:04:58,279
these nutrients they're gonna sell them

2412
02:04:55,489 --> 02:05:00,260
to you for 10% above that but after that

2413
02:04:58,279 --> 02:05:02,659
it will no longer carry the light of

2414
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:04,850
products yeah it's nothing wrong with it

2415
02:05:02,659 --> 02:05:06,889
it's just not a big seller for us it's a

2416
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:09,620
small shop also you can't carry every

2417
02:05:06,890 --> 02:05:11,450
two single line in there we replaced it

2418
02:05:09,619 --> 02:05:12,949
with some botanic hair products and we

2419
02:05:11,449 --> 02:05:14,899
already sold out of the stuff we stocked

2420
02:05:12,949 --> 02:05:16,519
in today so I recommend botanic are

2421
02:05:14,899 --> 02:05:24,589
strongly to everybody that I teach how

2422
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:26,420
to grow so that could have some small if

2423
02:05:24,590 --> 02:05:27,860
you listen to this show idle talk a lot

2424
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:29,600
about the nutrients I use I try to keep

2425
02:05:27,859 --> 02:05:30,889
a lot of my uh that's kind of stuff that

2426
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:32,600
I like to let people experiment on their

2427
02:05:30,890 --> 02:05:35,210
own botanic air doesn't pay me anything

2428
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:37,850
go to hydro pueblos support their new

2429
02:05:35,210 --> 02:05:41,840
their adventure is it a venture business

2430
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:44,630
venture I recommend it's what I use I

2431
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:46,010
promise I've talked about grow feeding

2432
02:05:44,630 --> 02:05:50,980
recipes and [ __ ] and all of it is

2433
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:50,980
included botanic probro

2434
02:05:51,020 --> 02:06:19,040
it smells almost drinkable Cannabis Cup

2435
02:06:01,039 --> 02:06:20,300
winning nutrients right there what we're

2436
02:06:19,039 --> 02:06:21,439
trying to do they're also good to the

2437
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:23,270
environment that must seem to be real

2438
02:06:21,439 --> 02:06:25,159
dirty I like that

2439
02:06:23,270 --> 02:06:26,960
liquid Karma's a good product you can

2440
02:06:25,159 --> 02:06:33,470
add liquid karma to any feed regimen and

2441
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:34,819
it will help you out vitamin e know is a

2442
02:06:33,470 --> 02:06:37,820
new product that they're putting out

2443
02:06:34,819 --> 02:06:40,939
that is a good product fold X in a

2444
02:06:37,819 --> 02:06:42,619
foliar spray it's a good product and OGT

2445
02:06:40,939 --> 02:06:43,969
see none of these we're not getting paid

2446
02:06:42,619 --> 02:06:45,019
for any of these free commercials we're

2447
02:06:43,970 --> 02:06:46,340
doing right now it's just this is just

2448
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:48,780
from our heart that's what we do it's

2449
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:51,449
what we use high quality products that

2450
02:06:48,779 --> 02:06:54,269
I wouldn't talk about [ __ ] on this

2451
02:06:51,449 --> 02:06:55,679
show alright so it is time to talk about

2452
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:57,570
the end of the grouse season sorry that

2453
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:59,789
music was kind of distracting both of us

2454
02:06:57,569 --> 02:07:00,389
let's focus a little bit our seasons

2455
02:06:59,789 --> 02:07:02,069
been fun

2456
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:07,710
nobody's stolen your [ __ ] hopefully you

2457
02:07:02,069 --> 02:07:09,029
didn't have to shoot anybody hopefully

2458
02:07:07,710 --> 02:07:10,590
you got to harvest everything hopefully

2459
02:07:09,029 --> 02:07:13,170
you didn't get that frost on it that one

2460
02:07:10,590 --> 02:07:15,150
night it's coming up guys if you haven't

2461
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:16,770
cut down yet you're a week or two away

2462
02:07:15,149 --> 02:07:25,769
maybe three or four weeks at the most

2463
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:28,050
right in the backyard it's really time

2464
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:29,970
to get your [ __ ] together it's time to

2465
02:07:28,050 --> 02:07:31,199
flush flushing is important even if your

2466
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:32,789
this is something that I've always

2467
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:34,769
wanted to touch on on the show let's

2468
02:07:32,789 --> 02:07:36,000
talk for a bowl give it however much

2469
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:39,360
time this takes we'll talk about

2470
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,800
flushing yeah flushing as you're feeding

2471
02:07:39,359 --> 02:07:42,509
all of your cannabis plants you were

2472
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,220
pouring even if you're using organics

2473
02:07:42,510 --> 02:07:46,590
you're pouring stuff into the root zone

2474
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:50,159
that is staying in the soil and your

2475
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:51,600
plants are feeding off of that you don't

2476
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:53,819
want to smoke whatever you're feeding

2477
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:55,530
your plants you don't want that taste in

2478
02:07:53,819 --> 02:07:57,210
your buds at the end you don't want

2479
02:07:55,529 --> 02:08:01,949
nitrogen you don't want phosphorous you

2480
02:07:57,210 --> 02:08:04,380
don't want potassium in your buds so the

2481
02:08:01,949 --> 02:08:05,760
plant actually takes up nutrients it

2482
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:07,560
puts the nutrients where they want and

2483
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:09,570
then yes your plants do spit out the

2484
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:11,220
excess nutrients through the roots again

2485
02:08:09,569 --> 02:08:13,109
it basically shits them right out I'm

2486
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:15,480
keeping this real simple what we need to

2487
02:08:13,109 --> 02:08:18,899
do now is flush the toilet we need to

2488
02:08:15,479 --> 02:08:20,579
get that we just want clean dirt for

2489
02:08:18,899 --> 02:08:21,960
sure and if you're recycling your dirt

2490
02:08:20,579 --> 02:08:23,850
this is a good point this is where you

2491
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:25,980
actually start recycling your dirt is

2492
02:08:23,850 --> 02:08:27,450
that the flush of an indoor plant so

2493
02:08:25,979 --> 02:08:28,979
this works for the outdoor we want to do

2494
02:08:27,449 --> 02:08:32,729
this to every cannabis plant you ever

2495
02:08:28,979 --> 02:08:36,419
grow before you harvest it 10 to 14 days

2496
02:08:32,729 --> 02:08:38,069
before you cut down that plant water

2497
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:40,230
that [ __ ] out of the plant water it as

2498
02:08:38,069 --> 02:08:44,069
much as you can and from then on out

2499
02:08:40,229 --> 02:08:47,099
only give it clean water just clean pH

2500
02:08:44,069 --> 02:08:49,799
if you can but this is the end so just

2501
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:51,829
give it a lot of clean water a watering

2502
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:53,628
real well go ahead I'll let you jump in

2503
02:08:51,828 --> 02:08:55,938
container plants there's a 20 gallon

2504
02:08:53,628 --> 02:08:59,059
container probably give it 20 gallons of

2505
02:08:55,939 --> 02:09:03,829
water and that's I want to see you know

2506
02:08:59,059 --> 02:09:07,099
pretty much you'll have from 17 gallons

2507
02:09:03,828 --> 02:09:09,469
of water come out probably yeah I

2508
02:09:07,099 --> 02:09:13,128
dragged a 7 gallon pot to an area where

2509
02:09:09,469 --> 02:09:14,328
I have a drain and I will pour about 15

2510
02:09:13,128 --> 02:09:17,479
gallons of water through a central

2511
02:09:14,328 --> 02:09:19,308
gallon pot and repeat it you know this

2512
02:09:17,479 --> 02:09:20,869
is yeah just keep pouring water you get

2513
02:09:19,309 --> 02:09:22,550
get however much water you can fill that

2514
02:09:20,868 --> 02:09:24,108
pot with pour it in there let it drain

2515
02:09:22,550 --> 02:09:25,668
through it'll pour out go back in a

2516
02:09:24,109 --> 02:09:27,109
couple of minutes pour another pitcher

2517
02:09:25,668 --> 02:09:29,809
or a bucket or whatever you're using

2518
02:09:27,109 --> 02:09:31,789
pour more water in there if you can set

2519
02:09:29,809 --> 02:09:33,439
the hose in your plants on your pot

2520
02:09:31,788 --> 02:09:36,378
plants water them until you're afraid

2521
02:09:33,439 --> 02:09:37,668
that it's over watered up you're not too

2522
02:09:36,378 --> 02:09:38,899
worried about killing them at this point

2523
02:09:37,668 --> 02:09:40,550
it is the end of the season

2524
02:09:38,899 --> 02:09:42,499
you won't overwater on there outdoors

2525
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:43,849
that water will go somewhere you want to

2526
02:09:42,498 --> 02:09:45,529
get all that nutrients off there the

2527
02:09:43,849 --> 02:09:47,389
indoor container plants Jesse's perfect

2528
02:09:45,529 --> 02:09:49,550
on that just water that pot as much as

2529
02:09:47,389 --> 02:09:50,628
you can if you have to it's kind of hard

2530
02:09:49,550 --> 02:09:52,159
to get a plant somewhere if you're

2531
02:09:50,628 --> 02:09:53,689
working a seven gallon pot you need to

2532
02:09:52,158 --> 02:10:02,299
get it kind of up off the ground so

2533
02:09:53,689 --> 02:10:03,530
it'll drain properly yeah a lot of you

2534
02:10:02,300 --> 02:10:05,329
guys are growing in the basement and you

2535
02:10:03,529 --> 02:10:07,099
got a dedicated bathroom set that sucker

2536
02:10:05,328 --> 02:10:08,599
in the shower put it up on two cinder

2537
02:10:07,099 --> 02:10:10,609
blocks under the pot so that it doesn't

2538
02:10:08,599 --> 02:10:11,989
go anywhere and that treats a lot of

2539
02:10:10,609 --> 02:10:13,369
drainage space that water will pour

2540
02:10:11,988 --> 02:10:15,138
right out of those bottom holes of the

2541
02:10:13,368 --> 02:10:16,908
pot if you've got a three gallon pot set

2542
02:10:15,139 --> 02:10:18,288
thought put a couple of cinder blocks in

2543
02:10:16,908 --> 02:10:20,268
your garage maybe where you can get some

2544
02:10:18,288 --> 02:10:22,248
water going or if you got a cool

2545
02:10:20,269 --> 02:10:23,418
backyard where your stash is kind of

2546
02:10:22,248 --> 02:10:25,069
hidden you don't want it don't show your

2547
02:10:23,418 --> 02:10:27,078
pot plants to your neighbors and be real

2548
02:10:25,069 --> 02:10:27,738
careful about bringing bugs in but this

2549
02:10:27,078 --> 02:10:29,358
is the end

2550
02:10:27,738 --> 02:10:32,238
you got to flush them real good always

2551
02:10:29,359 --> 02:10:33,829
14 it's 10 to 14 days with nothing but

2552
02:10:32,238 --> 02:10:36,288
water if you had any nutrient burn

2553
02:10:33,828 --> 02:10:38,268
problems get in there maybe a week

2554
02:10:36,288 --> 02:10:42,078
before you can I don't think you can

2555
02:10:38,269 --> 02:10:43,550
over flush the only thing you're gonna

2556
02:10:42,078 --> 02:10:45,228
do is kill it I mean it's gonna run out

2557
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:46,639
it's gonna be starving to death down the

2558
02:10:45,229 --> 02:10:52,639
roots because you're giving it you know

2559
02:10:46,639 --> 02:10:55,458
15 gallons you know this is flushing

2560
02:10:52,639 --> 02:10:57,409
will help your plants burn better don't

2561
02:10:55,458 --> 02:11:00,438
dry and cure better they'll smoke

2562
02:10:57,408 --> 02:11:02,058
they'll smoke better don't taste they'll

2563
02:11:00,439 --> 02:11:04,128
smell better have you ever smoked pot

2564
02:11:02,059 --> 02:11:05,890
that uh it almost tastes like you just

2565
02:11:04,128 --> 02:11:08,059
stuck your tongue in a light socket

2566
02:11:05,890 --> 02:11:11,060
who's that burnt [ __ ] on your tongue

2567
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:12,710
probably had not been flushed I feel

2568
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:16,700
like I can name the brand a nutrient

2569
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:18,289
sometimes I can taste worm castings a

2570
02:11:16,699 --> 02:11:20,000
lot of times in people's weed I can

2571
02:11:18,289 --> 02:11:21,920
taste advance nutrients honestly if you

2572
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,810
overdo a couple of things in botanic air

2573
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:24,899
I can taste it if you overdo it and

2574
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:28,450
don't flush it

2575
02:11:24,899 --> 02:11:28,449
[Music]

2576
02:11:28,569 --> 02:11:35,119
I think gh always has a it brings out

2577
02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:35,869
the limonene smell I think a candy

2578
02:11:35,119 --> 02:11:40,340
lemony

2579
02:11:35,869 --> 02:11:41,689
lemonhead candy I think so so if you've

2580
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:43,699
got something that you want that is a

2581
02:11:41,689 --> 02:11:45,739
lemon strain then you want to bring out

2582
02:11:43,699 --> 02:11:47,750
that lemon feed at the general

2583
02:11:45,739 --> 02:11:49,639
hydroponics also I don't say this a lot

2584
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:51,409
this is kind of a secretive thing that a

2585
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:52,970
lot of us know that one of those things

2586
02:11:51,409 --> 02:11:54,920
you have to like read a lot to learn

2587
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:57,020
stressing the plant with light stress

2588
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:58,310
and heat will bring out limonene so if

2589
02:11:57,020 --> 02:12:00,110
you're trying to lemon up your lemon

2590
02:11:58,310 --> 02:12:02,330
strains drop that light a little bit to

2591
02:12:00,109 --> 02:12:04,929
close around week six of ripening and

2592
02:12:02,329 --> 02:12:06,949
you'll bring out the limonene terpenoid

2593
02:12:04,930 --> 02:12:08,150
little also stress your plants a little

2594
02:12:06,949 --> 02:12:09,970
bit so you're gonna have to adjust on

2595
02:12:08,149 --> 02:12:11,689
that your top leaders are gonna brown up

2596
02:12:09,970 --> 02:12:16,670
sometimes we're not growing for pretty

2597
02:12:11,689 --> 02:12:18,169
plants sometimes cookies is gorgeous

2598
02:12:16,670 --> 02:12:29,329
right up until about week eight and then

2599
02:12:18,170 --> 02:12:31,430
she's so I'm teasing you check out this

2600

girl's gorilla glue number four nugget

2601
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:38,300
I'm gonna reach the finished product of

2602
02:12:36,979 --> 02:12:44,479
the gorilla glue everybody around here

2603
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:47,029
is passing yeah that's nice

2604
02:12:44,479 --> 02:12:48,259
shout out to elbow he does not listen to

2605
02:12:47,029 --> 02:12:50,659
the show I don't think but I'll get him

2606
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:53,300
to and he'll hear this that's well done

2607
02:12:50,659 --> 02:12:56,349
he did a good job with that glue number

2608
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:56,350
four I don't know if it's ready

hate the word moist throw in moist out

2611
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:08,659
there you know does that all right

2612
02:13:07,489 --> 02:13:10,369
we've kind of ranted on about flushing

2613
02:13:08,659 --> 02:13:13,939
the point here is flush your damn weed

2614
02:13:10,369 --> 02:13:15,199
we can tell the people that can tell can

2615
02:13:13,939 --> 02:13:17,428
tell and they're the ones that you want

2616
02:13:15,199 --> 02:13:21,538
to impress if it's hydro

2617
02:13:17,429 --> 02:13:23,429
flushing is even more important don't

2618
02:13:21,538 --> 02:13:25,319
really talk about hydro growing very

2619
02:13:23,429 --> 02:13:28,649
much and there's a reason for that but

2620
02:13:25,319 --> 02:13:30,808
um I have zero experience in hydro I'm

2621
02:13:28,649 --> 02:13:33,538
not an easy cloner that's about as far

2622
02:13:30,809 --> 02:13:37,320
as I get I've seen Sparky weed for my

2623
02:13:33,538 --> 02:13:38,880
Joey from hydro system if you've got a

2624
02:13:37,319 --> 02:13:40,679
Red Bull of nutrients you're constantly

2625
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:42,809
pumping that line it's very important

2626
02:13:40,679 --> 02:13:44,849
actually it's important throughout the

2627
02:13:42,809 --> 02:13:47,820
entire growth cycle every couple of

2628
02:13:44,849 --> 02:13:49,708
weeks you should be flushing and using

2629
02:13:47,819 --> 02:13:51,118
one of those flush products clear ex I

2630
02:13:49,708 --> 02:13:53,069
was just about to ask how do you feel

2631
02:13:51,118 --> 02:13:57,089
about those flush products not

2632
02:13:53,069 --> 02:14:46,859
necessarily for dirt in my opinion but

2633
02:13:57,090 --> 02:14:47,939
for hydroponics you need to help yeah so

2634
02:14:46,859 --> 02:14:49,139
flushing your plants really good is

2635
02:14:47,939 --> 02:14:50,400
really important you want to impress

Jesse and I with your weed and the only

2637
02:14:50,399 --> 02:14:57,089
way you're gonna do it also you don't

2638
02:14:55,319 --> 02:14:59,188
want to give sick people weed with [ __ ]

2639
02:14:57,090 --> 02:15:00,510
in it that's not what a caregiver does

2640
02:14:59,189 --> 02:15:02,130
it's not what a compassionate person

2641
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:03,780
does it's not what a responsible person

2642
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:05,159
does you're on the other team and you're

2643
02:15:03,779 --> 02:15:07,708
growing that weed that should be illegal

2644
02:15:05,158 --> 02:15:09,448
you're on this reason that makes

2645
02:15:07,708 --> 02:15:12,748
prohibition happen if you're going weed

2646
02:15:09,448 --> 02:15:18,958
that has not been flushed exactly he

2647
02:15:12,748 --> 02:15:21,958
said you think about not even sick

2648
02:15:18,958 --> 02:15:23,248
people like you know that's the II just

2649
02:15:21,958 --> 02:15:25,198
don't want to put that in anyone's body

2650
02:15:23,248 --> 02:15:26,469
right that's horrible thing to do to

2651
02:15:25,198 --> 02:15:29,000
someone

2652
02:15:26,469 --> 02:15:30,560
all right so you've flushed your plants

2653
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:35,390
now it's time oh we're gonna talk about

2654
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:37,580
D leafing after you flush a few days

2655
02:15:35,390 --> 02:15:39,350
before harvest time you want to get in

2656
02:15:37,579 --> 02:15:41,479
there and take off the fan leaves all

2657
02:15:39,350 --> 02:15:43,039
those big leaves that are in your way if

2658
02:15:41,479 --> 02:15:45,229
they've got what's called a pea deal

2659
02:15:43,039 --> 02:15:46,640
that's the stem that reaches to the

2660
02:15:45,229 --> 02:15:47,839
large there's some other people

2661
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:49,340
pronounce it differently you can tweet

2662
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:51,710
me and argue me that's just how I've

2663
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:53,510
read it so it anything with the P deal

2664
02:15:51,710 --> 02:15:55,369
you can reach and cut off chop all those

2665
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:56,030
leaves off clean those things out of

2666
02:15:55,369 --> 02:15:57,349
your grow room

2667
02:15:56,029 --> 02:16:00,050
don't just chop them and leave them on

2668
02:15:57,350 --> 02:16:01,460
the floor Hills bring bugs feed them to

2669
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:03,170
your chickens if you've had a clean

2670
02:16:01,460 --> 02:16:14,239
drove room you can possibly juice those

2671
02:16:03,170 --> 02:16:16,279
if you're into it you can cut off some

2672
02:16:14,238 --> 02:16:17,359
of the outer leaf if you want but you

2673
02:16:16,279 --> 02:16:19,819
might want to save that if you're making

2674
02:16:17,359 --> 02:16:21,529
hash just decide how much trichome is on

2675
02:16:19,819 --> 02:16:22,670
that if there's not a trichome on it you

2676
02:16:21,529 --> 02:16:24,170
can take it off right now

2677
02:16:22,670 --> 02:16:26,750
like you mentioned Girl Scout cookies

2678
02:16:24,170 --> 02:16:27,469
they always have a little PTO coming out

2679
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:29,899
of the nug

2680
02:16:27,469 --> 02:16:31,880
yeah such a long one too I you know

2681
02:16:29,899 --> 02:16:34,489
depending on how far it is like you said

2682
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:36,590
with hash some of them are a little

2683
02:16:34,489 --> 02:16:38,299
closer I'll keep that one on there just

2684
02:16:36,590 --> 02:16:40,700
because I see that little little bit of

2685
02:16:38,299 --> 02:16:45,759
resin in there and I can get greedy with

2686
02:16:40,700 --> 02:16:45,760
resin resin farmers brother

2687
02:16:45,860 --> 02:16:51,380
but yeah if it's very long I cut that

2688
02:16:49,069 --> 02:16:56,409
[ __ ] off you know coming out out of

2689
02:16:51,379 --> 02:16:58,670
the bud so clarify that a little bit I

2690
02:16:56,409 --> 02:17:02,420
found a knob that'll turn everything up

2691
02:16:58,670 --> 02:17:04,760
a little yeah all right so uh cut off

2692
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:06,679
all those fan leaves now while you're

2693
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:08,300
flushing you've got a few days now you

2694
02:17:06,679 --> 02:17:09,829
know you're flushing you know harvest is

2695
02:17:08,299 --> 02:17:11,779
coming you've taken off the fan leaves

2696
02:17:09,829 --> 02:17:13,670
now is the time to prepare the

2697
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:16,969
harvesting the trimming in the drying

2698
02:17:13,670 --> 02:17:20,228
area you need a space let's go back real

2699
02:17:16,968 --> 02:17:22,579
quick okay I like that one more thing

2700
02:17:20,228 --> 02:17:24,978
how do you feel about like this weeding

2701
02:17:22,579 --> 02:17:27,189
agents molasses and stuff like that I

2702
02:17:24,978 --> 02:17:31,510
use this [ __ ] out of molasses

2703
02:17:27,189 --> 02:17:34,659
with my outdoor stuff the first I start

2704
02:17:31,510 --> 02:17:39,239
fleshing really early like I actually I

2705
02:17:34,659 --> 02:17:43,299
started to plants flushing this week I

2706
02:17:39,239 --> 02:17:45,189
give them to molasses feedings before I

2707
02:17:43,299 --> 02:17:48,518
actually start flushing and it's just

2708
02:17:45,189 --> 02:17:50,319
glasses but it's pretty heavy so I know

2709
02:17:48,519 --> 02:17:52,120
what's going into my plants and this is

2710
02:17:50,319 --> 02:17:53,468
uh so trying to keep it basics I don't

2711
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:55,000
want to steer anybody wrong I want

2712
02:17:53,468 --> 02:17:56,888
everybody to learn the right steps but I

2713
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,500
do sort of something similar I feed them

2714
02:17:56,888 --> 02:18:01,299
enzymes carbohydrates and molasses at

2715
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:03,040
the end for sure so they'll get some

2716
02:18:01,299 --> 02:18:05,369
high grows I'm has the enzymes I prefer

2717
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:21,160
and they'll get the molasses and

2718
02:18:05,370 --> 02:18:23,380
sometimes maybe some yucca extract day

2719
02:18:21,159 --> 02:18:27,388
so I've got 14 days that's like day 14

2720
02:18:23,379 --> 02:18:30,339
that's that and then from there now I

2721
02:18:27,388 --> 02:18:32,529
feel like I don't overfeed I've got

2722
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:34,360
plenty of space to flush properly like I

2723
02:18:32,530 --> 02:18:38,340
can I drank a plant to a watering area

2724
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:38,340
just [ __ ] hose on it until it's flush

2725
02:18:38,519 --> 02:18:42,340
it's actually just converted the old

2726
02:18:40,718 --> 02:18:44,319
bathroom that was in the work joint in

2727
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:46,420
doing this is the flushing spot so the

2728
02:18:44,319 --> 02:18:49,170
guy's gonna pee with no stalls my

2729
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:52,540
building doesn't have indoor plumbing so

2730
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:54,129
yeah guys if you have all that stuff

2731
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:56,080
that you're taking for granted you're

2732
02:18:54,129 --> 02:19:00,218
you're way ahead of the game sometimes

2733
02:18:56,079 --> 02:19:01,870
ya been growing since before we could

2734
02:19:00,218 --> 02:19:03,308
talk about growing you need to go to the

2735
02:19:01,870 --> 02:19:05,290
hydro shop with your hat down in your

2736
02:19:03,308 --> 02:19:14,049
face then I've got dreadlocks to my ass

2737
02:19:05,290 --> 02:19:15,969
we're in a car I get looked at we

2738
02:19:14,049 --> 02:19:18,789
flushed we've used some sugars and

2739
02:19:15,968 --> 02:19:19,928
enzymes and coconut water and some yucca

2740
02:19:18,790 --> 02:19:22,210
extracts you don't have to use them all

2741
02:19:19,929 --> 02:19:23,469
at the same time you can use these

2742
02:19:22,209 --> 02:19:25,000
differently the sukkah net may need a

2743
02:19:23,468 --> 02:19:26,739
little while to break down so you may

2744
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:30,819
need something to help that happen the

2745
02:19:26,739 --> 02:19:33,069
enzymes are gonna be good so we have d

2746
02:19:30,819 --> 02:19:35,739
leafed we're preparing the dry space

2747
02:19:33,069 --> 02:19:37,239
right is that where we are yeah very

2748
02:19:35,739 --> 02:19:38,648
very important yeah

2749
02:19:37,239 --> 02:19:39,260
clean up your drying and trimming space

2750
02:19:38,648 --> 02:19:44,029
any

2751
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:46,341
dog hair hippie hair all the crap that's

2752
02:19:44,030 --> 02:19:48,801
on my table I think it's just a bunch of

2753
02:19:46,341 --> 02:19:50,239
dab resin to tell you the truth but all

2754
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:52,279
that [ __ ] is gonna end up in your weed

2755
02:19:50,239 --> 02:19:53,630
that you're cleaning up and once again

2756
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:55,370
that's just as important as having a

2757
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:58,310
good flush you don't want crap on your

2758
02:19:55,370 --> 02:20:00,230
weed you just spent 70 day flowering

2759
02:19:58,310 --> 02:20:01,851
cycle plus however long we took to veg

2760
02:20:00,229 --> 02:20:03,140
that stuff plus if you're doing a female

2761
02:20:01,851 --> 02:20:05,681
hunt you're risking you know you gotta

2762
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:09,979
tell which seeds are good order outdoors

2763
02:20:05,681 --> 02:20:12,280
yeah that's a big plant - yeah yeah put

2764
02:20:09,979 --> 02:20:14,899
a lot of work nervous nights into it

2765
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:16,671
have a nice secure area while we're at

2766
02:20:14,899 --> 02:20:19,011
it I did not write that down but have a

2767
02:20:16,671 --> 02:20:20,899
nice secure area and think about this if

2768
02:20:19,011 --> 02:20:22,970
you're making concentrates every piece

2769
02:20:20,899 --> 02:20:24,560
of dust and hair and particulate is

2770
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:27,949
going to end up in your concentrate

2771
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:30,079
somehow like even if it blasting butane

2772
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:40,641
over it you're gonna blast dog hair

2773
02:20:30,079 --> 02:20:43,700
juice in your concentrates you're gonna

2774
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:46,520
need so any trimming area your work area

2775
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:47,780
cover your table get a plastic cloth you

2776
02:20:46,521 --> 02:20:49,341
guys use rubber gloves when you're

2777
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:52,250
handling your plants when they're

2778
02:20:49,341 --> 02:20:56,870
growing when you're chopping them for

2779
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:58,579
god sake please you've seen how you do

2780
02:20:56,870 --> 02:20:59,931
finger prints when you commit a crime

2781
02:20:58,579 --> 02:21:01,909
you're doing that to your plants you're

2782
02:20:59,931 --> 02:21:04,190
leaving oils and hippie goop and human

2783
02:21:01,909 --> 02:21:06,860
goop and cheeto stains all over your

2784
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:10,461
plants wear some rubber gloves our oils

2785
02:21:06,860 --> 02:21:12,681
actually affect the plants for long-term

2786
02:21:10,460 --> 02:21:14,619
storage and plants that have been

2787
02:21:12,681 --> 02:21:17,631
handled with bare hands

2788
02:21:14,620 --> 02:21:21,820
break down faster in my experience that

2789
02:21:17,630 --> 02:21:25,609
makes sense I think a BHO dab you can

2790
02:21:21,819 --> 02:21:29,779
decarboxylase a Pho dab a done with your

2791
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:31,881
fingers and your fingers you can deep

2792
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:36,221
the carpet enough to be edible like

2793
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:36,220
processed is delta xi THC by your liver

2794
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:42,500
you can do that by rolling it in your

2795
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:44,391
hand imagine what we can do to a try

2796
02:21:42,500 --> 02:21:46,220
come on apply for sure it ruin it kill

2797
02:21:44,390 --> 02:21:49,109
it yeah it'll even weird oils that are

2798
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:51,389
fighting when you said deke are piloxing

2799
02:21:49,109 --> 02:21:54,779
think it a deal axing and all that stuff

2800
02:21:51,389 --> 02:21:55,498
no man yeah somebody asked me what is

2801
02:21:54,779 --> 02:21:57,479
dewaxing

2802
02:21:55,498 --> 02:21:59,158
we need to get a hash maker over to say

2803
02:21:57,478 --> 02:22:04,559
more technically what it is but I'll

2804
02:21:59,158 --> 02:22:06,299
explain it on a later episode so in your

2805
02:22:04,559 --> 02:22:08,038
trim room you should have comfy tables

2806
02:22:06,299 --> 02:22:10,168
you should have some good music

2807
02:22:08,039 --> 02:22:11,850
everyone's gonna argue over the music

2808
02:22:10,168 --> 02:22:15,748
sorry put on the agriculture podcast

2809
02:22:11,850 --> 02:22:17,699
episode one and hit play I actually like

2810
02:22:15,748 --> 02:22:19,488
to put up stand-up comedian shows wow

2811
02:22:17,699 --> 02:22:21,930
that's a good idea I listen to comedy I

2812
02:22:19,488 --> 02:22:24,299
listen to a lot of Joey Coco Diaz and

2813
02:22:21,930 --> 02:22:27,209
Joe Rogan listen to a podcast when I'm

2814
02:22:24,299 --> 02:22:28,679
trimming one of my favorite podcasts

2815
02:22:27,209 --> 02:22:30,539
hasn't posted an episode in quite a

2816
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:35,248
while I'm a little annoyed what's up

2817
02:22:30,539 --> 02:22:36,479
Adam ill where's my new podcast buddy we

2818
02:22:35,248 --> 02:22:39,078
gotta keep on track here we're getting

2819
02:22:36,478 --> 02:22:40,948
into the show I like to prefer in the

2820
02:22:39,078 --> 02:22:44,488
area gloves

2821
02:22:40,949 --> 02:22:48,890
comfy chairs good music let's go back to

2822
02:22:44,488 --> 02:22:51,898
dry area okay preparing that dry area

2823
02:22:48,889 --> 02:22:56,840
dehumidifier yeah humidifier yeah

2824
02:22:51,898 --> 02:22:56,840
fans possibly possibly a fan or two

2825
02:22:57,199 --> 02:23:03,449
we're gonna need to keep it between 60

2826
02:23:00,299 --> 02:23:05,009
and 70 degrees in go 75 degrees if you

2827
02:23:03,449 --> 02:23:06,209
need to if it's you know in your bedroom

2828
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:07,918
or something you're gonna be alright

2829
02:23:06,209 --> 02:23:11,699
don't stress but keep in mind though

2830
02:23:07,918 --> 02:23:15,209
that he is one of the biggest enemies of

2831
02:23:11,699 --> 02:23:17,459
a dragon plants yes and also you want it

2832
02:23:15,209 --> 02:23:19,260
dark yeah light I know it sounds weird

2833
02:23:17,459 --> 02:23:20,729
you've had all kinds of light beating

2834
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:22,828
down on your plants for months but now

2835
02:23:20,728 --> 02:23:25,378
we want it dark we want those to stop

2836
02:23:22,828 --> 02:23:27,238
growing and degrading we want the

2837
02:23:25,379 --> 02:23:29,310
animation right where we are it protects

2838
02:23:27,238 --> 02:23:31,648
the the trichromats

2839
02:23:29,309 --> 02:23:32,969
yes yes we picked him at the right

2840
02:23:31,648 --> 02:23:34,738
maturity we will don't want them going

2841
02:23:32,969 --> 02:23:38,340
much further we also want our humidity

2842
02:23:34,738 --> 02:23:39,868
at 40% if we can not much more than that

2843
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:41,850
if you go any lower you're gonna dry too

2844
02:23:39,869 --> 02:23:43,918
quickly if you go any higher

2845
02:23:41,850 --> 02:23:45,869
of course you risk molds and it's gonna

2846
02:23:43,918 --> 02:23:48,209
take too damn long to dry if you're in

2847
02:23:45,869 --> 02:23:49,310
the Dirty South do the best you can good

2848
02:23:48,209 --> 02:23:51,109
luck

2849
02:23:49,309 --> 02:23:53,059
the US in Colorado it's funny that you

2850
02:23:51,109 --> 02:23:54,649
say that because in the South you read

2851
02:23:53,059 --> 02:23:58,878
stories alike so when you harvest your

2852
02:23:54,648 --> 02:24:00,168
weed you got to dry it for 20 days and

2853
02:23:58,879 --> 02:24:03,588
then you read in Colorado you're like so

2854
02:24:00,168 --> 02:24:07,219
cut it down five days later they must be

2855
02:24:03,588 --> 02:24:09,379
in Colorado in February it really varies

2856
02:24:07,219 --> 02:24:11,208
from region to region yeah and even like

2857
02:24:09,379 --> 02:24:14,689
what side of the state you're on humans

2858
02:24:11,209 --> 02:24:16,189
dry out in Colorado yeah so you got your

2859
02:24:14,689 --> 02:24:17,748
fan you got your dehumidifier your

2860
02:24:16,189 --> 02:24:19,369
humidifier trying to have if you can

2861
02:24:17,748 --> 02:24:22,180
afford it if you can do it put a carbon

2862
02:24:19,369 --> 02:24:27,189
filter and a blower in your drying room

2863
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:30,918
harvesting plants stink very much

2864
02:24:27,189 --> 02:24:32,449
harvesting plants your neighbors will

2865
02:24:30,918 --> 02:24:34,430
smell it ten times more than you you've

2866
02:24:32,449 --> 02:24:36,199
been around them every day you're so

2867
02:24:34,430 --> 02:24:39,588
used to it you're so comfortable with it

2868
02:24:36,199 --> 02:24:41,328
I've had plants I had just gotten done

2869
02:24:39,588 --> 02:24:46,270
trimming it didn't have any plants on me

2870
02:24:41,328 --> 02:25:07,158
and somebody came over from the garage

2871
02:24:46,270 --> 02:25:09,078
what's going on so you get that carbon

2872
02:25:07,158 --> 02:25:10,609
filter also you need a hydrometer that

2873
02:25:09,078 --> 02:25:12,109
just tells you what the humidity is and

2874
02:25:10,609 --> 02:25:16,100
a thermometer they sell a great one at

2875
02:25:12,109 --> 02:25:17,988
Highgrove indoor growing supplies you

2876
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:22,119
can get at Walmart anywhere in the

2877
02:25:17,988 --> 02:25:24,228
nation Lowe's has remote-control

2878
02:25:22,119 --> 02:25:25,998
thermometer hygrometers you'll set the

2879
02:25:24,228 --> 02:25:27,318
unit in the room and then you can carry

2880
02:25:25,998 --> 02:25:28,850
the thing around with you and whatever

2881
02:25:27,318 --> 02:25:29,868
you're curious you look at the thing and

2882
02:25:28,850 --> 02:25:32,238
it tells you you don't have to run to

2883
02:25:29,869 --> 02:25:38,930
the grow room and luck my dad has one um

2884
02:25:32,238 --> 02:25:41,568
it has a chick on it and he's seriously

2885
02:25:38,930 --> 02:25:43,729
got this at Lowe's or Walmart but when

2886
02:25:41,568 --> 02:25:46,278
it's hot she's in a bikini and when it's

2887
02:25:43,728 --> 02:25:48,158
cold she's in a coat in the scarf and

2888
02:25:46,279 --> 02:25:54,520
everything out bumbled of similar

2889
02:25:48,158 --> 02:25:57,699
that's a great dad smiling put more heat

2890
02:25:54,520 --> 02:26:00,340
on your mic there we go all right so

2891
02:25:57,699 --> 02:26:02,380
we've got yeah the road the rooms are

2892
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:03,728
looking good we got a place to harvest

2893
02:26:02,379 --> 02:26:06,129
we got a place to dry now you need a

2894
02:26:03,728 --> 02:26:07,539
spot to hang your buds or your whole

2895
02:26:06,129 --> 02:26:09,938
plants depending on how you want to do

2896
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:11,770
it we'll talk about that in a minute set

2897
02:26:09,939 --> 02:26:13,988
up a hanging space with plenty of space

2898
02:26:11,770 --> 02:26:15,760
between your plants if you have a small

2899
02:26:13,988 --> 02:26:17,228
crop you can use a coat hanger put two

2900
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:18,969
plants on one coat hanger if they're a

2901
02:26:17,228 --> 02:26:22,148
little like three gallon plot kind of

2902
02:26:18,969 --> 02:26:24,039
guys if you've got a five gallon pot

2903
02:26:22,148 --> 02:26:26,289
hopefully made enough pot to where you

2904
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:27,699
need a one coat hanger per plant any

2905
02:26:26,290 --> 02:26:31,779
bigger than that we're gonna need little

2906
02:26:27,699 --> 02:26:33,579
hanging lines I use hemp twine and

2907
02:26:31,779 --> 02:26:35,470
freaking hooks and just put hooks in

2908
02:26:33,579 --> 02:26:37,059
each end of the wall and run some twine

2909
02:26:35,469 --> 02:26:39,068
across them you guys may not have space

2910
02:26:37,059 --> 02:26:41,978
fishing line works good too

2911
02:26:39,068 --> 02:26:43,658
a fishing line is perfect any kind of

2912
02:26:41,978 --> 02:26:45,368
string to hang it up you just want them

2913
02:26:43,658 --> 02:26:47,079
you know I've seen guys take chicken

2914
02:26:45,369 --> 02:26:48,460
wire and make a big cylinder out of it

2915
02:26:47,079 --> 02:26:50,170
and that way you got a bunch of hanging

2916
02:26:48,459 --> 02:26:52,929
spaces at different layers that's

2917
02:26:50,170 --> 02:26:55,059
basically what we do at the farm tomato

2918
02:26:52,930 --> 02:27:00,010
cages work great too yeah recycle that

2919
02:26:55,059 --> 02:27:01,868
tomato cage a long time ago I harvested

2920
02:27:00,010 --> 02:27:03,939
a crop and dried it in the hydro Hut

2921
02:27:01,869 --> 02:27:05,560
that the crop grew in just took out the

2922
02:27:03,939 --> 02:27:07,600
light flip the crop hung it upside down

2923
02:27:05,559 --> 02:27:10,238
right inside there Capital blowers going

2924
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:12,309
kept a carbon filter going beautiful

2925
02:27:10,238 --> 02:27:13,779
crop those awesome looks very well I

2926
02:27:12,309 --> 02:27:16,250
wish I had the space to be able to do

2927
02:27:13,779 --> 02:27:18,670
that yes

2928
02:27:16,250 --> 02:27:20,889
[Music]

2929
02:27:18,670 --> 02:27:22,478
avoid the drying racks if at all

2930
02:27:20,889 --> 02:27:24,039
possible yeah a lot of people are

2931
02:27:22,478 --> 02:27:25,389
talking about those on line the other

2932
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:27,430
day when I was talking about drying

2933
02:27:25,389 --> 02:27:28,959
those put a dam here they make a flat

2934
02:27:27,430 --> 02:27:31,000
side under weed they make it take look

2935
02:27:28,959 --> 02:27:32,139
tastes longer when you sort of squishing

2936
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,520
the bud together like that you're

2937
02:27:32,139 --> 02:27:35,920
messing up your trichomes and your

2938
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:37,270
flavors you're trapping in air trapping

2939
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:39,068
in chlorophyll you're trapping in

2940
02:27:37,270 --> 02:27:44,170
moisture which is what we try to get out

2941
02:27:39,068 --> 02:27:48,609
Ray's chance of mold it centralizes a

2942
02:27:44,170 --> 02:27:51,250
whole bunch of humidity and I've always

2943
02:27:48,609 --> 02:27:52,750
felt the mesh damages the but yeah just

2944
02:27:51,250 --> 02:27:54,579
shaking around and stuff trying to poke

2945
02:27:52,750 --> 02:27:56,290
through the mash and then you always end

2946
02:27:54,579 --> 02:27:57,539
up with I have to put something

2947
02:27:56,290 --> 02:27:59,220
underneath those to catch

2948
02:27:57,540 --> 02:28:01,650
the stuff falls out there's so much that

2949
02:27:59,219 --> 02:28:03,869
I always wonder what should I do with

2950
02:28:01,649 --> 02:28:05,909
this although that was a few years ago I

2951
02:28:03,870 --> 02:28:14,130
know what to do I don't know like

2952
02:28:05,909 --> 02:28:18,119
Wiesenthal so it is useful for if you

2953
02:28:14,129 --> 02:28:21,449
have gigantic plants all the large fins

2954
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:24,840
a little but that you end up with

2955
02:28:21,450 --> 02:28:26,250
inadvertently you know so I always seems

2956
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:28,200
like you have a pile of that stuff no

2957
02:28:26,250 --> 02:28:30,030
matter how hard you try to fight it

2958
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:31,380
don't be mad if you chop a button half

2959
02:28:30,030 --> 02:28:35,510
on your first trim session either

2960
02:28:31,379 --> 02:28:38,279
that happens always happens occasionally

2961
02:28:35,510 --> 02:28:40,069
alright we've got the rooms built up or

2962
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:43,680
wearing rubber gloves

2963
02:28:40,069 --> 02:28:44,369
let's have everything done before you

2964
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:47,489
chop down

2965
02:28:44,370 --> 02:28:50,190
don't be scrambling around be relaxed

2966
02:28:47,489 --> 02:28:52,680
this is really when I've seen a lot of

2967
02:28:50,190 --> 02:28:54,120
good crops go right up to the point

2968
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:55,440
where it's time to put scissors to him

2969
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:57,900
and that's when somebody [ __ ] him up

2970
02:28:55,440 --> 02:28:59,100
or right after you put scissors to it

2971
02:28:57,899 --> 02:29:00,840
and trimmed it and then put it all in a

2972
02:28:59,100 --> 02:29:03,000
Tupperware while it was wet or hung it

2973
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:05,210
out too long to dry yeah like this is

2974
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:07,950
where it counts you guys if you've spent

2975
02:29:05,209 --> 02:29:10,349
60 days 70 days on a flowering crop

2976
02:29:07,950 --> 02:29:11,970
let's do the harvest right this is where

2977
02:29:10,350 --> 02:29:13,050
this is where this is where the

2978
02:29:11,969 --> 02:29:17,369
patient's realism where the money

2979
02:29:13,049 --> 02:29:21,959
happens my aunt in a highly illegal

2980
02:29:17,370 --> 02:29:24,480
state go crop when I was younger and she

2981
02:29:21,959 --> 02:29:26,009
didn't know how to handle any of this

2982
02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:29,279
and of course there was no information

2983
02:29:26,010 --> 02:29:32,370
this was the 80s she stuck it in a black

2984
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:36,120
trash bag and then hung it in her

2985
02:29:32,370 --> 02:29:38,550
basement and they were swamps in the

2986
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:41,220
area of the country she lived in and are

2987
02:29:38,549 --> 02:29:44,429
not her basement but her attic and

2988
02:29:41,219 --> 02:29:47,340
needless to say it created a whole bunch

2989
02:29:44,430 --> 02:29:49,319
of mold sounds disgusting yeah a

2990
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:53,219
horrible waste of a summer's work

2991
02:29:49,319 --> 02:29:56,969
especially in this locale oh yeah time

2992
02:29:53,219 --> 02:29:59,819
airs your life or moldy bugs terrible

2993
02:29:56,969 --> 02:30:01,109
she was a crazy one so be prepared be a

2994
02:29:59,819 --> 02:30:02,459
Boy Scout when it comes to growing a

2995
02:30:01,110 --> 02:30:03,750
crop you should always be thinking two

2996
02:30:02,459 --> 02:30:05,309
weeks ahead in your pot plants because

2997
02:30:03,750 --> 02:30:06,488
anything you do today you're not gonna

2998
02:30:05,309 --> 02:30:08,259
see it for

2999
02:30:06,488 --> 02:30:10,588
seven to ten days probably anything

3000
02:30:08,259 --> 02:30:14,078
you've messed it up on in the season

3001
02:30:10,588 --> 02:30:16,180
here's your chance to you know make a

3002
02:30:14,078 --> 02:30:19,270
little right of it that's a good point

3003
02:30:16,180 --> 02:30:21,908
yeah get on it so I guess this is the

3004
02:30:19,270 --> 02:30:25,779
time where we are going to get the

3005
02:30:21,908 --> 02:30:29,168
plants and harvest that right yeah okay

3006
02:30:25,779 --> 02:30:30,640
we should also branch out to dry trim

3007
02:30:29,168 --> 02:30:32,978
and wet trim a little bit before we get

3008
02:30:30,639 --> 02:30:33,969
too far the way I'm gonna talk about how

3009
02:30:32,978 --> 02:30:35,559
I harvest a plan I'm gonna

3010
02:30:33,969 --> 02:30:37,418
hypothetically have a three gallon pot

3011
02:30:35,559 --> 02:30:39,969
I'm gonna drag that three gallon pot

3012
02:30:37,418 --> 02:30:42,578
with my three foot tall pot plant over

3013
02:30:39,969 --> 02:30:44,139
to a nice area where I've got plenty of

3014
02:30:42,578 --> 02:30:46,568
space I'm just gonna chop the whole

3015
02:30:44,139 --> 02:30:49,658
plant the way that I do it I chopped the

3016
02:30:46,568 --> 02:30:50,918
plant just just above where the first

3017
02:30:49,658 --> 02:30:52,238
nodes pop out

3018
02:30:50,918 --> 02:30:55,088
so that I don't have a lot of stick

3019
02:30:52,238 --> 02:30:55,509
hanging off the edge chop that necessary

3020
02:30:55,088 --> 02:30:58,478
water

3021
02:30:55,509 --> 02:31:00,009
flip the plant upside down I use a fuzzy

3022
02:30:58,478 --> 02:31:01,328
stick it looks like a pipe cleaner just

3023
02:31:00,009 --> 02:31:03,158
wrap that [ __ ] right around those

3024
02:31:01,328 --> 02:31:04,538
bottom two nodes so that I got a nice

3025
02:31:03,158 --> 02:31:06,009
hanger I'll leave some hanging off and

3026
02:31:04,539 --> 02:31:07,659
then I tied that under wherever it's

3027
02:31:06,009 --> 02:31:09,549
gonna hang from different situations at

3028
02:31:07,658 --> 02:31:10,988
this point I hang in different areas so

3029
02:31:09,549 --> 02:31:12,970
we'll see I'm using my main dry room

3030
02:31:10,988 --> 02:31:14,139
I'll just hang it from the dry line that

3031
02:31:12,969 --> 02:31:16,929
hangs up there boom it's hanging in

3032
02:31:14,139 --> 02:31:20,708
there I myself dry trimmed so I've got a

3033
02:31:16,930 --> 02:31:21,939
plant that's been flushed d leaved my

3034
02:31:20,709 --> 02:31:23,499
rooms are clean everything's goin

3035
02:31:21,939 --> 02:31:25,509
properly now I've just got this giant

3036
02:31:23,498 --> 02:31:28,418
wet plant this is mostly little leaves

3037
02:31:25,509 --> 02:31:29,918
just donkey dick buds hanging upside

3038
02:31:28,418 --> 02:31:33,600
down in my dry room mm-hmm

3039
02:31:29,918 --> 02:31:36,219
tips are perfect we were gonna wet trim

3040
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:39,158
this is where wet trim and dried trim go

3041
02:31:36,219 --> 02:31:40,628
to branch off a little bit right okay

3042
02:31:39,158 --> 02:31:43,238
just want to keep everybody on the same

3043
02:31:40,629 --> 02:31:44,619
page sometimes we we go too fast we've

3044
02:31:43,238 --> 02:31:46,328
done all this and sometimes people are

3045
02:31:44,619 --> 02:31:49,509
like you skipped like four days worth of

3046
02:31:46,328 --> 02:31:51,969
growth so I just want to keep it all if

3047
02:31:49,509 --> 02:31:53,109
you're gonna wet trim the difference

3048
02:31:51,969 --> 02:31:54,818
between white trim and dried trim is

3049
02:31:53,109 --> 02:31:56,078
obviously you let your plants dry if

3050
02:31:54,818 --> 02:31:57,338
you're gonna dry trim and then you get

3051
02:31:56,078 --> 02:31:58,748
in there and take the leaves off wet

3052
02:31:57,338 --> 02:32:00,129
trim you would do it right now you've

3053
02:31:58,748 --> 02:32:01,298
got the plant down you gotta hang it up

3054
02:32:00,129 --> 02:32:03,338
now it's time to get in there and chop

3055
02:32:01,299 --> 02:32:04,899
everything off you trim it into the bud

3056
02:32:03,338 --> 02:32:07,119
that's gonna be smoked at this point

3057
02:32:04,898 --> 02:32:09,158
right you don't have to go as close as

3058
02:32:07,119 --> 02:32:10,539
you look like you want to because those

3059
02:32:09,158 --> 02:32:12,488
little leaves are gonna shrink up into

3060
02:32:10,539 --> 02:32:14,070
the bottle little but still do a hell of

3061
02:32:12,488 --> 02:32:16,779
a good job getting in there

3062
02:32:14,069 --> 02:32:18,761
Jesse said earlier I definitely prefer

3063
02:32:16,780 --> 02:32:20,860
dry trimming Jesse and I agree say dry

3064
02:32:18,761 --> 02:32:22,090
trimming we agreed earlier that some of

3065
02:32:20,860 --> 02:32:23,860
those southern states we're talking

3066
02:32:22,090 --> 02:32:25,630
about with a lot of humidity you guys

3067
02:32:23,860 --> 02:32:27,250
may want a wet trim because you need to

3068
02:32:25,629 --> 02:32:29,560
get those leaves off of there and kind

3069
02:32:27,250 --> 02:32:31,870
of speed up that dry process here in

3070
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:34,239
Colorado there's not a lot of humidity

3071
02:32:31,870 --> 02:32:35,710
sometimes it gets super dry we're trying

3072
02:32:34,239 --> 02:32:37,569
to slow it down we need to slow it down

3073
02:32:35,709 --> 02:32:40,089
we leave those leaves on so we're gonna

3074
02:32:37,569 --> 02:32:44,049
talk about mostly about dry trimming

3075
02:32:40,090 --> 02:32:45,670
this is what trim is basically I cut the

3076
02:32:44,049 --> 02:32:48,640
buds off of the stick store I have a

3077
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:50,319
good hand size bud worn rubber gloves I

3078
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:52,090
try to hold on to just a stem let me

3079
02:32:50,319 --> 02:32:54,549
spin that but in my hand and just slowly

3080
02:32:52,090 --> 02:32:56,681
clip off all of the leaves you can trim

3081
02:32:54,549 --> 02:32:58,810
it to your preference if it's going to

3082
02:32:56,681 --> 02:33:00,370
you if you're trying to put it to market

3083
02:32:58,810 --> 02:33:01,899
you got to trim that [ __ ] close it's got

3084
02:33:00,370 --> 02:33:03,971
to look good take off if there's not a

3085
02:33:01,899 --> 02:33:06,039
lot of trichome on that leaf take it off

3086
02:33:03,970 --> 02:33:07,720
if that leaf is sticking out take it off

3087
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:09,761
we don't we're not leaf heads we're pot

3088
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:12,939
heads we don't smoke pot not leaves yep

3089
02:33:09,761 --> 02:33:15,579
so that's basically wet trim I have some

3090
02:33:12,940 --> 02:33:17,980
patients that they don't want it trimmed

3091
02:33:15,579 --> 02:33:19,239
it all with their old schools so I guess

3092
02:33:17,979 --> 02:33:20,470
you should leave it on the stick stone I

3093
02:33:19,239 --> 02:33:22,060
should say that leave it kind of on the

3094
02:33:20,470 --> 02:33:23,489
sticks don't cut it in just two smaller

3095
02:33:22,060 --> 02:33:26,049
parts because you need a way to hang it

3096
02:33:23,489 --> 02:33:27,640
you know how the branch is a branch and

3097
02:33:26,049 --> 02:33:29,229
then there's a little node coming off or

3098
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:31,181
your buds grow say one of those little

3099
02:33:29,229 --> 02:33:32,560
branch parts there's a little hook and

3100
02:33:31,181 --> 02:33:33,640
then you can hang that in your dry rub

3101
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:35,379
cuz after you get done trimming these

3102
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:36,970
buds you want to hang them up so they

3103
02:33:35,379 --> 02:33:39,479
don't get a flat spot and your cure a

3104
02:33:36,970 --> 02:33:43,180
core your dry rack you want them hanging

3105
02:33:39,479 --> 02:33:45,939
so trim them up hang them up and then

3106
02:33:43,181 --> 02:33:47,771
let those dry they those wet buds need

3107
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:50,050
to dry after they've been trimmed until

3108
02:33:47,771 --> 02:33:52,181
you grab them and bend the stick and the

3109
02:33:50,049 --> 02:33:54,010
stick should pop and snap it should just

3110
02:33:52,181 --> 02:33:56,620
go cracked right on you and that'll be

3111
02:33:54,011 --> 02:33:57,340
obvious when it happens so depending on

3112
02:33:56,620 --> 02:34:00,460
where you are

3113
02:33:57,340 --> 02:34:02,021
that should take between five to maybe

3114
02:34:00,459 --> 02:34:04,119
fifteen days just depending your

3115
02:34:02,021 --> 02:34:10,300
location and they drive from the outside

3116
02:34:04,120 --> 02:34:13,721
in so don't wear on what trim is still

3117
02:34:10,299 --> 02:34:16,259
right so like I mean the outside of the

3118
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:19,010
bud is gonna be dry before

3119
02:34:16,260 --> 02:34:22,770
it's actually dry right doesn't don't

3120
02:34:19,010 --> 02:34:24,689
you know get to happy and jump the gun

3121
02:34:22,770 --> 02:34:28,140
there it's really gonna make a huge

3122
02:34:24,689 --> 02:34:40,229
difference just slightly wet buds to dry

3123
02:34:28,139 --> 02:34:41,670
buds to properly cured buds podcast the

3124
02:34:40,228 --> 02:34:43,318
console isn't that impressive the look

3125
02:34:41,670 --> 02:34:50,359
on his face was like did I just call

3126
02:34:43,318 --> 02:34:52,680
from a straw I don't do that so let's

3127
02:34:50,359 --> 02:34:55,890
guys straight trim I prefer it it's

3128
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:56,578
easier dry trim you're gonna hang I hang

3129
02:34:55,889 --> 02:34:58,379
the whole plant

3130
02:34:56,578 --> 02:34:59,969
I've heard people chopping the Brandt

3131
02:34:58,379 --> 02:35:01,799
growing I'm talking about a three gallon

3132
02:34:59,969 --> 02:35:03,959
fire so I'd hang the whole plan some

3133
02:35:01,799 --> 02:35:06,148
people chop it into smaller pieces if

3134
02:35:03,959 --> 02:35:07,618
you get it into just branches that's

3135
02:35:06,148 --> 02:35:09,180
cool I like to let the whole thing hang

3136
02:35:07,619 --> 02:35:11,699
I feel like it dries up just the right

3137
02:35:09,180 --> 02:35:14,760
speed here just because where we are for

3138
02:35:11,699 --> 02:35:16,890
indoor plants I totally agree all right

3139
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:18,328
you've drawn those big outdoor plants

3140
02:35:16,889 --> 02:35:19,228
you've got to chop them into smaller

3141
02:35:18,328 --> 02:35:20,788
part yeah

3142
02:35:19,228 --> 02:35:25,709
outdoor plants with three levels of

3143
02:35:20,789 --> 02:35:26,850
cages around them and also I told

3144
02:35:25,709 --> 02:35:28,919
somebody to cut down the whole plant

3145
02:35:26,850 --> 02:35:30,270
they said I grow across oh you guys are

3146
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:31,439
gonna have to cut out branches so we'll

3147
02:35:30,270 --> 02:35:33,539
just go with this we'll go we've got a

3148
02:35:31,439 --> 02:35:35,068
bunch of branches now we're cutting off

3149
02:35:33,539 --> 02:35:38,609
one branch of time we hang those they

3150
02:35:35,068 --> 02:35:40,709
dry however long it takes just kind of

3151
02:35:38,609 --> 02:35:44,399
sort of similar to the wet trim we're

3152
02:35:40,709 --> 02:35:46,108
gonna let them hang until right right

3153
02:35:44,398 --> 02:35:47,728
before they snap when that first part

3154
02:35:46,109 --> 02:35:49,859
snaps now it's time to get to work

3155
02:35:47,728 --> 02:35:51,118
because your stuffs gonna dry slowly and

3156
02:35:49,859 --> 02:35:52,350
you're gonna catch up you're gonna get a

3157
02:35:51,119 --> 02:35:54,149
little behind in trimming but you'll

3158
02:35:52,350 --> 02:35:55,710
catch up yeah especially if you got a

3159
02:35:54,148 --> 02:35:57,358
lot of work to do hopefully you got a

3160
02:35:55,709 --> 02:36:00,959
lot of work to do yeah had that sounds a

3161
02:35:57,359 --> 02:36:08,818
lot like River and the 52 ounces we're

3162
02:36:00,959 --> 02:36:09,988
trying to grow up I hope you guys

3163
02:36:08,818 --> 02:36:12,840
remember that cuz I got where we're

3164
02:36:09,988 --> 02:36:14,368
headed so we got these dried plants you

3165
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:15,898
chop you chop your plants down you hung

3166
02:36:14,369 --> 02:36:18,060
on me a little dry they've cut off a

3167
02:36:15,898 --> 02:36:20,430
stick go to your drying area and you got

3168
02:36:18,059 --> 02:36:22,139
your stick pretty much just take your

3169
02:36:20,430 --> 02:36:24,630
thumbs and just knock those little dried

3170
02:36:22,139 --> 02:36:25,748
leaves right off put them in a little

3171
02:36:24,629 --> 02:36:27,128
container and

3172
02:36:25,748 --> 02:36:28,298
that or you can just knock the leaves

3173
02:36:27,129 --> 02:36:30,129
right into that container because you're

3174
02:36:28,299 --> 02:36:31,989
gonna make some sort of concentrates out

3175
02:36:30,129 --> 02:36:34,119
of that hopefully or food or something

3176
02:36:31,988 --> 02:36:35,708
with your gloves on with your gloves on

3177
02:36:34,119 --> 02:36:36,849
keep your gloves on please I don't want

3178
02:36:35,709 --> 02:36:39,099
to eat your skin flakes and your

3179
02:36:36,849 --> 02:36:42,668
fingernail dirt so you got these buds

3180
02:36:39,099 --> 02:36:44,439
and I kind of hold it kind of just

3181
02:36:42,668 --> 02:36:46,328
picture the way I do it looks like a

3182
02:36:44,439 --> 02:36:49,029
play Nintendo I got my thumbs just going

3183
02:36:46,328 --> 02:36:51,099
and I'm just knocking leaves off and it

3184
02:36:49,029 --> 02:36:55,149
looks like he's playing snake on a Nokia

3185
02:36:51,099 --> 02:36:56,379
phone pretty much what you're doing you

3186
02:36:55,148 --> 02:36:58,269
just hold that thing and it's knock the

3187
02:36:56,379 --> 02:36:59,649
leaves off you don't even have to you

3188
02:36:58,269 --> 02:37:01,599
can see what you want to take off once

3189
02:36:59,648 --> 02:37:03,248
it's dry so trim it to your preference

3190
02:37:01,599 --> 02:37:04,209
his little triangle leaves it stick out

3191
02:37:03,248 --> 02:37:05,408
I'm actually trimming this but that's

3192
02:37:04,209 --> 02:37:06,549
another table with my fingers these

3193
02:37:05,408 --> 02:37:08,318
little triangle leaves you just pluck

3194
02:37:06,549 --> 02:37:09,999
those right off your letter pluck that

3195
02:37:08,318 --> 02:37:11,259
off and you can see where the bud is and

3196
02:37:09,998 --> 02:37:12,119
where the leaf ends if you've done it

3197
02:37:11,259 --> 02:37:17,078
right

3198
02:37:12,119 --> 02:37:20,078
I use scissors but it's exact same

3199
02:37:17,078 --> 02:37:22,298
process eat some strains Girl Scout

3200
02:37:20,078 --> 02:37:25,269
cookies and Yeti know says there's

3201
02:37:22,299 --> 02:37:28,659
necessary those dried leaves fall right

3202
02:37:25,269 --> 02:37:29,949
off yeah and then so these dried nuggets

3203
02:37:28,658 --> 02:37:32,398
they're pretty much dry I throw those in

3204
02:37:29,949 --> 02:37:35,859
a bin and then when I'm done I jus

3205
02:37:32,398 --> 02:37:37,478
that's kind of how or the cure process

3206
02:37:35,859 --> 02:37:39,488
starts for both of these plants once

3207
02:37:37,478 --> 02:37:43,088
those sticks are snapping on your wet

3208
02:37:39,488 --> 02:37:44,378
trim take the leaves off throw it in a

3209
02:37:43,088 --> 02:37:46,088
bin and they're ready to go into jars

3210
02:37:44,379 --> 02:37:48,249
when you're done trimming everything

3211
02:37:46,088 --> 02:37:49,568
the dry trim now that you've knocked the

3212
02:37:48,248 --> 02:37:51,039
leaves off you got that in a bin now

3213
02:37:49,568 --> 02:37:53,378
we're ready to pretty much go into jars

3214
02:37:51,039 --> 02:37:58,149
and that's kind of where the curing

3215
02:37:53,379 --> 02:38:00,639
process would start don't you think I'm

3216
02:37:58,148 --> 02:38:04,148
sure we have really stoned me too me too

3261
02:40:40,068 --> 02:40:44,180
cuss jar this is only a rule that

3262
02:40:42,829 --> 02:40:46,189
applies to me but if the guests want to

3263
02:40:44,180 --> 02:40:47,930
participate they can the cuss jar if I

3264
02:40:46,189 --> 02:40:50,270
say the f-word backwards the only one

3265
02:40:47,930 --> 02:40:51,530
that counts in this cuss jar if I say

3266
02:40:50,270 --> 02:40:52,970
the f-word do you guys tweet me and

3267
02:40:51,530 --> 02:40:54,770

3268
02:40:52,969 --> 02:40:56,929
podcast starting on episode 30 that's

3269
02:40:54,770 --> 02:40:58,880
the show don't go back in time and cost

3270
02:40:56,930 --> 02:41:00,559
me money every time from now forward

3271
02:40:58,879 --> 02:41:03,318
that I say the f-word on a show it cost

3272
02:41:00,559 --> 02:41:05,090

3273
02:41:03,318 --> 02:41:06,709
I quit saying if I don't quit saying the

3274

f-word I will increase my donation

3275
02:41:06,709 --> 02:41:10,489

3276
02:41:09,079 --> 02:41:11,478
after it cannot committing to any amount

3277
02:41:10,489 --> 02:41:13,250
of episodes I want to see how I do

3278
02:41:11,478 --> 02:41:14,629
because if I do the worse I do the more

3279
02:41:13,250 --> 02:41:16,250
money I have to pay cuz it'll hurt me

3280
02:41:14,629 --> 02:41:18,108
more the dollar doesn't hurt my feelings

3281
02:41:16,250 --> 02:41:19,850
but it reminds me five dollars you go

3282

it's a friend on Instagram he we had a

3287
02:41:30,079 --> 02:41:33,139
long conversation and he does deserve

3288
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:34,760
the donation it's not an organization

3289
02:41:33,139 --> 02:41:37,279
it's actually a person who needs help

3290
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:39,260
it's a sick child so we will help that

your comments from stitcher as well the

02:43:06,100 --> 02:43:08,949
reason I like good reviews and good

3328
02:43:07,328 --> 02:43:10,750
ratings is because that helps us move up

3329
02:43:08,949 --> 02:43:13,359
in the ranks which just gets us which

3330
02:43:10,750 --> 02:43:15,340
gets us seen by more listeners which

3331
02:43:13,359 --> 02:43:17,590
gets more people growing quality product

3332
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:24,040
which gets less [ __ ] product out on the

3333
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:26,408
street so don't forget - the show is

02:48:33,889 --> 02:48:38,090
strain of cannabis that's really high in

all 50 states something I find weird

3454
02:49:08,559 --> 02:49:12,549
here I'm gonna have to do more research

3455
02:49:10,299 --> 02:49:13,779
it says Charlotte's Web hemp oil it's

3456
02:49:12,549 --> 02:49:16,329
got the little trademark symbol right

3457
02:49:13,780 --> 02:49:19,149
above that so they've trademark

3458
02:49:16,329 --> 02:49:20,620
Charlotte's Web hemp oil the email from

3459
02:49:19,148 --> 02:49:22,389
realm of caring which will now be

3460
02:49:20,620 --> 02:49:23,950
referred to as Roc explains that

3461
02:49:22,389 --> 02:49:25,510
Charlotte's Web product they will be

3462
02:49:23,950 --> 02:49:28,689
shipping falls within the federally

3463
02:49:25,510 --> 02:49:31,478
acceptable limit of less than 0.3% of

3464
02:49:28,689 --> 02:49:34,750
THC for classification as a hemp derived

3465
02:49:31,478 --> 02:49:36,819
food product the email also states that

3466
02:49:34,750 --> 02:49:39,159
the legality of this product is still

3467
02:49:36,819 --> 02:49:40,569
ambiguous and recommends the patient's

3468
02:49:39,159 --> 02:49:42,579
sign up for their state's medical

3469
02:49:40,569 --> 02:49:45,279
marijuana programs to provide your

3470
02:49:42,579 --> 02:49:47,079
family more protection however the

3471
02:49:45,280 --> 02:49:48,250
organization will ship to patients who

3472
02:49:47,079 --> 02:49:50,228
have signed up for the wait list

3473
02:49:48,250 --> 02:49:52,329
regardless of their home States cannabis

3474
02:49:50,228 --> 02:49:54,579
policies and regardless of each

3475
02:49:52,329 --> 02:49:59,319
individual client status as a licensed

3476
02:49:54,579 --> 02:50:01,209
medical cannabis patient so they found a

3477
02:49:59,319 --> 02:50:04,779
loophole apparently there is less than

3478
02:50:01,209 --> 02:50:07,869
0.3 percent THC in the Charlotte's Web

3479
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:08,920
cannabis oil that they're making well

3480
02:50:07,870 --> 02:50:10,210
let me call it the right things they've

3481
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:13,109
trademarked it we've got to say it right

3482
02:50:10,209 --> 02:50:13,108
I got a scroll back up

3483
02:50:14,409 --> 02:50:17,228
Oh Charlotte's Web hemp oil it's right

3484
02:50:16,270 --> 02:50:18,280
there in the very first sentence I

3485
02:50:17,228 --> 02:50:22,029
scroll down way too far

3486
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:23,229
ah so they're gonna ship it to all 50

3487
02:50:22,030 --> 02:50:24,970
states that means people in

3488
02:50:23,228 --> 02:50:26,500
Massachusetts they may you know pick a

3489
02:50:24,969 --> 02:50:28,569
state that you're afraid of if you live

3490
02:50:26,500 --> 02:50:31,510
in a state right now and cannabis is not

3491
02:50:28,569 --> 02:50:34,148
legal there you can get this product

3492
02:50:31,510 --> 02:50:35,500
shipped to you if you were on their

3493
02:50:34,148 --> 02:50:36,579
waiting list I don't know how long ago

3494
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:38,530
you had to sign up to get on the waiting

3495
02:50:36,579 --> 02:50:41,110
list but if you were there you can get

3496
02:50:38,530 --> 02:50:43,450
this product now I find that remarkable

3497
02:50:41,110 --> 02:50:45,310
I find that quite ballsy ballsy's the

3498
02:50:43,450 --> 02:50:46,810
word I'm gonna use I find it really

3499
02:50:45,309 --> 02:50:48,459
compassionate and I really hope this

3500
02:50:46,809 --> 02:50:50,019
works out I hope this helps a lot of

3501
02:50:48,459 --> 02:50:51,789
people let me continue with the article

3502
02:50:50,020 --> 02:50:53,170
let me give some credit before I get too

3503
02:50:51,790 --> 02:50:58,300
far I forgot to give credit to where

3504
02:50:53,170 --> 02:51:01,000
this article came from it just says

all right sorry I should prepared a

3509
02:51:09,091 --> 02:51:14,359
little better for that part

3510
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:15,710
so yeah photos gives photo credit to

3511
02:51:14,359 --> 02:51:17,210
Vanessa waltz and I'm pretty sure that

3512
02:51:15,709 --> 02:51:19,669
the article is from her also I actually

3513
02:51:17,209 --> 02:51:20,209
this was tweeted to me by my friend on

3514
02:51:19,670 --> 02:51:21,619
Twitter

3515
02:51:20,209 --> 02:51:24,648
what's up point Mike thanks for tweeting

3516
02:51:21,619 --> 02:51:26,300
that he's Nikon an emo Punk on Twitter

3517
02:51:24,648 --> 02:51:28,189
I'm not sure which is which it's either

3518
02:51:26,299 --> 02:51:29,988
at Nikon or at an emo Punk here let's

3519
02:51:28,189 --> 02:51:31,578
just be diligent and go look at that for

3520
02:51:29,988 --> 02:51:32,840
you then I promise I'll get back into

3521
02:51:31,578 --> 02:51:33,978
the article I want to give my credit

3522
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:35,930
because he hooked me up here this was

3523
02:51:33,978 --> 02:51:37,818
really something myles grint glad to see

3524
02:51:35,930 --> 02:51:39,979
because we see all kinds of bad news all

3525
02:51:37,818 --> 02:51:42,170
the time right that's good to see some

3526
02:51:39,978 --> 02:51:44,959
great [ __ ] I'm going through as quick as

3527
02:51:42,170 --> 02:51:49,068
I can on Twitter so it's Nikon Nico n

3528
02:51:44,959 --> 02:51:51,049
but he is at Nemo puck 15 any mo PU and

3529
02:51:49,068 --> 02:51:53,238
K 15 so give him a shout-out for me Tom

3530
02:51:51,049 --> 02:51:55,698
you appreciate hearing his story that he

3531
02:51:53,238 --> 02:51:58,279
sent me on the news here all right I'm

3532
02:51:55,699 --> 02:52:01,250
let's roll back down the cost of the oil

3533
02:51:58,279 --> 02:52:06,470
will be $250 per bottle which is equal

3534
02:52:01,250 --> 02:52:08,359
to 5 cents per milligram of CBD so there

3535
02:52:06,469 --> 02:52:10,519
are pros and cons of the new development

3536
02:52:08,359 --> 02:52:13,818
and an explanation of why it's likely to

3537
02:52:10,520 --> 02:52:16,550
be quite different than the RS h o CBD

3538
02:52:13,818 --> 02:52:18,260
debacle we're gonna have to that's got a

3539
02:52:16,549 --> 02:52:22,849
link to it so we're gonna check out the

3540
02:52:18,260 --> 02:52:25,790
RS o RS h o CBD debacle we're gonna read

3541
02:52:22,850 --> 02:52:27,979
that link also open link in new tab and

3542
02:52:25,790 --> 02:52:30,399
open link in new tab owner if that's the

3543
02:52:27,978 --> 02:52:30,398
same thing

3544
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:34,449
we're gonna read those also sorry guys

3545
02:52:32,831 --> 02:52:36,341
I'm rambley because I took a couple of

3546
02:52:34,450 --> 02:52:37,601
dabs and I just wanted to get this news

3547
02:52:36,341 --> 02:52:39,581
out Mike sent me this and I just wanted

3548
02:52:37,601 --> 02:52:42,761
to get on the mic and read it so

3549
02:52:39,581 --> 02:52:44,681
according to ROC the oil will test at a

3550
02:52:42,761 --> 02:52:46,780
consistent thirty to one ratio and the

3551
02:52:44,681 --> 02:52:48,341
THC will be lower than the point three

3552
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:50,771
percent allowed for food products under

3553
02:52:48,341 --> 02:52:54,489
federal law while naysayers may question

3554
02:52:50,771 --> 02:52:57,101
why this may why this is any more legal

3555
02:52:54,489 --> 02:52:58,751
than RSA chose products it is critical

3556
02:52:57,101 --> 02:53:00,461
to remember that our sh o has been

3557
02:52:58,751 --> 02:53:02,860
tested numerous times by independent

3558
02:53:00,460 --> 02:53:06,819
laboratories finding contents in excess

3559
02:53:02,860 --> 02:53:08,739
of 1% THC which is undeniable ly illegal

3560
02:53:06,819 --> 02:53:11,050
under federal law and in non-medical

3561
02:53:08,739 --> 02:53:12,940
states we can only hope that ROC is

3562
02:53:11,050 --> 02:53:15,161
testing and quality control will be far

3563
02:53:12,940 --> 02:53:17,351
more reliable than RSA chose based on

3564
02:53:15,161 --> 02:53:19,931
our OCS established track record with

3565
02:53:17,351 --> 02:53:22,360
products already available in Colorado

3566
02:53:19,931 --> 02:53:23,739
and California this is likely to be the

3567
02:53:22,360 --> 02:53:27,251
case although maintaining a consistent

3568
02:53:23,739 --> 02:53:28,989
ratio of 30 to one will undoubtedly be

3569
02:53:27,251 --> 02:53:31,421
challenging for the company's growers

3570
02:53:28,989 --> 02:53:33,101
and extraction staff so you guys haven't

3571
02:53:31,421 --> 02:53:36,569
seen a lot of initials here this are sh

3572
02:53:33,101 --> 02:53:39,700
o let's go see what that is

3573
02:53:36,569 --> 02:53:42,729
r sh o not a normal reaction to cannabis

3574
02:53:39,700 --> 02:53:45,811
so this is a product that shows a bottle

3575
02:53:42,729 --> 02:53:48,239
it looks like

3576
02:53:45,810 --> 02:53:50,789
nature's supplement there's some in a

3577
02:53:48,239 --> 02:53:54,959
syringe like an oral syringe and then

3578
02:53:50,790 --> 02:53:56,790
there's some in a bottle it's 18% CBD

3579
02:53:54,959 --> 02:53:58,469
I'm gonna read just this little quick

3580
02:53:56,790 --> 02:53:59,760
article that comes from I'll give you

3581
02:53:58,469 --> 02:54:02,340
some credit who wrote it it looks like

3582
02:53:59,760 --> 02:54:03,590
another Vanessa Walt's article in the

3583
02:54:02,340 --> 02:54:05,639
wake of reports of serious

3584
02:54:03,590 --> 02:54:08,340
gastrointestinal effects from the real

3585
02:54:05,639 --> 02:54:12,869
scientific hemp oil a real scientific

3586
02:54:08,340 --> 02:54:14,850
hemp oil so it's the controversial

3587
02:54:12,870 --> 02:54:16,920
product and people are claiming nausea

3588
02:54:14,850 --> 02:54:18,270
vomiting diarrhea people are saying

3589
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:19,889
that's a normal effect so I don't know

3590
02:54:18,270 --> 02:54:21,899
anything about that I can't argue that

3591
02:54:19,889 --> 02:54:24,709
from taking this product from saying if

3592
02:54:21,899 --> 02:54:24,709
that's a good effect or not

3593
02:54:26,379 --> 02:54:29,438
another competing product we're just

3594
02:54:27,850 --> 02:54:30,340
gonna go back to the article I just

3595
02:54:29,439 --> 02:54:33,630
wanted to make sure we knew what that

3596
02:54:30,340 --> 02:54:35,590
was also I said the CBD debacle I

3597
02:54:33,629 --> 02:54:35,920
clicked that link let's see what that's

3598
02:54:35,590 --> 02:54:38,228
about

3599
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:41,700
it's another go figure it's another

3600
02:54:38,228 --> 02:54:41,699
Vanessa Walt's article

3601
02:54:43,729 --> 02:54:47,239
article about marketing CBD so we're

3602
02:54:46,011 --> 02:54:48,921
gonna see a lot of that stuff because

3603
02:54:47,239 --> 02:54:50,210
it's gonna get really really popular or

3604
02:54:48,921 --> 02:54:52,640
it is getting really really popular

3605
02:54:50,210 --> 02:54:54,439
apparently I'll continue with the

3606
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:59,329
article as far as the feds coming down

3607
02:54:54,440 --> 02:55:01,011
with Roc Oh as far as the feds coming

3608
02:54:59,329 --> 02:55:02,479
down on ROC with a question mark that's

3609
02:55:01,011 --> 02:55:04,521
actually a question so we're supposed to

3610
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:07,279
say it like as far as the feds coming

3611
02:55:04,521 --> 02:55:09,141
down on ROC that would be an extremely

3612
02:55:07,280 --> 02:55:10,971
poor PR move on the federal government's

3613
02:55:09,140 --> 02:55:12,829
part with all the hype generated by

3614
02:55:10,970 --> 02:55:14,630
Sanjay Gupta CNN specials and the

3615
02:55:12,829 --> 02:55:16,220
widespread media coverage on CBD a

3616
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:18,199
federal crackdown on Charlotte's Web

3617
02:55:16,220 --> 02:55:20,149
would cause a huge uproar and the Fed

3618
02:55:18,200 --> 02:55:21,230
surely know this arresting and

3619
02:55:20,149 --> 02:55:23,841
prosecuting the self-proclaimed

3620
02:55:21,229 --> 02:55:25,399
Christian CBD providers from ROC would

3621
02:55:23,841 --> 02:55:27,171
spurn an entirely different public

3622
02:55:25,399 --> 02:55:29,869
response than the arrest and prosecution

3623
02:55:27,171 --> 02:55:32,239
of RSA chose leaders many of whom have

3624
02:55:29,870 --> 02:55:34,610
already faced charges from the SEC and

3625
02:55:32,239 --> 02:55:37,300
other federal agencies my guess is that

3626
02:55:34,610 --> 02:55:41,141
ROC is essentially untouchable and

3627
02:55:37,300 --> 02:55:41,140
unimpeachable in this venture

3628
02:55:41,630 --> 02:55:45,710
as for the negative side the most basic

3629
02:55:43,700 --> 02:55:47,899
and critical flaw is that thirty to one

3630
02:55:45,710 --> 02:55:49,880
is unlikely to help most epileptic

3631
02:55:47,899 --> 02:55:51,770
children anecdotal reports from Colorado

3632
02:55:49,880 --> 02:55:53,450
families using the higher ratio of

3633
02:55:51,771 --> 02:55:55,911
Charlotte's Web which is reportedly

3634
02:55:53,450 --> 02:55:58,160
tested as high as forty eight to one CBD

3635
02:55:55,911 --> 02:55:59,960
THC indicate that their children read

3636
02:55:58,161 --> 02:56:01,451
these either switching to other products

3637
02:55:59,960 --> 02:56:03,140
to maintain seizure control or

3638
02:56:01,450 --> 02:56:05,030
supplementing Charlotte's Web with

3639
02:56:03,140 --> 02:56:07,490
higher THC products available through

3640
02:56:05,031 --> 02:56:09,501
Colorado's medical cannabis program is

3641
02:56:07,490 --> 02:56:11,421
THC supplementation in addition to

3642
02:56:09,501 --> 02:56:13,190
mail-order Charlotte's Web is a viable

3643
02:56:11,421 --> 02:56:14,751
option for children and other medical

3644
02:56:13,190 --> 02:56:16,881
states who have previously been unable

3645
02:56:14,751 --> 02:56:19,791
to find consistent sources of clean well

3646
02:56:16,880 --> 02:56:21,350
tested CBD products and in non-medical

3647
02:56:19,790 --> 02:56:23,750
States it is certainly easier to find

3648
02:56:21,351 --> 02:56:25,490
THC for supplementation in the

3649
02:56:23,751 --> 02:56:29,720
underground black market than it is to

3650
02:56:25,490 --> 02:56:30,890
find CBD oils or clones so yeah I was

3651
02:56:29,720 --> 02:56:34,399
thinking about that the whole time I was

3652
02:56:30,890 --> 02:56:35,899
reading this it's just CBD what about

3653
02:56:34,399 --> 02:56:38,001
that montage effect we've talked about

3654
02:56:35,899 --> 02:56:43,070
so many times we got to get that whole

3655
02:56:38,001 --> 02:56:45,649
myriad of CBD THC THC V what about the

3656
02:56:43,070 --> 02:56:47,630
terpenoids that we're missing I think

3657
02:56:45,649 --> 02:56:48,800
all of it does it together and they're

3658
02:56:47,630 --> 02:56:50,570
saying that they're actually trying

3659
02:56:48,800 --> 02:56:52,911
they're needing to supplement with some

3660
02:56:50,570 --> 02:56:55,190
higher THC products because the CBD is

3661
02:56:52,911 --> 02:56:57,951
not working completely it's probably

3662
02:56:55,190 --> 02:56:59,480
helping it's you know just like any

3663
02:56:57,950 --> 02:57:00,920
medication that you would take or

3664
02:56:59,479 --> 02:57:03,171
anything new you would introduce to your

3665
02:57:00,921 --> 02:57:04,911
box to your body the first few times you

3666
02:57:03,171 --> 02:57:07,461
consume or take that you're gonna notice

3667
02:57:04,911 --> 02:57:09,380
a stronger reaction and after anything a

3668
02:57:07,460 --> 02:57:13,220
few times a few times you're gonna quit

3669
02:57:09,380 --> 02:57:15,979
feeling is strong of an effect so I'm

3670
02:57:13,220 --> 02:57:17,511
pretty sure that this CBD does work you

3671
02:57:15,979 --> 02:57:19,189
know for a while maybe for a long time

3672
02:57:17,511 --> 02:57:20,570
for some people maybe forever for some

3673
02:57:19,190 --> 02:57:22,461
but some people that's gonna you're

3674
02:57:20,570 --> 02:57:23,810
gonna need that THC I think I've

3675
02:57:22,460 --> 02:57:25,430
repeated and rambled about that long

3676
02:57:23,810 --> 02:57:28,341
enough so let me wrap up the last

3677
02:57:25,431 --> 02:57:30,440
paragraph here ensure there should be a

3678
02:57:28,341 --> 02:57:32,690
positive step in the war on cannabis at

3679
02:57:30,440 --> 02:57:34,490
the very least it should force federal

3680
02:57:32,690 --> 02:57:36,591
opinion on the legality of CBD hemp

3681
02:57:34,490 --> 02:57:38,149
products it will likely benefit some

3682
02:57:36,591 --> 02:57:40,070
number of patients especially those who

3683
02:57:38,149 --> 02:57:42,710
were able to supplement with THC and

3684
02:57:40,070 --> 02:57:45,800
unlike the CBD only legislation that has

3685
02:57:42,710 --> 02:57:47,300
been pushed by ROC the shipping of

3686
02:57:45,800 --> 02:57:49,760
Charlotte's Web is unlikely to have a

3687
02:57:47,300 --> 02:57:51,831
negative impact on future whole planet

3688
02:57:49,761 --> 02:57:53,661
legislation while the concept of trade

3689
02:57:51,831 --> 02:57:55,398
marking a plant and hoarding a strain

3690
02:57:53,661 --> 02:57:57,469
still rubs many patients and in

3691
02:57:55,398 --> 02:57:59,448
history insiders the wrong way the

3692
02:57:57,469 --> 02:58:01,340
bottom line is that more patients will

3693
02:57:59,449 --> 02:58:03,408
soon be able to access CBD rich oil

3694
02:58:01,340 --> 02:58:06,039
without having to move to realm of

3695
02:58:03,408 --> 02:58:07,788
caring States and that's a good thing ah

02:59:00,091 --> 02:59:04,530
once right now trying to do a show and

3724
02:59:01,290 --> 02:59:06,390
ramble so if you've got clones of CBD

3725
02:59:04,530 --> 02:59:07,681
medicine put those out there so I'm

3726
02:59:06,390 --> 02:59:09,540
saying because we don't want these

3727
02:59:07,681 --> 02:59:11,881
companies taking over all that [ __ ] why

3728
02:59:09,540 --> 02:59:14,850
do we want a company and charger that

3729
02:59:11,880 --> 02:59:16,109
that doesn't seem that's why we're

3730
02:59:14,851 --> 02:59:17,700
that's why most of us are smoking

3731
02:59:16,110 --> 02:59:19,319
medical cannabis anyways because we

3732
02:59:17,700 --> 02:59:21,150
don't want a company getting rich off of

3733
02:59:19,319 --> 02:59:23,940
us or a company telling us what we can

3734
02:59:21,149 --> 02:59:25,079
and cannot consume so I'm gonna move on

3735
02:59:23,940 --> 02:59:27,601
to the next article because I feel like

3736
02:59:25,079 --> 02:59:29,280
I'm ranting super dab doubt I gotta quit

3737
02:59:27,601 --> 02:59:32,400
getting so high on these episodes it's

3738
02:59:29,280 --> 02:59:35,431
kind of fun to tell you the truth if I

3739
02:59:32,399 --> 02:59:39,569
want to remember a little while back we

3740
02:59:35,431 --> 02:59:42,060
talked about a police officer who gave

3741
02:59:39,569 --> 02:59:45,659
out a whole bunch of tickets 66

3742
02:59:42,060 --> 02:59:47,251
citations in Seattle he was the main guy

3743
02:59:45,659 --> 02:59:50,310
giving out all the pot tickets we gave

3744
02:59:47,251 --> 02:59:52,739
him the big metal finger here's another

3745
02:59:50,310 --> 02:59:54,720
article that came from Seattle the

3746
02:59:52,739 --> 02:59:57,181
credit goes to the Associated Press it

3747
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:58,739
says Seattle's police chief has asked

3748
02:59:57,181 --> 03:00:00,511
the city to seek dismissal of all

3749
02:59:58,739 --> 03:00:03,149
marijuana citations issued by the

3750
03:00:00,511 --> 03:00:04,711
bicycle officer who wrote 80% of the

3751
03:00:03,149 --> 03:00:08,239
tickets handed out during the first half

3752
03:00:04,710 --> 03:00:10,519
of this year for using pot in public

3753
03:00:08,239 --> 03:00:12,559
Seattle Times reports that chief

3754
03:00:10,520 --> 03:00:14,149
Kathleen O'Toole said Friday the request

3755
03:00:12,559 --> 03:00:16,250
to the City Attorney's Office stems from

3756
03:00:14,149 --> 03:00:18,020
the conclusion that the 66 citations

3757
03:00:16,250 --> 03:00:20,329
were written as part of the officers

3758
03:00:18,020 --> 03:00:21,860
personal agenda the tool says the

3759
03:00:20,329 --> 03:00:22,639
tickets were written for the wrong

3760
03:00:21,860 --> 03:00:26,569
reason

3761
03:00:22,639 --> 03:00:29,180
bicycle officer wrote 66 of the 83 such

3762
03:00:26,569 --> 03:00:32,059
tickets issued in the first half of the

3763
03:00:29,180 --> 03:00:35,479
year of the city the student wrote 66 of

3764
03:00:32,059 --> 03:00:37,699
83 tickets in the first half of year so

3765
03:00:35,478 --> 03:00:39,649
in six months every month this dude

3766
03:00:37,700 --> 03:00:42,400
busted wrote 11 tickets for people

3767
03:00:39,649 --> 03:00:42,399
smoking pot

3768
03:00:42,489 --> 03:00:46,420
the officer wrote on one citation that

3769
03:00:44,469 --> 03:00:48,789
he used a coin toss to decide which of

3770
03:00:46,420 --> 03:00:52,030
two men got the ticket and on another

3771
03:00:48,790 --> 03:00:56,170
described state voter approval of

3772
03:00:52,030 --> 03:00:59,020
marijuana legalization as silly what he

3773
03:00:56,170 --> 03:01:01,600
freakin he wrote on the citation that he

3774
03:00:59,020 --> 03:01:02,260
used a coin to decide which two guys got

3775
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:05,110
the ticket

3776
03:01:02,260 --> 03:01:06,700
how can cops get away with that he wrote

3777
03:01:05,110 --> 03:01:09,190
it on the ticket I guess he's not he's

3778
03:01:06,700 --> 03:01:10,900
they're trying to make him not count now

3779
03:01:09,190 --> 03:01:12,489
they're trying to say huh your tickets

3780
03:01:10,899 --> 03:01:13,930
don't count would that be a big middle

3781
03:01:12,489 --> 03:01:15,549
finger if the authorities gave the

3782
03:01:13,930 --> 03:01:17,680
authority a big metal finger like that I

3783
03:01:15,549 --> 03:01:20,049
like it the time since the officer has

3784
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:22,559
apologized to O'Toole she's reportedly

3785
03:01:20,049 --> 03:01:24,549
still considering disciplinary action

3786
03:01:22,559 --> 03:01:26,319
the City Attorney Pete Holmes

3787
03:01:24,549 --> 03:01:27,899
spokeswoman Kimberly mill says Holmes

3788
03:01:26,319 --> 03:01:30,459
will review the Chiefs request

3789
03:01:27,899 --> 03:01:32,379
initiative 502 approved by Washington

3790
03:01:30,459 --> 03:01:36,879
voters included a civil fine per for

3791
03:01:32,379 --> 03:01:38,709
public consumption of marijuana so uh we

3792
03:01:36,879 --> 03:01:40,989
kind of got a some people on our side

3793
03:01:38,709 --> 03:01:42,728
because they let that cop are they gonna

3794
03:01:40,989 --> 03:01:43,959
they may let that cop stick it's a slide

3795
03:01:42,728 --> 03:01:47,129
that'll be kind of neat I'm scroll

3796
03:01:43,959 --> 03:01:47,129
through the neck to the next article

3797
03:01:47,379 --> 03:01:52,459
they were talking about in Denver about

3798
03:01:49,670 --> 03:01:55,069
banning BHO extraction and banning

3799
03:01:52,459 --> 03:01:58,159
certain types of extractions without

3800
03:01:55,069 --> 03:01:59,959
being in a licensed facility or what

3801
03:01:58,159 --> 03:02:02,389
they would call a MIPS I think that is

3802
03:01:59,959 --> 03:02:03,319
to be a little more accurate sorry I'm

3803

all right so this says some exemptions

3809
03:02:15,229 --> 03:02:20,539
and proposed Denver restrictions on

3810
03:02:17,209 --> 03:02:23,089
making home hash oil so it says

3811
03:02:20,540 --> 03:02:25,340
alcohol-based extraction process will

3812
03:02:23,090 --> 03:02:27,440
join water and food based method methods

3813
03:02:25,340 --> 03:02:30,090
as acceptable in Denver City Council

3814

hash oil production so that they could

3820
03:02:39,450 --> 03:02:44,880
be amended to accommodate residents who

3821
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:46,590
use an alcohol-based process sorry

weird

3825
03:02:48,530 --> 03:02:52,829
several people argued for the change to

3826
03:02:50,850 --> 03:02:54,329
the safety and well-being committee

3827
03:02:52,829 --> 03:02:56,159
including the father of a little girl

3828
03:02:54,329 --> 03:02:58,350
who depends on cannabis oil to treat her

3829
03:02:56,159 --> 03:03:00,209
severe epilepsy the committee will

3830
03:02:58,350 --> 03:03:02,880
resume the discussion on the proposed

3831
03:03:00,209 --> 03:03:05,369
ordinance or could vote on October 16th

3832
03:03:02,879 --> 03:03:08,069
on whether to send it to the full

3833
03:03:05,370 --> 03:03:10,620
council the proposal would ban the

3834
03:03:08,069 --> 03:03:13,500
amateur use of butane or other gases in

3835
03:03:10,620 --> 03:03:15,479
extractions of oil for marijuana that's

3836
03:03:13,500 --> 03:03:18,030
resulted in dozens dozens of home

3837
03:03:15,478 --> 03:03:19,799
explosions statewide this year licensed

3838
03:03:18,030 --> 03:03:22,020
businesses still could use that process

3839
03:03:19,799 --> 03:03:24,898
the people who make hash oil at home

3840
03:03:22,020 --> 03:03:27,950
would have to use safe water and food

3841
03:03:24,898 --> 03:03:27,949
based methods

3842
03:03:28,879 --> 03:03:36,438
this is gonna have two different effects

3843
03:03:32,559 --> 03:03:38,119
well people do [ __ ] that's illegal

3844
03:03:36,439 --> 03:03:39,500
anyway so I don't think that people are

3845
03:03:38,120 --> 03:03:41,060
gonna stop doing it it's just gonna make

3846
03:03:39,500 --> 03:03:44,148
it a little sketchier and now that's

3847
03:03:41,059 --> 03:03:46,189
gonna cause more more people sneaking

3848
03:03:44,148 --> 03:03:47,539
around doing it you have to do it in a

3849
03:03:46,189 --> 03:03:49,189
little more sketchy place which means

3850
03:03:47,540 --> 03:03:51,800
you're a little more enclosed which is

3851
03:03:49,189 --> 03:03:54,050
the dangerous part of it and also I

3852
03:03:51,799 --> 03:03:57,349
think it's gonna make the street value

3853
03:03:54,049 --> 03:03:58,789
of pho dabs go up and already right now

3854
03:03:57,350 --> 03:04:00,229
dabs are getting kind of hard to find

3855
03:03:58,790 --> 03:04:01,939
around here and the prices are going up

3856
03:04:00,228 --> 03:04:04,609
really high and it's because they're

3857
03:04:01,939 --> 03:04:07,909
making rolls like this I agree I don't

3858
03:04:04,610 --> 03:04:09,979
want some uneducated dude next door in

3859
03:04:07,909 --> 03:04:11,478
his garage making hash while I'm sitting

3860
03:04:09,978 --> 03:04:13,129
here trying to record a podcast I don't

3861
03:04:11,478 --> 03:04:16,069
need the next-door house blowing up and

3862
03:04:13,129 --> 03:04:19,279
screwing up all of our lives so I guess

3863
03:04:16,069 --> 03:04:21,920
it's kind of you know the adult in me

3864
03:04:19,280 --> 03:04:24,290
needs a parent in me the freaking smart

3865
03:04:21,920 --> 03:04:28,700
guy says we should not be blasting like

3866
03:04:24,290 --> 03:04:30,470
that so that's kind of cool too but then

3867
03:04:28,700 --> 03:04:33,409
and we got to get the shops or we got to

3868
03:04:30,469 --> 03:04:35,449
figure out a way that we can get some

3869
03:04:33,409 --> 03:04:38,780
kind of private caregivers to be able to

3870
03:04:35,450 --> 03:04:41,210
blast it if we build our own rooms if I

3871
03:04:38,780 --> 03:04:43,310
have OSHA come and build me a blast safe

3872
03:04:41,209 --> 03:04:45,319
room can I make it in there then maybe

3873
03:04:43,309 --> 03:04:46,819
please you know there has to be some

3874
03:04:45,319 --> 03:04:49,579
kind of exception because the shops are

3875
03:04:46,819 --> 03:04:52,309
charging way too much right now for

3876
03:04:49,579 --> 03:04:53,689
shatter and a lot of it is [ __ ] to tell

3877
03:04:52,309 --> 03:04:55,010
you the truth I wouldn't dab a lot of

3878
03:04:53,689 --> 03:04:57,110
the hash that I've seen come from the

3879
03:04:55,010 --> 03:04:59,300
shops I am a little bit of a hash knob

3880
03:04:57,110 --> 03:05:02,210
to tell you the truth but uh I don't

3881
03:04:59,299 --> 03:05:03,590
want to dad a lot of that [ __ ] so let me

3882
03:05:02,209 --> 03:05:05,419
show you I've got a camera going here

3883
03:05:03,590 --> 03:05:07,819
guys I'll post some pictures of this I'm

3884
03:05:05,420 --> 03:05:09,920
kind of working on putting up YouTube

3885
03:05:07,819 --> 03:05:11,029
videos this got ha I can't see what I'm

3886
03:05:09,920 --> 03:05:14,110
doing let me switch to the video this

3887
03:05:11,030 --> 03:05:17,561
got hot in the car but this

3888
03:05:14,110 --> 03:05:19,511
golden dope shadow right here it should

3889
03:05:17,560 --> 03:05:23,440
be nice and stable it shouldn't be goopy

3890
03:05:19,511 --> 03:05:24,909
soupy and poopy and then I'm gonna

3891
03:05:23,440 --> 03:05:27,069
contradict myself by showing you some

3892
03:05:24,909 --> 03:05:28,450
live resin that is a little bit gooey

3893
03:05:27,069 --> 03:05:30,341
but this is a different product this

3894
03:05:28,450 --> 03:05:35,409
isn't shatter we're not marketing this

3895
03:05:30,341 --> 03:05:37,960
is shatter this is live resin it's uh so

3896
03:05:35,409 --> 03:05:39,940
golden and clear that is bra that's just

3897
03:05:37,959 --> 03:05:42,220
uh we've talked about libraries and it's

3898
03:05:39,940 --> 03:05:44,110
fresh frozen butane blasted buds down in

3899
03:05:42,220 --> 03:05:45,399
a closed-loop shoutout to the guy that

3900
03:05:44,110 --> 03:05:46,480
did it for me he knows what's up he

3901
03:05:45,399 --> 03:05:48,369
knows who he is I don't know if I should

3902
03:05:46,479 --> 03:05:50,079
say his name on the show right now good

3903
03:05:48,370 --> 03:05:52,960
work that shit's golden really golden

3904
03:05:50,079 --> 03:05:54,970
looking but the shops are too much for

3905
03:05:52,959 --> 03:05:57,489
doodoo and that sucks so they have to

3906
03:05:54,970 --> 03:05:58,720
let the artists the extract artists that

3907
03:05:57,489 --> 03:06:01,390
know what they're doing the people that

3908
03:05:58,720 --> 03:06:03,609
uh that kind of led this movement has it

3909
03:06:01,390 --> 03:06:04,659
make everything happen not everything

3910
03:06:03,610 --> 03:06:06,521
that'll make sorry I'm adjusting a

3911
03:06:04,659 --> 03:06:09,220
camera over heroin rambling the guys

3912
03:06:06,521 --> 03:06:10,301
have evolved all this hash stuff they've

3913
03:06:09,220 --> 03:06:12,369
done the research they've done the work

3914
03:06:10,300 --> 03:06:14,680
we need to be able to do it in a safe

3915
03:06:12,370 --> 03:06:17,061
manner and I know that open blasting is

3916
03:06:14,681 --> 03:06:19,610
not a safe manner

3917
03:06:17,060 --> 03:06:20,779
I wonder if this is let's see this is

3918
03:06:19,610 --> 03:06:23,391
gonna have anything to do with the guys

3919
03:06:20,780 --> 03:06:24,530
with the closed-loop system let's scroll

3920
03:06:23,390 --> 03:06:26,819
through this article one quick time and

3921
03:06:24,530 --> 03:06:28,710
see

3922
03:06:26,819 --> 03:06:30,479
would ban amateur use of propane or

3923
03:06:28,709 --> 03:06:32,609
other gases an extraction of oil foam

3924
03:06:30,479 --> 03:06:33,989
yeah that [ __ ] says closed-loop

3925
03:06:32,610 --> 03:06:36,601
system or not I think in the way that

3926
03:06:33,989 --> 03:06:37,860
that's worded so we're gonna have to be

3927
03:06:36,601 --> 03:06:39,239
careful I know a few guys that have

3928
03:06:37,860 --> 03:06:40,200
invested in a closed-loop system

3929
03:06:39,239 --> 03:06:41,819
thinking that that was solved the

3930
03:06:40,200 --> 03:06:43,590
problem and now look they're changing

3931
03:06:41,819 --> 03:06:44,640
the rules right around here all right

3932
03:06:43,590 --> 03:06:46,409
I'm gonna get back into the article it

3933
03:06:44,640 --> 03:06:47,969
says Brian Wilson whose family moved

3934
03:06:46,409 --> 03:06:48,989
from New Jersey to Denver earlier this

3935
03:06:47,969 --> 03:06:50,609
year so his three-year-old daughter

3936
03:06:48,989 --> 03:06:52,619
Vivian could use medical marijuana

3937
03:06:50,610 --> 03:06:54,300
treatments said neither of those methods

3938
03:06:52,620 --> 03:06:56,490
will produce the kind of oil suitable

3939
03:06:54,299 --> 03:06:59,759
for her he uses an ethanol based

3940
03:06:56,489 --> 03:07:01,640
extraction process I didn't move I here

3941
03:06:59,760 --> 03:07:05,130
to put her at more risk Wilson said

3942
03:07:01,640 --> 03:07:06,931
n'ver fire chief elected Eric tabe

3943
03:07:05,129 --> 03:07:08,879
excuse me told the committee that the

3944
03:07:06,931 --> 03:07:11,579
proposal likely could be amended to

3945
03:07:08,879 --> 03:07:13,469
allow all alcohol based methods with

3946
03:07:11,579 --> 03:07:17,149
limits on use of heat and amount of

3947
03:07:13,469 --> 03:07:19,350
alcohol to keep it safe say I guess if

3948
03:07:17,149 --> 03:07:20,819
and I don't like rules and stuff but I

3949
03:07:19,351 --> 03:07:22,710
don't like fires and explosions either

3950
03:07:20,819 --> 03:07:26,039
if I have a choice a couple of rules or

3951
03:07:22,709 --> 03:07:28,229
a couple of fires and the Rastafarian me

3952
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:30,931
says [ __ ] the rules I owe a dollar but

3953
03:07:28,229 --> 03:07:33,270
uh the other part of me says I'm gonna

3954
03:07:30,931 --> 03:07:34,380
like fire um let me explain why I keep

3955
03:07:33,271 --> 03:07:37,280
saying that I need a dollar if you're

3956
03:07:34,379 --> 03:07:39,659
not a what common listener what's a

3957
03:07:37,280 --> 03:07:41,900
regular listener what's the phrase for

3958
03:07:39,659 --> 03:07:43,738
that or regular listener I guess

3959
03:07:41,899 --> 03:07:45,208
[Music]

3960
03:07:43,738 --> 03:07:47,698
every time I say the f-word I owe a

3961
03:07:45,209 --> 03:07:48,899
dollar and there's a charity there's a

3962
03:07:47,699 --> 03:07:50,908
guy he's not a charity it's a sick

3963
03:07:48,898 --> 03:07:52,379
person sick child that will get my

3964
03:07:50,908 --> 03:07:53,879
dollars every time I say the f-word you

3965
03:07:52,379 --> 03:07:55,589
guys have to tweet me tell me when I

3966
03:07:53,879 --> 03:07:58,228
said it tell me how many times in this

3967
03:07:55,590 --> 03:07:59,939
episode I said it it starts on episode

3968
03:07:58,228 --> 03:08:02,309
30 this is 31 so you got two episode

3969
03:07:59,939 --> 03:08:04,229
three can make some money off me

3970
03:08:02,309 --> 03:08:05,668
after a couple episodes if I don't stop

3971
03:08:04,228 --> 03:08:07,618
saying F word I'm gonna increase the

3972
03:08:05,668 --> 03:08:09,180
dollar amount I'll go from a dollar and

3973
03:08:07,619 --> 03:08:10,619
I'll be like alright now I'm gonna stir

3974
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:12,238
not now I'm not saying this but

3975
03:08:10,619 --> 03:08:13,680
hypothetically in the future I'll start

3976
03:08:12,238 --> 03:08:16,618
charging myself five dollars for every

3977
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:18,119
time I say that F word I mean if I still

3978
03:08:16,619 --> 03:08:19,709
don't stop will charge ten bucks and

3979
03:08:18,119 --> 03:08:21,479
then that's gonna start costing me money

3980
03:08:19,709 --> 03:08:22,918
and money counts and I don't want to say

3981
03:08:21,478 --> 03:08:24,538
that for it on the show and I don't want

3982
03:08:22,918 --> 03:08:26,279

the fair oh man so we talked about this

4012
03:09:50,238 --> 03:09:54,738
a little while back there was a pot

4013
03:09:52,668 --> 03:09:56,148
pavilion at the Denver County Fair they

4014
03:09:54,738 --> 03:09:58,549
had a joint rolling contest where

4015
03:09:56,148 --> 03:10:00,378
actually they rolled oregano instead of

4016
03:09:58,549 --> 03:10:01,698
rolling pot but they'd enjoy a rolling

4017
03:10:00,379 --> 03:10:04,039
contest they had a lot of stuff going on

4018
03:10:01,699 --> 03:10:05,418
actually had a pot drawing competition

4019
03:10:04,039 --> 03:10:06,800
off site where people had to draw their

4020
03:10:05,418 --> 03:10:07,998
paw and then people would go look at it

4021
03:10:06,799 --> 03:10:09,948
somewhere else cuz they didn't want it

4022
03:10:07,998 --> 03:10:13,039
there oh you were not supposed to bring

4023
03:10:09,949 --> 03:10:16,668
any pot products to this fair that's not

4024
03:10:13,039 --> 03:10:19,189
what was supposed to happen but full

4025
03:10:16,668 --> 03:10:21,590
mill handed out some chocolate bars and

4026
03:10:19,189 --> 03:10:23,659
people ate them

4027
03:10:21,590 --> 03:10:25,000
and seven people are now named as

4028
03:10:23,659 --> 03:10:28,420
plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit

4029
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:28,420
against these guys

4030
03:10:29,078 --> 03:10:33,279
imagine and we had to stock a little

4031
03:10:31,809 --> 03:10:36,340
while back on the show but imagine if

4032
03:10:33,279 --> 03:10:38,890
you or not a pot smoker so me listening

4033
03:10:36,340 --> 03:10:40,630
to the show may not be pot smokers some

4034
03:10:38,889 --> 03:10:42,309
of you may be amateur pot smokers some

4035
03:10:40,629 --> 03:10:44,408
of you I know only have smoked a little

4036
03:10:42,309 --> 03:10:47,528
while some of you can only smoke very

4037
03:10:44,408 --> 03:10:50,920
occasionally and if you eat a hundred

4038
03:10:47,529 --> 03:10:53,470
milligram edible you're gonna get really

4039
03:10:50,920 --> 03:10:56,078
high so imagine if you went to the fair

4040
03:10:53,469 --> 03:10:57,608
and you're just hanging out and

4041
03:10:56,078 --> 03:11:01,389
someone's like you try this chocolate

4042
03:10:57,609 --> 03:11:03,010
man and you're like no you're like I

4043
03:11:01,389 --> 03:11:04,840
believe you you work for this company

4044
03:11:03,010 --> 03:11:06,789
and you've got the apron on that says

4045
03:11:04,840 --> 03:11:08,078
the company neither behind the booth I

4046
03:11:06,789 --> 03:11:11,409
believe you so you eat the chocolate

4047
03:11:08,078 --> 03:11:12,670
right probably 45 minutes later you're

4048
03:11:11,408 --> 03:11:14,978
just [ __ ] your pants because you're

4049
03:11:12,670 --> 03:11:17,318
too high oh man imagine that you gotta

4050
03:11:14,978 --> 03:11:19,000
try to drive home and the weird part of

4051
03:11:17,318 --> 03:11:21,398
the head trip of it made my opinion is

4052
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:23,139
you don't realize that you ate something

4053
03:11:21,398 --> 03:11:25,538
that was gonna make you feel intoxicated

4054
03:11:23,139 --> 03:11:27,068
so now you're like tripping a little bit

4055
03:11:25,539 --> 03:11:28,659
because you're high right you're

4056
03:11:27,068 --> 03:11:30,129
starting to feel whatever whatever you

4057
03:11:28,658 --> 03:11:32,260
whatever comes on first you get the

4058
03:11:30,129 --> 03:11:33,578
tinglies in your arms and then things

4059
03:11:32,260 --> 03:11:36,460
are a little funny and you started

4060
03:11:33,578 --> 03:11:37,658
giggling but you don't know why and and

4061
03:11:36,459 --> 03:11:39,339
but now you really don't know why

4062
03:11:37,658 --> 03:11:41,350
because you didn't realize you ate this

4063

[ __ ] so you're like I'm [ __ ] now you

4079
03:12:13,389 --> 03:12:17,828
that was on the clock see this could

4080
03:12:15,430 --> 03:12:18,760
have caused a lot of problems we

4081
03:12:17,828 --> 03:12:19,809
shouldn't talk too much about it because

4082
03:12:18,760 --> 03:12:20,800
I guess there's a court case and

4083
03:12:19,809 --> 03:12:21,939
somebody can hear what I'm saying to be

4084
03:12:20,799 --> 03:12:24,519
like yeah that is [ __ ] up I didn't

4085
03:12:21,939 --> 03:12:26,760
realize that oh and other goddamn dollar

4086
03:12:24,520 --> 03:12:29,078
this is gonna be an expensive episode ah

4087
03:12:26,760 --> 03:12:31,568
so seven people are gonna make a lot of

4088
03:12:29,078 --> 03:12:34,420
money off of full mile chocolate and

4089
03:12:31,568 --> 03:12:37,299
live well so be careful if you ever go

4090
03:12:34,420 --> 03:12:38,648
to a fair or an event they're handing

4091
03:12:37,299 --> 03:12:40,328
out cannabis chocolates and you're a

4092
03:12:38,648 --> 03:12:42,760
lightweight or you're not aware of what

4093
03:12:40,328 --> 03:12:44,199
you're getting as carefully

4094
03:12:42,760 --> 03:12:46,960
I guess if you get the wrong [ __ ] sue

4095
03:12:44,200 --> 03:12:48,370
the hell out of them I probably would if

4096
03:12:46,959 --> 03:12:50,199
I wouldn't if you did it to me but if

4097
03:12:48,370 --> 03:12:51,520
you gave my daughter a medicated

4098
03:12:50,200 --> 03:12:53,350
chocolate and told her that it was a

4099
03:12:51,520 --> 03:12:54,970
regular chocolate that's I'm definitely

4100
03:12:53,350 --> 03:12:56,950
you're gonna yeah there's gonna be at

4101
03:12:54,969 --> 03:12:59,438

4102
03:12:56,950 --> 03:13:00,760

4103

03:14:40,770 --> 03:14:45,479
the old episodes and just make really

4142
03:14:42,840 --> 03:14:47,068
cheesy iMovie videos so that they can be

4143
03:14:45,478 --> 03:14:49,170
up on YouTube so that people that don't

4144
03:14:47,068 --> 03:14:51,028
have an iPhone or don't have stitcher or

4145
03:14:49,170 --> 03:14:53,609
whatever who are more simple and more

4146
03:14:51,029 --> 03:14:54,930
familiar with the youtubes well it'll

4147
03:14:53,609 --> 03:14:56,699
just give us another way to be listened

4148
03:14:54,930 --> 03:14:58,109
so I'm gonna throw the show up on

4149
03:14:56,699 --> 03:15:00,090
YouTube they'll be really simple videos

4150
03:14:58,109 --> 03:15:03,000
at first I'll learn how to make better

4151
03:15:00,090 --> 03:15:04,829
videos as time goes by the first few

4152
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:07,079
will be cheesy I promise you the first

4153
03:15:04,829 --> 03:15:10,469
two are goofy I made them last night

4154
03:15:07,079 --> 03:15:13,170
might have been medicated might have

4155
03:15:10,469 --> 03:15:15,568
been really medicated I would take a DAB

4156
03:15:13,170 --> 03:15:17,040
to this golden goat and you can't sleep

4157
03:15:15,568 --> 03:15:18,269
after you dab this golden goat so you

4158
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:19,529
just got to open your computer and just

4159
03:15:18,270 --> 03:15:20,609
go nuts because you don't really want to

4160
03:15:19,529 --> 03:15:24,810
do anything important when you're that

4161
03:15:20,609 --> 03:15:27,119
dad so I'm recording this one I'm just

4162
03:15:24,809 --> 03:15:28,439
staring into my macbook with a the

4163
03:15:27,119 --> 03:15:29,550
camera going and just recording me

4164
03:15:28,439 --> 03:15:31,020
what's up if you're checking it out

4165
03:15:29,549 --> 03:15:33,389
right now

4166
03:15:31,020 --> 03:15:34,859
I may just post that to YouTube but you

4167
03:15:33,389 --> 03:15:38,608
got 30 episodes to figure that one out

4168
03:15:34,859 --> 03:15:40,140
so it'll be up there eventually I might

4169
03:15:38,609 --> 03:15:42,750
I might go out of order you never know

4170
03:15:40,139 --> 03:15:43,799
with us you never know with me I just

4171
03:15:42,750 --> 03:15:45,478
wanted to jump on here and record

4172
03:15:43,799 --> 03:15:47,129
because I got that really cool tweet

4173
03:15:45,478 --> 03:15:49,079
about that article that Mike sent me I

4174
03:15:47,129 --> 03:15:51,719
had to tell you about that I wanted to

4175
03:15:49,079 --> 03:15:53,309
talk about the video of course I am the

4176
03:15:51,719 --> 03:15:56,129
guy from my region that exceeds a lot of

4177
03:15:53,309 --> 03:15:57,510
people have been asking me when will

4178
03:15:56,129 --> 03:16:00,839
certain things be back in stock in

4179
03:15:57,510 --> 03:16:02,639
nature's green remedies they're sold out

4180
03:16:00,840 --> 03:16:05,908
because I'm sold out you guys cleaned me

4181
03:16:02,639 --> 03:16:07,260
the heck out of seeds I really

4182
03:16:05,908 --> 03:16:12,359
appreciate it I promise you I'm working

4183
03:16:07,260 --> 03:16:13,590
on more stuff I've got more grateful dog

4184
03:16:12,359 --> 03:16:16,500
there would be a little bit of grateful

4185
03:16:13,590 --> 03:16:18,809
dog that that one doesn't make a lot of

4186
03:16:16,500 --> 03:16:20,279
seeds it's harder to get C's out of that

4187
03:16:18,809 --> 03:16:21,689
one than a lot of the others would be a

4188
03:16:20,279 --> 03:16:23,908
lot of bounty killer to be a lot of

4189
03:16:21,689 --> 03:16:26,488
Capleton there'd be a little bit of

4190
03:16:23,908 --> 03:16:28,879
heart of gold there will be some Kalonji

4191
03:16:26,488 --> 03:16:32,219
there may be a little bit of night nurse

4192
03:16:28,879 --> 03:16:33,629
a lot of what I make goes to the people

4193
03:16:32,219 --> 03:16:35,818
around here before it makes it to

4194
03:16:33,629 --> 03:16:39,478
nature's green remedies it goes to other

4195
03:16:35,818 --> 03:16:40,738
places before it gets there I take care

4196
03:16:39,478 --> 03:16:42,209
the locals first they take care of the

4197
03:16:40,738 --> 03:16:43,920
people around me my patients I'm a

4198
03:16:42,209 --> 03:16:45,839
caregiver those guys get the seeds first

4199
03:16:43,920 --> 03:16:47,100
that I make and then I put what I have

4200
03:16:45,840 --> 03:16:49,139
on nature's remedies when

4201
03:16:47,100 --> 03:16:51,779
order from me so I'll let them know when

4202
03:16:49,139 --> 03:16:53,698
I have snuff they'll order it and then

4203
03:16:51,779 --> 03:16:57,238
they'll put it on the website guys it's

4204
03:16:53,699 --> 03:17:02,790
gonna be honestly coughing and counting

4205
03:16:57,238 --> 03:17:05,100
so we're looking about probably 75 to 90

4206
03:17:02,790 --> 03:17:07,260
days if I don't want to make any huge

4207
03:17:05,100 --> 03:17:08,699
promises and there should be some stuff

4208
03:17:07,260 --> 03:17:10,738
on nature's green remedies maybe a

4209
03:17:08,699 --> 03:17:12,119
hundred days I'm gonna say because you

4210
03:17:10,738 --> 03:17:15,389
know I need packaging time and all that

4211
03:17:12,119 --> 03:17:16,829
stuff drying time right around 100 days

4212
03:17:15,389 --> 03:17:18,658
there should be some stuff available

4213
03:17:16,829 --> 03:17:21,359
from Ira genetics again in nature's

4214
03:17:18,658 --> 03:17:22,430
green remedies calm I apologize for not

4215
03:17:21,359 --> 03:17:24,270
being able to keep them in stock

4216
03:17:22,430 --> 03:17:26,279
honestly it's kind of a good sign that

4217
03:17:24,270 --> 03:17:29,670
they're sold out that means I'd be doing

4218
03:17:26,279 --> 03:17:31,979
[ __ ] right um also I have a forum
