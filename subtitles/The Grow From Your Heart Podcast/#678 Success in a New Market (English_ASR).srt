00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,959
discussing it but keep an eye out for

115
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,359
bud rod a lot of people are experiencing

116
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,879
bud rot here in colorado if you've got

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,120
an outdoor crop and you've not already

118
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,279
taken it down it may be time to go into

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
hurry up mode hurry up and get that [ __ ]

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,799
done i know we can't make the plants

121
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,399
ripen any more quickly maybe you can

122
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,840
feed it a few products but we can't get

123
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,679
it to go much more quickly but pay

124
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,758
attention for that bud rot you would

125
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,519
rather cut down a little bit early than

126
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,240
not get to smoke it at all because it's

127
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,240
got bud rot if you do experience bud rot

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,079
don't try to just cut around it

129
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,000
don't just cut it out just throw that

130
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,000
[ __ ] away don't smoke it don't extract

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,800
it don't wash it don't blast it have

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,319
some pride have some class just toss it

133
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
learn from your mistakes and do better

134
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,079
next year that shit's gross let's not

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,800
get anybody sick this is supposed to be

136
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,198
medical marijuana not get you sick

137
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,040
marijuana that's not the way to do it

138
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,879
another another thing i'm not even gonna

139
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,639
edit that big stutter there another

140
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,399
thing that i should talk about some of

141
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,079
your plants may be done at the top and

142
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,000
not at the bottom a lot of your big buds

143
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,079
may be getting ripened and finished up

144
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
so if you're afraid of those getting any

145
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,199
sort of bud rot or mold here at the end

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
because at the end is when the plants

147
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,639
are very susceptible to most issues if

148
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,960
you want to prevent a lot of that you

149
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,879
can take the tops of the plants the

150
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,319
bigger uh more ripened parts of the

151
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,560
plant you can take those and leave the

152
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,560
lower parts of the plants to ripen

153
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,800
further there are a few advantages of

154
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,199
that one of the main advantages is that

155
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,879
you get your product indoors earlier you

156
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,800
don't get the option for bud rot you

157
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,319
don't get the option for thieves you

158
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,079
don't get the option to maybe have

159
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,000
somebody else find your crop if it's in

160
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,680
an illegal area or on somebody else's

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,038
property don't do that be a good grower

162
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,759
but i know there's some people out there

163
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,159
doing their thing old school style but

164
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,000
you can take those top buds off get them

165
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,439
in get them cleaned up start drying

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,680
those start getting them ready for the

167
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,879
trim then you can trim those move them

168
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,400
out of the way and cut down the rest of

169
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,079
the plant move that in that way you're

170
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,079
not overwhelmed with one gigantic

171
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,399
harvest and you can let those bottom

172
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,000
buds finish if that's how it works out

173
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,000
on your plant most of the time they do

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,839
finish from the top down you get those

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,439
bigger buds at the top that'll let the

176
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,879
bottoms ripen up also you're getting all

177
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,478
that big bud out of the way the top you

178
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,399
can get more sunlight down there get

179
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,680
more airflow to the bottom once again

180
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,120
prevent your mold your mildew issues

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,000
all right so what did you learn this

182
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,680
year in your outdoor garden did you take

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
notes what are you going to do

184
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,519
differently to have a better outcome

185
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,560
this year maybe you crushed it this year

186
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,918
but

187
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,280
what are we going to do better next year

188
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,799
there's something you can do better no

189
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,198
matter how good you did no matter how

190
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,879
fat your harvest was no matter how terpy

191
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,038
that [ __ ] was no matter how successful

192
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,478
you feel like you are the best way to be

193
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,318
a good grower is to figure out how

194
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,839
you're going to improve upon that next

195
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,600
year maybe your dry and cure method

196
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,279
needs work maybe your trimming needs

197
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
work maybe your timing needs work i know

198
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,399
what i'm going to do better next year

199
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,160
i will plan ahead better next year

200
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,598
i did not realize i would have outdoor

201
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,520
space until

202
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,639
kind of the the last day to put plants

203
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,159
outside i was like they're going into

204
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,598
flower today technically if we think

205
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,360
about other people's plants and look at

206
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,079
theirs we need to get them out so i need

207
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,680
to

208
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,519
plan ahead i'll make

209
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,639
larger plants to go outside but of

210
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,478
course i couldn't do that because i

211
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,720
didn't have the time i will make better

212
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,279
selections i did good at selecting

213
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,360
plants for outdoors but i learned that a

214
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,198
couple of things take way too long to

215
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
even go into flowers so i've got one

216
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,720
plant in a greenhouse most of them have

217
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,399
been harvested by the time you hear this

218
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,720
they've been chopped down there's one

219
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,439
plant out there that is not finishing it

220
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,039
is still going it did not make pistols i

221
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,120
didn't get very many seeds because it

222
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,598
was very late to go into the flowering

223
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,240
stage i was very late to go into the

224
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,159
state or it can take pollen so that

225
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,319
plant is still flowering everybody else

226
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,319
is cut down that bad [ __ ] is still out

227
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,160
there i won't run that one outdoors ever

228
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
again i learned my lesson there i

229
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,000
noticed that a couple of them went into

230
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,079
flower really early they finished really

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,439
early and they banged out a ton of seeds

232
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,839
some of them didn't give me as many

233
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,240
seeds i learned a lot of lessons

234
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,038
on plant selection for outdoors that's

235
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,199
very very important we saw some issues

236
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,719
and some things and i saw which plants i

237
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,960
experienced issues and which plants

238
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,360
didn't so i learned a lot of stuff

239
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,359
i will prep and prepare for issues

240
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
better i didn't know what to expect in a

241
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,240
new environment

242
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,079
now i know what to expect i'll be able

243
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
to prepare for it i'll be able to treat

244
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,758
uh for things that are coming because i

245
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,840
know what is coming i know uh now i know

246
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,680
when to harvest also i did ha i did not

247
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,918
have any idea when my seeds would be

248
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,120
ready when we put the plants outside i

249
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,598
thought we would be going until

250
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,199
halloween uh we did not even go until

251
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,120
the middle of september we were cutting

252
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,519
down uh the middle of september we

253
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,839
started chopping uh it's october 1st now

254
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,679
we're almost done so uh yeah they got

255
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,839
done much earlier than i had anticipated

256
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,918
so i learned a lot within that aspect

257
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,760
plant selection and timing is mainly

258
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,838
what i learned outdoors

259
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,278
i had people growing doing a lot of the

260
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,279
work there were other people doing a lot

261
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,799
of the work they learned a lot something

262
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,799
that i should say is that i could

263
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,958
probably train the crew a little bit

264
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,719
better next year you guys did a good job

265
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,639
if you're watching listening you did

266
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,240
exactly what i said to do there were

267
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,399
things i probably could have explained

268
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,399
better i could have said when how where

269
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,240
and why with a little bit more detail so

270
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,519
that next year you're kind of able to do

271
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,278
it but i could have trained the folks

272
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,519
that were working uh they weren't even

273
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,600
working for me they did the work and i

274
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,440
it was a good relationship shout out to

275
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,200
the team they did a really good job i

276
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,959
feel like i guided them well but i could

277
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,320
have done better it's been a minute

278
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,079
since i've been in a big commercial

279
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,760
environment i'm used to running big

280
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,440
grows with a lot of people and covid

281
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,799
kind of slowed me down and then i was

282
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,560
working with friends and i didn't want

283
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,159
to [ __ ] go in there and like act like

284
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,239
i was in a commercial grow telling my

285
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,600
friends what to do so there's a dynamic

286
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,120
for me to learn there but i did a good

287
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,040
job we're all still friends and the

288
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,320
harvest is down that's really important

289
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,319
if you're growing with friends a lot of

290
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,839
times the girl with friends will ruin

291
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,360
[ __ ] relationships and i told my

292
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,720
buddy going in i was like dude i don't

293
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,240
care about the plants and the money as

294
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,680
much as when the end of this comes out

295
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,039
we still have to be [ __ ] friends no

296
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,399
matter how this goes like i'm going to

297
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,838
give you money you're going to give me

298
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,958
space i want to be your friend in the

299
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,920
end of this this can't [ __ ] up our

300
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,079
relationship here so that went well but

301
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,519
i could probably work on training my

302
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,360
crew a little bit better better next

303
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,200
year it was they did a good job but some

304
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,039
of the things we could have done better

305
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,120
if i thought about things a little bit

306
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,278
better again i was learning this was my

307
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
first inaugural outdoor grow so i

308
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,600
learned a lot i hope you learned a lot

309
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,519
um i am kind of in the process of

310
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,360
processing the outdoor harvest now it's

311
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,799
all seeded a lot of people are excited

312
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,879
for those seeds give me a minute you

313
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,399
guys uh it's taking it's a while it's

314
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,639
just me and there's a lot of plants a

315
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,399
lot of seeds the shit's got to dry up

316
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,360
we got to get the seeds out of it got to

317
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,879
get the seeds sorted counted packaged i

318
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
may have to order more packaging because

319
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,679
i look like i might be getting low

320
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,039
they're going more quickly than i

321
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,799
expected so thank you guys for buying

322
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,799
seeds but give me a minute we'll get it

323
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,479
going you guys my my point is i hope you

324
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,559
the first point i hope you learned a lot

325
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,399
outdoors and i hope you took notes and i

326
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,479

to save some of them and use most of

334
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,919
them for the indo expo but right now i

335
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,680
honestly have no idea if the indo expo

336
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:09,039
is happening if it still exists um

337
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,639

338
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,719
respond to me i'll tell you the truth

339
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,559
everything i know about the indo expo uh

340
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,680
the owner of the indo-expo passed away

341
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,039
they said that they were going to have a

342
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,639
meeting and figure out what would happen

343
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,559
with the future of indo

344
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,319
every email i have sent to every email

345
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,239
address that exists that i know of for

346
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
indo-expo either the employees have

347
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,759
replied and said we don't work there

348
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,879
anymore they fired us anything that ends

349
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,120
in indo at indoexpo.com comes back under

350
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,159
undeliverable that email address does

351
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,919
not exist so right now uh it does not

352
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,439
look good for indo expo that is not an

353
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,519
official statement from anybody but

354
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,959
rosta jeff of ire genetics it does not

355
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,919
look good i don't have any faith in that

356
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,599
event happening so um the seeds that i

357
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,519
was making that were intended to go out

358
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,959
there they may come out a little bit

359
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,480
early they may come out sooner than

360
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,799
anticipated you guys may get to play

361
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,879
with them before we expected so that may

362
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,479
work out to your benefit

363
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,759
let's figure out what happens within ox

364
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,440
but we may just let him out early just

365
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,039

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,039
only for the patreon contribution that

490
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,560
means a lot to me i do like the funding

491
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,399
and the support that way but the

492
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,559
compliments and noticing that uh

493
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,399
professional support for the community

494
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,399
that that's [ __ ] tremendous that

495
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,198
means as much as the patreon funding

496
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,278
however do not stop the patreon funding

497
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,198
i love both of those it goes on it says

498
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:26,720
i have a question for you and hopefully

499
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,639
it will give you enough to talk about

500
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,959
for the show dude with the mood i'm in

501
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,639
and whatever i smoked i think just about

502
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,879
anything would get me talking for the

503
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,959
show so i appreciate this it says

504
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,519
what past issues of colorado's legal

505
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,078
cannabis program expanding would you

506
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,440
like to see other states avoid so it

507
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,758
looks like our friend is moving to

508
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,680
virginia to get going and he'd like to

509
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,320
find some advice on some pitfalls that

510
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,719
he can avoid in the newly emerging newly

511
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,639
developing legal market in virginia

512
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,160
that's a very good question since we set

513
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,480
a good framework here we've been doing

514
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,759
it for years uh we've got just a regular

515
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,120
industry now it just seems like

516
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,360
something that happens it's not even a

517
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,599
fancy industry or a fancy place to go

518
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,959
anymore we do have a good framework so

519
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,438
we have seen

520
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,240
the good and bad and the things to avoid

521
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,199
so

522
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,199
um other states what other states should

523
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,919
avoid the first thing i wrote down and

524
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,038
it's very simple um in colorado i

525
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,480
believe that we use too much packaging i

526
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:26,879
agree with having a safe product that

527
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,919
is tamper-free and kind of child

528
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,000
resistant but child proofing comes from

529
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,120
parenting and that happens at home

530
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,798
that's my opinion um we waste too much

531
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,599
plastic and too much [ __ ] in the

532
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,759
cannabis industry in my opinion if you

533
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,000
in a lot of instant instances if you buy

534
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,240
an edible if one is to buy an edible it

535
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
will come in a multi-layered cardboard

536
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,640
package one that you have to push two

537
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,038
pieces down on one end and pull a tab on

538
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,520
the other to pull one cardboard sleeve

539
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,440
out of another cardboard sleeve to slide

540
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,519
out another cardboard sleeve which will

541
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,759
contain a plastic

542
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,599
like a shell casing which then will

543
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,839
probably have a plastic film over it

544
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,719
which underneath that will then have

545
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,720
your small tiny chocolate product inside

546
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,960
uh it's a product the packaging is

547
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,519
bigger than an iphone for a product that

548
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,079
is smaller than a kitkat and in my

549
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,000
opinion that's a lot of [ __ ] plastic

550
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,399
a lot of paper a lot of packaging to go

551
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,359
into a landfill to

552
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,919
give the idea of child proofing uh child

553
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,279
resistant i said it a moment ago child

554
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,200
proofing is something that happens at

555
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,119
home the whiskey bottles all it takes to

556
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,480
open a whiskey bottle is a good turn we

557
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,479
don't have to do a bunch of crazy [ __ ]

558
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,839
for that the kids could definitely cause

559
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,200
more harm with the whiskey bottle that's

560
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,199
a different argument but i think we

561
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,519
waste too much [ __ ] packaging that's

562
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,279
one of the things i really think uh is a

563
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,200
problem not a huge problem but it's

564
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,879
something if you're developing the rules

565
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,679
you could skip that just don't don't

566
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,559
make us put a gram of concentrates in a

567
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,720
container in a box in a bag in a box

568
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,119
with a seal with a [ __ ] another lock

569
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,720
box on top of it with a combination code

570
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,079
that don't make us do so many steps it

571
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,600
should get ridiculous and it's very

572
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:08,960
wasteful i throw away a lot of [ __ ] um

573
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,038
then limits on purchases i do believe

574
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,480
that there are reasonable limits but i

575
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,079
think that some of the limits that

576
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,759
colorado and other places have been

577
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,918
trying to enforce on us

578
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,079
are a little bit ridiculous we are

579
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,759
adults i said it a moment ago i compared

580
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,359
it to alcohol we can buy all the whiskey

581
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,038
we want pour it down our head and if we

582
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,279
die that's our own fault

583
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,679
why can't i buy enough cannabis to smoke

584
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,599
myself into a stupor i can't kill myself

585
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,600
with cannabis i can smoke until i'm

586
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,199
hungry and need a nap and then i'm going

587
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,959
to wake up and be like damn i smoked all

588
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,480
my weed that's about the biggest problem

589
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,919
i've ever really caused smoking too much

590
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,599
weed i eat everything in the

591
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,880
refrigerator everything in the cupboards

592
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,959
and i don't feel good because of that

593
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,520
but i've never had a mean like hangover

594
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,279
and been violent from ganja so um the

595
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,960
limits are kind of silly a little bit i

596
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,000
understand some limits like you

597
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,360
shouldn't

598
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,798
sure why not why shouldn't you be able

599
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,879
to buy a pound if you want to go to the

600
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,639
dispensary and buy a pound maybe get one

601
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,080
i understand that's for redistribution

602
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,600
purposes but

603
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,599
if cannabis was legal everywhere and

604
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,519
there was a dispensary everywhere nobody

605
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,959
would be redistributing all right so

606
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,119
some of the limits i do think are a

607
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,519
little bit silly although i understand

608
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,639
the reason but other rules make those

609
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,558
reasons it's all a chain uh so something

610
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,159
i would really would like to have seen

611
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,158
and i think i'm doing this different uh

612
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,080
you said issues that we could have

613
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,679
avoided i'm kind of talking about things

614
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,720
like just small details but something

615
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,038
that we skipped ourselves on is a safe

616
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,159
place to consume our product i can buy

617
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,200
cannabis

618
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,720
um

619
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,000
i'm just kind of viewing my city as i

620
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,558
cruise around if i come from the

621
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,119
interstate i pass one two

622
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,000
if i keep going that way there's one two

623
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,239
there's

624
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,240
apothecary farms there's two out that i

625
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,200
could probably drive to 10 or 12

626
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,480
dispensaries within um seven or eight

627
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,038
minutes probably

628
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,960
but there's nowhere around here to smoke

629
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,519
any of the product that i buy there are

630
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,759
two really cool parks uh there's a state

631
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,918
park there's a skate park but it's

632
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,400
illegal to smoke at those places you

633
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,799
cannot consume cannabis at the city park

634
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,480
at the state park at the skate park ah

635
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,839
you can't smoke there it would be really

636
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,360
cool if we could i'd really enjoy i'm

637
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,038
not to say we don't but you're not

638
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,359
supposed to and if you get caught there

639
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,798
uh it is it's a it's like an actual

640
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,558
crime you actually can get in trouble

641
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:17,839
for within the city most of the time

642
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,440
they'll say hey you can't [ __ ] smoke

643
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,279
here dude but like at the city park the

644
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,558
skate park [ __ ] like that they will

645
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,079
definitely be a little bit more of a

646
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,879
[ __ ] so there's no safe place to

647
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,038
consume products i've got to come home

648
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
or i've got to go somewhere else and

649
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,960
kind of hide and smoke in the car which

650
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,480
if you're a tourist

651
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,798
that's not cool because what if you're

652
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,480
new and you can't smoke like i can and

653
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,400
you go by some dabs and you go park

654
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,759
somewhere and you hit a dab pin and now

655
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
when you're you're sitting in your car

656
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,519
just [ __ ] roasting you don't know

657
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,440
what to do where to go the only safe

658
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,038
place is that car right now if you're at

659
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,400
the park you can [ __ ] roll in the

660
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,400
roll around on the grass you can go down

661
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,759
the slide you're at the park it's way

662
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,919
more safe than just being stuck in the

663
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,599
car there's no driving to be done if

664
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,880
you're at the park you could uh you

665
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,079
could drive the bench and you're safe

666
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,480
you could feed the ducks and you'd be

667
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:05,839
cool but i think a place to consume

668
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,519
would be really cool um i i'm at home i

669
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,599
can smoke freely here but if there were

670
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,599
a place where i could go socialize and

671
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,839
consume cannabis with my friends freely

672
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,519
and openly i'd go there we would do the

673
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,759
podcast from there occasionally we'd

674
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,759
have groups of people there like just do

675
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,798
shows there have irie genetics parties

676
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,400
there uh it'd be cool it'd be just wait

677
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,839
but we have all those kind of drinking

678
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,840
establishments why can't we have

679
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,759
cannabis consumption establishments i

680
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,480
know i keep comparing this to cannabis

681
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,720
but in colorado we did do the uh

682
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,279
regulate cannabis-like alcohol model and

683
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,960
we're still not following that we treat

684
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,558
it way different as i said before i can

685
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,038
buy all the whiskey that i can [ __ ]

686
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,678
load into the car at the liquor store

687
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,440
but i can't buy all the cannabis so

688
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,038
there are some silly rules the next

689
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,720
thing i wrote down is delivery it's

690
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,480
2021. everything gets delivered now my

691
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,558
food comes to my front door

692
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,000
my all my amazon stuff comes everything

693
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,000
i want just comes to the front door i

694
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,679
barely have to leave the house to go buy

695
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,679
any products i can get my groceries

696
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,320
delivered i can rely on all that stuff

697
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,080
to show up except my cannabis in

698
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,359
california and a lot of other places you

699
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,599
can just call a service and they will

700
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,759
deliver your product to you i think that

701
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,000
delivery would be a great option

702
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,759
especially for a lot of people that

703
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,919
don't have transportation maybe some

704
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,599
people can't get on the bus can't get an

705
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,520
uber can't get a cab to go buy their

706
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,599
ganja it would just help them out just

707
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,918
to get that stuff delivered a lot of

708
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,158
times i already basically know what i

709
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,600
want from the dispensary that i frequent

710
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
i know which brand i want i know what

711
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,959
type of product i want i basically just

712
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,719
need to see what's on the list and see

713
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,240
what's available in those parameters and

714
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,919
pick the strain or the flavor or

715
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,798
whatever you want to call it i already

716
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,320
know because i've been to that

717
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,400
dispensary so many times i know my

718
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,399
favorite product i can online shop the

719
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,840
[ __ ] out of that i'm allowed eight grams

720
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,038
i just click two of these two of these

721
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,639
four of these uh 20 tip 30 whatever they

722
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,240
give me the option for there's probably

723
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,679
check mark boxes in the app that i built

724
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,599
in my head it looks just like grubhub

725
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,840
but it's dab hub or something you know

726
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,199
uh dub hub they just bring you some dubs

727
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,639
you just [ __ ] click it up and they

728
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,400
show up just like grubhub they knock on

729
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,840
your door they check your id make sure

730
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,759
the person that [ __ ] paid for it is

731
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,519
the one show an id and they go high five

732
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,519
roster jeff take a dab for me and you go

733
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,038
here's [ __ ] 20 bucks for a tip thank

734
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,480
you for being fast be careful out there

735
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:15,679
bro or

736
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,038
bring them in and give them a dab but

737
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,240
that sounds really creepy because after

738
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,640
you give people a dab they don't [ __ ]

739
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,200
leave but i think delivery would be

740
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,880
super cool now another thing

741
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,159
that we are really lacking here in

742
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,679
colorado and you're going to think i'm

743
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,919
crazy when i say this because i act like

744
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,440
we're the most uh progressive cannabis

745
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,440
state one of the most progressive

746
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,880
cannabis states we got the the rules and

747
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,919
all that stuff but we lack heavily in

748
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,480
education education is lacking in the

749
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,120
consumer education is lacking heavily in

750
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,759
the industry education is lacking heavy

751
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,038
heavily in legislature and council and

752
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,839
people that make the rules and

753
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,759
regulations there's a huge lack of

754
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,759
education i feel like a lot of the

755
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,359
people that are in the

756
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,879
the role of making the rules and

757
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,038
deciding the future of legal and

758
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,039
recreational cannabis are not involved

759
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,319
in cannabis in any way they don't

760
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,000
understand the growing but they're

761
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,759
making the rules of grows they don't

762
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
understand the distribution or

763
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,679
consumption but they're making the rules

764
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,278
for how it's distributed and who can buy

765
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,960
it how it's sold what increments what

766
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,319
kind of packaging and they don't know

767
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,200
what they're doing and they're [ __ ]

768
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:21,599
up the uh profitability the viability

769
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,679
the longevity the enjoyability of the

770
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,359
entire industry so you actually asked

771
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,120
for something to avoid but i think this

772
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,199
is something that you definitely

773
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,759
should try to see if you can include or

774
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,919
something as some sort of education or

775
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,240
include people that you know are good

776
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,480
growers good speakers like it'd be ideal

777
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,159
to find a guy like myself to go talk to

778
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,679
city council with you or be involved

779
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,600
with the rule making committee whatever

780
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,640
the committee is called whoever has

781
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:49,439
developed the uh your state enter your

782
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,960
state's name here the southern colorado

783
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,278
cannabis law

784
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,720
invention and establishment committee be

785
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,960
part of that committee whatever state

786
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,278
you're in get a grower like myself to be

787
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,038
on the grow committee get a spokesperson

788
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,558
like mike to be on the rule committee

789
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,158
when it comes to building a team we've

790
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,000
got to do our best to get people that

791
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,320
understand our goal and our goal is to

792
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,839
get real quality products to the people

793
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,759
that desire them if they're medical

794
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:13,839
consumers if they're recreational

795
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,000
consumers our goal is to get a high

796
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,480
quality product to those people

797
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,839
so if you have somebody on our team

798
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,599
helping make the rules make the

799
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,000
regulations helping make the guidelines

800
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,879
it will really help us out get quality

801
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,359
products uh easily accessible to people

802
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,360
that need them so i think education is

803
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,599
very important try to educate people and

804
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,519
then try to put educated people in the

805
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,599
correct positions

806
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,639
if not you end up with [ __ ] like we got

807
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,798
here uh we had things like an ex-sheriff

808
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,880
and an old pta teacher and a retired

809
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,158
city council person making rules on

810
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,320
cannabis and guess how many of those

811
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,840
people smoke cannabis none of them guess

812
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,319
how many people thought cannabis was the

813
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,000
[ __ ] devil all three of them so why

814
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,678

something they don't understand get

816
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,038
people that understand that know what

817
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,119
they're talking about in there mike did

818
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,879

819
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,199
wasn't officially city council mike was

820
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,640
just a citizen speaking a lot of times

821
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,640
they gave him the cold shoulder they

822
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,799
[ __ ] ignored mike big up to mike for

823
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,159

831
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,599
dreadlocks so i kind of stayed back and

832
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,359
just spoke i told mike like speaking

833
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,719
points and mike would come to me and say

834
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,000
hey like what do you think about this

835
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,440
and what would be better and i'd say bro

836
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,278
this would really [ __ ] up growing for

837
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,960
everybody this would work and then mike

838
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,278
would go to city council and explain my

839
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,480
case uh mike's got the i'm wearing a

840
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,079
collared shirt today but it's a little

841
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,519
chilly in here mike's got the button-up

842
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,439
shirt and the tie and the glasses and he

843
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,278
looks real good for speaking i look good

844
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,798
in the growing on the podcast but send

845
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,159
the right person for the right job

846
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,759
that's a big part of it get some

847
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,039
educated people

848
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,200
so those are some of the things i would

849
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,960
definitely change let me recap

850
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,360
too much packaging

851
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,720
limits on how much you can purchase

852
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,798
something i overlooked in my notes

853
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,079
limits on potency

854
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:10,558
um i see a lot of proposals to ban high

855
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,278
potency products in recreational and

856
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,440
medical markets that is nonsense that is

857
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,000
really silly try to battle that try to

858
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,480
make sure that doesn't happen uh we want

859
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,599
highly potent products would you rather

860
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,200
me

861
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,319
if you were a medical professional would

862
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,840
you rather me take six inhales of smoke

863
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,918
through my lungs or would you rather me

864
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,839
take two and get the relief that i'm

865
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,360
looking for i think higher potency

866
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,759
product where i only have to smoke two

867
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,759
drags of that product i'm going to feel

868
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,440
better my lungs won't get as much stress

869
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:43,519
than taking six pulls six drags six bone

870
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,919
rips higher potency product is how you

871
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,519
achieve that so potency levels then

872
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,919
smoke lounges delivery and education is

873
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,158
something i would definitely um try to

874
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,919
work toward now i know you said things

875
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,080
that you would avoid uh but those are

876
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,159
the things that i would include it's uh

877
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,240
i'm not sure exactly what to avoid at

878
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,760
this point um

879
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,120
i think i included what i wanted to say

880
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,480
for that part i kind of read i kind of

881
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,398
just twisted your question i made it my

882
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,000
own but hey that's how we do things all

883
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,839
right there is more of this it says

884
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,159
sacred tree organic farms would like to

885
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,079
do everything possible to progress the

886
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,520
industry for the eastern united states

887
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,519
that's a really good mission statement

888
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,759
don't ever forget that you said that it

889
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,599
says what has been a successful approach

890
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,839
to having these discussions with city

891
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,719
council members

892
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,558
etc um

893
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,640
i think i started really well by saying

894
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,398
send the right team member send somebody

895
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,159
that speaks well there's a person in our

896
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,599
community i'm not gonna i'm not trying

897
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,600
to be disrespectful to them i'm not

898
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,158
gonna say their name but at the end of

899
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,918
every sentence they say they say use

900
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,159
guys you know

901
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,919

902
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,919
they may hear this love you bro but it's

903
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,200
hard to [ __ ] take you seriously use

your ideas of what you want for the

934
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,319
industry and for the future and for your

935
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,159
business uh the city council people the

936
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,759
people that you're gonna talk to

937
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,919
although most of them are tainted by the

938
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,519
devil they are people and they'll hear

939
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,440
what you're saying as a person they're

940
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,120
gonna put that smug face on they're

941
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,960
gonna do the smug [ __ ] that city council

942
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,639
people do but when they get home and

943
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,558
they're chilling and they're thinking it

944
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,240
might hit them you know that one guy

945
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,720
spoke really well and the thing he said

946
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,079
about the economy making a lot of money

947
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,798
and putting the money back into the

948
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,319
schools and a lot allocating a portion

949
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:22,000
of our profit from the cannabis to

950
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,599
educate the school you know that really

951
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,119
does work out because that that school

952
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:26,319
is losing money and all the potholes on

953
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,000
that one street we could probably fill

954
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,079
those with the weed money too like if

955
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
you speak clearly honestly tell them

956
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,519
your objective and let them know that

957
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,278
we're people we're not drug addicts

958
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,120
we're not [ __ ] crazy people out there

959
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,038
trying to poison the kids and brainwash

960
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,038
the neighborhood we would like to

961
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,440
contribute to the community we offer a

962
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:46,000
service we offer a profitable service we

963
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,278
offer tax money they want our tax money

964
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,119
when you talk about money they're really

965
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,519
like that and when you let them know

966
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,439
that the black market is selling and

967
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,558
buying cannabis anyway and we can tax it

968
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,000
they start going you know they're

969
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:57,359
they're right they're right and then you

970
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,519
let them know that you can free up

971
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,439
police hours by not having them [ __ ]

972
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,359
with weed growers and weed smokers and

973
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,399
people with weed they the cops go

974
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,398
that'll give us a lot more time to

975
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,879
handle real crime they'll start seeing

976
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,599
and realizing that stuff so be open be

977
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,399
honest have a real conversation then

978
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,839
also be [ __ ] persistent they won't

979
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:17,678
hear you the first time they won't hear

980
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,959
you the third time they're like parents

981
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,038
you're gonna have to just keep telling

982
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,960
them and telling them and telling them

983
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,200
cannabis is what our city needs cannabis

984
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,360
is not a problem cannabis is the answer

985
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,960
with cannabis we could have solved this

986
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,319
that deficit you're looking for that way

987
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,159
you're looking to make money if we had

988
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,000
open dispensaries six months ago we'd be

989
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,159
making enough money just from their

990
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,558
licensing to cover the deficit we're

991
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,000
experiencing this quarter find ways to

992
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:41,200
spin it for them and show them that

993
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,558
cannabis is the way to help your

994
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,840
community

995
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:48,000
but um be professional uh be open and

996
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,199
honest and have conversations

997
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,880
then out of nowhere it happened here uh

998
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,720
one of the city council people will come

999
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,240
up to you and secretly privately be like

1000
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,319
hey i'm on your team but i'm not sure

1001
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,000
how to [ __ ] play the rest of my team

1002
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:01,678
but just just know that i've got your

1003
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,880

1004
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,559
city council and they'll help you

1005
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,399
they'll be your friend forever and then

1006
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,960
you'll be able to get info and do things

1007
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:11,439
like that and then build relationships

1008
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,960
uh it's not a race it's a marathon at

1009
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,880
the beginning of this everybody thought

1010
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,399
it was a gold rush they wanted to get in

1011
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,240
get rich get out uh stick around start

1012
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,239
uh you're from colorado you know how to

1013
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,359
do this go in and realize you're going

1014
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,960
to be here forever you've got good

1015
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,719
education you've got good ideas you

1016
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,720
probably have a good business structure

1017
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,480
go in and be an example set a standard

1018
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,640
and show them that you know how to do

1019
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,278
that i really think that showing that

1020
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,960
we've got business plans and paperwork

1021
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:40,558
and backing and that we're not just a

1022
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,919
bunch of potheads and drug addicts it's

1023
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,918
really important that we show that

1024
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,679
because that's their first normally when

1025
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,519
you go to a business meeting the

1026
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,038
business people are like how can we tell

1027
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,558
this [ __ ] we don't want to give

1028
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,879
them our money that's their main

1029
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,639
objective how can we tell them no what

1030
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,320
flaws can we find in their business plan

1031
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,919
how can we tell them that they need to

1032
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,200
go rework their business plan because

1033
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,559
their numbers are wrong and all this

1034
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,798
[ __ ] sucks that's what a business

1035
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,158
advisor and somebody a financial advisor

1036
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,319
that's one of their jobs they're paid to

1037
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,639
be a [ __ ] and crush your dreams when

1038
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,719
you go in there and you say marijuana

1039
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,720
first or cannabis first they don't even

1040
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,480
get to the part about looking at your

1041
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,398
numbers looking at your reports looking

1042
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,000
at your uh your performance sheets they

1043
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,598
don't care about any of that stuff they

1044
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,519
say cannabis get out of here drug addict

1045
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,119
pothead so you've got to beat that

1046
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,878
before you even get in the room you got

1047
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,800
to look sharp you got to be clean you

1048
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,480

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,119
but get somebody that can look good and

1053
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,280
build a relationship just know that

1054
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,720
you're going in there forever to build a

1055
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,560
long-term relationship you're not trying

1056
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,678
to pull the wool over somebody's eyes

1057
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,918

00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,759
media and business cards well um

1077
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:27,358
that's a really good question that's

1078
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,119
part of my consultation package so

1079
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,279
you're gonna get a freebie freebie here

1080
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,960
you guys take some notes social media is

1081
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,839
a big part of advertising it is free

1082
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,440
utilize the [ __ ] out of free advertising

1083
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:40,880
of course you've got to be careful

1084
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,480
because a lot of the big guys in the

1085
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,400
social media space don't like our

1086
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,599
products but if you're smart about it

1087
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,200
and you learn how to dance around the

1088
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,680
algorithms and dance around the terms of

1089
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,519
service and not do anything too stupid

1090
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,239
social media advertising is one of the

1091
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,639
best free advertising models there is

1092
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,000
it's great because it's free to you it's

1093
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,679
free to the consumer which means

1094
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,119
everybody's there i'm looking for

1095
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,559
sneakers i'm looking at drum sets i

1096
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,920
might be looking at butts to be quite

1097
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,078
honest with you but if you sneak your

1098
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,599
dispensary ad in there i'm gonna see it

1099
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,280
and it's gonna hypnotize me because my

1100
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,119
brain is looking at all the [ __ ] that i

1101
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,640
really want to see and now you just

1102
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,559
snuck your dispensary ad in there and

1103
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,239
it's kind of programmed it's in that

1104
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,838
that ooh good stuff ooh good stuff ooh

1105
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:20,159
look drums you look sneakers oh look

1106
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,239
drums you look sneakers dispensary it's

1107
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,639
hitting right in those good notes you

1108
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,159
just got right in the mix on accident so

1109
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,838
it's like a subliminal thing that i'm

1110
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,399
going to enjoy now that i'm interested

1111
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:31,920
in so that social media [ __ ] uh don't

1112
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,680
overlook that that's free and it's a

1113
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,039
great way of advertising but you ask for

1114
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,239
other stuff so

1115
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:40,639
um

1116
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:43,039
most cities have a local scene paper uh

1117
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,719
it's probably named something cool like

1118
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,239
in colorado springs it's called no in

1119
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,598
pueblo it's called the independent it

1120
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,759
might be the same thing in colorado

1121
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,200
springs the colorado springs independent

1122
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,560
in the denver area they've got the

1123
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,480
westward

1124
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,880
in your area it's probably called

1125
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,000
something cool also in hip it's a little

1126
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,920
it's a thin

1127
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,920
uh paper magazine local scene magazine

1128
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,838
usually in the back of that you can find

1129
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,880
ads for all of the dispensaries all of

1130
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,480
the weed doctors all the tattoo shops

1131
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,920
they advertise all the concerts that are

1132
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,280
coming up and the shows on the page

1133
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,320
right before that

1134
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,480
i think that's a great place to

1135
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,960
advertise a lot of people uh when

1136
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,400
colorado was new in the legal market we

1137
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,000

independent and just turn right to the

1139
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,559
back you just start backwards basically

1140
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,880
and look for the dispensary ads and the

1141
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,078
weed doctors and the tattoo shops and

1142
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,000
the concerts because i didn't care about

1143
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,599
all the articles and [ __ ] in the front i

1144
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,039

1206
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,920
[ __ ] apple store those are always

1207
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,358
weird to me i don't like those places

1208
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,320
it's a little bit too much for a weed

1209
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,960
store but set up the vibe that you like

1210
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,039
and the clientele will spread the word

1211

of mouth have amazing customer service

1212
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,759
go above and beyond don't nickel and

1213
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,159
dime your customers to death i've seen

1214
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,000
dispensaries just charge a little extra

1215
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,239
for every [ __ ] thing and it just

1216
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,079
feels cheap don't charge me for the

1217
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,838
container you're going to put my product

1218
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,000
in i have to have it it just feels like

1219
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,599
you're just like just [ __ ] give me

1220
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,280
that you already charged me 100 for the

1221
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,640
weed that two dollar [ __ ] container

1222
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,079
isn't gonna hurt you but it makes you

1223
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,838
look like an [ __ ] charging me two

1224
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,839
bucks for it so just throw my weed in

1225
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,279
the good container and smile and i'm

1226
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,119
gonna say ah they gave me this nice

1227
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,200
container for my weed it makes the

1228
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,599
experience [ __ ] way different than

1229
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,358
two bucks for a shitty container or wow

1230
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,720
look at this nice container they gave me

1231
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:23,440
for my weed and if they're selling it to

1232
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:25,919
me for two bucks it costs them 50 cents

1233
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,000
and that's changing the entire customer

1234
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,079
interaction the whole vibe of the

1235
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,400
experience so don't nickel and dime your

1236
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,400
people build the crowd that you want but

1237
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,240
you have the ability to cultivate the

1238
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,119
audience and the crowd and the customers

1239
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,639
that you want at your dispensary so

1240
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,280
use the kind of art that brings the

1241
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,279
crowd you want decorate the way you want

1242
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,800
i wouldn't be a good person to decorate

1243
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,560
the dispensary the waiting room the

1244
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,160
dispensary area the design of that that

1245
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,000
wouldn't be for me i'm kind of a

1246
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,000
streamlined dude i like straight lines i

1247
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,079
like a nice flow i don't need a lot of

1248
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,519
distracting colors if it were up to me

1249
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,039
the walls would probably be gray the

1250
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,039
floor would be [ __ ] white you just go

1251
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,960
and you buy weed and you'd go out if you

1252
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,039
let somebody with some some flow and

1253
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,880
some experience and some ideas do it it

1254
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,318
may be a more beautiful customer

1255
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,920
experience it may go in and say wow this

1256
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:11,519
place is decorated so nice i just want

1257
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,639
to go there to look at the art and then

1258
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,318
they'll go in and they'll say oh the

1259
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,078
shopping experience is set up so nice

1260
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:19,920
that i just want to come here compared

1261
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,160
to other places so have it set up well

1262
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,318
then cultivate the audience and the

1263
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,480
customer interaction that you want they

1264
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:28,239
will share their experience there

1265
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,679
everybody will tell everybody the

1266
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:31,118
experience they had there if the little

1267
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:32,879
old ladies enjoy it they're going to

1268
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,160
tell the other little old ladies if

1269
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,000
they're comfortable there you will get

1270
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,920
them if the bros like it they'll go

1271
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,440
there if the the snobs like it they'll

1272
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,720

1273
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,440

1274

try to have quality products that's one

1275
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,599
of the main things to focus on is

1276
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,000
quality products at a fair price don't

1277
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,318
do any shady shifty [ __ ] then have

1278
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,838
people with experience and education

1279
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:56,639

he's getting quite popular he's doing a

1295
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,079
lot of shows the brand irie genetics is

1296
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,719
currently sponsoring jamiri morgan on a

1297
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,359
few shows of this tour so the irie

1298
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,519
genetics banner will be hanging on the

1299
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,358
side of the stage while the band plays

1300
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,759
so that is a creative way of advertising

1301
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:41,598
my logo is on the stage while the reggae

1302
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,520
band is playing they're wearing my

1303
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,519
shirts they've got my stickers and my

1304
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,519
advertising at their booth what more

1305
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,199
could you ask for things like that will

1306
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,358
really help you out that is creative

1307
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,039
advertising of course that sort of stuff

1308
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:54,639
uh takes you've got to cultivate

1309
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,960
relationships and there's a fee for

1310
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,519
stuff like that but creative advertising

1311
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,679
is a good way for people to see you then

1312
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,159
don't forget about the cliche and very

1313
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,598
common applications and websites that

1314
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,199
are very popular they don't pay me to

1315
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,720
talk about them they don't give me any

1316
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,480
love they don't give me any fist bumps

1317
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,399
but don't forget about things like

1318
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,199
leafly and weed maps a lot of people are

1319
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,079
big haters on those applications

1320
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:20,239
of those applications but so many people

1321
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,839
view those apps on a daily basis that if

1322
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,159
you don't put your dispensary and your

1323
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,559
products there you're probably missing

1324
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:29,519
something big advice if you put your

1325
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:32,159
dispensary on any of those services

1326
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,960
please update the damn menu if your menu

1327
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:37,039
is updated on maybe like every four hour

1328
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,720
basis it shouldn't be that hard i

1329
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,800
understand i've worked at a dispensary

1330
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:42,719
before you can have a person responsible

1331
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,318
for doing that an assistant manager

1332
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,759
there's somebody that loves to sit there

1333
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,880
and play on the [ __ ] computer all day

1334
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,720
make it their job update that inventory

1335
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,318
if i can go on your weed maps and click

1336
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,559
and see that you have got the products i

1337
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,639
want in stock versus i wonder if they've

1338
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,078
got what i want i'm going to the place

1339
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,480
where i can look on weed maps and it

1340
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,599
says we have got this in stock i will go

1341
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,119
there first so update your weed maps

1342
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,519
that sounds silly that sounds like a

1343
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,880
very minor detail but as a consumer i've

1344
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,800
worked on both sides of the counter i've

1345
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,240
been i'm a been a consumer and i've been

1346
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,480
a bud tender i've been a dispensary

1347
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,639
manager i've been a grower i've been a

1348
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,280
kid i've been all over the weed industry

1349
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:20,799
um and part of my job was recon when we

1350
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,280
were building dispensaries and getting

1351
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,359
started one of the first places i worked

1352
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,960
on my day off i would go to other

1353
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,279
dispensaries and just see what they're

1354
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,280
doing how it's set up what can i what do

1355
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,960
i love and what do i not love about this

1356
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,040
dispensary what can i borrow from this

1357
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,480
idea to make my place better so i've

1358
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,400
been to a lot of places i've been on

1359
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,960
both sides of the counter i think i've

1360
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,720
got a lot of experience but cultivate

1361
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,720
the audience you want to bring create

1362
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,959
the vibe you want to bring and it sounds

1363
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,639
like you're a very smart person quality

1364
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,199
products and good customer service are

1365
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,879
the bottom line that's what wins if the

1366
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,719
people want to go there because you're

1367
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,640
cool and you're nice and the products

1368
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,399
are quality they'll go there if you've

1369
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,920
got one you'll get some people if you've

1370
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,000
got the other you'll get some people but

1371
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,079
if you've got quality products and great

1372
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,559
customer service people will flock to

1373
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,119
your place and word of mouth will make

1374
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,078
that happen very easily and social media

1375
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,680
is

1376
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,440
that's almost word of mouth right now

1377
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,759
because people talk more on social media

1378
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,880
than we do in person i talk to way more

1379
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,960
people on my phone than i do in the in

1380
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,800
public in person on a daily basis which

1381
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,880
as i'm saying that that sounds wrong and

1382
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,280
feels weird but that's the reality i can

1383
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,480
post something and between all the

1384
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,599
different accounts and services that

1385
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,280
i've got on cannabis i've got over 60

1386
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,200
000 followers i can post something and

1387
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,800
60 000 people are going to see it and

1388
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,159
it's free on instagram i've got 32 000

1389
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,318
followers and i can post something and

1390
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,920
people will see it and it's free so

1391
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,000
that's word of mouth that's social media

1392
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,720
advertising please do not discredit that

1393
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,318
even though you did say no social media

1394
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:51,598
all right i think i've been rambling on

1395
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:53,199
this message for a long time this

1396
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,519
actually may be the only message of this

1397
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,439
podcast uh the last part of the message

1398
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,960
says thank you for all you do and

1399
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,960

you started she's a champ um

1424
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,440
something that i did not mention

1425
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,078
if you'd like to be successful in the

1426
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,358
cannabis space right now this is going

1427
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,480
to be the last ramble because i don't i

1428
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:57,759
didn't write this down and i just

1429
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,079
thought that this was super important as

1430
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,400
we were talking about uh myself mike and

1431
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,480
my other cons consultation uh what is it

1432
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,680
consultant friend um

1433
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,159
right now something that i think is

1434
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:10,719
really important is owning or at least

1435
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,519
being in charge or uh probably owning i

1436
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,959
guess

1437
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:17,199
all of all aspects of your facility you

1438
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,639
need the grow you need the extraction

1439
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,480
you need the processing and the

1440
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,239
dispensaries so that way there's no

1441
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,318
that's all your chain it's from seed to

1442
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,399
sale it is all yours vertical

1443
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:28,480
integration is what i'm trying to say

1444
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,920
the best way to do it is to control all

1445
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:34,000
aspects of the entire system the grow

1446
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,159
the processing uh if you can do the

1447
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,440
processing that is the best deal but i

1448
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,118
understand that's a whole other license

1449
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,079
a whole nother thing if you could do the

1450
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,480
grow the processing uh the extraction

1451
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,000
and the sales you are going to win but

1452
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,000
if you can own as many pieces of that

1453
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,239
chain as possible that is how you set

1454
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,960
yourself up for maximum success it would

1455
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,358
be ideal to own the grow the processing

1456
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,960
the edibles company and the dispensary

1457
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,279
sometimes i do understand we've either

1458
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,679
got a process or have somebody else make

1459
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,839
edibles for us or buy the edibles but

1460
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,679
the idea is to get 70

1461
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:07,199
of your own products on your shelf and

1462
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,919
be sustainable so you've got to get the

1463
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,639
grow operating at maximum speed to

1464
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,280
sustain you to get 70 of your products

1465
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,558
from that grow onto your shelf so you

1466
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,319
got to figure out how much you sell

1467
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,599
every two months every three months

1468
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,358
figure out how much that grow can

1469
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,359
produce every two or three months get it

1470
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,039
up to speed get a nice rhythm to where

1471
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,119
you've got product in the right areas at

1472
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,519
all times there's no shortages keep in

1473
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,440
mind that 710 and 420 come up and you're

1474
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,838
gonna sell record amounts of wheat in

1475
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,318
those weeks got to plan ahead i think

1476
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,400
i'm rambling now but own everything that

1477
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,558
you can the entire chain vertical

1478
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,838
integration that is the key i do

1479
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,280
understand if you've got to have other

1480
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,920
people step in and help out with some

1481
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,559
parts but the most profitable way is

1482
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,159
vertical integration control all aspects

1483
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,400
of your product where it comes from and

1484
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,679
where it goes from seed to sale all

1485
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,200
right so let's get back to wrapping this

1486
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,118
one up it does again say thank you for

1487
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,799
all you do hopefully this can make it on

1488
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,440
the show bro it more than made it on the

1489
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,800
show this was the entire show and i'm

1490
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,800
sure that we did help out some other

1491
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,400
growers because a lot of people will be

1492
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,800
moving to new states and there will be

1493
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,400
new states coming online that are legal

1494
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,119
