00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,240
have a website that website of course is

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,399
IR genetics.com on that website there's

41
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,000
a row of tabs one of those tabs does say

42
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,759
grow help or grow questions if you send

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,840

44
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,560
question here on the podcast I will send

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,560

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,159

49

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,079
sleepwalking all week the question goes

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,600
a little bit like this it says hey rosta

52
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:01,718
Jeff I love you I love the podcast and I

53
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,158
love your genetics bro that is a lot of

54
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:04,798
love don't even know you but if you're

55
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,079
sending that much love I already know I

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,080
can love you back it says I have a

57
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,038
question about the new clone drop you've

58
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,280
been doing I'm curious what the

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,000
acclamation procedure is for your

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,640
shipped clones I'm betting a lot of the

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,080
lucky folks who are able to score would

62
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,479
appreciate this info U then he says

63
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,360
unfortunately I wasn't able to get one

64
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,238
um yes I do have a solution for that it

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,599
says I know other sellers have specific

66
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,759
programs for keeping them alive and

67
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,439
slowly adjusting them what is yours

68
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,399
thanks for everything all right so this

69
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,439
is referring to many people may be

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
confused what this uh listener viewer is

71
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,959
talking about I recently did a little

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,040
drop of lemon Jeffrey rooted clones on

73
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,840
IED direct.com that's right I was able

74
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,359
to sell a few clones on iir and I do

75
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,640
plan to do that again uh this listener

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
said they were not able to get the

77
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,279
Clones they did sell out quite quickly

78
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
uh the way to make sure you get updates

79
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,640
when those clones are available is to go

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,719
to the website the same website where

81
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,158
you send in those questions I

82
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,318
genetics.com go to about three quarters

83
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,199
of the way down at the bottom of the

84
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,399
page there's a tab that says stay up to

85
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,238
date a little picture of a mailbox if

86
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,640
you type in your email address when I do

87
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,439
clone drops I will send out a newsletter

88
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,238
and everybody will get a newsletter when

89
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,318
those clones are coming out you can stay

90
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,680
up to date and you can get those clones

91
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,679
also patreon does get the first heads up

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,480
on new drops restocks and sometimes

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,920
random coupon codes so check out

94
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,719
patreon.com fromyou heart that also is

95
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,479
on IR genetics.com that's like four

96
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,519
websites I've mentioned in 30 seconds I

97
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:34,238
should chill out and stay focused over

98
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,680
here so my point is if you want to know

99
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,438
when those clones come out make sure you

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,400
join the newsletter that way you'll get

101
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:41,639
an update or of course patreon does get

102
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,400
the first heads up now let's address the

103
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,079
main part of the question yes I am

104
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,360
shipping clones and you can buy them off

105
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,040
of I direct.com but then they arrive and

106
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,480
what do you do with them how do I take

107
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,878
care of them that is a very good

108
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,158
question they're all sent via Priority

109
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,239
Mail Express sometimes I change up the

110
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,959
boxes depending on what is available but

111
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,878
they are always sent Priority Mail

112
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,280
Express so they get to you very quickly

113
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:04,959
now when your package arrives I do

114
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,479
recommend that you bring it indoors and

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,920
let it adjust to room temperature if it

116
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,598
was on the truck and it's really hot

117
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,318
outside you don't want to open that

118
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:14,399
package when the the plant inside there

119
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,000
is really hot and open it into a cool

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,399
room and the opposite if it's really

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,478
cold don't open it into a warm dry room

122
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,439
let that box sit and adjust to the room

123
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,159
for a little while let it adjust and get

124
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,160
to room temperature then when you open

125
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,320
it you will find that there is a baggie

126
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
a one gallon baggie inside of that box

127
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,959
it's probably taped to the the box is

128
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,759
what I've begun doing uh it's the most

129
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,279
secure and costeffective way to ship

130
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,240
these clones just tape it right to the

131
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,399
box so there's a big baggie in it's

132
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,400
gently taped to the Box remove that tape

133
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:43,719
get that big baggie out unroll that it's

134
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,478
just wrapped up once or twice unfold it

135
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,440
open that up reach inside you will find

136
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,279
the plant right inside of there at the

137
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,038
bottom of that plant are very nice roots

138
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,719
that have grown out I took a paper towel

139
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:54,759
and I moistened it and I gently wrapped

140
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,520
it around those roots it's just wrapped

141
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,800
around just very gently wrapped it's not

142
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,120
folded up too technically uh it's just a

143
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,680
real nice gentle wrap you can probably

144
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,360
unwrap it and then unfold it and it

145
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,560
should come right off the roots will be

146
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,479
very robust and very healthy the plants

147
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,680
that I sent are very healthy plants so

148
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,079
uh carefully unwrap that paper towel

149
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,600
sometimes they're going to get stuck if

150
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,359
it gets stuck put a little water on

151
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,639
there you just pour a little bottled

152
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,680
water on there you could spray some

153
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,400
water on there if you prefer get it wet

154
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,160
that paper towel should come right off

155
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,560
if it doesn't it's not a big deal gently

156
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,240
plant that paper towel and those roots I

157
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,038
would recommend you remove the excess

158
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,280
paper towel as much as you can whatever

159
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,639
stuck you can leave it there if you're

160
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,318
afraid to to damage those roots but then

161
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,680
gently plant that paper towel the

162
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,879
remnants and The Roots right into your

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,519
medium if you're going to soilless mix

164
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:44,279
uh living soil uh cocoa you can just put

165
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,359
that paper towel right in there it's

166
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,318
very biodegradable it will biodegrade

167
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,680
quite quickly and it will not cause you

168
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,919
any problems so just put minimal paper

169
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,519
towel in there I'm not saying throw the

170
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,038
whole thing in there but if some of it

171
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,839
gets stuck you can trim around it you

172
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,478
can pick it off a little bit of paper

173
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:00,560
towel will not cause you any problems

174
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,318
when you plant that so the first step is

175
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,038
getting it out of the box carefully open

176
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,598
that box up get the the baggie out of

177
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,038
there open up the baggie get the plant

178
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:10,800
out carefully remove that bottom baggie

179
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,598
uh so I wrapped it in a paper towel and

180
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,160
then I put another baggie over that to

181
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:16,000
keep that secure to keep that moisture

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,759
in there so just gently remove that

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,279
second that second baggie take the paper

184
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,199
towel off uh then get your medium what I

185
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,279
recommend what I would do uh these

186
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,319
clones are ready for this I would get a

187
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,000
Solo Cup I buy a bunch of beer cups when

188
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,160
I do this I just go buy a stack of beer

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
cups from the store uh just get like 50

190
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,960
of them for a good price keep them on a

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,680
shelf I've always got them available I

192
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,879
cut holes in the bottom with my scissors

193
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,079
so that way I've got three drainage

194
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,918
holes in the bottom of my beer cup scoop

195
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,079
up some soil or soilless mix whatever

196
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,560
you're using pack it in there not tight

197
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,079
but not loose either you want it packed

198
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,639
in there kind of firm then it will make

199
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,399
a little cone shape on the top of the

200
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,038
soil so the the cup is round there's

201
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,120
just a little cone I can't figure out

202
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,918
how to describe that because just a cone

203
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,720
inside and here we go I'll grab a bottle

204
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,079
let me get a prop so uh I will make this

205
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,560
is a little more pointy than I would

206
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,519
prefer but we make a little cone shape

207
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,240
out of the soil then what I try to do is

208
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,439
take the roots those roots of that clone

209
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,079
are kind of shape imagine that my white

210
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,000
fingers are those roots I want to spread

211
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,918
them over the top of that cone so they

212
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,160
don't Bunch up inside of that new medium

213
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:14,598
I don't want them tightened up in there

214
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,759
I want to give them an opportunity to

215
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:18,800
spread and grow spread your roots that's

216
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,400
what you want them to do so I make that

217
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,560
little cone shape and I just lower those

218
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,560
roots onto there and hope that it

219
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,800
spreads out a little bit uh you'll get

220
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,120
good at it you'll get better at it the

221
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,960
more you do I know you've only got one

222
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,360
clone right now but over time you'll

223
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,758
practice this and you will get good at

224
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,919
it so I will take that oh one one thing

225
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,960
I forgot that soil is already moistened

226
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,918
once I filled that cup I have moistened

227
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,478
it what is in the water that I fed it I

228
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,038
definitely recommend we use some sort of

229
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,279
micos when you're potting these new

230
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,478
clones uh there are a couple advantages

231
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,799
of this uh the First Advantage is those

232
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,240
microbes will help speed up that plant

233
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,520
growth that root growth will go

234
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,038
explosive when the recharge or the

235
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,038
powdered micos or whatever other product

236
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:58,038
you do choose to use the the great white

237
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:59,680
the Orca whatever product you choose

238
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:01,399
when that hits those roots they will

239
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,280
explode when that comes in contact with

240
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,120
the roots and the water that will make

241
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,959
those roots start to grow very rapidly

242
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,120
so you'll get rapid root development

243
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,878
which will lead to big fat healthy plant

244
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,800
development and the other advantage to

245
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,759
using these microbes is once you build

246
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,360
up these colonies of beneficial bacteria

247
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,720
that are good for the plants the proper

248
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,400
microbes uh those microbes will fight

249
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,960
off uh the bad microbes the bad funguses

250
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,000
that try to come around anything that

251
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,839
will be detrimental to the plant any

252
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,879
pathogens will be prevented by those

253
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,079
beneficial microbes so build up some

254
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,120
colonies get those going start with that

255
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,038
very first watering a lot of the good

256
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,799
soils and soilless mixes we are buying

257
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,759
already come with that in there but add

258
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,759
a little recharge like I said add a

259
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,278
little uh what's it called Great White

260
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,158
uh a little bit of the cheap micos a

261
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:45,480
little bit of azos whatever micro

262
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,679
products you can add in there let's get

263
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,440
them in there and get these plants a

264
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,599
little bit of a head start or even a

265
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,320
little bit of a recharge if you will

266
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,920
shout out to Scotty reel all right so

267
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,200
we've got our so these plants are wet

268
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,679
with our micro product in there uh we've

269
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,480
got a little cone shape at the top of

270
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,439
the cup I'm going to spread those roots

271
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,278
right over that and I'm going to grab

272
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,160
another about a half a handful of dirt

273
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,759
and just set it set it right on top of

274
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,480
that and just tap it down a little bit

275
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,278
just give it a little tap just so that

276
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,839
the plant just enough to hold the plant

277
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,759
upright and then those roots can grow

278
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,200
down and we're not squishing any Roots

279
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:16,639
then I kind of spin that that cup uh

280
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
I've got a really smooth technique where

281
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,360
I just take two fingers and tap the dirt

282
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,920
down and spin the cup and it only takes

283
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,639
me a couple of seconds to pack all that

284
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,759
dirt perfectly tight we want it pressed

285
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,039
in firmly but we don't want to squish

286
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,159
the roots and we want to allow room for

287
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,480
that plant to grow uh we need those

288
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,519
roots to be able to work their way

289
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,879
through that soil uh we want it kind of

290
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,600
firm not too tight not loose it's really

291
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,360
hard to describe once you see that

292
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,839
perfect root growth you'll understand

293
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,159
once you water it all in and it starts

294
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,040
to dry and compact by that next watering

295
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,919
that's right about where you want it so

296
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,278
uh when you water it in Pay uh pay

297
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,000
attention it's going to start to dry

298
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,159
watch how it settles push that dirt in

299
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,480
and then maybe add more soil soil this

300
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,439
makes whatever you're using don't be

301
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,000
afraid to top it off after a day or two

302
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,600
after a watering or two uh so we've got

303
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,879
our plan it's potted now it's in this

304
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,399
little cup then I would put it under a

305
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,559
veg light I would introduce it slowly

306
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,759
honestly I recommend you do this with me

307
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,838
too um I always isolate and uh what's

308
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,799
the word I'm looking for there's a word

309
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,320
um quarantine a clone my brain could not

310
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,719
think of quarantine you guys I don't

311
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
have any notes I've got very minimal

312
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,079
notes this is all just coming out of

313
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,360
what I would do I would quarantine this

314
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:25,679
clone anytime I get a clone from a

315
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,680
friend a bro a homie a clone service a

316
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,639
clone shipper any clone that comes in it

317
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,838
honestly sits right here on this table

318
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,639
for several days so I can observe it the

319
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,560
day it comes in it gets treated with

320
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,399
nuclear uh pesticides I apply some crazy

321
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,119
[ __ ] to it I'm not going to smoke that

322
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,159
plant it's going to become a mom I need

323
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,919
to Nuke it and make sure there are no

324
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,039
bugs on that plant so as soon as it

325
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,879
comes in It Gets Zapped and then it sits

326
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,599
right here on this table for three to

327
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,159
five days where I can observe it I'll

328
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,879
spray it on that first day I'll spray it

329
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,480
on that third day then I'll give it a

330
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,320
good observation and make sure there are

331
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,959
no bugs on there before it even makes it

332
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,920
into general population uh as a breeder

333
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,439
as a person who uses my plants as a

334
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,399
business I cannot risk bringing a

335
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,720
pathogen a pest into my garden I have to

336
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,519
be very careful so that plant sits right

337
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,440
here I recommend to you guys even if

338
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,879
it's coming from me bro I'm a reputable

339
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,440
clone Source but still quarantine that

340
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,958
bad [ __ ] make sure there are no

341
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,240
problems just make that your standard

342
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,919
operating procedure no matter who sends

343
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,440
you the Clones bro pretty girls have

344
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,439
problems too uh make sure that the Clone

345
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,440
is clean so clean that clone up

346
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,880
quarantine it isolate it now at this

347
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,760
point I would recommend adding some

348
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,120
light even if it's just in this room I'm

349
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,639
going to add some light to it I've got a

350
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,959
pretty good light right up above me that

351
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,919
light puts off quite a bit of light

352
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,958
enough to keep a clone alive sometimes

353
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,399
I'll crank up the studio lights also

354
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,879
there's a window right behind me I can

355
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,958
put some sunshine on this clone if I

356
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,679
need to I just need enough light to keep

357
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,799
it going keep it growing keep it healthy

358
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,159
it's been in the dark for several days

359
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,439
uh you don't want to go blasting it

360
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:52,759
immediately with super intense veg light

361
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
uh just set it on the table give it a

362
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:56,759
little light let it adjust give it a few

363
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
days it will be fine if that plant

364
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,360
starts to look a little bit droopy a

365
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,440
little bit sad

366
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,399
sometimes they will it's just

367
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,480
environment and plants its nature

368
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,799
sometimes they're going to look a little

369
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,800
bit sad if it looks droopy if it looks

370
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,559
pissed off I recommend getting a baggie

371
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,559
like a sandwich baggie or the little bit

372
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,078
bigger than a sandwich baggie and just

373
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,719
make a little Dome and just slide it

374
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,278
right over it and that way you can kind

375
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,759
of control the amount of humidity that's

376
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,278
in there and the plant won't be

377
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,439
subjected to so much air flow it'll be

378
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,240
able to develop more humidity inside

379
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,320
that Dome while it's generating its

380
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,919
roots and getting its life started so if

381
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,040
it's starting to look a little bit sad a

382
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,479
little bit pissy uh just take a baggie

383
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:33,240
slide it right over the top of that

384
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,120
plant if you really want to secure it

385
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,560
use a rubber band at the bottom of that

386
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,480
usually not even necessary you could

387
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,838
just slide it right over uh that'll trap

388
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,839
enough moisture in there that will help

389
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,360
out your problems so we've gotten it out

390
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,040
of the box we've built our little

391
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,000
pyramid we've moistened the water built

392
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,159
our pyramid drop the plant on top of

393
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,399
there spread the roots uh filled up on

394
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:53,278
top of it so our plant's nice and sturdy

395
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,759
uh label that cup that's something that

396
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,879
we should definitely do you've got this

397
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,480
cup right your bright red cup right on

398
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,320
there the name of the strain right now

399
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,879
just write it real big on there so

400
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,360
there's no chance to forget maybe you

401
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,519
get another clone in a couple days you

402
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,600
don't want to mix them up maybe you

403
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,278
already have more label this bad [ __ ]

404
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,240
so that way you paid money for it you do

405
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,039
not want to lose it get it confused so

406
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,360
we got a labeled clone and a cup it's

407
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,838
back filled it looks good uh we have

408
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,680
treated it for bugs if you want to um if

409
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,399
you want to spray it I would recommend

410
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,519
spray it don't don't just think just

411
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,159
because it came from me I'm 99.9% sure

412
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,399
it's clean but guess what everybody

413
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,879
that's given me a clone that had bugs on

414
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,919
it said I'm 99% sure it's clean it's

415
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,759
that one [ __ ] percent that'll get you

416
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,360
bro so uh make sure that's it's clean

417
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,759
spray it quarantine it uh if it starts

418
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,759
to look sad put a little baggie over it

419
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,360
uh put uh I put the big quart bag it's

420
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,360
not a sandwich I think it's a quart size

421
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,039
bag slide that right over the top if you

422
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,039
need to generate more humidity in that

423
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,719
Dome more light and more heat is the way

424
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:51,519
to generate that humidity get a light

425
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,160
above it uh that will start to bring the

426
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,278
water up toward that light that will

427
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,519
help you get some humidity in there so

428
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,559
uh you've got your plant you got your

429
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,320
little humidity Dome on there I'm going

430
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,239
to check my notes and see what else I

431
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,680
wrote down that we need to cover here

432
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,440
I'm learning my uh shipping o sop I'm

433
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,159
getting pretty good at it the roots are

434
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,639
wrapped in a paper towel and then double

435
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,319
secured in two baggies oh I use an easy

436
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,000
cloner uh that's something that I'm

437
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,399
going to mention here these come out of

438
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,958
an easy cloner so the whole time once

439
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,720
the plant is cut as a clone it never

440
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,559
goes under a dome so these didn't

441
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,079
require any hardening off time or

442
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,638
whatever you call that when you have to

443
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,319
open the Dome and let those clones

444
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,839
adjust that's why I'm pretty sure that

445
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,120
they should be pretty Hardy when they

446
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,000
come out of that baggie when you get

447
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,480
them that's why I say only sometimes

448
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,440
they're going to need a baggie to help

449
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,839
themselves rejuvenate but also they're

450
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,959
coming out of an easy cloner so the

451
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,240
roots are just exposed and hanging uh

452
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,559
but they're super healthy and I keep

453
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,639
them secure I just want you to know what

454
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,399
to expect uh if you do think about

455
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,959
ordering uh a clone from me uh then it

456
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,440
says carefully pot um if the roots are

457
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,559
let's see if the if the roots are stuck

458
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,120
you can bury the paper towel uh light

459
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,319
feeding lots of microbes veg light and

460
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,959
then slowly increase that light I didn't

461
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,000
even write down quarantine on my notes

462
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,719
here so after 3 to 5 days once that

463
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,039
plant shows you that there's no bugs on

464
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,759
it then slowly introduce it to that veg

465
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,519
light if you've got a a little LED or a

466
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,480
T5 light that'll be perfect for this

467
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,360
little plant slowly introduce it I just

468
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,839
don't want you to burn shock confuse

469
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,680
this plant by putting it under a super

470
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,320
bright light and frying it uh I know

471
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,239
that you just paid some uh some funds

472
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,720
for it so I want it to be a success I

473
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,720
want you to succeed with the products

474
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,120
you buy from me uh if that's a clone if

475
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,519
it's a seed I want success for you uh I

476
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,519
sell you seeds and then I teach you how

477
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,278
to take clones so I want you to be

478
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,839
self-sufficient once you've got a clone

479
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,439
or some seeds to do that with uh let me

480
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,639
make sure I covered everything I'm 99.9%

481
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,680
sure but like I said it's always that 1%

482
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,318
dude um I think we covered it's only

483
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,479
0.1% at that point right I know

484
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,000
somebody's going to correct me and I

485
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,039
know who it will be um I think I covered

486
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,839
that one my dude Sleepwalker uh thank

487
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,240
you for the great question everybody out

488
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,639
there I hope you enjoyed that quick

489
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,759
little sop on how to take care of those

490
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,799
brand new clones when I do ship them to

491
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,079
you um Alo if you're trying to get on

492
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,039
that waiting list if you're trying to

493
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,879
get the updates on how to get the Clones

494
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,599
go to IR genetics.com there's a part at

495
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,439
the bottom it says join the mailing list

496
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,240
or stay up to date type in your email

497
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,839
address when I put out new clones I will

498
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,198
send out an email that says lemon

499
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:18,519
Jeffrey clones are available uh I

500
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,359
honestly cut some let's see today is uh

501
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,679
Saturday is when this episode comes out

502
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,959
so give me 12 days from Saturday that's

503
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,000
like a weird 80s movie title 12 days

504
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,359
from Saturday but that's about when

505
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,600
those clones should start start popping

506
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,240
Roots there will be some lemon Jeff and

507
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,079
there will be some other surprises that

508
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,879
I'll start talking about more as soon as

509
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,198
I see the little roots and my friend

510
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,759
Sleepwalker make sure you check your

511
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,719
inbox because you've got a coupon code

512
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,759
for a free pack of seeds at iy

513
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,920
direct.com all right we're going to keep

514
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,800
this rambly podcast moving I do have

515
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,000
another email here in front of me this

516
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,719
one also came from that growel tab at

517
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,120
edirect tocom before I read this I do

518
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,639

it's free and it just takes a second all

521
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,560
right this question came from our new

522
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:05,599
friend Leo and it says Hey Rasta Jeff

523
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:07,720
when making seeds do you look for the

524
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,759
same attributes in your reversal plant

525
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,400
as you would a stud male this is a very

526
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:14,640
good question people know that I love

527
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,519
making feminized seeds I'm also known

528
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,799
for making very high quality regular

529
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:21,038
seeds uh those require different type of

530
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,240
pollen donors so it is a different hunt

531
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,959
when I'm hunting for the femin stuff uh

532
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,400
I get to smoke those plants I get to see

533
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,360
what they taste like I get to see what

534
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
the buzz is like I get to experience

535
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,759
that plant uh in a different way than I

536
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,080
do those male plants so it's kind of uh

537
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,798
it's like I've already got the flavor I

538
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,199
keep doing this Chef kiss motion with my

539
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:38,879
hand I already know what that plant

540
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,798
should taste like and what that flavor

541
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,160
should uh contribute to the breeding so

542
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,720
it's a little bit of a head start it's a

543
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,000
little bit of a I don't know it's like I

544
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,440
already know what chocolate tastes like

545
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,720
so if I want to cook something or bake

546
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,000
something I know when and where and

547
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,079
where not to use chocolate so that's

548
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,279
also how breeding works with fem seeds

549
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,439
all right let me get to the part of the

550
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,918
qu let me get to the answer here um a

551
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,120
reversal if I'm selecting uh so if I'm

552
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,640
selecting a male plant for pollination

553
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,599
um I will accept a nine out of a 10 I

554
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,240
would prefer on a scale of 1 to 10 I

555
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,839
would prefer a 10 but a 10 to me is

556
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,400
really hard to attain that is uh that is

557
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,359
that's like the most perfect plant you

558
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,000
could ever find and I found nearly

559
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,399
perfect plants but there's always I'm

560
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,839
picky dude I'm picky so if I would say

561
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,000
that a male plant has to be a nine and

562
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:24,759
that is in plant growth shape structure

563
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,200
flowering time amount of pollen that it

564
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,599
makes uh the amount of time it takes to

565
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,159
make that pollen uh the flowering time

566
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,918
of that male because I let them go nine

567
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,799
or 10 weeks and let them I see what they

568
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,640
do I observe what those flower clusters

569
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,759
do do they make colors how much water

570
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,520
does it take does it is it an

571
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,798
overdrinker is it an under Drinker how

572
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,798
much feed does it like I pay attention

573
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,599
to a lot of things when it comes to

574
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,000
selecting a male plant uh let me make

575
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:53,279
sure I check my notes Here Yeah growth

576
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,319
traits um so uh uh what are we shape

577
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,918
structure flower time uh flower density

578
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,480
um that matters on the mail end the

579
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,360
female so all these things matter when

580
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,159
it comes to selecting a male plant now

581
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,798
that male plant can be a nine but when

582
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:11,200
it comes to selecting a reversal I need

583
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:13,798
a 10 and I know that sounds wild if I'm

584
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,640
that picky on my male plants uh how can

585
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,639
I be that extra picky on the females

586
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,360
that are reversed yes that's how picky I

587
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,000
am um if the male plants can be nines

588
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,719
these reversals must be 10 because we

589
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
get to smoke them we get to sample them

590
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,079
we get to experience them why wouldn't I

591
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,279
pick a perfect 10 so I need that shape

592
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:33,319
that structure that Vigor that

593
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,440
resistance to pathogens that resistance

594
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:37,200
to pests people really forget about that

595
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,798
one uh everyone's worried about what

596
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,279
does it look like on Instagram and how

597
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,879
much can I get for a pack of it um as a

598
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,639
grower as a breeder is it pest resistant

599
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,039
is it pathogen resistant a lot of people

600
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,600
are growing a lot of outdoor flowers now

601
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:51,359
I need to breed stuff that does not

602
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,199
catch the powdery mildew I need to breed

603
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,879
stuff that doesn't get the bud mold I

604
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,440
need to make plants that are bug

605
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,000
resistant so people are not getting

606
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,640
attacked by pest in their outdoor

607
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,038
Gardens that's something that I'm

608
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,000
thinking about so I look at that at the

609
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,079
females that I'm going to reverse uh

610
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,279
what kind of leaf shape do they have uh

611
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,960
what kind of uh basic structure and how

612
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,678
do they grow do they get real tall do

613
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,798
they get real stretchy or they stay real

614
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,360
tight can they support themselves what

615
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,839
about the flowers I mentioned the same

616
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,918
thing in the male plants how are the

617
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,240
flower clusters are they real dense are

618
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,280
they fluffy are they foxtail are they

619
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,798
fingery then also one of the main things

620
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,798
to think about one of the most important

621
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,839
things I guess that I should have

622
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,839
mentioned first is what is the goal of

623
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,639
the breeding project does this pollen

624
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,480
donor uh meet the criteria of what I'm

625
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,400
trying to create so I like to use really

626
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,319
weird analogies I started using baking

627
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,640
earlier so we're going to stay with that

628
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,839
like I said earlier if I want to make

629
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,840
chocolate muffins I'm not going to bust

630
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,319
out like uh pastrami that's not going to

631
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,639
go in my chocolate muffins so if I want

632
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,399
to breed chocolate this I know that's

633
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,799
[ __ ] wild right but it makes sense so

634
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,519
if I want to breed chocolate muffins I

635
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,200
need something muffiny and chocolatey

636
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,279
right it wouldn't reach for the pastrami

637
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,120
stuff so find plants that meet the

638
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,879
criteria for your breeding project are

639
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,839
you trying to make make fruity flavored

640
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,799
stuff skunky flavored stuff and of

641
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,519
course this plant's only 50% of the mix

642
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,480
but keep in mind it's going to be a big

643
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,558
50% it could be 60 maybe 70% depending

644
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,240
on how the breeding goes keep that in

645
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,359
mind what if I do want to make pastrami

646
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,759
then I'm going to find if I want to make

647
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,479
pastrami Rye mustard I need a plant that

648
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:18,960
smells like Pastrami and mustard a plant

649
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,960
that smells like R I got to breed those

650
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,400
bad [ __ ] so think about that when you

651
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,759
are starting to breed what do you want

652
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,038
your outcome to look smell taste how is

653
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,839
the buzz then as the grower the breeder

654
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,119
how does it grow is it problematic in

655
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,000
the [ __ ] grow room cuz I don't want

656
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,759
to grow problematic plants I have a

657
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,839
large clientele of homeg Growers a lot

658
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:38,200
of the people that purchase my seeds are

659
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,720
medical Growers that are growing for

660
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,798
their medical needs or they're providing

661
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,360
for somebody with the medical condition

662
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:44,839
the consuming cannabis will help with

663
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,639
their medical condition and improve the

664
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:48,480
quality of their life many of my

665
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,960
customers are home Growers many of my

666
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,558
clients are people growing for

667
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,400
themselves so I need and a lot of them

668
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:55,278
are new Growers because I have a podcast

669
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,559
I introduce a lot of new people to

670
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:59,880
cultivation so I need a product that is

671
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:01,879
very reliable very easy for the new

672
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,240
Growers of the community to be able to

673
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,799
have good success with so that's

674
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,400
something I think about when I'm growing

675
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,960
and breeding so if I can knock that

676
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,440
plant over and forget to water it for a

677
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,278
couple of days and then go pick it back

678
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,400
up and set it back up and prop it up and

679
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:14,640
it goes hey I'm ready to grow those are

680
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,960
the plants that I should think about

681
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,559
breeding with because I want people to

682
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,640
have good success in the garden so it's

683
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:21,759
a plant that can take abuse and one day

684
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,520
one way I find those is uh and I've

685
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,720
talked about this before I'm involved

686
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,158
with commercial cultivation facilities

687
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,319
and I'll go walk through the facilities

688
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,559
and I see plants that Just sh shine and

689
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:32,359
I know that those plants are getting

690
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,879
beat up cuz those workers the guys in

691
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,359
the facilities are overworked there's

692
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,320
too many plants they not getting paid

693
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,678
enough there's not enough people so I

694
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,200
know those plants are getting abused

695
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,278
when I see the plants that shine in

696
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,840
there so I watch how they get abused in

697
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,798
the grow and then I see the best plants

698
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,399
that come out and I select those as some

699
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,599
of my breeding plants so I like to pick

700
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,640
stuff that I know uh can take some abuse

701
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,240
that can tolerate some drought some uh

702
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,919
if you forget to water it for a day it

703
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,278
might be okay if you overwater it the

704
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,080
next day it should still be okay I like

705
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,240
plants I can teach you to pop and twist

706
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:02,519
and lollipop and do all the work to so

707
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,480
I'm keeping that in mind as I'm

708
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:07,798
selecting for my breeders also so um

709
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,278
let's see let me get back to my notes um

710
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:11,359
I need them to be better than a regular

711
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:12,839
male because I can smoke it I can see

712
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,119
all the traits that we're looking for

713
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:16,759
that's the main thing that I wanted to

714
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,798
stress on this um we got to cover all

715
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,440
the important details the smoke the buzz

716
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,558
the aroma the flavor and then all the

717
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,840
growth traits and of course I've

718
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:25,319
reviewed all those a bunch of times so

719
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,359
it says when making fem seeds do you

720
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,839
look for the same attributes and my

721
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,399
bottom line answer on the bottom of the

722
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:33,759
paper it says I look for the same

723
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,278
attributes and more uh like I started

724
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,440
this my my male my real male donor

725
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:40,400
plants my male pollen donor plants uh

726
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,759
those can be nines I'd prefer a nine a

727
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,080
9.5 I'll accept an 8.5 maybe it's got to

728
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,319
it's got to have some really super

729
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,439
traits but those mail plants can be

730
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:51,879
nines I need a really good solid mail

731
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,519
plant that meets my criteria and I've

732
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,559
gone through the criteria and it mean it

733
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,000
helps me reach the goal of my breeding

734
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:00,038
product project which we've talked about

735
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,759
uh so I need need that solid mail but

736
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:04,400
for a reversal it's got to be a tan cuz

737
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:05,879
I already know what it smokes like if

738
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,080
why would you reverse something that

739
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,320
isn't everything you want if it's not

740
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,759
you've already smoked it you know what

741
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,918
it's going to taste like you know what

742
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:13,480
how it's going to get you high you know

743
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,679
how much of it you have to smoke to get

744
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,640
you high also is there a ceiling is

745
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,600
there a limit to this plant the more I

746
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,360
smoke can I just keep getting higher or

747
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,319
do I max out at some point because a lot

748
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,398
of plants have a limit uh some of the

749
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:27,278
more uh the Congo Ripper uh the more

750
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:29,038
Congo Ripper you smoke the higher you

751
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,880
get the more wing suit you smoke the

752
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,720
higher you get but a lot of the other

753
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,399
strains it's common just for your

754
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,200
biology once you smoke to a certain

755
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:37,398
point you'll just max out you won't get

756
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,159
any higher I don't know if you guys just

757
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:41,479
saw me full Panic CU my computer screen

758
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:43,360
went bright blue it's not supposed to do

759
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,440
that I got it to come back so it might

760
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,158

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,240
idirect tocom so the question goes a

793
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,960
little bit like this it is labeled a

794
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,359
problem in my garden and it says I was

795
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,000
wondering I've got a seated crop and it

796
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:03,839
became infected infested with spider mes

797
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,880
okay so he's uh he's got some plants

798
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,000
theyve been pollinated and since that

799
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,278
time happened the dreaded spider mights

800
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,359
have showed up of course this has

801
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,839
happened to me before this is solvable

802
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,918
this is fixable and it may not be as bad

803
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,519
as your thinking it may be it says uh

804
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,559
would this affect the way the seeds

805
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:24,038
finished will they still be vigorous or

806
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:26,158
am I wasting my time um then it says the

807
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:27,839
plants are currently drying to be dry as

808
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,080
[ __ ] uh you've been watching the show

809
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,720
good work bro and after this would you

810
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,000
recommend to clean what would you

811
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,558
recommend to clean my grow area I have

812
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
used a bleach solution is that enough

813
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:43,200
cheers and thanks so much for the

814
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,240
podcast from aywy 420 this is a very

815
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,880
good question so you bred some uh some

816
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,240
seeds and in the process those mother

817
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,799
plants the female plants were infested

818
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,038
with spidermites now you've got the

819
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:55,759
seeds those seeds should be viable you

820
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:58,319
should be able to produce uh viable

821
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,038
potent vigorous plants from those seeds

822
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,879
uh my true answer is there's only one

823
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:04,038
way to find out my dude grow some of

824
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,640
those seeds and see what you've got uh

825
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:07,158
there's uh no stress in doing a

826
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,320
germination test I don't know how many

827
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:12,320
seeds you have maybe you got 30 maybe

828
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:13,918
you got 30,000 but take 10% of them

829
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,158
however many you got if you got 30 take

830
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,679
three seeds so just pull 10% of your

831
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,080
seeds and fold them up in a wet paper

832
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,159
towel and germinate them and see how

833
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,079
many Sprout uh if they sprout then

834
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:24,919
you've got really good seeds grow those

835
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,519
why not just keep going with those see

836
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,120
what you come up with do the uh the 1212

837
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,000
from seed method that I talked about on

838
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,319
the dude grow show and just run these

839
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,880
plants really quickly and see what

840
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,678
you've created you may have some cool

841
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,520
[ __ ] if you did your research and did

842
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,399
your dude diligence before you made this

843
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,000
cross you may have made some real gold

844
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:43,278
here so run these seeds see what you've

845
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,919
created uh just do it for the fun of it

846
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,398
just see if they germinate that's a fun

847
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,480
test uh run them on the 1212 method that

848
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:50,879
I mentioned uh that's a fun game to play

849
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,640
just run them and see what they do take

850
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,200
a bunch of pictures and see what you

851
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,840
have created like I said you may have

852
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,919
new gold there you may have created the

853
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,558
new uh the new chem dog the new golden

854
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,120
go you may have the New Girl Scout

855
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:03,038
cookies you might have the new gelato on

856
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,398
your hands bro we don't know what you

857
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,558
have done in that Garden we got two more

858
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:09,639
things to talk about since these plants

859
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:12,678
were infested with spidermites during

860
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,240
the uh the development time the way my

861
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,759
brain thinks is that if you do that same

862
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,880
process multiple times if you uh take

863
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,519
the F so you got F1 seeds take those f1s

864
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,320
and make f2s but in the process let

865
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,839
those plants get hit with spidermites

866
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,639
again then take those f2s and breed F3

867
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,959
and when you're doing it keep the spider

868
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,519
mites going don't ever get rid of the

869
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,679
mites just keep them going because what

870
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,440
you're going to do eventually if you

871
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,720
breed properly if you do the proper

872
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,240
selection and this is a whole another

873
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,798
bracket of this conversation we're not

874
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,519
going to have today but people will

875
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:45,960
continue this part in the comments talk

876
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,558
about how to do this in the comments if

877
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,640
you're a a person that understands

878
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:51,278
breeding what you eventually will do is

879
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,679
you'll breed plants that are fully

880
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,880
resistant to spidermites if you select

881
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,679
the plants that get hit the so if you

882
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,600
fully infest the room with spidermites

883
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,200
and you find female plants that the

884
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,839
mites don't touch and then breed to

885
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,360
those and then infest that room of

886
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,879
spidermites again and find the the

887
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,918
female plants that the mites don't touch

888
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,640
and breed to those you'll breed out the

889
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,440
spidermites out of that plant they they

890
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,360
won't want it it'll take several

891
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,000
Generations but you could focus on that

892
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,719
you could definitely make that a thing

893
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,599
you're already the first step into like

894
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,440
a 23 step process Why not start now all

895
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:24,000
right so we've talked about the uh the

896
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,798
resistance to spidermites that you were

897
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,278
breeding that's pretty cool now we got

898
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:29,839
to talk about cleaning up this room I

899
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:31,398
think the bleach will do you just fine

900
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,678
you said that you have bleached used

901
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:35,719
bleach to clean up the room that should

902
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,440
do it if you've cleaned up everything

903
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,919
however bleach is not an integrated Pest

904
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,320
management system you've cleaned up the

905
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,200
room one time it's clean for now but uh

906
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:47,439
spidermites are microscopic and they're

907
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,798
going to find a crack in the whatever a

908
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,399
crack in the whatever I don't know where

909
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,879
the room is if it's in the basement if

910
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,759
it's in a gigantic facility if it's in a

911
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,440
real tight laboratory those spidermites

912
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,079
they've already found one crack they

913
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,399
know where it is they're going to keep

914
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,879
coming in and they're going to come back

915
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,599
if you're bringing them on your shoes on

916
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,080
your clothes if they found their own

917
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:06,158
entry way if you've got a pet that's

918
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,278
bringing them they will be back so it is

919
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,278
time to develop an integrated Pest

920
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,759
management system there are a lot of

921
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:15,200
different ways to do this uh in my

922
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:17,519
opinion as a commercial cultivator uh

923
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,519
the most effective uh cost effective

924
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,200
time effective way is to apply a spray

925
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,839
application of a pesticide once or twice

926
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,080
a week and when I say the word pesticide

927
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:29,439
people get scared but there are a lot of

928
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:30,879
great options of products you can use uh

929
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,960
this is where I leave it up to you this

930
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,360
is where you need to do the research and

931
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,679
find out um what strength of pesticide

932
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,359
you want to use how organic you want to

933
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,880
stay there are a lot of things to think

934
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,439
about I've got my own opinions I don't

935
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,480
want to spout most of those right now

936
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,159
we're running out of time on the show

937
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,798
but this is where you get to decide some

938
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,480
ethics and think about how you want to

939
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:51,720
do things how bad do you want to spray

940
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,599
these bugs uh how often do you want to

941
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,558
spray do you want to use some hippie

942
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,158
oils some preventative [ __ ] or do you

943
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:59,119
want to get in there with agricultural

944
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,360
pesticides and spray once and know

945
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,239
you're not going to have to mess with it

946
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,599
for one or two weeks there are a lot of

947
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,240
things to think about and also things to

948
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,719
understand uh understand these

949
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,000
pesticides understand what you're

950
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,079
putting on your plants understand uh if

951
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,159
it's good or acceptable uh so my rule of

952
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,158
thumb is I am in Colorado I understand

953
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,080
the Colorado Department of Agriculture

954
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,880
and the Colorado marijuana enforcement

955
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,879
division pesticide application rules I

956
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,639
am actually certified by the Department

957
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,278
of Agriculture as a train the trainer

958
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:30,879
certified uh p pesticide trainer uh

959
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,720
which means I can go to a commercial

960
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,600
cultivation facility and train people

961
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,639
there on how to safely handle and apply

962
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,199
pesticides uh but make sure you go read

963
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:42,359
all of that stuff is what I'm getting at

964
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,159
learn about those pesticides so what I

965
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,839
was getting at is I go by the Colorado

966
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,880
Department of Agriculture and Colorado

967
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,319
marijuana enforcement division pesticide

968
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,840
application rules if a product is banned

969
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,918
in the state of Colorado I do not use it

970
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:56,558
uh if a product that I use on a regular

971
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,559
basis becomes banned sometimes I'll

972
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,398
remove that product from the rot

973
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:01,960
honestly most of the time I use it until

974
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,558
I'm out of that product because I'm not

975
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,919
in that facility but I want to follow

976
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:07,000
that guideline so make sure that that

977
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,840
product or if you want to do the

978
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,398
research see if that product is approved

979
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:13,480
in your area for cannabis application if

980
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:15,599
you have commercial cultivation or the

981
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,720
Colorado approved pesticide list is not

982
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,719
hard to Google if you Google Colorado

983
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,600
marijuana enforcement division approved

984
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,600
pesticide list you can find it and you

985
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,439
can see what you can apply to the

986
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,158
products then you have to learn when to

987
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,440
and when not to apply those products and

988
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:32,200
how to apply them learn about re-entry

989
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,480
intervals learn about uh your pesticide

990
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,159
uh your safety gear learn about all that

991
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,880
stuff but please do learn about uh

992
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,039
integrated Pest Management the most

993
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,320
effective way in my opinion is sprayed

994
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:43,919
applications once or twice a week now if

995
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,720
you do choose to go with the sprayed

996
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,639
pesticide applications as your method of

997
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,558
integrated Pest Management I do

998
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:52,000
recommend a rotation Don't Spray the

999
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:54,440
same pesticide every time you spray

1000
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,319
because these bugs will develop a

1001
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,960
resistance to your pesticide that's

1002
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,359
right if you go in there every day you

1003
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,159
throw a right hook by the third or

1004
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,079
fourth time they just throw up that left

1005
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,159
block and they keep their day going you

1006
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:07,038
need to rotate your pesticides I would

1007
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,679
recommend two to three different

1008
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,200
pesticides and spray one and then spray

1009
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,120
the other and then spray one and then

1010
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,399
spray the other so you can really

1011
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,439
confuse these bugs just mix it up rotate

1012
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:19,558
them also another thing you can do is

1013
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,278
called a tank mix uh this is a little

1014
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:23,558
bit Advanced but do some research do

1015
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,519
some reading this is possible I do this

1016
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:27,480
all the time in commercial facilities

1017
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,679
you can mix more than one pesticide in

1018
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,480
your tank at a time and apply them for

1019
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,759
multiple modes of attack if you want to

1020
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,960
apply something that isn't real sticky

1021
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,440
add a little bit of Evergreen uh that'll

1022
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,038
make it stickier and then now you've got

1023
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,080
two different modes of attack for that

1024
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,919
application in one time follow all the

1025
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:44,638
rules write that stuff down when you do

1026
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:46,000
that all right that is my pesticide

1027
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:48,038
application rant now let's talk about

1028
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,480
your other option the other option is of

1029
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:53,079
course Predator bugs you can buy and

1030
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,240
release bugs into your grow that will

1031
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:57,879
eat the existing spider mites there are

1032
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,120
bugs that love to eat spidermites um

1033
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,559
depending on where you are the

1034
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,959
environment in your grow space there are

1035
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:07,440
several different options um I really

1036
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,280
like the lace Wing eggs you can buy lace

1037
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,800
green lacewing eggs and you can hang

1038
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,320
these little placards on the plants and

1039
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,519
they've got just little lacewing eggs

1040
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,760
all over them and they will start to

1041
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,239
hatch and they look like little

1042
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,480
alligators and they'll start climbing

1043
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:21,959
around and they will eat all of the

1044
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,719
other bugs in your grow space um those

1045
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,199
things are hungry they're vicious they

1046
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,838
will go eat all the spidermites the

1047
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,239
spidermite eggs the thrips uh the fungus

1048
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,000
snats they will eat the [ __ ] out of

1049
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,319
everything the Green Lace Wings will

1050
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,800
develop it and then after that they turn

1051
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,480
into real big Green Lace wings and

1052
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,079
they'll eat everything else a few other

1053
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,599
Predators I would recommend are the

1054
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:42,519
sories the cucumeris the hypo aspis

1055
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,320
miles and then why not throw some Ro

1056
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:46,398
beetles in there and there was another

1057
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,359
one on my mind that my brain won't say

1058
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,398
sworsky cucumeris hypoaspis miles

1059
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:55,519
californicus that's the same as somebody

1060
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:59,199
else uh Ro beetles um I also recommend

1061
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,358
the um uh we'll say the Green Lace wings

1062
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,000
and there's another one that goes in the

1063
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,358
soil that my brain will not think of but

1064
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,119
I think five recommendations is enough

1065
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:07,799
this is enough to give you a springboard

1066
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,119
a jumping point to start thinking about

1067
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,920
the Predator bugs also many people in a

1068
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:13,200
home grow don't like the Predator bugs

1069
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,200
they they think it's gross to have the

1070
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,879
idea of bringing in bugs but you'd be

1071
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,078
amazed at how many bugs are already

1072
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,280
there we won't even think about that now

1073
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,680
all right so uh your first option is uh

1074
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,640
so you've cleaned up the room clean

1075
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:26,838
everything real good then I would start

1076
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,559
treating the plants uh introduce an

1077
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:32,199
integrated pest management system rotate

1078
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:33,920
three pesticides in uh once or twice a

1079
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:35,879
week if you don't see any bugs spray

1080
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,440
once a week at the first sign of bugs

1081
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,400
step that [ __ ] up spray twice a week um

1082
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,400
if you don't want to spray stuff because

1083
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,160
of whatever and that's up to you I get

1084
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,639
it people don't want to spray [ __ ] uh

1085
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,319
they get worried about poisons or

1086
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,199
whatever uh a lot of things to read

1087
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,119
about and educate yourself on there then

1088
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:54,399
you can try the uh Predator bugs which

1089
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,838
again is a lot of things for people to

1090
