62
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,798
computer screen everything sounded great

63
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,798
when i went to process the video and do

64
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,479
the editing it wasn't great

65
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,920
i did not want to can it i didn't want

66
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,280
to throw that episode away i wanted to

67
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,960
make sure you guys got to hear what mike

68
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,159
and i had to say mainly what mike had to

69
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,759
say in that episode

70
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,200

71
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,598
did my best to clean it up

72
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,680
edit that a little bit put that show out

73
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,119
but i know that was not up to rasta jeff

74
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,719
standards that was not grow from your

75
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
heart podcast standards

76
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,120
i apologize things will be better in the

77
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,759
future i'll do my best to not make that

78
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,959
happen

79
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,759
i think i found the solution i found a

80
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,360
way to

81
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,639
mitigate that problem you guys don't

82
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,319
care what the solution is i almost

83
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,799
rambled on about that but

84
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,719
i found a way to record three different

85
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,360
video options and three different audio

86
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,359
options

87
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,959
i'll do my best to piece those three

88
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,120
recordings together that's six different

89
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,159
recordings to make a top shelf podcast

90
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000

97
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,439

the edibles challenge episode that i

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
participated in

150
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,040
on embracing organics with my friends we

151
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,319
all acquired the same edibles the same

152
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,879
amount of edibles

153
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,319
some of us ate all 250 right at the

154
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,360
start of the show some of us kind of

155
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,439
dosed ourselves

156
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,919
slowly throughout the show some people

157
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,560
didn't choose to eat all of the dosage

158
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,918
uh as i watched a few people just throw

159
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,040
it all into their mouths at the start of

160
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,839
the show

161
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,800
my plan was to eat 50 now 50 later see

162
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,918
how it goes maybe

163
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,199
50 more a couple people threw all 250 in

164
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:58,959
their mouths and i thought

165
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,879
i don't want to be late to the party so

166
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,680
i just ate all 250 right there at the

167
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,639
beginning

168
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,319

195
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,000
blurry blurry night the next morning i

00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,639
embarrass ourselves our friends

208
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,639
uh one of our friends north of the

209
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,560
border had to check out early

210

he was twisted he was done he was

211
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,478
roasted he was cooked he was barbecued

212
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,159

ah he looks like a statue he was just it

216
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,560

217
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,879
house he was laid out just a little

218
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
he was just one if he didn't have such

219
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,680
bad cottonmouth he would have been

220
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,519
drooling on himself i do believe

221
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
tanasi handled himself quite well dirt

222
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,680
man dan didn't seem to be very affected

223
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,960
uh watching keith try to handle i said i

224
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,079
wasn't gonna say their names but [ __ ] it

225

we're saying their names are gonna watch

226
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,439
the show

227
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,199
keith was gonna stop at a certain amount

228
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,879
of edibles he was already

229
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,560
plenty intoxicated you could see it on

230
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,000
his face his mouth wasn't moving

231
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,519
uh he would say words but his mouth

232
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,240
wasn't making the right shape for those

233
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,079
words

234
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,079
it's kind of funny to watch him but oh

235
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,560
he's kind of pale too

236
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,000
he said if he got so many likes on the

237
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,478
video that he would eat

238
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,639
more edibles and basically he said if he

239
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,159
got 150 he would eat the 150 and if we

240
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,160
got 200 likes on the video

241
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,680
he would eat 200. um i may be a smart

242
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
ass and maybe not the best friend on the

243
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,478
planet

244
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,000
sometimes i used my social media prowess

245
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,758
and i posted to facebook saying hey

246
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800

247

253
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,198
night

254
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,719
i think we had a good time overall oh we

255
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,240
got to see who could handle the edibles

256
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,800
nobody honestly

257
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,478
was uh wrecked in a dangerous position i

258
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,079
said that our canadian friend checked

259
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,839
out early because he was twisted

260
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,680
it was okay he did the same thing i did

261
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,439
he way too much food and went to bed

262
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,199
uh he's still canadian he still talks

263
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,800
funny he's still killing it at life

264
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,800
i just took a few hours to get him out

265
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,319
of that weed coma so we all handled it

266
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,759
pretty well it was a good show

267
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,160
once again i encourage you to check out

268
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,759

274
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,159
are still getting our medical marijuana

275
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,280
cards renewed it's hard to get

276
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
appointments it's hard to

277
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,959
to do a lot of things in person i got an

278
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,560
email from my

279
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,478
cannabis doctor that said hey it's time

280
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,399
to renew would you like to do it over

281
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,680
the phone and i said sure

282
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,279
and they said make an appointment on

283
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
this app so i clicked on a thing and it

284
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,679
said

285
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,360

286
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,719
it said be ready 10 minutes ahead of

287
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,479
time to fill out a paper

288
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,879
i got a text message 10 minutes ahead of

289
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,320
time i filled out that paper i hit send

290
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,479
after i hit send i got a phone call it

291
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
was the weed doctor and said hey

292
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,000
uh why do you need medical marijuana and

293
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,518
i explained why and they said have you

294
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,519
had medical marijuana before and i said

295
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,879
this is like my 14th or 15th year of

296
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,080
renewing my card

297
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,519
they giggled and they said cool your

298
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,639
paperwork is pushed through give me your

299
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,399
credit card number

300
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,080
i paid them for my medical marijuana

301
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,958
card filled out a couple of papers on

302
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,200
the state

303
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,559
uh if the state didn't have a small

304
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,800
snafu with my paperwork

305
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,639
it would have taken a total of two hours

306
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,838
to get my medical marijuana card renewed

307
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,439
i didn't have to leave the house didn't

308
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,120
have to put on pants

309
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,720
like i said there was a small technical

310
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,000
mistake not a big deal something was

311
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,399
spelled wrong and so

312
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,759
i was just a technical the other people

313
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,600
the service i used

314
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,439
uh spelled my name wrong my name is

315
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,200
spelled wrong technically they spelled

316
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
it correctly but it's not the way

317
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,040
my full name is spelled if that made any

318
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,719
sense to you uh but other than the quick

319
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,399
snafu it would have taken me a total of

320
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,200
maybe two hours to get my weed card

321
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,600
renewed

322
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,120
which is remarkable back in the day uh

323
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,959
we would make appointments

324
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,240
and you would go to the weed doctor and

325
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,479
you would realize that

326
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,480
they just said sure come at 11 and they

327
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
told everybody they called to come

328
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,240
at 11 or whatever time they felt was

329
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,439
good they just said come in

330
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,440
there were no appointments we would

331
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,720
stand in line uh all day

332
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,160
sometimes you'd get there at nine in the

333
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,800
morning you'd get to see the dock at

334
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,399
five

335
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,838
and they would sign your paperwork that

336
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,639
day and send you on your way it used to

337
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,640
cost

338
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,080
uh somewhere between three and five

339
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,439
hundred dollars to see the doctor this

340
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
time it was 80 bucks

341
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,920
it used to cost 120 to register with the

342
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,199
state this time it was 25. 25

343
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,838
it's getting much cheaper the whole

344
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,839
appointment everything was 105

345
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,120
it took me less than two hours didn't

346
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,800
have to leave the house

347
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,399
technically didn't have to put on pants

348
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,039
i did wear pants just to make you feel

349
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,278
better

350
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,719
but that was quick that was easy so i'm

351
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,399
good for a solid year

352
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,079
i got my medical marijuana card

353
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,240
really comfortable it was a really

354
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,319
pain-free [ __ ] flawless process they

355
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,000
call you and ask you a few questions

356
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,920
uh then they ask you if you're crazy

357
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,039
basically do you have any mental

358
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,639
conditions they would start are you

359
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,838
suicidal do you want to hurt yourself or

360
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,000
anybody else

361
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,760
are you pregnant weird [ __ ] like that

362
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,360
and if they most of the time you know

363
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,720
how to answer the questions it's so much

364
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,800
easier over the phone

365
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,278
uh and then when i told her it was my

366
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,759
14th year or 15th year of renewing my

367
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,200
card

368
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,480
she just started typing she's like we

369
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,920
don't need to ask all these questions

370
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,200
we're just gonna go ahead and uh

371
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,599
i think you're ready to go and she

372
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,160
re-give me my card so i got the new weed

373
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,159
card

374
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,159
everything is good to go got my plant

375
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,879
count taken care of

376
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,319
i do not opt for the uh increased plant

377
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,480
counts because in colorado we're

378
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,839
limited to 12 plants anyway if i were

379
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,440
going to have a dispensary or something

380
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,640
grow my plants i may go for the extra

381
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
plants but i don't pay extra for the

382
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,600
extended plant count

383
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,679
it doesn't make any sense it's pointless

384
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,240
for me so i'm just got the regular plant

385
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,000
count

386
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,440
uh gonna crush it with that it's fine

387
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,799
for me it does what i need to do i got a

388
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,079
small grow space anyway

389
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,919
i've made those numbers work for the

390
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:24,639
past couple of years so didn't need to

391
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,479
increase

392
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,639
i was amazing how easy it would have

393
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,120
been just to pay for the extended plant

394
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,360
count

395
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,320
which is basically money uh allegedly

396
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,360
i'm not sure

397
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,399
anyway that was the weed card doctor the

398
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,320
next thing i want to talk about is

399
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,759

i talk about cannabis all the time i'll

402
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,240
do it quickly right now cannabis is a

403
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,360
social media application it's a lot like

404
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,560

anyway cannabis it's a social media

411
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,759

433
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,879

441
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,600

first email on this show

550
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,480
this one is titled shout out question it

551
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,600
came from

552
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,000
actually i just grabbed this from

553
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,240
youtube somebody said i joined

554
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the patreon approximately two weeks ago

555
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,399
and i still have not gotten a shout

556
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,600
out my friend crazy hand replied this

557
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,198
was a youtube comment

558
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,278
crazy hand replied to the comment it

559
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,439
says i feel he does it randomly

560
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,720
uh i've never heard mine on a shout out

561
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,320
part and then he mentioned it

562
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,160
and then he did me a solid and gave me a

563
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,399
special shout out and then he said my

564
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,240
rng is always bad i can't remember what

565
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,839
rng stands for but

566
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,120
um uh so mainly the question here is

567
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,800
uh somebody said they signed up for

568
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,879
patreon approximately two weeks ago i

569
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,639
still haven't given them a shout out

570
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,159
there are a couple of reasons for that

571
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,919
it's nothing personal i think this

572
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:55,120
person actually did get their shout out

573
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,599
shortly after this

574
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,278
comment was posted let me explain why if

575
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,720
you contribute to patreon sometimes it

576
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:01,600
does take me a minute to give you a

577
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,558
shout out

578
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,038
i am recorded one solid week ahead i do

579
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,199

580
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,798
shows a week i try to record both of

581
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,400
them uh so if

582
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,240
the show that comes out tuesday was

583
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600

584
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,679

585
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,038

586
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,640
several days ahead

587
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,318
just in case something goes wrong i

588
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,319
don't want to have to get on the mic and

589
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,078
record a show thursday edit it post it

590
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:24,798
hope it comes out on youtube on time on

591
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,438
thursday

592
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,960
i'm ahead of myself so uh we gotta wait

593
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,320
for the episodes to come out in the

594
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,200
order which they come out

595
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,798
and with the covid times uh with [ __ ]

596
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,640
life the way that it is i try to be at

597
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,400
least one or two episodes ahead

598
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,799
so that if something does go wrong in my

599
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,360
life i've got one or two loaded up in

600
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,599

601
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,119
is what we say uh i've got a couple

602
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,399
loaded up that i can launch

603
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,759
if something's wrong with me if

604
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,720
something's wrong with my gear if my

605
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,359
internet's down

606
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,919
i've got a backup plan so uh you send me

607
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,918
the

608
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,440
message on the first saying hey i'm a

609
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,759
patron i want the shout out

610
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,519
i write it down on the first maybe i'll

611
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,359
record on the third or fourth

612
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,038
uh then that won't come out till the

613
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,879
seventh maybe and then

614
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,240
maybe i recorded two episodes maybe

615
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,120
you're the second episode that month

616
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
that i record

617
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,599
you're not going to get your shout out

618
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,120
till the 10th maybe you're the third

619
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,678
you're looking at the 13th of the month

620
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,959
now

621
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,320
so it's just about the first of the

622
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,840
month i write down the shout outs and

623
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,439
then i record them through the month

624
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,879
and it may just take a minute i do get

625
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,080
to them

626
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,840
also i'm getting i don't want to

627
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,599
complain i'm getting an overwhelming

628
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,279
amount of shoutouts and amount uh

629
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,079
overwhelming amount of contributions and

630
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,119
response i

631
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,119
love it i can't keep up i used to do 10

632
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,879
shout outs at the top of every episode

633
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,519
if you pay attention now sometimes it's

634
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,600
12. sometimes i extend it to 13 if the

635
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,279
names are short and i can sneak it in

636
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,519
so it went from 10 shout outs every

637
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,599
episode to 12 or 13.

638
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,200
i may and i can't make you a promise

639
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,119
because my time is limited

640
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,360
i may have to step it up and do a third

641
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,199
episode just to get the patreon

642
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,359
shoutouts in every month which

643
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,720
if i can find another one more evening

644
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,079
to record i would love to give you a

645
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,798
third episode and if i can get the

646
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,480
content

647
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,079
if you guys can send me more questions

648
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,839
and [ __ ] i would love to get that third

649
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,798
episode out i would make the adjustments

650
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,359
but that may be

651
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,918
what has to happen so uh the main issue

652
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,839
is

653
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,360
that you're i get the patreon notice on

654
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,839
the first of the month and then i put

655
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,678
out

656
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,519
eight episodes every month you may get

657
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,080
your shout out on that eighth episode

658
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,918
and i just go down the list honestly uh

659
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,119
i just pick the 710 club and i just

660
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,480
start writing their names i actually

661
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,959
type them into the computer

662
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,640
and i just read them as they come up so

663
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,240
uh sometimes people get snuck in there

664
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,240
if there's a special circumstance

665
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,919
like if it's your birthday or if you

666
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,359
just contributed to patreon today and

667
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,919
you're brand new maybe i'll put you on

668
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,159
there

669
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,679
but for the most part uh they're random

670
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,000
they just i get the notifications on the

671
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,519
first

672
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,119
i try to get them all done by the end of

673
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,720
the month if not i continue them through

674
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,199

676
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,960
10. now it's 12 or 13. i may have to do

677
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,960

678
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,360

719
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,879
question

720
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,400
this one came from patreon it came from

721
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,080
jackie daytona

722
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,320
and it said no actually this one came

723
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,000
from youtube came from jackie daytona on

724
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,240
youtube and it said hey jeff

725
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,480
thanks again for the great info i had a

726
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,079
thought when you were explaining nanners

727
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,720
in a previous episode i talked about

728
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,639
nanners

729
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,079
uh hermaphroditic male flowers and

730
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,159
female plants

731
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,359
ah that's what i was calling nanners it

732
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,679
says people love

733
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,519
visuals i love visuals too but i think

734
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,559
you have something different in mind in

735
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,119
this question here

736
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,359
i think you mean visual aids it says and

737
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,439
sometimes a pop-up photo can show a good

738
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,439
example of what you're talking about

739
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,600
i've been putting in photos right about

740
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,400
here uh somewhere here in this region in

741
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,678
the video

742
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,280
i've been learning a lot more with my

743
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,519
editing equipment i've got a couple of

744
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,119
uh

745
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,279
other ideas that may happen here in the

746
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,158
future to give you some more uh visual

747
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,879
aids

748
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,159
but uh it says nanners herms male female

749
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,320
parts etc

750
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,000
people obviously can just google it

751
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,798
however it could really add a new

752
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,359
dynamic to your already great podcast

753
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,240
thank you for sharing your generous

754
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,158
knowledge

755
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,679
uh man jackie daytona thank you i do

756
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,600
appreciate that great comment that is a

757
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,200
good idea that is great feedback i love

758
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,119
constructive criticism

759
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,400
uh positive or negative feedback as long

760
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,959
as they're done politely

761
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,120
are both taken well uh this is a great

762
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,240
idea you're very very accurate and very

763
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,719
correct i should

764
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,359
have posted a picture of a plant with a

765
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,159
nano

766
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,839
right here that was a missed opportunity

767
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,120
good job on catching that

768
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,959
uh so now's a good time to catch up uh

769
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,239
never too late right now's a good time

770
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,600
better late than never is what i think

771
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,440
my brain is trying to say

772
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,038
so at this point i'm going to pop up a

773
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,400
couple of photos here on the screen and

774
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:43,759
we're going to talk once again about

775
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,798
nanners if you listen to the episode

776
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,798
about nanners

777
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,639
here is a great visual representation of

778
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,720
nanners what i'm going to show you

779
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,640
is a female cannabis plant that is late

780
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,640
into flower this is a very well

781
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,720
developed flower and you will see that

782
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,480
in the very center of this flower

783
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,919
there are two yellow things that just

784
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,960
don't look right popping out of the

785
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,240
center of the bud

786
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,880
i'm gonna put the picture right here on

787
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,480
the screen and right here in the center

788
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,919
i'll try to circle it or something i

789
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
need to learn the software so i can't

790
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,400
promise you what's going to happen but

791
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,199
i'll do something to indicate

792
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,038
right here this part that i'm showing is

793
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,480
what i'm calling the nano you'll see why

794
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,798
we call that the banana

795
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,400
that is a female plant it's got buds on

796
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,279
it it's got trichomes we can see the

797
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,720
female

798
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,399
pistols is what you may want to call

799
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,640
them we can see the female

800
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,640
clearly see that it's a female but we

801
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,679
see a couple of male parts in the middle

802
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,159
of that plant

803
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,240
those are nanners that is what we call

804
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,679
an intersex plant that is what we call a

805
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,359
hermaphrodite plant that is

806
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,679
hermaphroditic

807
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,000
sometimes those manners contain pollen

808
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,519
and that pollen can pollinate your room

809
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,038
now this plant is way too far beyond

810
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,639
pollination point for that to be an

811
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:49,278
issue but if you've got younger plants

812
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,120
in the room

813
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,960
that plant could receive the pollen so

814
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:56,158
that is what we call a nano

815
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,159
that could or could not contain pollen

816
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,919
sometimes they have pollen sometimes

817
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,640
they do not have pollen sometimes they

818
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,240
have pollen

819
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,759
that is non-viable so

820
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,359
that's what a nano looks like i'm going

821
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,119
to scroll through my ipad here and find

822
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,639
another picture and explain this one

823
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,798
once again

824
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,320
this one the thing that looks like a

825
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,679
tongue sticking out of the butt it looks

826
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,839
like a yellow tongue

827
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,600
that is a nano that is a male flower

828
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,240
sticking out of a female plant once

829
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,719
again

830
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,839
we have got a hermaphrodite an intersex

831
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,159
plant

832
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,599
so this plant the past two shots that i

833
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,880
showed you there would be a decision to

834
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,639
make

835
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,200
if there's no pollen coming out of those

836
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,960
nanners if you're running one crop on

837
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,159
one cycle that has no chance of getting

838
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,319
pollinated

839
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,600
you may keep that plant around a couple

840
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,319
of late nanners

841
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,038
in late flower may not be detrimental to

842
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,038
the grow

843
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,879
if it happens early that's when i get

844
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,640
rid of them for sure if it happens in

845
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,840
week one or week two it's gone week

846
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,840
three it's gone

847
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,038
week four five and six i'd probably get

848
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:54,959
rid of it week eight

849
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,359
i would consider keeping that bad dog

850
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,679
because the flowers are so far

851
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,278
into bloom they're so far into ripeness

852
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,880
the female parts which

853
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,880
would receive that pollen are so

854
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,320
recessed and dried up that that plant

855
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,400
won't receive pollen it will not

856
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:11,599
pollinate it will not make seeds

857
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,640
so this plant with this tongue looking

858
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,558
male pollen sac sticking out

859
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,320
if that is the fire if that's a really

860
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,000
good cannabis and it only makes one or

861
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,000
two of those on the entire plant

862
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,200
i may consider keeping that but that is

863
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,359
a clear picture

864
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,038
of a nano very good shot i'm going to

865
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,278
call this one a tongue we got a new word

866
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,640
for it looks like a tongue in my opinion

867
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,798
i'm going to scroll through my ipad and

868
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,240
see what my next photo is the next photo

869
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,679
which i'm going to show you

870
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,720
is a very clear shot of a cannabis plant

871
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,519
with male and female sex parts clearly

872
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,720
displayed

873
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,918
in one single bud set of this plant this

874
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
is a lower bud

875
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,960
we can see the female parts uh this

876
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,200
little hair that we see coming off here

877
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,880
uh a lot of people call it the hairs

878
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,120
those are a lot of people are gonna call

879
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,720
it pistols uh those are stigmas or

880
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,918
pistols i may have said stamens a moment

881
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,278
ago that's the wrong word i shouldn't

882
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,799
have said stamen i don't know

883
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,278
uh why i said stamen talking about the

884
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,319
female plants uh stigmas and pistols is

885
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,480
what those are called

886
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,079
uh the little hairy parts here this

887
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,919
other part that's opened up that looks

888
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,879
like a sea shell that opened or a flower

889
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,080
that bloomed

890
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,159
that is a male cannabis flower that part

891
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,759
that opened up the pollen was in there

892
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,760
that may have contained pollen that is

893
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,679
now all over the garden that part is

894
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:24,558
actually the stamen that part there is

895
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,038
the stamen

896
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,359
it popped open uh it may have shot

897
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:31,440
pollen all over the plants next to this

898
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,839
the female parts the pistols and the

899
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,400
stigmas may have been pollinated

900
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,798
so this is a plant with clear intersex

901
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,798
traits we can see a male flower a male

902
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,599
pollen sac which has been opened and we

903
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,798
can see

904
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:46,879
the female stigmas or pistols so that is

905
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,879
a very good shot to show you a male

906
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,320
and a female now i'm going to scroll

907
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,960
through my ipad and see what i've got

908
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,480
next

909
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,798
the next photo is another shot of a male

910
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,319
and a female flower on the same plant

911
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,359
they're early in the flower this is a

912
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,000
great way to show you

913
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,119
what a male flower is going to look like

914
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,038
so we've got a guy

915
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,798
who is holding a small part of a plant

916
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,038
to indicate what we're looking at

917
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,519
this part here that looks like a pod it

918
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:14,640
is seed shaped it's bean shaped

919
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:18,158
that is a male flower and that thing

920
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,000
is a day or two away from opening up and

921
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,440
pollinating the rest of the grow that

922
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,599
thing's big and beefy

923
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,519
it's swollen it's going to come out just

924
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,319
a little more and protrude then it will

925
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,759
point down

926
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,439
then it will open up and pollen will

927
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,640
come out of that pollen sac that is a

928
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,360
very clear

929
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,679
male pollen sac however further up the

930
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,359
plant the little bud that we see here

931
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,120
it's got those female parts those little

932
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,639
the things you guys like to call hairs

933
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,479
those stigmas and pistols that are

934
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,600
sticking off there that is a clear

935
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,880
female part

936
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:49,678
and then you can see uh i can see

937
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,880
swollen calyxes or swollen bracts which

938
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,440
i will assume

939
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,080
are seeded already or are developing

940
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,558
seeds or

941
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,519
will develop seeds so that is a very

942
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,639
clear shot

943
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,720
of a hermaphroditic plant a male female

944
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,240
intersex plant all right i think i've

945
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,480
made it clear what male

946
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,839
this part right here that is a male

947
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,759
plant that part

948
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,519
not a male plant that is a male part if

949
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,079
your plants show that it is probably a

950
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,240
male

951
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,519
if it's got these hairy parts up here

952
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,159
that's what we're looking for in a

953
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,759
female

954
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,278
i'll try to post a solid picture of a

955
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,720
male that's a boy

956
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,720
now i'll post a solid picture of a

957
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,079
female that's a female

958
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,839
and now you've seen what the intersex

959
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,519
plants look like now i've made it clear

960
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,879
what manners look like what males look

961
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,480
like what females look like what

962
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,720
intersex plants look like

963
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,519
that should help you out quite a bit one

964
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,679
thing

965
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,679
that you should not get paranoid about

966
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,919
are swollen brax or

967
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,000
swollen calyxes when you're looking at a

968
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,120
cannabis plant the parts that develop

969
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,640
are calyxes and brax they keep growing

970
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,879
sometimes those look like they're

971
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,320
swollen and they look like they are

972
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,960
male parts those are not male parts they

973
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,798
will be

974
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,159
at the bottom of the bud so you'll have

975
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,918
a little branch and at the bottom of the

976
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,600
butt it'll start to look like popcorn

977
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,799
it'll have little balls

978
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:05,918
those could be swollen bracts or

979
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:08,000
calyxes don't over judge don't get too

980
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,080
paranoid don't get too excited

981
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,759
and get too quick to cut down a plant

982
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,000
that is showing you female parts because

983
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,960
you

984
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,919
think it may be a male verify make sure

985
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,079
that it's a male

986
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,600
at the intersections at the nodes is

987
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,000
where you're most likely to see

988
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,000
the first signs of male sex if you're

989
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,960
seeing those balls and the buds that is

990
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,519
probably

991
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,200
a swollen calyx or a bract that is just

992
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,839
swollen because it's developing the way

993
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,080
it should

994
