telling me that he went to Oregon and he

84
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:10,659
was actually ballsy enough to take his

85
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,189
medicine on the plane with him a whole

86
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:13,689
bunch of it a whole bunch of it will

87
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:18,000
tell it tell everybody what you traveled

88
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:20,020
on a plane with I took my breasts um

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,169
this is gonna sound ridiculous

90
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,719
I took a library as water hash rosin

91
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:30,669
some flour a little bit of clear some

92
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:32,770

95
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,289
everything but a torch yeah yeah I knew

96
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,060
not to ticket or yeah you cannot take

97
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:42,009
the torch they'll taste it torch that is

98
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,840
very similar to a bomb it's already a

99
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:45,370
bomb essentially yes they don't they

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,969
don't want that on the plane so I took

101
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:51,370
all that well the rigs were in a locked

102
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:54,729
case so and I put the rigs in my

103
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,530
check-in baggage okay all the product

104
00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:00,459

105
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:03,969
carry-on it was back sealed and then in

106

and a copy of my driver's license and

108

109
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,629
thing they would see they totally went

110
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:16,600
through my bag and it went through the

111
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:19,209

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,040
harvest four strains a week out of our

166
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,930
16 strains so that we always have extra

167
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,540
non-hand and to keep in track with all

168
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,769
of that also is it's a lot of work man

169
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,750
it's things that people don't think

170
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:36,219
about is trying to keep the variety

171
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,990
coming consistently

172
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,360
because in aggro you're gonna want to

173
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,310
put let's do this whole row of Sour

174
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,050
Diesel per se just because you want that

175
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,240
whole row but then when it comes time to

176
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,740
put it on the shelf now you've got a

177
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,030
whole bunch of Sour Diesel so if

178
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,800
somebody comes to the dispensary to buy

179
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,089
product we gonna should turn a sour

180
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,639
diesel if that's all you're interested

181
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:55,929
in and then see where a wholesaler so

182
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,389
that makes it even worse

183
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,490
so the dispensary buyer comes to us and

184
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:03,370
you know we got a whole bunch of Sour

185
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,560
Diesel even if it's bomb you know

186
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,389
they're probably just gonna go on

187
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,069
so that's rain big reasons we have to

188
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,439
have a everybody like the variety that

189
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:13,000
31 flavors yeah that's what keeps them

190
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,170
coming back if you could probably if you

191
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,120
could probably sell 10 pounds of that

192
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,740
sour diesel but if you had five other

193
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,120
strains you could probably salt seven

194
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,220
pounds of each one of them just because

195
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,050
of the variety yeah yes a variety of

196
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,160
this kink that's gonna people don't

197
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,750
think about what it takes

198
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,370
I've been talking a little bit about it

199
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,569
on the show about commercial growing

200
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,160
people don't think about what it takes

201
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,290
it's good to hear you come in and talk

202
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,550
about just scheduling the clones cuz it

203
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,160
starts at the clones you got a schedule

204
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,500
two clones to know what your variety is

205
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,540
going to be in about a hundred and

206
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:45,879
twenty days yeah so it's more like

207
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:49,629
ninety four for my situation but you

208
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,610
know these don't it's yeah planning

209
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,839
preparation and then everything you do

210
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,069
this is something that I got sidetracked

211
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,139
on when I was talking with will

212
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:58,360
everything you do has to be documented

213
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,219
in metric pretty much if your scissors

214
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,439
touch a plant you have to open up a

215
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,910
computer and make a note somewhere in

216
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,668
the damn computer that something

217
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,710
happened we have one person spends 40

218
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:12,729
hours a week doing nothing but that man

219
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:15,159
yeah I know I mean that's this MacBook

220
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,509
on a cart was actually a trash can with

221
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,770
a piece of wood on top of it excited

222
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:19,659
trash bin on wheels and I pushed around

223
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:21,579
to water one of the smaller areas it was

224
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,140
like for water in small plants I put the

225
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:24,579
board on top of that and put the MacBook

226
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,829
on top of there and that was my metric

227
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:29,769
station roll that around and just do my

228
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:34,088
metric right there just made 900 clones

229
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:37,750
of this just harvested this if you cut

230
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:39,400
off so there are varying different

231
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,469
different compliance officers will tell

232
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,598
you different rules on this if you cut

233
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,640
off something on a plant it needs to be

234
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,259
weighed and documented in metric you

235
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,129
have to go to that plant tag number you

236
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:50,929
have to say I manicured

237
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:53,210
point four grams off of plant number

238
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:54,859
nine zero five five five and then you

239
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,379
have to show on camera that you

240
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,820
destroyed the part that was manicured

241
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:02,210
off the plant it's but it's very tedious

242
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,250
and metric very tedious all right so we

243
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,600
talked about dabs on a plane Jesse got

244
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,980
way I was taking [ __ ] on a plane and he

245
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,560
looks like an ogre - and they didn't

246
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,060
even then we talked about you knew gross

247
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,369
space let's talk about what we brought

248
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:14,869
you here for the main top of the G whoa

249
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,610
when we talked on Facebook you're like I

250
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,379
want to talk about reminding people to

251
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,680
clean up their gross space after the

252
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:22,879
outdoor season for sure yeah so what do

253
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,959
you want to tell us about that that is a

254
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:29,779
super good topic I mean it depends on

255
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,570
how you grow I guess but you know I'm an

256
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:37,159
organic grower kind of homestead style

257
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,690
as a term a real farmer yeah yes a term

258
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,839
I've been using lately I picked it up

259
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,040
from a person in Oregon so who should

260
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:49,070
give that person a shout-out did you

261
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:49,519
mention the podcast at all yeah I'm not

262
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,100
surprised

263
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,289
hippie Mary she lived on the coast down

264
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:59,300
the road from the place I was staying

265
00:09:54,289 --> 00:10:00,860
and it's normally not like me to go out

266
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,979
and just randomly start talking to

267
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,810
strangers but for some reason I there

268
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,490
were some huge tomato plants at her yard

269
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:09,739
that kind of attracted me to her so

270
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,120
ended up making a friend out there but

271
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,279
that's the true farmer in you

272
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,539
yeah the tomato plants made of plants

273
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,579
are done in Colorado they've been

274
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:20,199
harvested and eaten by now and she had

275
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,200
Tomatoes up there and Jessi was like oh

276
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,110
yeah no that's uh I told her how she

277
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,600
grows or how I grew she actually had a

278
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,330
couple plants out back too but uh I - I

279
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,790
told her how I grew and she called me a

280
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,800
homestead farmer so a homestead grower

281
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:41,569
so I kind of like that term I like that

282
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:44,419
it feels good sure but my situation I've

283
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:47,120
got living soil I've got a whole bunch

284
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:50,059
of plant waste the the leaves the stalks

285
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,649
all that so I've taken all of that and

286
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:55,519
ran it through a chipper into the

287
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:57,860
compost pile okay so by next you know

288
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,659
summer that will be nice black compost

289
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,310
and

290
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,439
I'll have you know all the nutrients

291
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:04,149
that we're still in it and this is the

292
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,730
this would be the third year we've done

293
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,309
this but it just all goes right back

294
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:13,569
into the system again that's awesome

295
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:15,969
so I up my soil real good I've I watered

296
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:18,429
it down real good and I've got it

297
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,160
covered with plastic to store it over

298
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:23,378
the winter um that gonna make it nice up

299
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,389
mycelium layer happened in there funk

300
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:26,889
okay on and that's a good thing you guys

301
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:28,329
when you start seeing a lot of people

302
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,919
see that white fuzz they'll make you

303
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:31,239
super soil or there or they'll make some

304
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,828
compost yeah and they see that white

305
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,180
fuzz and they freak out that's what

306
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:37,599
you're working for that's the goal that

307
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:38,979
white fuzz is magic yes sir

308
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,959
that's what's gonna make all the [ __ ]

309
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:46,930
happen covered yeah we got all that

310
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:52,599
handled the plastic is good for several

311
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:54,878
things it helps insulate the soil on

312
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,639
really cold days I mean on really cold

313
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,870
days it's it's gonna get cold

314
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,568
there's nothing you can do about that

315
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,240
but on days when it warms up and then it

316
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:07,120
cools off again it can the the warmer

317
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,259
the soil stays the more breakdown

318
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,028
happens the more healthy is alive yeah

319
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:16,539
so it protects it from that it protects

320
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:18,309
it from getting blown away drying out

321
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:21,669
and blowing you know all the precious

322
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:24,219
topsoil off and then also something I've

323
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:26,500
noticed last year is it keeps the damn

324
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,980
neighborhood cats from yeah neighborhood

325
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:33,188
cats love to piss and do their thing in

326
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,149
your in your nice fresh garden soil so

327
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:37,059
it keeps them away too

328
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:40,000
perfect yes cats probably helps keep the

329
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:44,018
birds out possibly Oh birds wouldn't be

330
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,480
so bad but yeah but yeah so I'm shaking

331
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,818
shoot into there oh yeah well that goes

332
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,670
into the compost pile so it just all

333
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:53,139
returns back to the do you use a bow

334
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,789
coffee bucket at home yes

335
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,730
before that Bokashi bucket right into

336
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:59,469
there do you have another use for it um

337
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,839
normally I put it in the compost pile or

338
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:05,769
I'll just bury it directly in one of the

339
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,420
beds okay oh nice but here lately I'm

340
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:10,000
gonna go ahead and compost it inside

341
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,829
after it's done in the bucket I'll put

342
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,970
it in a little

343
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:18,089
miniature tumblr I made and that'll be

344
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,339
to redo or make it less acidic okay and

345
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:23,399
then I'm gonna feed it to my new worm

346
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,980
inside warm bins so awesome yeah you and

347
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,600
Spence are both doing worms Barefoot's

348
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,310
doing worms everyone's going worm life

349
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,709
it's awesome I love it it's good to see

350
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,809
everybody doing worms have you tried to

351
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:35,278
use the stuff from your Bo Kashi bucket

352
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,229
the drainage that they call it the

353
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,149
leachate that's a stinky foot smell and

354
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,370
juice that comes out of there if you

355
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:43,679
have a clogged drain pour that [ __ ]

356
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,480
right down the drain like probably two

357
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,278
ounces down a clogged drain it'll

358
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,810
dissolve if you got like a hair clog or

359
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,338
whatever is in there it'll I've got

360
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:51,629
these dreadlocks down to my [ __ ]

361
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,700
knees so I get some hair clogs and

362
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:54,689
there's the drain the shower just pour

363
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,459
that in there it'll clean it right up

364
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,019
it'll stink you gotta pour it in there

365
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,278
let it soak all through a give it like

366
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,870
an hour and then just go to run the hot

367
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,730
water kind of push it down and get rid

368
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,850
of the smell it eats it right up nice

369
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:10,620
yeah remember you told me you clean the

370
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:12,870
clone machines basically dissolves all

371
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,089
the funky layer that the cloner gets

372
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,289
covered in calcium and stuff yeah you

373
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,149
guys take good care of your cloners I

374
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,439
had a cloner since I didn't clean it out

375
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,589
good enough I got clogged up and fried

376
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,760
itself so my fault yep all right we're

377
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,610
talking about compost pile sorry I

378
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,429
totally set transcended track you

379
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:33,120
another thing on that's on the bow Kashi

380
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:35,250
liquid that is basically I've been told

381
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,740
this from two people that really know

382
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:42,690
their stuff that is basically em1 yes so

383
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:46,070
it's like great white shark yes actually

384
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:49,020
yeah I've been using em1 all summer and

385
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,700
I I've been getting it from a friend

386
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,039
I've been making it myself and I'm out

387
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,140
so for the last couple weeks I've just

388
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,469
been using bo khosh II bucket juice when

389
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:03,088
I normally would use the em1 and I see

390
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:05,879
no noticeable changes it's other than

391
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:08,730
the the rotting trash can be king foot

392
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,129
smell there's such great stuff smells

393
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,070
like a a bard dumpster yeah it's bit

394
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:18,600
that has food to it somebody threw up in

395
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:20,310
yeah all right so you're composting all

396
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,740
of your stocks all of your big leaves

397
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:24,179
that aren't usable for any product it's

398
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,730
all going into the compost pile

399
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:28,229
chicken shits in there nitrogen all your

400
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,450
food waste that you've been eating all

401
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,339
the time goes into your Bo Kashi bucket

402
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,259
so you're making fertilizer out of that

403
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,510
that gets buried we've got our soil

404
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,189
covered up got the soil covered up you

405
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:40,110
can actually breathe em if you're you

406
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:43,110
know I'm not necessarily no-till wearing

407
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,690
that so you can go ahead and actually

408
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,300
re-emit now and put all your amendments

409
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,190
you would put it in the spring and it

410
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:51,838
just makes everything better how much of

411
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,279
that old root ball do I need to get out

412
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,440
of there before I do that I leave all

413
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,088
over them you just chop the stick and

414
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,060
then kind of dig another hole later

415
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:02,610
yeah and yeah if you keep the soil wet

416
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,039
and active throughout the winter in the

417
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,300
span the early spring there will be no

418
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,219
root ball when you come back to it

419
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,929
everything if you let it dry out and you

420
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,180
don't cover it the root ball will still

421
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:13,789
very much be there okay okay keep it

422
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,109
moist in the earth we'll eat it yeah

423
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:19,919
reassimilate it turn back in the booth

424
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:22,519
okay all right so you can read now in

425
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,539
the winter and that stuff will hopefully

426
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,769
rebuttal colonize and keep producing

427
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:27,389
itself right then you'll have even more

428
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:30,120
potent soil by the time it's time to

429
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:31,528
grow outdoors yep okay so and then at

430
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,409
that point the only things I would add

431
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:37,320
in would just be like kelp and alfalfa

432
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:41,100
things that are they're gonna break down

433
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:44,370
all the way through to where you know

434
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,589
there's basically none left for it so

435
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,269
you know go ahead and hit Hayes really

436
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,209
stumbled all over that's early

437
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:54,569
go ahead when you plant go ahead and do

438
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:57,000
like a micro eyes that inoculant and

439
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,410
then add a little kelp and this is when

440
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,299
you're landing yeah I'll kind of little

441
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:02,789
alfalfa to the soil I'm getting ready to

442
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,859
roll so nice we can talk more about that

443
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,779
later shows yeah we're definitely gonna

444
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,129
record a whole bunch of outdoor episodes

445
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:10,678
for next year so that we've got them

446
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,420
prepared yeah we were both so busy this

447
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,160
year yeah these big commercial girls

448
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,860
keep us on our feet my summer next year

449
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,750
is looking to be even busier how do you

450
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,838
already know that

451
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:24,439
well because it's only a few months away

452
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:26,970
that is true so yeah that's after

453
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,569
November well we'll know if it's got to

454
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,118
happen

455
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:31,858
so we're just wait until then but we

456
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:35,788
have an out and this is a whole nother

457
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:37,918
outfit we we have an outline we have

458
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:40,259
property they have licensing everything

459
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,859
like that so excellently waiting to pull

460
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,690
the trigger

461
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:44,398
everything you seem to get involved in

462
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,019
seems to take off and go to get a good

463
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:49,079
launch so yeah I'm sure it's gonna work

464
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:50,579
for you I've been uh yeah I stumble into

465
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,499
all these startups it's kind of weird

466
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:53,849
because you're a guy they can get [ __ ]

467
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:55,919
done and people need somebody like you

468
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:58,558
they can get [ __ ] done true yeah and the

469
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,629
girl store doesn't hurt either and I

470
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,999
know how to grow and I know how I know

471
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:04,949
how to do things but I don't know as

472
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:07,348
much on how to get [ __ ] done as you do

473
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,269
so I need a guy like you to [ __ ]

474
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:10,589
build the walls and build the tables and

475
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:12,358
then once you get the tables built and I

476
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,428
can come in and build the watering

477
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,648
system and run the plants that's why

478
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:19,048
you're on the move and I'm on the move

479
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:20,699
yeah we run it a few times they decided

480
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:22,408

off and go somewhere else and Jesse

483
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:26,788
couldn't rebuild then I'll come back and

484
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:28,649

will wait till this November to decide

497
00:18:58,618 --> 00:19:02,728
if that's gonna happen

498
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,959
there's an election coming up we may get

499
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:05,609
a president that doesn't want medical

500
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,919
cannabis or recreational cannabis at all

501
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:10,408
that may might put a kibosh on some of

502
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,538
our plans but more locally what jesse is

503
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:14,609
talking about we have amendment 200 and

504
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:17,729
amendment 300 here in Pueblo Colorado

505
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:19,949
if those pass the marijuana industry in

506
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:23,788
Pueblo Colorado will be forced to shut

507
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:26,278
down in 17 they get a full year D to

508
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:28,769
keep going but after that it's over so

509
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:30,148
no new licenses he's not like these

510
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:32,109
people even though they have a license

511
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:36,069
they've never grown before

512
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:39,159
and and it's kind of a change of

513
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:40,689
location for him to so they went under

514
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,960
the new proposal they wouldn't be able

515
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:46,150
to let it happen yeah good luck I hope

516

some kelp and some alfalfa meal and then

570
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:45,220
when it comes time for season we're

571

572
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,850

576
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,870
themselves themselves yeah guys get the

577
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,300
worms going the worms are so if you've

578
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:03,789
got the compost pile you know by all

579
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:05,470
means use it up so that yeah put that in

580
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,909
there put that in your holes so that

581
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,930
sounds so gross but then in the holes

582
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,150
where you're planning your plants so

583
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:12,039
that all that compost that rich compost

584
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,380
can feed those plants even if you're

585
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,849
sorry to cut you know go far even if

586
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,190
you're grown in pots you can still

587
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:20,980
utilize that that compost even if you're

588
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,830
using salt based chemical nutrients you

589
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,539
can still utilize yes I love the trend

590
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:28,000
that I'm seeing on Instagram and social

591
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:30,159
media and even the forums of people

592
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,809
they're recycling soil and running

593
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,779
no-till and you're seeing them top dress

594
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:36,789
and decorate their plants to keep like a

595
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:39,099
layer in their tour they can keep the

596
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,899
moisture in putting stuff like alfalfa

597
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:42,669
sprouts and other sprouts on top of

598
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,440
there and I'm loving the way that it

599
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,390
looks in a nice indoor garden with these

600
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,460
there's other growth on top of your play

601
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,960
a little little eco sphere on top of

602
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,299
your plant there sure and then you got a

603
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,950
pot plant growing out of it and out of

604
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,109
it is dying and actually feeding your

605
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,850
plant it's such a it's such a neat

606
00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:00,189
little thing to learn and see happen

607
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:02,529
it's like a miniature environment yeah

608
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,039
it's that permaculture is that the word

609
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:05,190
I'm looking for

610
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,889
no they'd be no-till which is a

611
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:12,519
permaculture value but permaculture is

612
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:15,190
hard to wrangle into one set you know

613
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:18,369
one definition okay it's just a way of

614
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:20,470
looking at things so I learned something

615
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:22,000
today all right so we've got our plants

616
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,440
so now we're still at the end of the

617
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,490
season let's keep ourselves kind of on

618
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,750
track we're at the end of the season

619
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,710
we've cleaned up we've got our compost

620
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,420
pile everything's chipped up

621
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,009
everything's covered we put some stuff

622
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,519
where the old plants were now what

623
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:35,379
should we focus on other than that

624
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,960
cleaning up your trash you know

625
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,850
inevitable every grows got a little bit

626
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,940
you know

627
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:44,980
beer bottles or you know old netting dr.

628

exact wrapper yeah get get all that [ __ ]

630
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,839
cleaned up it looks bad

631
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,730
get your cages put away if you use those

632
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:58,869
if you're netting or whatever get that

633
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:00,819
I'll put up any kind of shade cloth if

634
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:02,408
you want to reuse it next year you need

635
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:04,658
to store it away and get it out of the

636
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:06,519
weather same with like your water

637
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:08,379
barrels your air pumps any kind of

638
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,298
liquid nutrients you had outside you

639
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:12,579
need to get all that inside and in a

640
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:15,128
warm place you know and don't bring it

641
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:15,308
inside to your grow area yeah don't do

642
00:24:15,128 --> 00:24:17,048
that

643
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:19,019
don't bring the bugs and mildew into

644
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:21,490
your garden put it in the shed outside

645
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:23,169
clean it if you can take some time and

646
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,240

650
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,740
same thing but the thirty percent

651
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,419

652
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,048

00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:54,039
like some pine oil and some or something

661
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:57,819
like that in it would that's gonna kill

662
00:24:54,038 --> 00:25:01,179
anything so you know yeah I like the dr.

663

665
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:05,199
it's perfect

666
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:06,459
alright so clean up get out there and

667
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,600
clean everything up take all the

668
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,819
equipment out of there make it look like

669
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:14,618
there was never a grow there yeah okay

670
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:16,359
if you're if you grow in pots and you

671
00:25:14,618 --> 00:25:17,740
want to reuse all your soil even if

672
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,928
you're not if you're growing pots and

673
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,659
you're not reusing your soil throw it

674
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:24,820
away like you know it's just if you had

675
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:27,369
any issues they're still lingering there

676
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:29,618
you know if you are gonna reuse it get

677
00:25:27,368 --> 00:25:32,230
it all in a pile get it wet cover it

678
00:25:29,618 --> 00:25:33,788
with plastic it's the same principle we

679
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,249
were talking about with covering the

680
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:39,940
with the raised beds and everything so

681
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:43,179
you know if we had some fungus gnats or

682
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,558
powdery mildew is that going to be kind

683
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:47,619
of destroyed in the composting process

684
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,898
order or is that kind of compound fungus

685
00:25:47,618 --> 00:25:51,470
gnats if you get it heated if you get

686
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:52,849
the pile heated up enough

687
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,788
which means you've got to add a

688
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:57,888
considerable amount of raw green

689
00:25:55,788 --> 00:26:00,230
material and just organic matter to it

690
00:25:57,888 --> 00:26:02,209
for it to heat back up it will most

691
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,149
definitely kill the fungus now okay

692
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,220
powdery mildew I have no idea okay so

693
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:08,418
now we might we might be killing

694
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,829
ourselves trying to do both because I

695
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:11,809
think if you put the green in there

696
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:13,609
the PML girl in the green but I don't

697
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:15,678
think the PM can grow on things that are

698
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:18,168
not leafy for sure well I mean green

699
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,940
matter could even be like green manure I

700
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:23,028
mean a guy he could be cow shed it could

701
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,909
be anything that's gonna heat up grass

702
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:27,440
clippings if he feels it leaves an old

703
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:31,129
pot leaves yeah okay

704
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,480
I mean poop yeah oh yeah chicken poop is

705
00:26:31,128 --> 00:26:34,308
just such a great amendment I know it's

706
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,839
funny that I say that because I'm a

707
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:37,398
vegetarian I don't even eat the chickens

708
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,740
but I've noticed that when chicken poop

709
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:41,178
goes into a compost goes into plants it

710
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,609
really does something and then see bird

711
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:45,710
poop also yeah any sort of sea bird poop

712
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:48,589
anything from the sea is really really

713
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:51,350
rich oh I love the way see stuff gross

714
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:54,019
yeah it's that's why that Kush smells so

715
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:56,599
good see Kanaks if I ever had to label

716
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:58,429
the way I like to grow you know that's

717
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:00,048
Sikh annexes you want me to edit that

718
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:01,548
out to know that nobody steals that cuz

719
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:03,740
that's it might be a phrase you want it

720
00:27:01,548 --> 00:27:05,450
no because there may be someone on the

721
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,519
coast that's like way more worthy of

722
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,500
easing that I'm not worried about it

723
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,870
some girl around the coast that wants to

724
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:15,429
make some sea but you better be getting

725
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:15,428
like your own kelp in your home purchase

726
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:21,069
impress me don't do that you did not

727
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:23,359
hear that

728
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:25,428
man there's kelp laying all over the

729
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,329
beach in Oregon if it's okay you're

730
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:29,269
probably gonna get in trouble if you

731
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:31,278
collect it I don't organ it stinks okay

732
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:33,200
yeah I'm pretty sure people wouldn't

733
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,990
mind get it put in some bottles and ship

734
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,460
the first tester batches to Jesse I'd

735
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,059
love to try it rinse all the salt off

736
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:44,900
first please

737
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:49,500
please I could just see the plants just

738
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:51,570
forget to rinse the kelp we are way off

739
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,680
topic but we are still on topic it's

740
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,269
amazing how we do it

741
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,920
clean this is something I deal with

742
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:56,910
every year and I [ __ ] did it this

743
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,789
year

744
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:02,700
clean out your your outdoor spray

745
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:04,230
bottles because like mine have T's go

746
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,569
through it which has a lot of molasses

747
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,400
and they always clog up oh yeah and then

748
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:09,750
in the spring I'm just like [ __ ] and

749
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,970
end up throwing it away and go and get

750
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,400
in the new pumping you guys ready yeah I

751
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,589
cleaned them all out with super hot

752
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,570
water this year I'm good to go for next

753
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:19,859
year you guys by the pump sprayers that

754
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:22,769
have the nozzle on it where you can

755
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:24,000
release the pressure with you want to be

756
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:25,259
able to release that pressure because

757
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,539
otherwise you'll pump it up real hard

758
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,190
and the [ __ ] the nozzle gets stuck

759
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,440
you'll never get it off of there now you

760
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,880
can't refill it and you just throw it

761
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,019
away because you'll try to pop it open

762
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,400
with something you're gonna break it

763
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,740
some of the plastic somewhere will spin

764
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,060
or trust me get there with the kind the

765
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,130
type that happens the pressure release

766
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:42,210
valve so you can once it's pumped up and

767
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,880
pressurized you can take that pressure

768
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:48,029
off it's really scary trying to undo it

769
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,340
when you got like neem oil in there you

770
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:52,289
don't just spray up in your face I saw

771
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:54,209
that happen with someone that had a tank

772
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:56,700
full of for might once oh god I could

773
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,289
backpack tank oh they're pumping it

774
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,920
pumping it and they didn't have that lid

775
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:05,639
screwed on all the way right yeah that

776
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,410
was back before anyone well lots of

777
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,330
people knew better but we didn't yeah

778
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:11,970
before we knew that floor might was a

779
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:13,769
no-go if you got to do something if you

780
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,539
get a brand new clone and it came from

781
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:17,009
somebody and you really really want it

782
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:19,619
but it might have something hit it if

783
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:22,170
you need to mother that out take clones

784
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:23,879
from that yeah go smoke in the Florham I

785
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,769
did one at least try to get a generation

786
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,710
from there alright so we've cleaned up

787
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:30,150
everything we've got we want to cover up

788
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,960
the holes for night the area for next

789
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,030
year do you just want to leave it

790
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,039
exposed oh you want that cover okay

791
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:36,420
cover that up so that all the stuff can

792
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,129
process in there get some heat in there

793
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,990
you got your compost pile going

794
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,220
we got everything cleaned up it doesn't

795
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,079
even look like a girl happened in that

796
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,059
yard or that field anymore right yeah

797
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,279
just make it look nice and good yeah and

798
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:48,899
it's all it's a clean slate for you to

799
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,339
go back next year and then as soon as

800
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,150
the snow melts and you're thinking about

801
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:53,799
growing the next thing to do is

802
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,259
there and fix all of the holes in your

803
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:57,970
fences and go check that fence go make

804
00:29:56,259 --> 00:30:00,309
sure that that thing is super secure go

805

809
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:10,869
out there as soon as it gets warm that's

810
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:12,819
the stuff you got to do then and uh I

811
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:15,819
mean to pick depending on how serious

812
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:17,710
you get I actually I know of a couple

813
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:21,279
people that are already growing their

814
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:25,180
plants for next season but you know if

815
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:28,569
you're a small you know 25 35 plant or

816
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:30,670
less outdoor grow you can get away with

817
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:33,189
you know you can start your plants in

818
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,509
February probably if you're growing from

819
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,090
seed and you want to do a female

820
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:38,589
selection I suggest starting now but if

821
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:41,649
you're grown from clones

822
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:43,179
you know February you can start you know

823
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,450
start them up if you're going for trees

824
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,580
so start them up get huge you don't live

825
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,710
and I don't let them get root bound and

826
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:52,269
I ever yeah cuz they will start to

827
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:54,430
flower on you they will start flowering

828
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,990
so bedroom inside get them big top them

829
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,720
get them loved don't let them get root

830
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,640
bound to the pest free don't run yeah

831
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,400
keep them pest free do not run them on a

832
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,590
24 hour light unless you plan on putting

833
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,540
them outside underneath the 24 hour like

834
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:09,909
see I would have never thought of that

835
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:12,549
yeah yeah I mean if you got a hoop house

836
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:14,320
and you can run a little all it takes is

837
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:17,799
like just a little fluorescent right if

838
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:19,569
you can do that sure go for 24 but in my

839
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:23,740
experience running them 24 and then

840
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:26,289
putting them outside under not 24 is it

841
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,420
just it either stunts them out sativas

842
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:30,609
it'll throw them into bloom

843
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,880
I mean indicas it'll throw them into

844
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:36,339
bloom you know so just and then then you

845
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,620
get two weeks of going into bloom and

846
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:40,149
then going back into veg and then edging

847
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:41,529
and then going back into flower and then

848
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,420
he got plans to just look like hell and

849
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:46,569
they're mad and you have a very funky

850
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:50,789
looking plan yeah and your trimmers hate

851
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:52,750
you maybe some seed maybe some seeds man

852
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:54,069
is there anything else that we should

853
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,450
mention when it comes to cleaning up

854
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:58,679
your garden at the end of the season to

855
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:01,960
prepare for the winter and the next year

856
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,440
nothing major if you have locks on gates

857
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,720
or something like that

858
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,180
put them inside unless they need to be

859
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,350
out there but it just keeps them from at

860
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,299
least around here it keeps them from

861
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:14,599
getting arrested up and crap like that

862
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:16,159
so just a lot of the things I do is so

863
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,649
that I don't have to spend money on it

864
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,110
the next year and so that my tools last

865
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:23,870
awesome or you know first several years

866
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:25,819
not just one season at a time so I think

867
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:27,409
a lot of that comes with age or getting

868
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:32,089
older for sure we're getting tired of

869
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:38,150
buying the same damn hammer I left it

870
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:42,769
out somewhere if you leave it somewhere

871
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:44,390
