169
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:10,199
events it has to stay in the confines of

170
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,520
that regulated building

171
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,080
so they can't take that cannabis there

172
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:16,240
which means the dispensaries the large

173
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,719
dispensaries that have paid a lot of

174
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,439
money for booths can now cannot go

175
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,840
display their product um typically these

176
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,560
booths would be smoking you down with

177
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,638
dabs they'd be smoking you down with

178
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,918
flowers there would be a line you would

179
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,360
get to taste all of the major

180
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:34,879
dispensaries and Colorado's products now

181
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,160
the me is saying no you cannot do that

182
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,800
they have also said that they're going

183
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,120
to be there in force to enforce this to

184
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,038
make sure this happens that's not in

185
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,120
this letter that's just the talk around

186
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,038
this letter they have verified yes we're

187
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,759
not [ __ ] around we're coming to to

188
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,519
kind of put some pressure on you then

189
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,479
there's that short paragraph uh medical

190
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,560
or retail marijuana lensey owners or

191
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,359
employees should not use personally

192
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,399
purchased flour or products as a mean to

193
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,560
avoid the intent of the statute and

194
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,598
regulation prohibiting off premises

195
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,360
display and sale of marijuana now that

196
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,800
sounds like a lot of weirdness if you

197
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,038
don't catch on to what that says that

198
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,038
means that if a dispensary owner knows a

199
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,560
private grower like myself I'm a private

200
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,279
grower I have a private caregiver grow

201
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,800
he cannot buy a pound of product from me

202
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:21,559
and put it in his dispensary display at

203
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,319
the Cannabis Cup he cannot do that uh

204
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,199
should not use personally purchased

205
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:30,800
flower or product as a means to avoid

206
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:32,199
the intent so if they find product there

207
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,680
you're they're going to be upset about

208
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,520
it you're going to be in violation some

209
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,038
way because you're violating either the

210
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,918
transportation law and taking it out of

211
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,839
the closed system that they have

212
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,839
invented here or you're going to be in

213
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,878
violation because you have now purchased

214
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,598
some outside system cannabis and brought

215
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,840
it into the system so they're definitely

216
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,158
going to find a way to screw us let me

217
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,038
find page two that's what I'm kind of

218
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:54,000
stumbling into here there we go all

219
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,439
right oh there was another paragraph on

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,680
the end of page one that I have to start

221
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,879
with let's find that it says but in

222
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,560
order to diminish the

223
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,199
uh potential for improper conduct at an

224
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,000
event or festival Colorado lenes are

225
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,639
strongly encouraged to locate any Booth

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,120
or exhibit table in an area away from

227
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,000
separated oh in an area away from and

228
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,280
separated from any area designated for

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,839
consumption of marijuana similarly

230
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,038
lenses are encouraged to avoid any

231
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:25,439
participation in which the ly might

232
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,878
appear to be facilitating potentially

233
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,038
illegal conduct so they know that

234
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,599
there's going to be consumption at some

235
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,718
of these EV and they're saying that they

236
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:36,918
want you if you are an Meed regulated

237
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,240
business you need to be uh locate any

238
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:42,120
Booth or exhibit table in any area away

239
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,799
from and separated from any area

240
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,919
designated for consumption consumption

241
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,359
so they're pretty much saying get the

242
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,278
[ __ ] away from all the Cannabis stuff

243
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,200
where people are smoking go far far away

244
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:52,320
from

245
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,879
that um the last I heard High Times

246
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,000
cancelled the medical portion of their

247
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,078
party at the Cannabis Cup this year

248
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,440
because um they're putting this pressure

249
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:01,799
on it and they can't get they couldn't

250
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,079
get enough medical entries is what

251
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,719
somebody told me is why they were doing

252
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:07,000
it this kind of makes sense now what

253
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,600
they used to do was they would have a

254
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,360
special building designated just for the

255
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,440
medical entries and it doesn't seem like

256
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,240
they're doing that now but I'm going to

257
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:19,680
keep reading this a pursuant to CRS 12-

258
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,720
43.3 d901 do you guys really want to

259
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,319
hear all these numbers I'm going to skip

260
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
that uh it is unlawful for a person to

261
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,200
buy sell transfer giveway or acquire

262
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,959
medical marijuana retail marijuana or

263
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,560
retail marijuana products except as

264
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:33,479
allowed uh pursuing to these articles or

265
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,958
section 16 of article uh Roman numerals

266
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,039
of the State Constitution sorry I'm

267
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,958
trying to get past that part quickly uh

268
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,719
conduct outside of the protections of

269
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,599
the licens and regulated market under

270
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,360
CRS title 12 or authorized under

271
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,079
amendments 20 or 64 May trigger criminal

272
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,720
liability under CRS Title 18 to include

273
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,838
unlawful dispensing sale and

274
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,320
distribution of marijuana or marijuana

275
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,519
concentrate which means if you're there

276
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,399
giving away cannabis as a booth they can

277
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,639
uh arrest for unlawful distribution of

278
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,240
marijuana uh or marijuana concentrate

279
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,639
and then it continues to say the Meed

280
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,839
will continue to work with Colorado

281
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,679
lenses to promote a strong and legi

282
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,160
legitimate regulatory framework for the

283
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,359
Colorado marijuana industry me will hold

284
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,399
both businesses and individual marijuana

285
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,800
lenses responsible for violations of

286
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,480
State statutes and regulations failure

287
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,199
to abide by the state uh the statutes

288
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,120
and regulations may result in a range of

289
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,240
sanctions up to including the suspension

290
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,919
and revocation of marijuana business or

291
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,480
occupational licenses is in addition to

292
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:35,240
possible criminal charges and penalties

293
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,000
so what they're saying there is

294
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,480
everybody that works in an me regulated

295
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,639
facility has to have an me badge which

296
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,240
uh mine should be sitting on the table

297
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,519
there there it is um it's a little green

298
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,720
badge it's got your picture on it it's

299
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,600
got your name on it and it says

300
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,399
marijuana enforcement Division and then

301
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
there are three different colors there

302
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,839
are support badges which are like

303
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,799
usually the trimmers the bud tenders and

304
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,560
stuff and then there are key badges

305
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,919
which are like um uh people that make

306
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,599
decisions is B basically how that goes

307
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:06,039
uh

308
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,480

00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,199
and those are bright red uh you only see

312
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,159
those very rarely but they're saying

313
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,240
that if you get caught doing something

314
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,600
stupid at this event they will revoke uh

315
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,000
not only the business license but

316
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,680
they're going to take away the employee

317
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,278
Meed badge license which is kind of

318
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,638
sketchy too so guys if you're out there

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,399
douge if you don't know douge from

335
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,958
Hitman Glass say what's up to him at the

336
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,278
Cannabis Cup give him a high five I

337
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,879
might put this episode out a couple of

338
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:06,000
days early just so that you can hear

339
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:09,600
this before the cup you know this is cup

340
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,320
day here but happy 420 anyway um douge

341
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,278
raises the question uh in Colorado here

342
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,839
their goal was to regulate alcohol or

343
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,320
regulate cannabis like

344
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,199
alcohol now this does not seem like the

345
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,040
fair way to do it right because when you

346
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:26,759
go to any event in Colorado you see Kors

347
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,838
everywhere you see Budweiser it's Kors

348
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,399
everywhere because we got a lot of Kors

349
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,920
breweries here but you see Kors you see

350
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,039
bud you see fat tire you see so many

351
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,639
beer ads everywhere you go in Colorado

352
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,599
and if you go to like the food festivals

353
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,759
if you go to a football game a baseball

354
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,440
game there are beer ads now what's wrong

355
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,519
with having cannabis people cannabis

356
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,160
businesses at cannabis events if we're

357
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,078
going to go do beer events where we

358
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,679
serve beer everywhere it's just unfair I

359
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:54,919
think it's hypocritical it's not what we

360
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,319
asked for it's not what we voted for we

361
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:59,399
need to find a way the big flaw in all

362
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,160
the Colorado laws in my opinion is we

363
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,759
can buy cannabis we can grow cannabis we

364
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,319
can possess cannabis we can have

365
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,519
cannabis but the only place you're

366
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,560
really allowed to consume cannabis is in

367
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,240
your own home that's the only legal

368
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,799
Place uh in the privacy or another

369
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,720
person's home or in a private place and

370
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,759
we've tried to have events that we have

371
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,160
called private but then once the cops

372
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,799
show up they call it public and we can't

373
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,039
have our dab events or smoke outs there

374
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,319
anymore so that's the flaw in our law is

375
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,958
having somewh legal to smoke and being

376
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,440
able to have these booths come and bring

377
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,759
their wees and advertise heavily kind of

378
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,199
sucks that they're cracking down this

379
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,559
might be this year could set a precedent

380
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:37,879
for how the cups are going to go in the

381
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,958
future they may change things um I hope

382
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:40,278
it goes well guys if you're going to the

383
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,679

616
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,038
going to rant here for a minute again

617
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:37,918
about 16 days ago I got a major

618
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:40,400
concussion I don't think it yeah it was

619
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,400
about 16 days ago say I can't even count

620
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,559
uh I've talked about it on the show I

621
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,000
didn't realize but I hit my head twice I

622
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:47,678
told you guys I hit my head right but I

623
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,278
hit my head but then I fell down some

624
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,880
stairs and at the bottom of the stairs I

625
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:52,038
hit my head again and I just found on

626
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,080
the back of my head a few days ago I

627
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:57,720
found a nice well on the back there too

628
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,639
um I was a lot more [ __ ] up than I

629
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,839
realized you guys I recorded two

630
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,278
podcasts with Mike and Adam that are

631
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,240
fuzzy to me I don't a lot of that stuff

632
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:08,200
that guy talking wasn't completely Rost

633
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,480
a Jeff that's kind of my subconscious

634
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,798
doing its weird [ __ ] on those episodes

635
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,720
uh the show with can adventure with

636
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,918
Rusty and Rob I feel like I was kind of

637
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,480
getting my [ __ ] back together but there

638
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:18,640
are moments uh in that podcast where I

639
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,960
don't know what the [ __ ] was going on to

640
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,400
tell you the truth I hope you guys

641
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,079
couldn't tell I hope the show's been all

642
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
right uh but I'm kind of feeling like

643
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,240
I'm getting back together uh my brain is

644
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,640
kind of unscrambling itself sometimes I

645
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,919
forget get dumb stuff like uh when I

646
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,038
leave my house if I'm going to certain

647
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,360
people's houses I have to think about

648
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:36,919
when I pull out of the driveway which

649
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,038
way should I go it used to be

650
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:39,159
subconscious if you're going to this

651
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:40,278
guy's house you turn left if you're

652
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:41,840
going to his you turn right now I have

653
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:43,278

people were afraid of medical cannabis

for a long time but it seems like people

715

are uh kind of getting excited about it

716

$2 million in 2014 the first year of

recreational pot sales in Colorado in

748

00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,720

313.2 million for recreational Cannabis

752
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,720
projections based on the first two

753
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,960
months of 2015's recreational and

754
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,919
medical numbers suggest that Colorado

755
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,319
will sell more marijuana and collect

756
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:34,120
more in pot related taxes in 2015 than

757
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:38,079
it did in

758
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:39,599
2014 you know I can support that um I'm

759
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,759
uh I'm the grower at the spot now and

760
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,199
we're still working on the grows and

761
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:44,440
getting everything in place but I'm

762
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,038
there often in meetings and talking

763
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,000
about where to put this and how to do

764
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,558
that and where we're going to do

765
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,079
everything and who's going to do what

766
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:52,918
but uh when I'm there I see the sales

767
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:55,599
happening and they are getting busier

768
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,559
than ever busier than ever and I also

769
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,959
hang out excuse me I also hang out with

770
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:01,398
my good friends at green and healthy

771
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,558
wellness and I see those guys getting

772
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:06,000
busier than ever so more and more people

773
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,278
are buying cannabis and there are more

774
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,079
shops popping up and with more shops

775
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:13,798
popping up around us and the spot

776
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,798
staying as busy as it is uh that tells

777
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,519
me that all those other shops have to be

778
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:19,599
selling stuff too CU people go check out

779
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,480
new places and I feel like a lot of the

780
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,038
people that come from at ofate they know

781
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,839
they can only buy seven grams at one

782
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,519
shop so they probably go visit several

783
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,038
shops and in my area there are a lot of

784
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,839

neighborhoods by fixing campaign Flyers

817
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,278
to pizza boxes before they're sent out

818
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,640
to customers calari says he printed

819
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,119
5,000 campaign flyers for the boxes

820
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,080
enough to last about two weeks at the

821
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:46,798
pizza shops the pizza the piece pictures

822
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:49,319
khed Bari under the words I'm a real

823
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,240
person he's running against four others

824
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:53,558
for two at large seats in the May 5th

825
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,000
election in cment Debbie Ortega and

826
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:59,158
Robin knich are fellow Challengers uh

827
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,398
Joe Sylvia and Jeffrey Washington oh and

828
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,919
fellow Challengers sorry I read that

829
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:03,959
word wrong and fellow Challengers Joe

830
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,480
Silva and Jeffrey

831
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,558
Washington so far Khaled Bari excuse me

832
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,159
I got to take a drink my throat's all

833
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:10,158
clogged up let's go for some water this

834
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:11,080
time I think that root beer is what

835
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,159
clogged

836
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:15,798
me all right that's better so far karari

837
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,799
who also co-owns Denver Relief the

838
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:19,158
city's oldest marijuana dispensary has

839
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,278
raised some eyebrows among fellow

840
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:23,000
candidates by missing candidate forms

841
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:24,839
though he says he had conflicts and

842
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,398
plans to begin participating in some

843
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,558
upcoming events his pizza box Flyers are

844
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,918
unorthodox campaigning where it gets a

845
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:33,398
little squishy is that under Denver

846
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:35,519
election code calari must report sexy

847
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,918
pizzas seating of the cardboard real

848
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,200
estate and arguably the delivery service

849
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,480
as an in-kind

850
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,640
contribution he says he plans to do so

851
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,558
but it's unclear what that's worth

852
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,320
Denver leads it up leaves it up to

853
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,398
candidates to assign a fair market value

854
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,359
that's reasonable Khaled Bari says he's

855
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,918
mulling that over and will probably rate

856
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:57,359
the value at a penny or two per flyer or

857
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,799
$50 to $100 total on his next campaign

858
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,519
Finance report

859
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,759
he says that's reasonable because he's

860
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:05,359
used sexy pizza's boxes uh sexy sexy

861
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,079
pizza's boxes to promote his other

862
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,278
businesses including Denver Relief and

863
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,720
sex spot comedy shows as well as

864
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,558
partners events at no charge he pointed

865
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,759
out that his campaign volunteers not

866
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,158
sexy pizza employees are attaching the

867
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,919
Flyers to the boxes in advance so

868
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,640
technically he's not really using the uh

869
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,360
pizza shop employees he's using his own

870
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:28,799
guys so he's not using the pizza shop as

871
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:30,119
like slave labor uh yeah that's uh

872
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,639
political crap you have to worry about

873
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:35,000
so perhaps it was inevitable that cabari

874
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,159
would attempt such Synergy in his run

875
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,558
for Denver city council this is after

876
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:40,000
all the same guy who tried to make a

877
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,319
point and mock Governor John

878
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,200
Hickenlooper a former beer brewer who

879
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,720
opposed pot legalization by following

880
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,000
him around in a chicken suit and there's

881
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,440
a picture of this dude in a chicken suit

882
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,519
smoking a spliff on a couch it's pretty

883
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,200
funny then it says but his mailers his

884
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,640
mailor strike a more serious tone

885
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,600
highlighting khed Bar's business

886
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,600
experience as an entrepreneur who

887
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,558
started or helped start several local

888
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:02,038
businesses and making the claim I have

889
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,319
more business experience than all

890
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,038
current city council members combined

891
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,720
he's careful to mention his ownership of

892
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:11,879
the marijuana shop in passing below his

893
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,319
support for LGBT and transgender gender

894
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,360
transgendered rights and his position as

895
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:19,000
an opponent of greedy developers he's

896
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,678
drawn more serious fundraising support

897
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,720
lately out outraising the other four

898
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,798
candidates in March by collecting $

899
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,960
22,38 though he still Trails the

900
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,638
incumbent overall total

901
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,240
significantly

902
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:35,599
uh that this article is written weird

903
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,000
right here it hard to say it is hard to

904
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,519
say if he's rounding up enough support

905
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
to threaten Ortega or nich on May 5th

906
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,240
but caliari always exudes confidence he

907
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,359
noted that the pizza box Flyers amount

908
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,880
to a fraction of his efforts we're going

909
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:50,839
to end up doing right around 70,000

910
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,600
mailers he said they're going to go to

911
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:55,278
various demographics and we're making a

912
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:56,839
couple thousand phone calls the social

913
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,839
media is really what I'm getting a kick

914
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:01,439
out of right now so this article was

915
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:03,119
first published on the denverpost.com I

916
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,480
think it's great that this guy who is

917
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,038
part owner of a dispensary owns a pizza

918
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,319
joint and is running for office in

919
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,558
Denver is attaching his Flyers to pizza

920
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,678
boxes you're hitting your target

921
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:15,480

as productive as you can be so that

956

957
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,079
