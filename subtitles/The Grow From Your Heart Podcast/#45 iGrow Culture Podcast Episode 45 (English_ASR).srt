I'm going to try to put it back on track

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,400
um I want to mention something I

76
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,158
mentioned it's the holiday season iTunes

77
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,560
sent me me an email and they say that

78
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:06,399
there will be a delay in podcast posting

79
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,199
between December 22nd and January 5th

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,039
which will affect this episode and

81
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,399
possibly another episode I will post

82
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,798
them early I'll try to get them we're

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,519
recording on a Thursday the show comes

84
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,519
out on a Monday I'll try to put it up

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,400
like Saturday night and hopefully

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,200
that'll give iTunes time to do whatever

87
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,560
it is they're doing I'm not sure why

88
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,560
they choose to do that around Christmas

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,199
time people love it early they can love

90
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,719
it early yeah if it makes it it may not

91
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,719

four days and you know it sounds great

144
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,198

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,000
okay uh I don't want to give exact units

164
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,759
but it's still single digit units

165
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,879
so sounds like you're a busy man yeah

166
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,759
putting in the house there was nothing

167
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,199
there and the guy that was there doing

168
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,479
it um was there all alone and I mean I

169
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,520
don't know if you've ever tried to do

170
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,879
construction all alone but it's hard you

171
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,918
can't really do a lot of construction by

172
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,038
yourself you're just slow cutting and

173
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:24,038
doing and cutting and doing measure

174
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,399
twice cut once nail it up measure twice

175
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:26,478
cut once and then you need someone to

176
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,638
help it's easier if you got someone to

177
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,279
help you hold the [ __ ] right when he

178
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,879
told me I literally laughed at him I was

179
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,679
like

180
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,719
that's great uh but we you know that's

181
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,840
it's good job I can't I can't [ __ ] and

182
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,720
hopefully it holds out through the end

183
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,159
of the month cuz I really needed the

184
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,160
stuff for the kids in Christmas oh it's

185
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,680
good timing right good Christmas check I

186
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,240
I was kind of busy today myself dude

187
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,720
today I want to give a big shout out to

188
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,199
my homie Spence uh Spence and I have

189
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,599
been talking about me learning how to

190
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,080
make dabs because I smoke a lot of hash

191
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:59,038
and I grow my own herb I am sufficient

192
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,000
all the way from I can create my own

193
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,839
seed seeds I can germinate I can grow

194
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,720
the seeds I can Harvest it I can trim it

195
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,638
then I've got the product that is done

196
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,400
is flowers and trim and then I like to

197
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,319
smoke Dabs so I had to learn how to turn

198
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,439
that into the dabs I want today SP

199
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,039
Spence spent about four or five hours

200
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:15,959
teaching me how to do that we ran a

201
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,878
couple of batches I got to run some

202
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,799
tubes myself uh I've got all the way up

203
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,199
to uh the point when we put it in the v

204
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,360
oven I understand all of that and I

205
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,360
understand the back oven I just don't

206
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,960
know the controls on the oven very well

207
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,520
myself once I get that comfortable I

208
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,959
think I can make pretty good shatter

209
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,598
there's a batch of my shatter that I

210
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:36,000
blasted sitting in the v of and right

211
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,560
now waiting for me to uh check it out in

212
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,079
about 48 Hours Spence is going to flip

213
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,160
it because it's in his uh his facility

214
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,158
but I'm kind of proud I'm kind of

215
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,680
excited that's awesome yeah so we'll go

216
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,120
from seed to shatter it'll go all the

217
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,280
way from the germination all the way to

218

I've seen their children that they have

559

smoking weed while they're here

561

569
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,480
soon as you get home it's back to the

570
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,919
the polo shirts and yes Mama but I truly

571
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,240
am flattered there are a lot of places

572
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,960
for them to go and they chose here

573
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,159
because we have gay rights in cannabis I

574
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,840
just figured they'd running out they're

575
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,400
running out of places to go I don't want

576
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,480
to be offensive to a lot of people just

577
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,280
just the West I can't even say the name

578
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,839
of them they bother me so much but just

579
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:23,158
this one group they just piss me off I

580
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,038
know I've said a lot of R sh I kind of

581
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:26,080
wanted to know the name of the

582
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,558
dispensary so I'd be

583
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,678
like uh they're going to Marisol is the

584
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:31,519
first one they listed you know what I

585
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,880
think I uh took a screenshot of the

586
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,400
article here um because that's how I was

587
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,559
just saving news on my phone no I didn't

588
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,798
take a screenshot of the article but I

589
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,399
know they're going to marasol and one

590
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,599
other one uh and if you said the name of

591
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,120
it it may be pbl West Organics actually

592
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,158
but it was not the spot shout out to the

593
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,239
spot that's the spot that I would

594
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:50,480
represent they should go there that's

595
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,880
where the good weed's going to be so

596
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,919

597
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,360
Colorado is being sued by I'm looking

598
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,600
for the article on my phone Colorado is

599
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,240
being sued by the state states of

600
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,759
Nebraska and Oklahoma have you heard

601
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,000
about this yet no not yet cool Sean's

602
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,158
lighton to join over there he looks like

603
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,400
he's ready for this story uh today the

604
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:07,760
states of Nebraska and Oklahoma

605
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,919
announced that they have filed lawsuits

606
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,839
against Colorado alleging that

607
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,720
Colorado's amendment 64 is

608
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:14,199
unconstitutional Colorado's Attorney

609
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,279
General John suthers issued the

610
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,519
following statement in response because

611
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,519
neighboring states have expressed

612
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,319
concern about Colorado grown marijuana

613
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,119
coming into their states we are not

614
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,439
entirely surprised by this action

615
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,918
however it appears the plain if's

616
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,480
primary grievance stems from a

617
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,880
non-enforcement of federal laws

618
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,679
regarding marijuana

619
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,000
as opposed to choices made by the others

620
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,120
of Colorado we believe this suit is

621
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,558
without Merit and we will vigorously

622
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:41,119
defend it against it in the US Supreme

623
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:43,279
Court so Nebraska and Oklahoma are

624
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,079
trying to sue Colorado because we are

625
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,158
not following Federal rule they're going

626
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:49,038
to try to force the feds to come in here

627
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,600
and clean up the weed scene that we've

628
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,359
created they're jelly all that money you

629
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,158
think they're jelly no I don't think

630
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,719
that but those aren't states that those

631
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,960
place they're not very popular in the

632
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,079
first place place I don't think they're

633
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,360
really worried about that yeah those are

634
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,720
places that pretty much lock you up

635
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,319
forever for having herb they don't like

636
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,240
it at all there no and I know it's

637
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:10,519
happening because I know people we read

638
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,240
about them getting busted all the time

639
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,798
people are definitely driving pounds

640
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,599
pounds and pounds out of this state

641
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,558
because we're able to produce it yeah

642
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:21,000
but do you really think it was any more

643
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:23,879
than before you know what I mean um

644
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,880
there there is more cannabis smaller

645
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,440
amounts uh well when more personal were

646
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,799
you here for the wild wild West

647
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,400
Revolution that I talk about when

648
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:33,359
everybody got a red card and there was

649
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,960
nobody to care to regulate it everybody

650
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,079
just grew yeah when I first got here or

651
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,919
at least when I first got here there

652
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,519
wasn't the whole badge system or

653
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,360
anything like anybody could I worked at

654
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,639
a dispensary and and you could grow I

655
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,158
could walk into your shop with a

656
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,440
backpack full of quarter pounds and sell

657
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,840
them to you right yeah so imagine if you

658
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,360
were getting here it was seven to eight

659
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,558
maybe nine if you could really Hustle

660
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,199
the shop for a quarter pound but I know

661
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:58,639
friends that will maybe send [ __ ] to the

662
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,798
east coast and they can get for that

663
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,278
same quar pound to their cousin that

664
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,000
live or their brother that lives out

665
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:05,200
there and they just don't give a [ __ ]

666
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,679
they're like why not and they'll just

667
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,880
send it or drive it out there and what's

668
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,640
to if you're a 20-some year old kid with

669
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,240
no kids what's guess my point of view is

670
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,640
just the the weeds it's either going to

671
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,880
come from California it's going to come

672
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,600
from Washington or it's going to come

673
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,960
from Colorado so I feel like the weed's

674
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:21,759
just going to be moving across those

675
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,240
States anyways regardless of whether

676
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,919
they sue us it'll just go right back to

677
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,558
wherever they were getting the uh the

678
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,759
solution would just be uh Nationwide

679
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,639
legalization you know medicine Without

680
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,359
Borders oh did we just start a new uh

681
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,480
new program medicine Without Borders

682
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:37,959
yeah just make it known that we'll just

683
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,278
drive around your [ __ ]

684
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,319
state they're talking about giving it to

685
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:43,319
uh convicts and stuff too spin your mic

686
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,918
a little towards your face please

687
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,399
they're talking about giving it to

688
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,360
convicts as well how rich you sound Rich

689

691
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,640
talking about giving it to con we might

692
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,720
have taken a lot of dabs before this

693
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,759

yeah yeah convicts uh just in jail bro

695

703

other day was way higher than we were

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,000
and that's saying

716
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,319
something yeah there's a time in place

717
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,759
for that I've got an

718
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,558
article um I hope I saved it oh look

719
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:59,879
it's refreshing we might not have

720
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:02,879
internet service come on on

721
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,720
computer if that happens then we're

722
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,640
making a 45 minute video on how bad it

723
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,079
sucks I bet the internet sucks oh look

724
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,320
there's not another internet company is

725
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,678
there no oh no yeah we don't get an

726
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,519
option in our area we get one provider

727
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,759
so uh little less anxiety for medical

728
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:20,200
marijuana states on on a federal level

729
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,839
is the next article here it's from the

730
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,960
Cannabis and it's published December

731
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:27,240
12th and it's from Kyle Potter of the

732
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,679
Associated Press and it says buried deep

733
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,919
inside the 1,600 page funding bill

734
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,679
Congress is scrambling to pass to avert

735
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,200
a shutdown a few lines can for come

736
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,200
sorry let me try that again a few lines

737
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,519
comforted Minnesota officials worried

738
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,120
about the federal government cracking

739
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,639
down on the State's new medal medical

740
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,879
marijuana program I'm going to kind of

741
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,120
skim a little bit here because I want to

742
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,559
get to more of this stuff I just wanted

743
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,158
to read this one uh in its current form

744
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:51,639
the $ 1.1 trillion spending Bill

745
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,600
includes a section that bans the

746
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,278
Department of Justice from using federal

747
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,079
funds to intervene with states with

748
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,440
medical marijuana laws that that's the

749
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,038
best part right there I can almost stop

750
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,759
the whole article right there so what

751
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,839
that says is I'm going to read it again

752
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,919
in its current form the $1.1 trillion

753
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,079
spending Bill wrap your money name wrap

754
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,720
your head around that [ __ ] number

755
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:13,960
real quick $1.1 trillion but then it

756
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,240
says bans the Department of Justice from

757
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,440
using federal funds to intervene in

758
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,159
states with medical marijuana laws which

759
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,200
means they can't [ __ ] with us now I mean

760
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,200
they can because they'll find a way but

761
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,480
they're not going to mess with the

762
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,159
States they're not going to try to come

763
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,319
and make us switch our laws back they're

764
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,960
not going to I don't think they're going

765
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,558
to continue with raids there's still

766
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,120
going to be illegal growups there's

767
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:35,278
still going to be illegal stuff going on

768
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,959
that they're going to have

769
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,440
to it says 23 states have legalized

770
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,679
medical marijuana but those measures

771
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,120
still conflict with federal law and

772
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,759
though the Obama Administration has

773
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,359
generally been friendlier to marijuana

774
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,599
than administration's past mson Regala

775
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,558
wondered what if that changes or a new

776
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,519
president changes cour uh changes course

777
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,200
US House narrowly passed the funding

778
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:58,278
bill with the medical marijuana section

779
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,440
Thursday this Senate was is expected to

780
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:02,759
take it up

781
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,080
Friday so uh he doubts the bill will

782
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,720
marketly change the government's

783
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,000
handling of the issue uh most attorneys

784
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,600
have indicated they won't go after

785
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,759
medical marijuana business as so as

786
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,678
they're as long as they're following

787
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,960
state laws so the point is I think it

788
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,440
gives them a little more comfort and I

789
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,360
wouldn't say it gives very much more

790
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,880
Comfort but you never know he continued

791
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,558
the bottom line is it's still illegal

792
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,960
under federal law so anything could

793
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,119
happen but they don't have funding so

794
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,600
what are they going to do these cops

795
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,918
aren't going to go and raid [ __ ] on

796
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,719
their own time are they there was cop

797
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,038
California that did but I

798
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,640
mean then you're also if a cop's going

799
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:36,599
to go off and do that on his own time

800
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,399
without support he may be looking for

801
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,480
that lucrative income yeah that's not

802
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:42,398
going to fly in Colorado though no but

803
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,120
I'm just saying yeah it it sounds like

804
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:46,119
to me it's going to lead to bad to cops

805
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,719
all right so we've gone like 25 minutes

806
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:49,798

833
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,880
Organics episode have been my two most

834
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:44,678
popular episodes out of 44 episodes

835
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,360
awesome yeah people learned a lot um

836
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,080
people asked a lot of questions I can't

837
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,119
shout out everybody that emailed me

838
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,480
texted me uh tweeted me because I would

839
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,479
spend a whole show doing it but we got a

840
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,240
lot of response on that I want to talk

841
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,599
more about worm casting mostly because

842
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,000
that's kind of what seemed to be the

843
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,558
base of a lot of your stuff and a lot of

844
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,119
what got the conversation going um I'm

845
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,240
going to jump back we were talking about

846
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:08,398
worm castings we've got uh for basic te

847
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,038
you said worm castings in molasses and

848
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,959
you mentioned multiplying the protozoa

849
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,519
is something that you really stressed uh

850
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,759
so first of all I guess my main question

851
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,319
I should ask is what are protozoa uh

852
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,558
protozoa are just other

853
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:25,398
microorganisms uh in the Pro it's not

854
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:28,759
just the protozoa it's everything it's

855
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:31,719
all of the microbes in

856
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:33,679
there so you've got fungi and bacteria

857
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,798
and all of these beneficial things so

858
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,440
you're just going to give them a food

859
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,839
source and really give them a chance to

860
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,440
thrive and grow so all of those things

861
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:43,720
actually fall under the category of

862
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,720
protozoa uh no the protozoa are a a

863
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,120
specific uh I don't know what I can't

864
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,798
think the term right off of my head but

865
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,319
yeah it's just a certain microbe that

866
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:55,119
lives in the soil all right that's one

867
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:56,439
that I'd never really I'd seen the word

868
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,558
but I never paid attention until you

869
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,120
opened my mind to it actually I had a

870
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:05,158
wor so uh since we're on the subject uh

871
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:08,518
we have been feeding our worms we've

872
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,640
been substituting Alfalfa with cannabis

873
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,720
um nice yeah we were donated a little

874
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,038
over 3,000 pounds of what we call Canam

875
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,880
which is finely ground material from a

876
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:21,440
local o or actually I can open Vape are

877
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,159
you familiar with the company they sell

878
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,759
vapor pins um and organ labs they

879
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,240
donated the material uh by law by law

880
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,839
all dispensaries have to dispose of

881
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,640
their waste and unfortunately a lot of

882
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:36,278
people are just mixing it with old dirt

883
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,080
and throwing in a dumpster and then it's

884
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:41,038
going to a landfill uh we have been

885
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,960
feeding it to our worms kind of is a

886
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:47,240
test trial worms loved it uh they really

887
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,519
did we just sent or we just got our test

888
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:55,440
results back uh today actually and the

889
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,960
it was off the chart I mean it it really

890
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,200
was let's see what we have on here he's

891
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,278
searching you guys give him a second

892
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,000
bear with him he's digging through the

893
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:05,278
iPhone always takes a minute I mean the

894
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Rocky Mountain worm company's definitely

895
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:08,720
been the conversation at work for the

896
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,480
most of the week anyways well that's

897
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,440
good to hear yeah he he really takes

898
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,519
pride in what he does and he feeds his

899
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,120
worms the highest quality everything and

900
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,960
that seems to be the important part it

901
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:24,079
really is you know he he he makes them

902
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,679
produce what you want you know

903
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,798
everybody's so focused on cost everybody

904
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,880
wants the cheapest casting out there and

905
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,359
they don't really understand that you're

906
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,960
only hurting yourself you know if you

907
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,558
want I keep saying if you're going to

908
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,079
cut cost on the grow then cut the cost

909
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:38,558
in the sale too ex and they don't want

910
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,519
to do that they want to cut cost in one

911
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:44,440
end and it's not fair yeah and with

912
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:47,720
these castings um you can take a compost

913
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,120
and cut you know 10 to 15% of the

914
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,519
compost and then make your own Verma

915
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:54,759
compost and then cut that in one part

916
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:56,759
Pete Moss one part Iration one part

917
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,960
vermac compost there's your base soil

918
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,638
you can add in your amendments like your

919
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,278
crab meal and your asite and kelp and

920
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:06,558
alala whatever you're going to add you

921
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:09,398
know there's your mix soil and it's

922
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:12,638
really that simple but uh Jay's been

923
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:14,479
feeding his worms uh cannabis plant

924
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:17,479
matter and they have been freaking

925
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,079
loving it uh test results were

926
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,960
astronomical uh comparably to running

927
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:27,519
the alphalpha the biological life was

928
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,038
off the chart I mean we gained hundreds

929
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,720
of

930
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:36,839
protozoa fungi bacteria um the active

931
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,880
fungi which means basically the things

932
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:41,918
that are working in the soil um before

933
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,880
we had a higher fungal content but that

934
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,559
doesn't really mean much if they're not

935
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,559
active we have a lower fungal content

936
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:49,240
but more activity if that makes more

937
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:51,278
sense oh you want more BioLife yeah this

938
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,240
stuff is so freaking biodiverse it's

939
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:55,319
amazing we're so excited about it so

940
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,558
feeding at cannabis made it better and

941
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,200
now you're going to feed that to your

942
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:02,720
cannabis feed those leaves back to those

943
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,360
worms Loop Growing System yeah I like

944
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,440
that a closed loop self-sustainable

945
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:08,439
system and we all got to get away from

946
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,919
the bottles um I've been reading more

947
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,919
about it since Sean kind of talked about

948
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,360
it and we're paying for shipping and

949
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,759
water that's what we're paying a lot of

950
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,278
yeah I was looking at the general

951
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:21,480
Organics label today just kind of going

952
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:24,200
over what was in it and it's it's pretty

953
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,558
amazing I mean there's just so much

954
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,200
stuff in the label for and there's

955
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,839
really not that much in the bottle it's

956
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,480
pretty amazing they got to preserve it

957
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,119
and they got to make it stable and it's

958
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,278
got to be chated or buffered or yeah

959
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,359
then it's got to be shipped and it's got

960
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:37,880
to be able to stay in different

961
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,119
temperatures and it's got to have a

962
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,240
shelf life you could just make it

963
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,879
yourself 24 hours before you yeah and

964
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,919
then it's use it you can smell it and

965
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,519
it's so much richer it really is and

966
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,240
then you're not throwing away plastic

967
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,679
for all the neighbors to see your

968
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,399
freaking botanic air bottles in the

969
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,880
trash can they don't need that um so you

970
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,439
talked about multiplying the protozoa

971
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,760
what's the best way to go about that uh

972
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,720
so basically you just need to give them

973
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:03,038
a food source so when you um when you

974
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,079
give like mix your tea up so you

975
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:05,158
basically what you're going to do is

976
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,558
you're going to add in your worm

977
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,159
castings and then you're going to put in

978
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:09,240
your food source and that's going be

979
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,919
using I'm going to back up just for a

980
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,638
second using a five gallon bucket yeah

981
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,720
so a five gallon bucket like a nylon or

982
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:17,119
something to keep all the stuff in uh I

983
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,038
preach free suspension te's especially

984
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,599
on a smaller scale I mean if you're not

985
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,720
doing anything over 15 or 20 gallons

986
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,240
anything throw all the [ __ ] right in

987
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,319
there you just throw it right in there

988
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,359
um and then Stir It Up and it's like top

989
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,638
dressing goes on kind of th you need to

990
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:31,359
Bubble it put a bubble yeah you're going

991
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:34,479
to want a bubble it 5 gallon bucket get

992
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,119
your hopefully reverse osmosis water uh

993
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,960
or at least uh let it bubble for a

994
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:40,439
couple of days get the air out and then

995
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,360
put all your your worm castings your

996
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,759
molasses and whatever else you decide to

997
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:45,599
put in there exactly we can you can

998
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:46,798
expand on it as you please we've talked

999
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,000
about a lot of cool [ __ ] to put in there

1000
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:49,519
I hope you're paying attention yeah

1001
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,519
basically yeah so you get your bucket

1002
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,798
you get your airstones uh castings of

1003
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,120
molasses you're going to throw that in

1004
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,960
there and you're going to just want to

1005
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,158
brew it from 12 to 24 hours I really

1006
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,480
really wouldn't recommend taking it

1007
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,080
anything over that if you're not

1008
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,319
familiar with Brewing set it on

1009
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,720
something you guys it's going to Bubble

1010
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:05,558
Up and hopefully it's going to Bubble Up

1011
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,278
huge and make a huge bub you do have a

1012
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:08,719
big problem with the foam it's as simple

1013
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,838
as dropping a little bit of the coconut

1014
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,480
oil in there and then it's just gone

1015
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:15,119
nice s did not know that yeah I've made

1016
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,960
plenty of mess I used to grow in like

1017
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,800
carpet and stuff like that I've seen

1018
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,878
some of your pictures yeah yeah so all

1019
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,960
right so we're we just want to feed them

1020
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:25,319
and put them in a bucket and give them

1021
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,639
some oxygen and they will multiply uh do

1022
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,359
you know the ratio they multiply are we

1023
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,000
going to get like 10,000 times or a

1024
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,838
thousand times more you're going to get

1025
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,838
thousands and thousands of times more

1026
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,039
yeah it's pretty amazing uh check out

1027
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,639
anybody who's listening that's

1028
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:41,079
interested in this like Google micro man

1029
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,720
and he's got amazing articles about Brew

1030
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,839
times and how you can you know take them

1031
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,398
longer for for more fungal dominant teas

1032
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,078
shorter times for more bacterial

1033
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:51,799
dominant te's how you can

1034
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:55,159
actually uh kind

1035
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,639
of cook your or inoculate your

1036
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,039
ingredients for your compost tea to make

1037
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,280
them more fungal dominant so you can

1038
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:02,279
take uh your earthworm castings and

1039
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,920
sprinkle in a little bit of oatmeal like

1040
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,640
so let's say that you're going to use

1041
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,920
three cups so I made for example I mixed

1042
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:13,559
a 15 gallon tea earlier I use three and

1043
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,079
3/4 cups of worm castings all right and

1044
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,599
I knew I was going to use that much so

1045
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,960
what I did is I took that three and 3/4

1046
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,559
cup of worm castings and put it in a

1047
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:23,000
mason jar uh added some oat brand

1048
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:25,519
sprayed it with a water bottle and

1049
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,320
sealed it up about two days ago and then

1050
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,280
today I went down into my base B and

1051
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,320
cracked it open and it smell sweet it

1052
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,640
was covered in whiteo bacteria and I use

1053
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,960
that for my tea and that's a way to

1054
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,519
fungal charge the [ __ ] out of your tea

1055
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,000
yeah it sounds like it wow that's pretty

1056
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,599
sweet yeah and cannabis plants love

1057
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,239
fungal dominance and so that's going to

1058
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,720
make instead of those little scraggly

1059
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:47,479
shitty Roots you see it's going to make

1060
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:50,239
big thick white spaghetti for roots

1061
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,440
right exactly I like to you know with

1062
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,799
the when you do the free suspension teas

1063
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,240
and you kind of get messy your your drip

1064
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,200
trays will fill up with dirt you know

1065
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:01,159
how it gets it at the end of the and

1066
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:03,118
I've seen my root will grow right into

1067
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,679
that dirt in the bottom of the pot me

1068
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,640
they just can't get enough of it uh I'm

1069
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,279
definitely I need to go so the storees

1070
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:10,519
in Colorado Springs I live about 45

1071
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,880
minutes away from there I'm going to

1072
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,039
plan a trip up there quite soon uh here

1073
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,200
within the next week I've got some

1074
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:19,400
freshly transplanted stuff that I want

1075
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,439
to feed some Rocky Mountain worm tea um

1076
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,920
you keep talking about azomite do I want

1077
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,679
I've always thought of azomite as

1078
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,559
something I wanted to add during flour

1079
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:28,679
do I want that in my veg phase as well

1080
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,440
uh you know really it's just more for

1081
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:32,639
flour if you're going to mix it in with

1082
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,159
your soil um which most people will do

1083
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,279
or they'll have some sort of amendment

1084
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,440
similar uh in their soil that makes

1085
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,920
sense yeah so I really wouldn't

1086
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,720
recommend it until you're flowering

1087
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,280
especially if you're you know not

1088
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:46,399
transplanting really yeah okay all right

1089
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,040
yeah these these plants I'm doing now

1090
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,358
are going to finish in their little pots

1091
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,039
yeah the asite I know a lot of people

1092
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,679
who will do uh worm castings grow Kashi

1093
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:56,199
and asite every two weeks as a top dress

1094
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,199
I need to learn more about the Kashi

1095
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:00,199
everybody's all Gro Kashi happy yeah I

1096
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,838
think I don't know the grok Kashi is

1097
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,639
really cool but I feel like a lot of

1098
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,000
people are using it just to use it I

1099
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:07,759
don't know if they really understand

1100
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,838
what they're using it for the idea is

1101
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,920
that uh it's lactic acid bacteria it's

1102
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:17,159
photosynthetic bacteria it's yeast it's

1103
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,800
a lot of other things going on in there

1104
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:22,239
and you're going to introduce that into

1105
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,160
your root Zone into your plant and the

1106
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,118
grow Kashi will actually help digest old

1107
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,960
root parts and

1108
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,920
and things that are sitting in your soil

1109
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,880
kind of stagnant

1110
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,920
en exactly like enzymes W yeah I mean I

1111
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,160
can show you how to kick that bottle of

1112
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,079
hyro it's as simple as sprouting some

1113
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,399
seeds Okay see there's something else

1114
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,720
I'm going to learn it's going to take me

1115
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,119
a little bit of time but eventually I'm

1116
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,118
going to get away from all the bottled

1117
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,800
nutrients it's a little overwhelming

1118
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:49,559
it's funny cuz I taught Adam how to grow

1119
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,720
mostly with full bottled stuff and he's

1120
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:54,039
over there shaking his head like I have

1121
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:56,078
to I saw the seed process the other day

1122
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,000
and I it just clicked I compare it to

1123
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,760
like cooking you know like when you when

1124
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,760
you first start cooking and you look at

1125
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,240
recipes online and stuff they're

1126
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,839
freaking overwhelming because there's so

1127
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,279
many things that go into it but once you

1128
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,599
acquire once your you know your

1129
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,119
cabinet's filled with all those spices

1130
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,838
it's nothing it takes five minutes to

1131
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,039
you know whip up a meal and it's the

1132
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,400
same thing with the tea is it's

1133
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,960
overwhelming at first but once you have

1134
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,838
castings of molasses and kelp and hydro

1135
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,119
slate and everything that you use it's

1136
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:27,559
really nothing and then you're buying

1137
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,599
all this things in bulk so you're

1138
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:32,400
getting them at a fraction of the cost

1139
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,400
without water weight for shipping too

1140
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,039
yeah and you can buy everything locally

1141
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,280
between Jesse at hyro and then Jay up

1142
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,800
Rocky Mount worm company there's yeah

1143
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,319
there's absolutely no reason to buy

1144
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,880
anything online when's a good time for

1145
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:48,159
me to drop in man uh Monday through

1146

1148
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,039
Monday through Friday midday I don't do

1149
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,119
things too damn

1150
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,400
early but yeah he's always 11 to 11 to

1151
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,680
one yeah lunchtime is when I do business

1152
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,400
yeah you need to stop up there and check

1153
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:03,199
out these Cana castings they're pretty

1154
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,760
freaking sweet man I'm excited about

1155
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,838

really soon I want to go get some stuff

1157
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:10,358
oh man you sparked so many questions so

1158
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,559
many questions I'm not sure which one to

1159
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:14,318
pick I have uh I'll choose one from a

1160
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,358
listener I got to grab my phone again I

1161
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:18,159
feel like I'm the wrong person in this

1162
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:19,920
damn chair I feel like if Jesse was here

1163
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,318
right now he would have been all in this

1164
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,720
conversation and I'm just sitting over

1165
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:27,759
here like with my mouth open like a so

1166
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:30,799
that's great man I I'm love hearing

1167
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,160
about this because I see it around in

1168
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,280
all the the growing footage and [ __ ]

1169
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:37,000
part of my show is to bring the Growers

1170
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,160
on your level and The Growers on his

1171
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,559
level into one together because we're

1172
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:43,039
not different uh I started first you

1173
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,318
were playing guitar or being a

1174
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,759
skateboarder or you probably play Xbox

1175
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:49,159
way better than me you might MMA fight I

1176
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,640
was growing weed while you're doing that

1177
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:52,519
I'll help you grow some weed hopefully

1178
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,118
when I want to learn how to MMA fight or

1179
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:55,639
some [ __ ] you're down to teach me I live

1180
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,358
back East there was nobody that was

1181
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:00,838
willing to teach you and you know it's I

1182
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:04,119
watched all the YouTube videos for many

1183
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:06,279
many years so now being able to see it

1184
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,920
firsthand and being able to have

1185
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,480
different styles when I let you trim the

1186
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,519
first time I thought you had a boner it

1187
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,240
was It was kind of weird yeah I did

1188
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:18,239
until the dog and then it was like it

1189
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:20,799
got really weird yeah yeah when I gave

1190
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,439
him that Grateful Dog he went nuts it

1191
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,160
was stuff stunk so good wow what

1192
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,280
happened oh I know what's happening I

1193
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,879
hope that doesn't really affect the

1194
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,319
podcast here cuz I'm get phone call and

1195
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,358
it's popping up on my computer because

1196
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:34,480
the new iOS no it's working the new iOS

1197

back on track here no dude I like having

1199
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,200
you on because you don't have to be a

1200
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,719
pro to be here you you might ask the one

1201
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,480
question that the listeners are

1202
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,159
wondering because we're Sean and I kind

1203
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,719
of know what we're saying and we just we

get I've been told that we're snobs and

1205

we just talk right over some points

1206
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,280
because we expect everyone to know it

1207
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,040
happens I mean we that wears off really

1208

and thank and Thanking us for what we do

1240
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,920
like I said earlier that means a lot

1241
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,760
yeah that was awesome that was a really

1242
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,280
weird Echo did you catch that yeah

1243
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,480
something went digital on me that's cool

1244
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,960
it's back though yeah thanks for the

1245
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,519
question and so that's a question for

1246
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,400
Sean you were talking about map and dap

1247
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:12,318
yeah so map and dap is uh let's see if I

1248
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,240
can say this right it's mono ammonium

1249
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:18,239
phosphate and Dio potassium phosphate or

1250
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:21,399
something similar to that I'll give it

1251
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,078
to you yeah um but basically yeah

1252
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,440
they

1253
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:29,920
they chemicals that are used in

1254
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,519
basically every single Hydro product or

1255
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,599
synthetic nutrient product on the Shelf

1256
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:40,239
uh they're synthetic salts

1257
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:42,000
uh the big problem with them uh in my

1258
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,318
opinion is they don't flush out of

1259
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,880
plants I I you know I don't think that

1260
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:48,159
you can get them out uh heavy metals and

1261
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,039
things like that are stored in the

1262
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:53,598
triome so once you kind of get them in

1263
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:55,440
there there's no way to get them out and

1264
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,920
if you're blasting you're blasting those

1265
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,280
heavy metals into your mix exactly and

1266
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,760
that's you know I kind of mentioned

1267
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,200
azomite a couple of times and asite is

1268
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,640
one of the things that's filled with

1269
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,799
heavy metals so you really want to be Li

1270
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:09,598
you know you don't want to use too much

1271
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,640
of that stuff uh glacial Rock Dust

1272
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,640
filled with heavy metals so it's not

1273
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:17,879
just or synthetics you know that are

1274
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:20,679
filled with these things but mono uh map

1275
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,318
and dap are probably the worst of all uh

1276
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:24,679
just in the simple fact that they're the

1277
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,838
most common and it's easy it's something

1278
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:29,799
easy to look out for I'm not telling you

1279
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:32,119
to like run away from the map and D but

1280
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,599
it's if you're somebody who's interested

1281
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:35,838
in a cleaner product something that's a

1282
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,640
little bit more

1283

biob biz is a really good one to use uh

1310
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,838
General Organics that's you know that's

1311
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:45,679
another one to use that's really good

1312
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:48,400
but you know to each his own I don't

1313
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:51,239
use things like that there's what's the

1314
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,599
big one on the market right now Moab

1315
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:55,318
yeah you know the mother of all blooms

1316
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,559
yeah you know you know what Moab is is

1317
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:59,358
just MTH

1318
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:01,599
if you look in the ingredients it's like

1319
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,838
99.9% map so I'm not going to sit here

1320
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,440
and tell you that it's like going to

1321
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:07,239
kill you or it's bad for you but it's

1322
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,880
one of the things you want to look out

1323
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:10,118
for if you're an organic grower so it's

1324
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,480
just printed on the bottle as

1325
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:14,358
monoammonium phosphate yes okay so if

1326
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,318
you're looking for it that's map and dap

1327
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:19,159
is the Dio ammonium phosphate it's very

1328
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:21,000
similar the D so if you're trying to

1329
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:25,399
avoid that that those are the two to to

1330
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,079
stray from and uh I know I'm just paring

1331
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,280
what kushman says but kushman says that

1332
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:29,720
that's often what gives you when you

1333
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,960
smoke good weed and for some reason you

1334
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:32,480
get a headache and you're like that was

1335
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,400
good herb why did it give me a headache

1336
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,240
it had map and dap residuals in it I

1337
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,838
can't prove that but that's what kushman

1338
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:41,318
has led me to believe from everything he

1339
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:42,880
has said and I mostly trust kushman

1340
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:45,199
there's no reason not to trust kushman

1341
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,480
in my opinion he smokes a lot no he's

1342
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:49,118
he's the he's kicking ass and taking

1343
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,400
names with his veganics right now he's

1344
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,838
won a couple of cups

1345
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,720
um so he really knows what the plant

1346
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:56,679
wants yeah I'll take his word for it

1347
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,799
yeah

1348
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:00,719
uh do you recycle your soil yes did I

1349
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,119
ask you that in the last episode uh yeah

1350
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,838
I don't I don't like to recycle my soil

1351
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,358
okay I really don't I do it because it's

1352
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:11,199
cheap um I really don't if I recycle my

1353
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,400
soil I like to use it as a in my veggie

1354
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,480
garden

1355
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,400
but I just I haven't mastered that yet

1356
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,880
okay um I always see a loss in yield no

1357
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,000
matter what I do I've blamed it on other

1358
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,358
things and haven't attributed it to that

1359
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,719
I'm thinking that these worm castings

1360
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:30,119
are going to help me out that problem

1361
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:32,318
yeah and I and I'm having better luck uh

1362
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:34,318
starting with sterile Medias you I used

1363
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,719
to run like Happy Frog and roots and

1364
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:40,079
stuff like that uh switched it up to

1365
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:41,279
more of like a promix base got a lot

1366
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,200
better results out of that now I'm

1367
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,480
running my own like Verma compost Pete

1368
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:50,000
Moss and buckweat hole with amendments

1369
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,960
and stuff but the promix and stuff I'm

1370
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,838
getting better results with reusing the

1371
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,679
soil it's a lot easier to amend it at

1372
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,519
the beginning it being a sterile media

1373
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,799
okay um I can write down how much of

1374
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:02,480
what I put into it and basically if my

1375
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,359
plant doesn't show a deficiency

1376
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,199
throughout that cycle I just REM

1377
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:11,318
everything like I would you know a brand

1378
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:13,318
new soil mix and grow right back into it

1379
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:15,679
whereas you know Ren the fox farm and

1380
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:18,358
The Roots organic I feel like with the

1381
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:20,759
guos and the blood meals and everything

1382
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:23,480
that's already in there plus me amending

1383
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,319
it by the end of the cycle sure that

1384
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,559
might not have been of any deficiencies

1385
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:30,599
but I really don't know where that

1386
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:35,800
soil's at yeah so that's kind of where

1387
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:37,359
I'm at with reusing soil uh using mix so

1388
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,240
this is kind of what I found to do with

1389
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,119
I've been doing with my soil lately so I

1390
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:44,919
take it and mix it with the stuff out of

1391
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,480
my Bashi bucket uh like all of the slimy

1392
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,639
leftover pickled trash that ends up in

1393
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,318
your Bashi bucket so I just mix it in

1394
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,318
with my soil in a tu looks like you're

1395
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:54,519
making him

1396
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:56,480
hungry you do that [ __ ] I'm not doing

1397
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:59,079
that I'm not doing that is so you just

1398
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,760
dump it out into your uh you know into

1399
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:03,200
like a Rubbermaid container fill it up

1400
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,760
with dirt and then just let it sit and

1401
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:07,399
then basically you know in a couple of

1402
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,760
weeks or a month or two or whenever I

1403
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,400
get around to going back to those

1404
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:14,280
buckets um it'll be compost and then

1405
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:17,559
I'll mix that with worm castings and use

1406
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,960
that as a vermac compost for my soil so

1407
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:21,920
you're using up a lot of space aren't

1408
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,960
you uh not really I just pictured a lot

1409
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,000
of space when I'm think about Gage I

1410
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,358
have I have a garage and I don't park my

1411
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,838
car in it yeah so that's where I'm

1412
00:48:28,358 --> 00:48:32,719
storing everything nice yeah I do crazy

1413
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:34,880
[ __ ] so other people don't have to if

1414
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,358
you have any like weird experiments you

1415
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,000
want to try and you don't have the space

1416
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:40,119
just email Jeff and he'll let me know

1417

1420
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,039

1421
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,280
that or a branch of that plant and send

1422

1439
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:22,719
all of it was Landing into pots I don't

1440
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,639
know how it was working that's how you

1441
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,558
learn I don't know if Mike knew what to

1442
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:27,879
think about that that's all right no you

1443
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,040
definitely work at a different pace than

1444
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,720
what Mike us doing it's fine he picked

1445
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:34,318
up he picked up he was fine yeah uh what

1446
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,039
should I not use in my Organics that's

1447
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:39,279
going to be my last question for the day

1448
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:41,039
uh you know it's depends on your level

1449
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,760
of like you know your dedication to

1450
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:44,880
Organics but the first thing that I

1451
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,760
would kick out would be blood meal and

1452
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,960
bone meal okay uh if you really care

1453
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,680
about Organics chances are you don't eat

1454
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,318
GMOs and you don't eat I'm not going to

1455
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,239
say you're a vegetarian if you're you

1456
00:49:55,318 --> 00:50:00,079
know if you're into Organics and stuff

1457
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:02,159
but those things are byproducts of like

1458
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,599
the you know slaughterhouse industry

1459
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:07,239
feather meal is a byproduct of the

1460
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,119
poultry industry all of and they have

1461
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:11,118
their place don't get me wrong because

1462
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,440
I'd rather them be recycled into

1463
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,280
agricultural byproducts for farm and

1464
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,559
other agricultural uses but when it

1465
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,680
comes to Growing medicine for people I

1466
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:21,359
don't believe that feather Meal made

1467
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:23,879
from chickens that were fed you know

1468
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:25,519
antibiotics and hormones should be used

1469
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,760
to grow it same thing with the blood

1470
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:28,559
that scraped off the slaughterhouse

1471
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,319
floor to make the blood meal it's just

1472
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:33,240
this gelatinous goo filled with

1473
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:35,400
everything that there was in that cow uh

1474
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:37,000
bone meal same gig so if you're going to

1475
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,599
use things like that I would just

1476
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,760
recommend there's other Alternatives you

1477
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:43,400
can use things like fish blood meal

1478
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,280
alala kelp I mean there's a lot of plant

1479
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,838
baits um if you really want to get into

1480
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,880
it cfree and berock root and nettle and

1481
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:53,318
dandes and you know go out in the woods

1482
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,079
and pick a bunch of [ __ ] am I going to

1483
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:57,000
come back from the Rocky Mountain worm

1484
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,000
company with a whole back seat full of

1485
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,400
brand new [ __ ] and rethink my whole

1486
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,039
growing method the first time I go in

1487
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,240

1488
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:04,558
thing is is you're going to you'll

1489
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:06,798

00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,040
you've seen at Jesse's shop too okay and
