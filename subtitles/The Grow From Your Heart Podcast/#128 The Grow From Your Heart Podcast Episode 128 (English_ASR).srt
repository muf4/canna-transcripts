don't own the company that's not the

79
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,549
choice I would have made but by its

80
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:54,079
product they're not cutting any corners

81
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,299
with it I could tell you that much you

82
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:59,599
tried any of the distillate that's made

83
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:01,129
from co2 no I mean I love that I've

84
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,759
heard about it and I did not know that

85
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:06,379
was made from co2 or this here this is

86
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,909
sphere X I'm about to drop it

87
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,169
I've got two containers stacked up cuz

88
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:10,818
it's hard to get that bottom

89
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:12,199
out so I just turned this way to put it

90
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:14,629
on there and it trigger there it did it

91
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,669
for me in July that's some spear X it's

92
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,590
made from co2 oil and then they turn it

93
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,869
these they use a fractal distillation

94
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,430
process as far as I understand I don't

95
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,409
know exactly what that is but I know

96
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,150
that the basics and they pull out the

97
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:27,530
goodies and that's what it looks like

98
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,400
we'll take a dab of it here we can't do

99
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,479
it right now it's just too much of a

100
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,530
pain in the ass you'll do it after the

101
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,079
show I'll leave it here so we see it

102
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,818
yeah that's made from co2 oil so I got

103
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,500
uh some serious Terp so it's got some

104
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:38,089
serious Terps on it I'm gonna crack this

105
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,560
one open sooo good so now you're

106
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,810
reaching for the clear I like the clear

107
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,909

California it's the super Lemon Haze

110
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,360

111
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,068
Terps on this one I prefer the sphere X

112
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,209

118
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:10,699
that little dabs of that when I put I'll

119
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,650
take a big dab of something else and dip

120
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:14,479
it into that a little bit so that it's

121
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,030
not so overwhelming yeah this one out

122
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,680
the sphere X I could dab a gram of it by

123
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:21,409
itself and knock off my throat it

124
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,699
doesn't burn that's super smooth yeah so

125
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,789
shout out to the guys at sphere X you

126
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,019

127
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:28,069

128
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:29,538
product it does when you make a good

129
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:32,418
product Rasta Jeff will give you a shout

130
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:33,800
out um so yeah let's talk about outdoor

131
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:35,569
growing man everything's going good for

132
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,199
you you got the new the business run in

133
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:41,329
yeah some outdoor weed hopefully people

134
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,250
have access to some clones or some seeds

135
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:46,550
cuz now it's time to get those going

136
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,350
yeah especially seeds yeah yeah you

137
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,569
might be a little behind if you're grown

138
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,520
from seed you might be by now yes so

139
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,769
well I guess the first question when

140
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:59,899
should we put our plants outdoors in

141
00:04:54,769 --> 00:05:02,120
Colorado second week of May is that kind

142
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,228
of that's like the earliest I'd do it

143
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,228
all right

144
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:08,300
I've put them out you know first to June

145
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:09,800
and they still yielded just as good as

146
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,360
the ones that went out the second week

147
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,759
in May alright I get a little extra

148
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,410
attention to catch him up yeah so okay

149
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,668
so yeah you got about a two week window

150
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,500
that's prime to put him out

151
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:19,699
yeah he's out by the the first weekend

152
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,279
of June though if you haven't done it by

153
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,420
then carry him out

154
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,339
scuse me a burp and carry him out that

155
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,250
weekend get them started get them

156
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:29,429
outdoors do you know offhand when we're

157
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,839
gonna start the flowering season

158
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,730
typically kind of varies from strangest

159
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,769
drained but typically it's around the

160
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,960
end of July beginning got obvious all

161
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:40,329
right that's here at Colorado

162
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:41,888
I believe that does change a little

163
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:43,300
regionally right that's gonna be a

164
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:45,610
little bit different the dates when you

165
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,470
put stuff outside the time frames are

166
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,180
gonna be a little bit different varying

167
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,940
from coast to coast California you can

168
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,620
put them out today there's probably be

169
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:55,660
okay I have friends on Instagram that

170
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,730
they're already out today they've been

171
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,200
out for weeks honestly yeah they're in

172
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,680
Oregon in Northern California there's

173
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,860
oiled out there though bastards we can't

174
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,300
do it like that it's cool we do crush it

175
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,150
though yeah we figure out how to fix

176
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,030
that all right so get them out there the

177
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:14,439
first week of June at the latest get

178
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,639
them out there get them ready hopefully

179
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,750
you've got some clones you got some

180
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,889
seeds they're going you've had them

181
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,079
sexed already you know if they're boys

182
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,819
or girls yeah get some plants healthy

183
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,550
don't get him too big because they're

184
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:25,540
gonna grow really quickly outdoors last

185
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,978
year a lot of people weren't prepared

186
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,540
for the size of plants that they were

187
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:31,029
growing and that [ __ ] got way too big

188
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,240
the camouflage got away from them their

189
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:36,129
fences way too crazy that's a good thing

190
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,210
but it's also a bad yeah so be prepared

191
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,850
for that your plants are gonna get

192
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:42,399
really large outdoors make sure they're

193
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,660
not root bound either that's really

194
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,699
important when you take them outside

195
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,800
yeah when you put them in the ground

196
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:50,500
I've just I've noticed through my years

197
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,038
of experience rootbound plants sometimes

198
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,269
they go into shock going outside

199
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,339
sometimes they go into shock in a way

200
00:06:55,269 --> 00:07:00,399
that they want to start flowering right

201
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:02,829
away yeah okay and that's no good yeah

202
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,319
so make sure they're not root bound and

203
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:07,389
that's you know if you have if the

204
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,339
weather is holding or like you have a

205
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:12,370
greenhouse or some you can put out

206
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:14,199
earlier than the second week of May but

207
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:19,168
also right now we're around 12 hours of

208
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:22,360
light here in the first week of April so

209
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:25,000
if you put plants outside there is a

210
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,259
chance that can go into bloom and you

211
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,149
don't want that to happen doesn't gonna

212
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:29,348
revenge aren't they yeah yeah we're

213
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,429
gonna have they're gonna flower that

214
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,949
they're gonna go back and then I'm gonna

215
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,100
reflow or the party is gonna be all fun

216
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:38,139
plants yeah bad structure and limbs

217
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,060
break off and it's just no good

218
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,319
all right so though kind of be don't let

219
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,019
them get root bound and that leads me

220
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,519
into my next question perfectly I was

221
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:47,799
gonna ask you if we should plant into

222
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:51,370
the dirt outside or if we should take

223
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,009
them outside in pots my I mean my

224
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,990
preferred method being kind of a crunchy

225
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:59,289
hippie I like to plant straight in the

226
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:02,350
ground it's it's less work I feel like

227
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,300
and the plants just are healthier but

228
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,900
you know doing it in containers who've

229
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,810
is very very possible to last year I did

230
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:13,329
plants in 150 gallon smart pots for the

231
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,910
first time and I was really stoked with

232
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:19,209
those how they were your stocks gigantic

233
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,470
size your arms the the first and second

234
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:22,989
round of plants that got put in there

235
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,930
got stolen by some [ __ ] [ __ ]

236
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,879
[ __ ] Pheebs and I haven't talked much

237
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,139
about it but I had a horrible summer I

238
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,459
never mentioned it on the show but we

239
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:33,039
talked about some people getting ripped

240
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:34,659
off you were one of those [ __ ] whoever

241
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,360
took Jesse's plants so they didn't get

242
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,679
as big as name is you know if the first

243
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,320
ones I put out there would have got left

244
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,209
there the stalks probably would have

245
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,730
been as big around as a 2-liter bottle

246
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:49,180
um they ended up about as big around as

247
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:53,129
one of these uh six to twenty ounce of

248
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:56,169
water bottles okay Wow and that was with

249
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:59,559
about four and a half weeks of edge they

250
00:08:56,169 --> 00:09:01,629
were gonna be beast yeah the the first

251
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:05,199
ones that got taken they were mice

252
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:06,340
trained government mule and as you want

253
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,629
to tell us about government mule I'll

254
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,769
give you an opportunity to do that sure

255
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:13,210
it's uh it's made by shimira I think

256
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,850
mara chimera

257
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,470
is a company that's not really in

258
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,269
existence anymore he's still around

259
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,269
though yeah yeah he just doesn't make

260
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:26,159
seeds anymore but it's a deep chunk Tom

261
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:28,449
Hill's deep chunk crossed with g13 okay

262
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,699
it's uh you were growing this [ __ ] out

263
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:33,870
of that yeah the pheno I have is like

264
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,310
pure indica it's real short and stocky

265
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,549
in this plant that was in the hundred

266
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:42,578
fifty gallon smart pot last year within

267
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:44,769
maybe six weeks to being outside or no

268
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:46,748
make it that long probably about four

269
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:48,879
weeks with being outside it was

270
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:50,769
seriously eight foot tall six foot

271
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,699
around six foot you know it was just

272
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:57,938
beast and that's not a strain that

273
00:09:54,698 --> 00:10:00,159
really beasts like that so if it was

274
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:01,688
making it happy oh yeah all right so

275
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,219
that's that leads me perfectly you keep

276
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:06,548
helping me out your segue into my next

277
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,129
questions on accident here if we're

278
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:10,298
gonna put our plants into the ground do

279
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:11,589
we just want to throw them into the dirt

280
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:13,149
that's in the backyard or do we want to

281
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:14,410
dig a hole and put some good dirt in

282
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,028
there some good soil that we buy from

283
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:18,969
the store or do we just wanna use the

284
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:21,759
backyard soil I mean if if that's all

285
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,239
you have you can use it okay I wouldn't

286
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,089
know

287
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:27,278
right especially here in southern

288
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,899
Colorado the native soil it's pretty

289
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,610
hard it's pretty dusty and kind of clay

290
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:31,839
like yeah yeah it's been killed off

291
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,169
pretty good especially like in

292
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:38,980
residential areas and stuff yeah it

293
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:41,528
doesn't hold water well when it's dusty

294
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,239
like that the nutrients that are in it

295
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:44,980
thick because of shale based soil

296
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:47,019
there's a [ __ ] ton of nutrients in it

297
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,909
but it's not accept accessible to the

298
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:51,850
plant because of the structure of the

299
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:54,068
soil so you're growing you basically end

300
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,860
up growing in a pretty super salty

301
00:10:54,068 --> 00:11:00,519
environment yeah yeah literally

302
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:02,769
so at the very minimum to have you know

303
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,869
pretty good results I'd recommend but

304
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:07,688
cutting your native soil with like one

305
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:11,769
part coco koi or one part peat moss and

306
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:16,438
then one part native soil and then one

307
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:19,749
part worm castings or compost okay and

308
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:22,118
by default that that soil recipe pretty

309
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:26,079
much works everywhere and you'll end up

310
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:27,759
with some really great soil so you know

311
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,769
that'd be your base so then you can

312
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,808
still add extra amendments to that also

313
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:33,399
if you if you wish you can afford it and

314
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:36,188
if you want to yeah but okay

315
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,168
that's like farmer recipe that's produce

316
00:11:36,188 --> 00:11:40,868
gets girl on that recipe like in the

317
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:43,928
raised permaculture beds okay that's

318
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:46,540
that's it so all right so can we throw

319
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:48,129
that same recipe into those hundred and

320
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,988
fifty gallon smart pots that's it that's

321
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:52,509
actually exactly what I did I added a

322
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:53,939
little more aeration to it and maybe

323
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:56,339
went a little bit heavy

324
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:59,038
the peat moss okay yeah that's exactly

325
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,929
what I did so yeah and it worked out

326
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:02,848
great and stocks the size of football of

327
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,418
two litre gallons that's huge bro that

328
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:05,429
is huge

329
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:08,058
good job I wish I had pictures to show

330
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:10,948
me me too

331
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:12,418
all right so I'm gonna throw out a

332
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:13,828
little bit of a soil mix that I wrote

333
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:15,088
down I would buy if I were gonna use

334
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:16,858
hundred and fifty gallon smart pots

335
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:18,419
outside that's got to be a huge pot how

336
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:20,429
is that about six feet around yeah yeah

337
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:23,728
three feet tall it's like a kid pool

338
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:26,548
it's about that tall yeah okay 24 28

339
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:30,089
inches ish yes yes yeah so yeah that's

340
00:12:26,548 --> 00:12:32,879
that's a [ __ ] kid pool yeah people

341
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:36,119
wrestle in there so I would put I would

342
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,589
buy some bag - soilless mix I'm not too

343
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:39,418
picky about that whatever the store has

344
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,789
I like the roots organic I like to pur

345
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:43,129
it's pretty much all the same [ __ ] it's

346
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:45,629
a little bit different it's all the same

347
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,069
you run a hydro store you know there's

348
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:49,048
all the same different [ __ ] routes has

349
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:50,938
more aeration in it like your Fox farm

350
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:52,889
products so I always feel like they need

351
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:54,389
a little pearlite or something at it

352
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,979
right and they need to be sifted because

353
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,470
their sticks and [ __ ] and Fox farms all

354
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:59,669
the time the hell are they doing so I'd

355
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,739
go some bagged soil it doesn't matter

356
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:03,418
what you use I would definitely put worm

357
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,918
castings in there I like the coco coir

358
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:06,389
like Jesse said I think it gives the

359
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,918
plants a little bit uh it's adds

360
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:09,448
moisture to the plants life their

361
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:11,458
vascular systems a little more healthy

362
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:12,928
they just seem more hydrated with the

363
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,719
coco in there I think they get more

364
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:17,908
flavor cocoa most definitely it it well

365
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,069
it holds water differently than peat

366
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:21,208
moss does well you're like doubling down

367
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:22,498
right there and you can use a little

368
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,899
more nutrient you need a little more

369
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:27,028
nutrient that's always I like to put

370
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,379
perlite in there yeah just to keep it

371
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:30,568
airy and fluffy and then it helps you

372
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,129
not over water especially in outdoor

373
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:34,078
situations you might get a rainy ass

374
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:35,879
night that provides a save your life for

375
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,798
sure the peat moss like your ATAR the

376
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,019
peat like you're saying and then for

377
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:41,578
pest prevention I we learned this from

378
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,198
our good friend Sean shoutout to keen

379
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,118
Cola if you're listening I like to mix

380
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,918
in the Quran Jamil and neem cakes if

381
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:49,259
we're going outdoors just to keep those

382
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:51,869
bugs away yeah that's that's part of my

383
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:53,399
personal I mean yeah you came real close

384
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:55,859
to my personal recipe would you put some

385
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,038
oyster shell in there yes very easy all

386
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:57,720
right

387
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:59,009
I'm learning outdoor from you guys I

388
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,599
don't do it myself but that's why I

389
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:04,288
bring you guys here's a trick on the

390
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:07,180
oyster shell add go to hydro store guy

391
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:10,600
given away okay go to the feed store

392
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:12,549
and get oyster shell for chickens it's

393
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,129
been collected off the beach it's not

394
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:17,399
ground-up its whole oyster shell breaks

395
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:19,629
down it takes it more time to break down

396
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,220
so put that in as a bit of a

397
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:23,860
time-release and then get the powdered

398
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:27,279
powderized oyster shell from your local

399
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,899
hydro store and you got two different TT

400
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,279
races available times yeah that's

401
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:31,809
awesome good tips you get all the way

402
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,970
through the season I like that you're a

403
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:35,859
hydro store guy that doesn't just make a

404
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,720
shop at the hydro store your own feed

405
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,779
store stuff yeah I have to pay for the

406
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,269
[ __ ] too man I mean right one thing I

407
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,709
want to mention you can use bottled

408
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:46,059
nutrients in your outdoor grow if you're

409
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,860
just gonna throw the plants into some

410
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:49,569
soil containers or dig a hole in your

411
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,100
backyard you can go to the store you can

412
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,360
buy some botanic air you can buy some

413
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,279
nectar of the Gods you can buy whatever

414
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,889
brand they've got there a and B their

415
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:58,539
bloom feed solution other bloom boosters

416
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:59,830
you can mix that up if you're throwing

417
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:02,169
it into some outdoor soil you can

418
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,490
actually mix it up kind of heavy you can

419
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:06,039
feed it pretty damn strong with that

420
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,990
stuff outdoors you can do that if you're

421
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,579
not able to maybe somebody's not

422
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,960
able-bodied we're pretty healthy dudes

423
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,790
we can do things maybe somebody doesn't

424
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,170
have the physical capabilities they

425
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:15,819
could throw a few pots in the backyard

426
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:16,870
and mix up some nutrients and have

427
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,430
somebody help them do that way instead

428
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,200
of having to mix up a big batch of dirt

429
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:23,319
and plant these you can do that you guys

430
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,570
for sure we would just as a ganja farmer

431
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,430
myself an indoor ganja farmer and Jesse

432
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,590
and outdoor farm boy I think we'd rather

433
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:31,269
lead people into this way of mixing up

434
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,009
some soil outdoors and letting nature

435
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:35,620
kind of do its thing it takes a lot of

436
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:38,289
the guesswork out of it this will prove

437
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,600
this will promote pest prevention and a

438
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:42,730
healthy environment oh yeah using those

439
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,430
bottled nutrients isn't gonna contribute

440
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,950
to plant health it's only gonna

441
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:49,389
contribute to big buds yeah and the soil

442
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,940
recipe so we're talking about here they

443
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:54,279
they actually help with the healing of

444
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,650
the earth they contribute back to that

445
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:58,480
they make the soil better so when you

446
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:01,870
leave there that that piece of ground is

447
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,389
better than it was before and that's one

448
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,970
you know you I suppose you can do that

449
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:08,439
with bottle nutrients to just watch out

450
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,259
for salt build ups and stuff like that

451
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,810
so right that's not as friendly and if

452
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:15,750
you do grow outside do it on your land

453
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:17,519
don't do it in some

454
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,950
at National Forest don't be an idiot

455
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,019
like that and clean your [ __ ] up like

456
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:26,400
take your bottles inside don't make

457
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:27,659
don't ya like Jesse said make it cleaner

458
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,639
than when you found it pick up some

459
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,620
trash shout out for pieces I think I've

460
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,250
told the story on some of the older

461
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:37,279
episodes or the earlier ones but a few

462
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,419
years ago there was a gigantic cartel

463
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,629
bust here in the mountains real near

464
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:44,279
here and I have family land that

465
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:48,480
neighbors the land where they got busted

466
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,919
on so we hiked in you know after the

467
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,170
cops and you know just to check it out

468
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,990
look around and the amount of trash up

469
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:57,839
there was just appalling terrible that I

470
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,149
grew up on that mountain and you know

471
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,250
it's kind of it almost brings a tear to

472
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:06,029
your eye to see that see that up there

473
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:08,660
and is it accessible to folks like us no

474
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:10,680
no you'd be trespassing

475
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,220
excuse me from coffin what if we were to

476
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,930
clean it that's not really trust back I

477
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,600
don't think anyone I don't think Bob

478
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,880
would say anything so that is I was

479
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,338
gonna say what was that four years ago

480
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,589
that happened we're still hauling trash

481
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:28,619
out of there and that's we make it it is

482
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:31,829
a pretty good hike from the road or from

483
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:33,209
where my cabin is but we make a few

484
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:36,179
trips up there year and Houston trash

485
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:40,200
out cones that's uh yeah it's ridiculous

486
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:43,110
how much was up there so it's just all

487
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,000
so it's ridiculous how much the cops and

488
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:47,039
the DA left up there cuz you could tell

489
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,599
the trash from the cartel growers and

490
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,879
you can tell the trash from the cops and

491
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,649
they just left [ __ ] up there the Dunkin

492
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Donuts was from the cops and the beans

493
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:58,350
and rice was from the cartel yep right

494
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,050
free you told me in my one of my

495
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:02,219
friend's dad's was a police officer I

496
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,539
don't know how much I'm supposed to talk

497
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,370
about that he's not a cop anymore so

498
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,619
they can't probably do [ __ ] but he was

499
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:09,000
retiring at the time and they called him

500
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,609
and had him go stand there and watch

501
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,839
like once they raided everybody ran but

502
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:14,459
they needed the teams to get up there

503
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,439
like the DEA and [ __ ] wanted to go and

504
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,569
investigate so he stood there and

505
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,190
watched just made sure that nobody went

506
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:22,200
in that area but he said that he walked

507
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,179
around and they had little camps set up

508
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,019
like stoves with beans and rice and all

509
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,850
the all

510
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:28,950
food was from Mexico it was all Mexican

511
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:30,599
packaging and straight up making Mexican

512
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,000
dinner up there every night even the

513
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,819
miracle can grow containers that I have

514
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,109
cleaned up off their they have Mexican

515
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,740
riding on them there's no English on

516
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:40,409
them whatsoever

517
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,809
you're like segwaying into the things I

518
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,360
have in my mind for the show on accident

519
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:46,980
which is [ __ ] awesome would you add

520
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,169
anything to this soil mix before we move

521
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,960
on would you do you use azomite azomite

522
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:54,750
yeah yes down for next year's lessons I

523
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,029
like doing minerals so I do basalt

524
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,240
this is real similar to the Clackamas

525
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:02,460
coupe recipe from the forums build a

526
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,630
soil but this is old-school but I

527
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,900
haven't heard that name in a long time

528
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,900
really

529
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,639
basalt gypsum these are all things you

530
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,089
can find at your local garden stores

531
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,610
especially like gypsum dolomite lime

532
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:20,339
those are all pretty easy to find then I

533
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:22,079
used azomite those four combinations of

534
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,429
minerals you got pretty much every

535
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,049
single trace mineral in the world

536
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,500
covered right there that's gonna make

537
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:27,000
your plants

538
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,670
chirpy it's gonna make it healthy I'm

539
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,089
gonna smell real well and then oyster

540
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,950
show a shrimp mill fish mill some

541
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:37,230
something like that some kind of I like

542
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,700
aqua products I stay away from bone meal

543
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,559
blood meal like slaughterhouse product I

544
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,880
would use kelp meal if they were up to

545
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,220
me so I'm gonna write down kelp meal for

546
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:49,340
my style just make sure whatever I used

547
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:52,680
to yeah tons of coke mill alfalfa meal

548
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:55,519
I'll get four nema nitrogen yeah and

549
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,200
alfalfa breaks down really quick so that

550
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,210
can give you some of that real early

551
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,330
season you know boost to get them

552
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,340
exploded to you know pop bottle sized

553
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:07,559
stops for weeks your plants are gonna

554
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,659
take up 90% of their nitrogen during the

555
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,299
vegetative phase of their lives yep

556
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,310
yeah yeah actually you don't want to

557
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:16,649
over spike that that's why alfalfa Mills

558
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:18,210
good because it breaks down so quick you

559
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,500
in the middle of flowering towards the

560
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,720
end of flowering you don't want them to

561
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,130
find a source of nitrogen that can have

562
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,779
some [ __ ] up yeah I'll make them taste

563
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,550
funky and it'll slow down the flowering

564
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,200
phase rest of the buds out a little yeah

565
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,899
they'll start to finger yeah get that

566
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,690
little fingers foxtails alright so you

567
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,250
said a minute ago you cleaned up a bunch

568
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,470
of [ __ ] miracle-gro containers from

569
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,720
the cartel grow site you guys if you

570
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,890
want to Google the cartel gross

571
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,329
I'm sure you could find it it was a

572
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,659
cartel girl found in the Santa Isabel

573
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:46,339
National Forest area off highway 165 I

574
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:48,919
was about probably four or five years

575
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:51,349
ago I was well well covered by the news

576
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,788
around here so they threw out a bunch of

577
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,019
miracle-gro containers which tells me

578
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:56,569
that they probably weren't growing super

579
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,099
quality product no no let's talk for a

580
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:01,189
minute about why we should never use

581
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:03,408
Miracle Grow or any Scots type of

582
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,570
product first of all Miracle Grow is

583
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:09,559
made by Scott which is owned by Monsanto

584
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:11,329
which is trying to force the entire

585
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:14,000
world to be force-fed seeds that are

586
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:15,949
made by them which are all GMO produced

587
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,349
to be able to be sprayed by their

588
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,929
products that are made by them they're

589
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:22,879
ruining a whole bunch of things and not

590
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,350
healthy I'm just [ __ ] talk about a

591
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,720
circle right now but they're killing the

592
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,308
bees they're they're real it's all about

593
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,409
money for science is shown there pretty

594
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:33,079
much single-handedly responsible for the

595
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:35,330
bee die off right now so we do not want

596
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:36,710
to support anything with Monsanto in the

597
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:38,869
first place is why we don't want to use

598
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,480
any type of Miracle Grow or Scott's

599
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:44,298
products yeah if you're gonna buy stuff

600
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,429
like that go to go to a hydroponics

601
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:49,158
store go to your local grocer or get a

602
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:53,059
decent grow soil don't go get like a

603
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:54,710
turf builder at Home Depot or a lot of

604
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:56,538
people hate on the Fox Farm brand I

605
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,400
think that's actually available at some

606
00:21:56,538 --> 00:22:01,250
of the larger hardware stores like ace

607
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,620
mayhaps Fox Farm Fox farm isn't amazing

608
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,298
but it's definitely not bad yeah it's if

609
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:07,729
you're gonna buy something at Ace or

610
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:10,220
Home Depot or Lowe's get Fox Farm don't

611
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,169
get the Scotts brand stuff yeah Pro mix

612
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,120
is available in most places the pro mix

613
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:16,820
is a good product yeah sunshine for pro

614
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:20,629
mix yeah oh the sunshine different

615
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:22,700
companies okay but it's the pretty much

616
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:28,010
exact same just different proprietary

617
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:29,990
blends of micro mixes good [ __ ] you

618
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:31,069
could hide that in bulk oh yeah they

619
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,839
sell that in so if you're doing some

620
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:34,908
outdoor Pro mix oh yeah go get that

621
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,639
that's not bad at all these amendments

622
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:40,250
give me [ __ ] golden out there but

623
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,840
let's talk about why not to use it first

624
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,210
of all the obvious reasons the there

625
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:47,649
Monsanto products but they're way over

626
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,808
loaded with the wrong NPK ratios

627
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,509
ton of nitrogen tons of nitrogen way too

628
00:22:49,808 --> 00:22:54,250
much and that soil is loaded with these

629
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:56,019
little they used to be green when I was

630
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,250
a kid these little green speckles yeah

631
00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:01,240
and those are time-release nitrogen and

632
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,619
basically there are little time-released

633
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,000
vitamins for the plan yep

634
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:06,579
so what sucks about that is you don't

635
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,049
have very good control of what you're

636
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:09,789
feeding your planet however often you

637
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:11,829
water those are gonna dissolve and your

638
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:13,779
plants gonna get that nutrient you don't

639
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:16,449
want nutrients going to your plant every

640
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:17,680
single time you water you're gonna start

641
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,910
getting salt buildup you're gonna start

642
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,410
getting crinkled leaves you're gonna see

643
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,690
burnt tipsy buds aren't gonna taste

644
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,070
funny so don't use that type of stuff

645
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,529
don't use any of that miracle girl

646
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,960
feeding go to a real gorilla store I

647
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:31,149
recommend botanic hair nectar of the

648
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,069
Gods I've seen great results from nectar

649
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,240
of the Gods relation it's my buddy Steve

650
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:36,099
Daffy no I don't know if you listen to

651
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,450
the podcast bro but you grow with nectar

652
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:40,299
of the Gods and the stuff you grow

653
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:43,269
tastes really good so I nectar the Gods

654
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:45,970
is good botanic air is good I'm used

655
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:47,889
advanced nutrients and I had okay

656
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,650
results but I was more happy with

657
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:53,050
botanic air by a long shot I did not

658
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,360
like psycho at all the psycho brand I do

659
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:56,589
not approve I did not like it there are

660
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,849
a lot of brands available to store

661
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:59,019
what's super hot right now I haven't

662
00:23:57,849 --> 00:24:03,490
been paying too much attention to the

663
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:05,410
new stuff nectar we push some nectars

664
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,380
coming up it takes a while to get people

665
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,808
switched over to a line you know from my

666
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,179
perspective for a retail setting oh yeah

667
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:16,000
but botanic air and general hydroponics

668
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:18,610
are she's definitely reliable general

669
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,609
hydroponics general organics and then

670
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:24,549
Mills and Mills pays the bills I've some

671
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:27,189
good [ __ ] with Mills I learned some last

672
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:28,928
week some things about Mills that even

673
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:32,080
this organic growers gonna give him a

674
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:33,640
shot some endure suspense was killing it

675
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,500
with the Mills he was crushing it so

676
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,710
shot it dispense with the Mills was

677
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,808
doing a good job we get bio business

678
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,730
always vibe is especially for like

679
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:44,829
outdoor canna is a great line if you

680
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,089
want to spend some money yeah yeah there

681
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:52,178
the other Dutch and they're well

682
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:54,490
well-made jungle juice is there sorry

683
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:56,230
I guess the labels I just oh yeah it's

684
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,309
so long do the same thing I really

685
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,339
recommend if you can use bottled

686
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:02,230
nutrients I like to add humble honey

687
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:04,569
it's a good product yeah it's definitely

688
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:06,250
yeah it's got good stuff there so go to

689
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:08,288
the Hydra store get yourself bottled

690
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,630
nutrients if you if you confuse don't

691
00:25:08,288 --> 00:25:12,548
buy that stuff at the hardware store

692
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,260
don't buy try not to buy your soil and

693
00:25:12,548 --> 00:25:16,619
stuff at the hardware store their gross

694
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:18,460
stores somewhere if you live somewhere

695
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,859
honestly if you live somewhere where

696
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,788
that shit's inaccessible maybe you're

697
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:26,769
better off not growing there you if

698
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:28,269
you're gonna do it but we can't condone

699
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:30,069
it and we can't encourage it so you're

700
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:32,500
only listening to this for entertainment

701
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:36,220
purposes where you yeah it's illegal but

702
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,619
also it's not immoral so and you're

703
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:42,298
probably a grown-ass adults oh yeah yeah

704
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:44,769
oh hi you better be a grown-ass adults

705
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:47,408
totry gotta be it's an 18 and over show

706
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:48,879
so hopefully you're an adult alright

707
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:53,679
we've got kind of rant either

708
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,450
um so also last year in our area we live

709
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,548
in Pueblo Colorado this is kind of it's

710
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,140
not the valley but we are kind of in a

711
00:25:57,548 --> 00:26:01,269
valley were surrounded by mountains on

712
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,009
every side burnable we're in a bowl

713
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:04,509
that's a great way to put a river flow

714
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:06,038
[ __ ] the other day we were in the Dust

715
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:07,720
Bowl brother there's so much wind and

716
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:10,058
dirty just blowin I thought my car was

717
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,649
getting sandblasted yeah I was miserable

718
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:14,190
and it was cold too

719
00:26:11,648 --> 00:26:16,629
it was weird super sunshiny yeah

720
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:19,390
horrible so we're in this weird bowl and

721
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,010
we get really strange weather changes

722
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,409
and drastic weather changes it'll be

723
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:25,658
today I used my heater and my air

724
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:28,600
conditioner both in my car yeah me too

725
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:30,070
yeah right now it's a seven forty nine

726
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:32,109
in the evening and I've got the front

727
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:39,038
door open and two windows open I thought

728
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:40,538
I just heard the front doors so yeah

729
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,240
it's the weather it changes a lot here

730
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:45,099
my point is this caused a lot of folks

731
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,349
to get powdery mildew last year a lot of

732
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:49,148
folks that grew outdoors their plants

733
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:50,528
were riddled with powdery mildew so what

734
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:52,418
I'm getting at is you've been growing

735
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:53,558
outdoors for a lot of years now your

736
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:54,630
dad's been growing outdoors for a

737
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:56,408
hundred years

738
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,549
shout-out to the old man what's up

739
00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:00,700
brother good day good to hear from you

740
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:02,918
hope you're doing well how do you guys

741
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,669
go about preventing and taking care of

742
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:09,270
powdery mildew outdoors you know

743
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:09,270
prevention

744
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:15,019
planning the areas you know we have

745
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,970
plenty of circulation around our plants

746
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:18,889
we don't cram them together we cleaned

747
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,130
we hollow them out in the Middle's we

748
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:26,800
clean shape the lake soap all that you

749
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:29,510
know only goes so far though you know

750
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,609
there's a few products a zmax I mean I

751
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:33,650
can't really recommend spraying anything

752
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:38,479
out of bud but if you have to you have

753
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:43,070
to basil max green cleaner just good old

754
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,110
h2o or h hydrogen peroxide h2o2 3630

755
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:47,929
percent hydrogen peroxide diluted at

756
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:50,240
about 20 to 30 miles per gallon will

757
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:54,860
help keep it away but it will not stop

758
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,150
it more organically T's would help like

759
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:57,529
you could even brew it to you with like

760
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,880
me I think Shawn would tell you to

761
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:02,240
Berlin I smell opposed to note some

762
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,730
karanji and there to see your I think

763
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,279
you're gonna want to fungus dominate to

764
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:10,009
battle p.m. yeah that will disrupt the

765
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,609
pH on the surface of the leaves yeah and

766
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:15,019
then like there's some some plant teas

767
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:20,689
you can make I've been experimenting

768
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:23,629
with Shama mill which is it's a natural

769
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:26,650
herb you find it in a lot of like tea

770
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:29,510
blends for like drinking like hot tea

771
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,870
it's considered a weed in most of the

772
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:34,250
world

773
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:35,959
it grows naturally here in Colorado so

774
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,789
I'll be able to a while crafted in the

775
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,730
fall I've just been buying it from the

776
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:43,460
health food store right now but it's a

777
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:52,549
natural antal antifungal and

778
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:57,890
antimicrobial yeah anti fungal bacterial

779
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:59,629
okay so I believe it makes it t that has

780
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:03,040
a higher pH was another thing I heard

781
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:06,290
but with those you know two properties

782
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:11,059
it battles p.m. pretty good it looks

783
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:13,609
like so and then also a added benefit of

784
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:15,289
it is its high and P and K so that's

785
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:17,299
just another you're going to help

786
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:19,309
increase trichomes yeah that's

787
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:22,309
I'm actually right now my current run I

788
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:27,200
gave half my yeti og plants a teammate

789
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:29,569
of this um I'm week five right now I

790
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:34,069
think I gave half of them a tea made of

791
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:36,349
that and then I gave up the other half

792
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:38,599
for that feeding they just got water so

793
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:39,949
I'm kind of kicking back seeing let's

794
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,829
have a wait and see what does what

795
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:47,840
that's always a good thing to do how do

796
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:50,059
you feel about is it oh so 28 yeah seems

797
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,409
like I'm really great yeah yeah I get

798
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:55,119
the numbers mixed up there's so many

799
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:58,400
others potassium silicon I think yes yes

800
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:00,829
a lot of growers are really respect or

801
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,460
preaching it I haven't used it

802
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:06,919
personally yet so but it's a different

803
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,920
kind of silica so and if you mix it in

804
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:12,440
with almost any of your store-bought

805
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,170
foliar feeds it really increases the

806
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:19,130
effectiveness of both products I see

807
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:21,050
that sometimes we I have used it in

808
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,640
conjunction with my integrated pest

809
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:25,369
management system and my plants will

810
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,780
love it it kind of helps the whatever

811
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:28,159
you're putting on the plants it helps it

812
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:29,690
stick a little better I think too it

813
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,330
works like a snicker spreader a little

814
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,799
treat okay it's got the the consistency

815
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:35,689
of dish soap almost when you open up the

816
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,829
bottle we stick my finger and [ __ ] I

817
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:42,380
know I'm not supposed you but I want to

818
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:45,230
know I smell it almost taste it yeah

819
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,510
soul synthetics make some products that

820
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,130
I would drink if you served me a cup of

821
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:50,980
like if I went to the monta factor and

822
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,270
they handed me that no that's [ __ ]

823
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:57,880
what is this it's sole synthetic

824
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:57,879
nitrogen blend light let's get it on bro

825
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:03,470
what is a nectar for the god smells kind

826
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,079
of good too yeah it's very similar to

827
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,610
soul synthetics okay it was soul

828
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,049
synthetics and another brand that I got

829
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:11,029
some samples of but there's a bunch of

830
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:13,039
molasses in one of them and it just

831
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:16,129
smells so yummy I didn't drink this

832
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:18,559
humic acid and molasses together yummy

833
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,630
flavor speaking of that full power you

834
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,039
actually can drink and it's actually

835
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:24,680
good for you that's funny

836
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:27,769
yeah it's a it's a humic and fulvic they

837
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,410
have to label it as humic acid but it's

838
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:30,849
actually fulvic acid

839
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:34,690
that has something to do with labeling

840
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:36,759
laws but yeah this there's no warning on

841
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,400
it there's no real MSDS for it

842
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,289
so this effort Jeremy from build a soil

843
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,759
talk about drinking it too that's what

844
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:45,879
kind of got me to research I was like

845
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:48,279
this guy's nuts nuts but he's got a lot

846
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,840
of great ideas yeah yeah I mean I'm

847
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,160
pretty you know he seems like a guy

848
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,619
concerned about what's going into his

849
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,140
body so most of the Dragonfly earth

850
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:59,349
medicine products are guaranteed it's

851
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,900
mostly just alfalfa and what such good

852
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:03,519
stuff if you need brutes use that lush

853
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,840
roots just yeah take your little baby

854
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,819
clones where the roots are showing and

855
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,990
just roll the clones in that lush roots

856
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:09,579
and then put them in the soil and

857
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:13,990
they'll just they'll be rootbound nice

858
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:16,659
day fat flowers is a good one too okay

859
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:18,460
I've run too big of a crop for the price

860
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,070
of yeah most definitely

861
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,890
that's a for a boutique grower for sure

862
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:26,349
that's three less or something insect

863
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,000
frass is amazing but we could never use

864
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:30,490
it at either one of our works because

865
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,279
it's different it's the price it would

866
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:36,069
take to make you know 300 gallons once a

867
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,509
week of the [ __ ] is ridiculous this I

868
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:39,579
can't want to give a shout out to a

869
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:42,339
product but I'm not sure yeah let's go

870
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:43,000
for it a big-time exterminator it seems

871
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,799
to be working

872
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,450
that's all I have to say about that

873
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,889
big-time exterminators right this comes

874
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,840
in a black bottle with a skull on it

875
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,480
this is big-time exterminator on it it's

876
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:55,359
pretty red it's mostly organic and it's

877
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,630
approved by the meed rules which is very

878
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,789
important very important and I feel like

879
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,770
I've been adapting I run a personal home

880
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:04,690
drove a caregiver grow for my patients

881
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:06,160
which is all legal and legit and I can

882
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,440
do whatever I want there's no nobody

883
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,170
looks at it but I adapted the same Emmy

884
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,269
Dhiru 'ls to my personal grow like if

885
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,560
they don't allow it there then I got to

886
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:16,750
throw it away also there's no need for

887
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,179
me to and it keeps me learning here also

888
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,750
yeah and there it keeps me prepared for

889
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:24,360
both places

890
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:28,269
my wife Bernadette my life my life she's

891
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,619
been studying that list very good and

892
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:31,029
getting to know pesticides I'm actually

893
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:33,609
really proud of her

894
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:35,839
shout out to burn she has had growers

895
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:37,849
from some of our clients calling her

896
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,589
and asking her about stuff and what they

897
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,178
can use in what they can't use cuz she

898
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:44,449
knows more about it than the head grower

899
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:47,390
for these gigantic grows so the email

900
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,769
out lists to everybody at metric oh yeah

901
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:56,270
I get a list of all the new pesticide

902
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:57,798
yeah yeah she's actually she tried

903
00:33:56,269 --> 00:34:02,150
calling the Med to talk to him about it

904
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:05,210
one day and a certain lady with her name

905
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:08,510
starts with an M called her back and was

906
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,639
not cool at all but then we called the

907
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,929
department agriculture and she ended up

908
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,608
spending about an hour on the phone with

909
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:15,470
a lady those guys are super cool the

910
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:17,239
Department of Ag is really go I hope

911
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:18,378
they're the people that actually

912
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:20,658
regulate us one day

913
00:34:18,378 --> 00:34:22,159
that's one of my hopes and dreams Gary

914
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,659
had some great points on the show that

915
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,338
we recorded last night that hasn't been

916
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,450
released yet everybody that listens to

917
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:27,559
the show has heard it by now but and

918
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:28,730
you'll hear it but there are some great

919
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,378
things that kind of go along with that

920
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:34,429
statement it'll be entertaining

921
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:36,440
so powdery mildew how are we getting rid

922
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,260
of that remind me again uh we're mixing

923
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,769
up some spray yeah Shama mill chamomile

924
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,750
tea

925
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:43,159
all over the plants yeah it'll disrupt

926
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,898
the pH okay I want to make sure that we

927
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,669
covered that one I bet adding some

928
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:48,588
silica to that tea to help raise the pH

929
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:51,168
even more maybe probably be real good

930
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:53,779
time exterminator with some Costa 28 in

931
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:56,210
there yeah be really really effective on

932
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,310
p.m. is what I would assume I'm sure a

933
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,990
big time exterminator we have it at the

934
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:03,889
store but I've never used oh really oh

935
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:05,618
yeah cool I didn't know that's cool we

936
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:08,358
have another one their products to the

937
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:11,000
enzyme big-time enzyme big-time roots

938
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:12,588
big-time inoculate yeah that's what they

939
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,820
got there you should see the story they

940
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:15,380
just had a good shout out those are good

941
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,849
products I like the big time there's one

942
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,039
with coconut oil and some other things

943
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:20,990
in it I really approve of that one nice

944
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,880
alright so if you guys do

945
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:24,858
here's another side note if you do have

946
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,809
buds that have powdery mildew on them I

947
00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:29,838
know it sounds like the easy way out

948
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:31,880
do not blast them and turn them into BHO

949
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,949
please no please don't do that don't

950
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,059
press them and turn them into rosin we

951
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:38,929
don't want to taste your burnt popcorn

952
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:44,659
and powdery mildew you I haven't seen

953
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:45,949
any powdery mildew frozen yet I made a

954
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:47,960
joke the other day I said well since

955
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:48,899
everybody learned how to make BHO nobody

956
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,070
gets powdery mildew

957
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:54,720
any more truth you never see it nobody's

958
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,010
like I lost a whole crop to PM her yeah

959
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,439
we got PM's like no we have a whole

960
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,970
bunch of shatter that's what you see now

961
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,389
and I know a few people they think it's

962
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:05,489
safe yeah I could okay

963
00:36:03,389 --> 00:36:07,469
here's I'm not a scientist I'm not a

964
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:08,969
chemistry student I'm not this is I'm

965
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:11,250
not qualified to give this speech but

966
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:13,529
this is what I understand about the idea

967
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:17,250
of blasting powdery mildew covered buds

968
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:19,290
ah some folks say that the PM will not

969
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,820
get through the screen good enough if it

970
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:21,929
doesn't maybe it won't maybe it'll stay

971
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,400
in the tube maybe it's right there

972
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,690
pressed up against the screen just like

973
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,610
your coffee and it's not getting through

974
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,889
and all the coffee is coming through but

975
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:30,510
what is coming through maybe not the

976
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:32,519
spores and not the mildew but there are

977
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,110
mycotoxins inside of those spores that

978
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:35,849
have been extracted just like your

979
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,050
cannabinoids and your terpenes they've

980
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:39,839
been washed off so you're getting the

981
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:42,750
mycotoxins which are going to affect you

982
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,200
in the long run if you if you inhale the

983
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,239
spores

984
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,439
you'll get that sooner you'll get an

985
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:48,869
infection in your lungs who get an

986
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,519
irritation the mycotoxins are gonna take

987
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:51,690
a little while to and infect your body

988
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:52,920
and it's gonna be different gonna have

989
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,450
fungus inside your body you know

990
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,440
mycotoxins running around inside your

991
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:57,869
lungs now they're gonna get in your

992
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,929
bloodstream I'm not a doctor I don't

993
00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:02,250
know enough about that but I do know

994
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:03,809
that it's not a good idea because you're

995
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,000
just washing the mycotoxins off the

996
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:07,409
mildew into your hash and then people

997
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,300
are gonna make edibles out of that hash

998
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:10,949
some times and they're gonna consume eat

999
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,210
that [ __ ] and they're gonna smoke it

1000
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:13,679
this is supposed to be something that

1001
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,170
improves the quality of people's lives

1002
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,329
not makes us sick er not [ __ ] us up so

1003
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,500
please do not blast your powdery mildew

1004
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:21,989
buds the only thing that I recommend

1005
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,969
I've never done this

1006
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,409
shout out to Shawn and Jordan that's all

1007
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:26,819
there I don't know what else to call

1008
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:31,049
them Shawn and Jordan some friends of

1009
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:33,390
mine they say that you can take the 30%

1010
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:35,460
hydrogen peroxide and put it in

1011
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:37,859
distilled water and you can mix that up

1012
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:41,039
and they say you can dunk your p.m.

1013
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:42,360
covered buds or hoo p.m. dosed buds in

1014
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,369
that and then hang them up and they will

1015
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:49,920
dry and that will cure your powdery

1016
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:51,719
mildew problem yeah I've heard that if

1017
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,130
anybody has done that email me it's girl

1018
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:54,779
from your heart at hotmail.com I'd love

1019
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,900
to hear what your experience about with

1020
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,960
that on that

1021
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:01,119
object I've heard that you can wash your

1022
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,068
butts in the exact same way like your

1023
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,650
outdoor boats to wash the dirts and

1024
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:07,869
stuff off of them yeah doing that exact

1025
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:11,260
same thing but without the hydrogen

1026
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:13,210
peroxide okay water he's done that let

1027
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,869
Jeff know about that too yeah cuz I'd

1028
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,159
like to hear

1029
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:17,380
I had a friend named Donovan who was

1030
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:19,088
known as DJ tanki Online back in the day

1031
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,250
he I don't know if I supposed to say his

1032
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:23,980
real name in his online that doesn't

1033
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,510
exist anymore so we're cool he used to

1034
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,980
say that he would rinse his buds off

1035
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,510
just like a week before harvest he'd

1036
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,889
just go in there and rinse him off with

1037
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,839
the spray bottle and hose him down just

1038
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:34,118
to get all the dust off of him huh which

1039
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:35,858
is a good idea because in my opinion all

1040
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:37,358
that dust that you kick up during the

1041
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:39,519
grouse season all that it's been windy

1042
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,650
as [ __ ] out oh yeah people got plants

1043
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:42,880
out if it's this windy in the middle of

1044
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,650
the flowering season people are gonna

1045
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,470
have buds that are just covered in dirt

1046
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,450
on one side yeah that's going into your

1047
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:51,689
hash yeah you're just gonna blast that

1048
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:54,068
right into the pot of gold right there

1049
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:57,099
dirt extract it's gonna taste like earth

1050
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:59,980
yeah maybe the buds is a good idea in

1051
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:02,349
this region I'm gonna try it this summer

1052
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:05,679
it sounds lazy but in my personal grow

1053
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:07,269
room I quit sweeping around week six the

1054
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,608
buds are getting sticky everything's

1055
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:12,519
real sticky and I don't want to stir up

1056
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:14,710
any dust or dirt off of the floor into

1057
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,599
those buds so I will let it get kind of

1058
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,068
funky from about week I mean there's not

1059
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,900
a lot of [ __ ] on the floor I'm not even

1060
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:21,788
eating snacks or anything but their

1061
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,548
leaves and you spill soil when you kick

1062
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:26,710
pots occasionally and [ __ ] happens but I

1063
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:28,509
won't sweep sometimes from like week six

1064
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,199
or seven until after harvest or at the

1065
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,089
end of harvest

1066
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,598
I'll cut off all the leaves pre harvest

1067
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:36,068
and then sweep up and yeah pretty much

1068
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,240
cut down the plants pre-harvest cut down

1069
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:39,278
the plants and then sweep up and clean

1070
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,318
up yeah I start fresh spray the whole

1071
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:44,230
room with hydrogen peroxide water and

1072
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:45,788
[ __ ] clean it up vomit yeah bomb it

1073
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,679
clean it up redo the flooring fix all

1074
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:49,420
the ducting that should be a whole

1075
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,919
episode what to do between Bros we could

1076
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:56,139
probably talk for six weeks about that

1077
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:57,760
oh yeah untouched subject a lot so yeah

1078
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:59,739
so we've been known for about 40 minutes

1079
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,599
dude I think we gave the folks a decent

1080
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:03,429
start all we did was tell them how to

1081
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,019
mix up some soil so dig some big holes

1082
00:40:03,429 --> 00:40:06,399
and put all that stuff inside of it and

1083
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:09,650
then put your little baby plants in

1084
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,930
there I'm about May 15th to June

1085
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,818
fifth ish yeah and then keep an eye on

1086
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:17,210
them keep them watered decently just

1087
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:19,699
real quick do your soil at least two

1088
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,690
weeks before cover the top of the hole

1089
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:27,169
with plastic that helps accelerate the

1090
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:29,329
composting process of the of the Rodman

1091
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:34,670
mints being broken down and being plant

1092
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:35,930
available earthworms are great yeah

1093
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:39,019
throw some worms and that if you can't

1094
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:41,480
mulching is awesome Oh your hole size do

1095
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:43,969
you know it kind of depends on you know

1096
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:48,079
the size of your plant then and how big

1097
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:50,179
it can get but a at least 3x3 hole and

1098
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,619
you only need to go with cannabis you

1099
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:54,889
only need to go down about 18 inches

1100
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:56,809
there's no need to try to fill a [ __ ]

1101
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:57,650
six-foot hole full of highly enriched

1102
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:59,778
soil

1103
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:01,309
I think it's expensive quickly yeah it's

1104
00:40:59,778 --> 00:41:03,889
just a lot of work and it gets really

1105
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:07,519
expensive yeah go get you some bales of
