anyway moving forward here we are

66
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:23,429
episode 316 I want to talk a little bit

67
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,110
about what I got to do this weekend one

68
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,700
of my favorite comedians is Doug Benson

69
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,080
and of course Doug and I have kind of

70
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,699
become buddies over the past few years

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,190
since I've gone to so many of his shows

72
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,259
and interacted with him so much every

73
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:36,120
year Doug Benson comes to comedy works

74
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,399
in downtown Denver and does a live

75
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,799
taping of his podcast called Doug loves

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,340
movies Doug loves movies is a podcast

77
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:46,530
all about movies and movie trivia Doug

78
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,689
encourages the audience members to make

79
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,549
nametags it's not like a nametag that

80
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:53,009
would say hi my name is Rasta Jeff but

81
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,510
it's more like a movie poster idea the

82
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:57,090
idea is that you print a movie poster

83
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:59,039
and you replace a word in the movie

84
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,259
title with your name and then replace

85
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,090
one of the characters in the movies face

86
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,679
with your face and possibly add Doug

87
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,709
Benson and whoever you think one of the

88
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,299
guests on the shows maybe you swap their

89
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,579
faces with the guest face in your face

90
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,319
and Doug's face so it's a custom poster

91
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:15,870
like maybe you might have a poster that

92
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:18,030
says Rasta Jeff strikes back and you've

93
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,769
taken out you've put Rasta Jeff's face

94
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,180
right in the middle of it so it's Rasta

95
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,549
Jeff strikes back swinging a big light

96
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,219
saber looking like a Jedi that's pretty

97
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:29,659
cool um so that's the idea you bring

98
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:32,039
nametag posters and then doug has three

99
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,689
comedian guests that join him on stage

100
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,459
and they come out and they select a

101
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:37,229
nametag from the audience nametags and

102
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,169
they are playing for that person so if

103
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,668
the celebrity wins then the person whose

104
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,260
name tag they have selected wins the

105
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:45,180
prizes that come from a prize bag so

106
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,068
that's sort of the idea behind what the

107
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,659
the nametags the prizes and then there

108
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:50,659
are games that happen and Doug plays

109
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,859
random movie trivia games based on

110
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,209
whatever he feels like doing that night

111
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,669
and whatever he's got lined up for the

112
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,229
show so that's how Doug Benson show

113
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,719
happens that's what Doug Benson's show

114
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,699
is I know that I'm gonna get the

115
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,370
opportunity to smoke before and/or after

116
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:10,318
the show with Doug Benson so I rolled up

117
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:13,620
five 10-gram raw cones so I had a couple

118
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,208
of 10grams ready to smoke at all times I

119
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,430
had a couple in my pocket at all times

120
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,340
in case something came up and of course

121
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,500
we uh so i met my buddy i picked up my

122
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,168
friend Baker and Baker and I drove to

123
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,759
comedy works from downtown Denver maker

124
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:28,418
lives a little off of downtown we drove

125
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,389
to downtown Denver

126
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:33,339
in the parking garage then we met up

127
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,499
with my friend Brett Mary's motivation

128
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:38,528
on Instagram we may have gotten a little

129
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:41,770
bit stoned then we headed into Comedy

130
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:44,050
Works around 4:15 we decided to go

131
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:46,658
outside of Comedy Works and go smoke I

132
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,550
was carrying one of those raw cones in

133
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:49,990
the package it was in the little uh that

134
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,300
rock cones come in a package so that

135
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,978
they're sold the the rolling paper

136
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,449
without any cannabis has sold in this

137
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:57,339
cone-shaped package so that the paper

138
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,629
doesn't get destroyed I just rolled the

139
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,429
joint and put it back in there and then

140
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,050
I was walking out of the comedy club

141
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,310
just carrying that and a lighter so it

142
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,740
was kind of obvious what was about to go

143
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,978
happen and I looked behind me and it was

144
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,620
myself and Brett and my friend Baker and

145
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:13,000
another guy that I had seen before

146
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,228
somewhere but I wasn't sure who the hell

147
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,718
he was and then it dawned on me

148
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:17,859
I said hey you're Decker doom and he

149
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:20,259
goes yeah brother and he shook my hand

150
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,180
it was a friend who had been watching my

151
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:24,069
Instagram feed and we became Instagram

152
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,629
friends and he told me he was gonna be

153
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,968
at the show and I said hey if you see me

154
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:30,430
come introduce yourself he was smart

155
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:32,649
enough to see me and my crew go walking

156
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,209
out the back door of the club at 4:15

157
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:35,918
and thought I should probably follow

158
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,269
those boys and he was smart because we

159
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,098
went out there and smoked a 10 gram

160
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:40,990
joint and there weren't very many people

161
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:43,478
out there the people who were out there

162
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,949
were pretty damn cool so anyway we

163
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:47,228
finished smoking our joint and we go

164
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,300
back inside everybody gets comfortable I

165
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:50,709

166
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,718

167
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:54,430
delivered to our table to our seats it

168
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:56,079
was it was perfect timing it couldn't

169
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,370
have been any better we sat there for

170
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,068
just a couple of minutes I had time to

171
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,680
pound down my snack and then the lights

172
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,360
went out and the comedy show started so

173
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,959
it was Doug loves movies so Doug comes

174
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,218
out and he tells jokes and uh sets up

175
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,778
the show you know for a few minutes he

176
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:12,310
talks about where he's gonna be for the

177
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:14,079
next few weeks and tells all of his Doug

178
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,519
plugs and just kind of hangs out with

179
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,408
the audience and then he brings out his

180
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,959
guests about five or ten minutes into

181
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:22,718
the show his guests this time were a

182
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:24,489
comedian named Jacob Seraph who is known

183
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:26,228
for traveling with Doug and doing a few

184
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,449
Doug loves movies podcast he's kind of a

185
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:30,218
regular there was another comedian by

186
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,348
the name of Dan Cheeseman who is a

187
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:34,088
semi-regular on the podcast and he is

188
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,319
not the Cheeseman from Cheeseman parks

189
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:36,879
if you guys listen to the podcast

190
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,468
there's plenty of jokes about that all

191
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,330
the parks in Denver are called Cheeseman

192
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:42,279
lots of businesses called Cheeseman

193
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:44,409
something he is not that Dan she

194
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,479
I mean also another comedian by the name

195
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,060
of John toll who I've seen before at

196
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,980

197
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,839

198
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,939
recorded at the downtown location of

199
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:58,089
Comedy Works uh he did a really good job

200
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:59,379
of sitting in with the two semi-regulars

201
