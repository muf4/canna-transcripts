79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,979
man thanks a lot man so we brought Shawn

80
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:43,259
on the show to talk about some

81
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,750
integrated pest management but before we

82
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,039
get there men tell the people what you

83
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,330
have been up to it's been a long time

84
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,889
since you've been on the show build some

85
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,730
credibility and let all these folks know

86
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,329
what you're up to

87
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:56,609
so I think the last time I was here I

88
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,150
was working on a Three Rivers organics

89
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,060
projects nice organic grow out here in

90
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,209
Pueblo finished it out turned it over to

91
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,280
some great guys so there

92
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,259
from what I understand they're pumping

93
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,900
out some great product right now so

94
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:14,598
congrats to them I moved on was doing

95
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,789
some just some consultation in the

96
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,188
industry of different grow gigs writing

97
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:20,840
some stuff out helping some extraction

98
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:24,019
companies and now I'm actually involved

99
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,319
in a hemp project so we're a nutritional

100
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:29,599
hemp company were pulled our permits

101
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:32,500
through the CDA we're all legal

102
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:35,119
everything that we grow is under 0.3%

103
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,628
THC so you can smoke my whole farm and

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,560
not get high we're really excited about

105
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:42,649
this project

106
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,938
what is the CBD level of that 15 percent

107
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,859
but what we're averaging is no value so

108
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:51,918
we're specializing in our extraction of

109
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:53,719
that through critical co2 very good is

110
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,239
that do you need to be a medical patient

111
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:58,310
to receive that since its no THC you

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,829
don't have to be you can be any age from

113
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,359
any state anywhere in the world just

114
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:03,200
come here to Colorado and get it from me

115
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:05,569
that's amazing

116
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,708
yeah yeah any amount he invited you come

117
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:08,988
get it you guys it'll be available

118
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,549
fairly soon so you said the word

119
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:14,269
nutritional hip is that something you a

120
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:16,728
phrase you coined I mean and you could

121
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:20,689
say that technically we pulled in an

122
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:22,819
industrial hemp license and industrial

123
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:28,250
hemp traditionally thought is gonna be

124
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:31,038
fuel fiber you know seed crop okay

125
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,478
in puebla there's actually a ban on male

126
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:35,930
plants meaning you would kind of discuss

127
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:38,899
this earlier and we don't grow male

128
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,959
plants we don't do traditionally on a in

129
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:44,359
a hip operation they drop a pound and a

130
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,908
half a seed per acre there'd be a 50/50

131
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,669
male to female ratio that rely on the

132
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:52,490
male plant pollen to drop the THC levels

133
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:54,908
in the female to give them that point

134
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:59,810
zero three whereas we have been

135
00:04:54,908 --> 00:05:02,930
selectively breeding these high CBD low

136
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,389
THC ratio strains just like people have

137
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:09,590
been breeding high THC low CBD strains

138
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:12,288
so it's a really similar approach to

139
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:15,739
growing is traditional MMJ style but

140
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:17,199
with its industrial technically it's

141
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,389
industrial hemp

142
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,860
because we don't do the male plants and

143
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:22,810
we're going further more of the

144
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,449
medicinal nutritional factors of it

145
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,189
that's why we try to coin the steering

146
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,990
nutritional him because it's not FDA

147
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:31,599
approved I do not say there are any

148
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,590
medical purposes right okay let's wait a

149
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:36,370
plane safe appreciate that all right

150
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:39,459
do you want to shout out the name of

151
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,649

and thanks man

167
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:20,528
so you said that you've got to have all

168
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:22,448
females and no males with the number of

169
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:24,009
plants that you're working with I know

170
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,389
the traditional way is to just flour

171
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,468
them out you cut a clone and flour them

172
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,028
you were working with a very large

173
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:29,348
number of plants you told me the number

174
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:34,629
I don't know if I have liberty to say

175
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:36,848
those numbers uh you know we can sue you

176
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:38,860
just the guys can do the math at home if

177
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:41,278
they really want to twenty acres on six

178
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,500
foot centers so you do the math on that

179
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:45,819
but it's a lot of [ __ ] plan that is a

180
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,168
whole shift on a plant there's more

181
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:49,960
plants than I ever imagined being

182
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:52,168
responsible for almost poop myself a

183
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,698
little yeah every time I think about it

184
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:56,620
you know I feel that way but every day

185
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:59,348
it seems like more of a reality you know

186
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,449
we started out with nothing this was an

187
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:04,028
empty field four months ago and now

188
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:06,580
we've got this infrastructure we do and

189
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:08,288
I still have a while and a large crew

190
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:10,859
you know longer we've got a great team

191
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:14,680
out there I couldn't stress it enough

192
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,348
Pablo Justin Eric Chris Kelly

193
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,478
Tony everybody out there's just it's not

194
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:21,788
just me kicking ass I mean these guys

195
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:24,459
all heard that yeah I'm gonna it's their

196
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:26,259
job we'll make them listen Matt so what

197
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,638
I was getting to is how do you know that

198
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:29,379
all of those planets how do you verify

199
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,960
that all of those plants are females out

200
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:32,540
there

201
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:36,139
we everything's from clone okay so

202
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:39,140
everything yeah is from clone it's gonna

203
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:42,919
we you know just like you would endure

204
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:44,779
Lisa we start off see batch call out the

205
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,020
males you actually had to grow yet the

206
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:50,179
flower some of me yeah you know flower

207
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:53,209
him out cold the males test out the

208
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,250
females we knew with this what we were

209
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:57,439
working with what to look for so it

210
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,209
wasn't as difficult as one would think

211
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,689
because this is already something that

212
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:04,909
was in existence Suzie Q which maybe

213
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:07,879
some people are familiar with so it

214
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:11,840
wasn't too hard for us to work it out we

215
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:14,569
started out with a good mitt a quite a

216
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,250
few females and then slowly built our

217
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:20,029
way up and then now we've got a whole

218
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,110
army of other plants just clone and

219
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:23,059
clone and clone and that's the name of

220
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,300
the game and got a 10,000 square foot

221
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,399
propagation building a greenhouse going

222
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,009
up and it will be used for half of it

223
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,870
for mothers half of it for clones so you

224
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:35,389
said the strain was called Susie Q yeah

225
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,789
Susie okay so you guys that are kind of

226
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:40,340
just learning just like you'd buy some

227
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,379
pot called sour diesel or OG Kush the

228
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,070
hemp has the varietals the same way

229
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:46,909
right now

230
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,080
Centennial seeds there shoutout to sin I

231
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,980
don't know if you're familiar very

232
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,230
thoroughly

233
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,210
I wouldn't met with the guy at the owner

234
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,090
of the companies I think his name's been

235
00:08:53,210 --> 00:09:01,700
bit yeah he's great guy shout out to Ben

236
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:03,470
and he's got a lot of wisdom yes he said

237
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,420
we're growing his auto and box out there

238
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,490
we've got Auto to it clean and healthy

239
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:10,610
we've got up in the future yeah we've

240
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,279
got out of 11 great yes maybe ours is

241
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,500
auto 11 I just read it as it probably is

242
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,179
its Roman numeral two okay maybe is no

243
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,519
room in number two and I mean it is 11

244
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:21,379
so who knows we'll have to ask them one

245
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,759
day we just call it Auto but yeah so

246
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:26,689
there's fee nose in there that you run

247
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:28,669
every which way so we still we're

248
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,380
running in Mass the I won't really

249
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,699
release what we're running in particular

250
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:34,100
but those are the strains were running

251
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,480
we're running and mass what we know for

252
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:40,820
certain is our point for 15 percent CBD

253
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,220
under point three it's actually testing

254
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,610
at 0.25% tea

255
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:50,120
see right now the other stranger pretty

256
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,550
experimental we still have a while I'll

257
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,649
get a good flower I'll get a good

258
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:56,359
harvest off and then we'll maybe

259
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:59,688
propagate a couple of thousand and put a

260
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,699
pound in the field but uh yeah so

261
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:03,318
everything since we can't grow for a

262
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:05,919
male or we can't have male plants

263
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:09,620
everything has to be taken from a tested

264
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,990
female okay is there a lab test for that

265
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,448
that you can use actually we

266
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:17,209
there are lab tests so we've been

267
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:18,948
working with we used to work with labs

268
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:21,619
here in the state

269
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:23,889
all of a sudden Emmy do you wanted to be

270
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,629
a holes and come out and say that

271
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:29,060
licensed or meed certified testing

272
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:30,470
facilities are no longer to test him are

273
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:32,929
allowed to test him if they have an

274
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,970
excuse for that I believe it's because

275
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:36,739
they're the tracking system is

276
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,959
implemented through with the hemp so the

277
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:44,299
CDA supposed to start implementing the

278
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:45,318
RT are the radiofrequency tags so RTI F

279
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:48,049
I can't remember

280
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:49,969
RFID there you go those every day yeah

281
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:53,179
so they're supposed to start issuing

282
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:57,278
some of those for us after harvest to

283
00:10:53,179 --> 00:11:00,258
get us into these testing facilities so

284
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,120
back in the day last summer

285
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:04,970
basically they is at the end of this

286
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,379
harvest season is when they kind of

287
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,420
implemented that law yeah I think it was

288
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:10,370
November they quit and we couldn't test

289
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:12,289
it anymore so we haven't really been

290
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,480
able to test since then so we built our

291
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:16,458
own facility so right now we're building

292
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,709
our own testing facility on the farm

293
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,969
there won't be any need to go any

294
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,708
outside sources

295
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,149
you guys are problem solvers aren't you

296
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:25,338
you know it's just

297
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,629
yeah cut out the middleman necessity is

298
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:29,029
the mother of invention I think they

299
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:32,058
said well you know the way it works is

300
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:34,578
our reg our governing body a regulatory

301
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:36,409
agency is the Department of Agriculture

302
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:38,929
so we work with the Colorado Department

303
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:41,600
of Agriculture issued us our permit

304
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:44,359
we're very open with them everything we

305
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,129
do they you know we file harvest reports

306
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,769
planning reports it's kind of the way

307
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:51,528
the compliance works but they test

308
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:53,028
frequently they but you know it's

309
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:55,039
sporadic testing they don't announce

310
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:57,769
when they come and it's usually around

311
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,409
harvest a random drug test exactly and

312
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:03,078
the problem is is if they were to come

313
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:07,399
out and test my field and you know as

314
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:10,278
well as I do it the cannabinoid count

315
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,350
can fluctuate or change due to anything

316
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:15,110
you get a pest infestation or you get

317
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,389
prolonged periods of UV light or you get

318
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,188
a drought period you whatever happens

319
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:22,278
but you can have

320
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:23,928
exterior factors that can you know

321
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:26,448
change the cannabinoid council lutely

322
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:28,909
so if this if I have the CDA come in and

323
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:32,028
we're at four percent five point four

324
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:34,039
point five I have to destroy my crop Wow

325
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:35,990
four point five is your limit on time

326
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:38,409
point three percent point three is my

327
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:41,178
limit so anything over point three is uh

328
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:42,828
has to be destroyed on the property man

329
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,899
that's terrible I'd hate to have to see

330
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,969
that yeah so that's the you know we'll

331
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,649
build our own fasting facility it you

332
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,839
know it's worth it that way we can test

333
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,120
these things periodically and make sure

334
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,579
we we have that consistent product same

335
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,490
thing with we'll be doing an extraction

336
00:12:55,578 --> 00:13:00,469
now that we can do our own in-house lab

337
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,600
testing our own in-house homogenized

338
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,970
testing so as we release in large batch

339
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,649
products you know everything's gonna be

340
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,290
the same quality everything is gonna be

341
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:12,589
the same grade you know that's something

342
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:15,558
that I really I'm so fortunate to be a

343
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:18,740
part of this organization because they

344
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:21,049
believe the same way I do that we will

345
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,419
not skin or skip things like that when

346
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:26,058
it becomes too health and it comes to

347
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:28,878
the purity of the products we don't [ __ ]

348
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:31,278
around should see the look on his face

349
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,899

[ __ ] around dude big thank so much

351
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,720
respect for that we've needed people to

352
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:37,309
come to this industry like that

353
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,740
when a lot of the new rules came into

354
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:41,120
play a lot of money came into play the

355
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,159
guys with a lot of heart like you and I

356
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,659
kind of got pushed away by the guys with

357
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,919
a lot of money and a lot of backing so

358
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:48,289
it's good to see some heart coming back

359

hemp seed yes but the question is is how

364
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:06,100

365
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,099
colloidal silver registered to see

366
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:16,399
like stare back ask this fast yeah no

367

we're very interested and everybody's

370
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,700
interesting creating your own seed stock

371
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:24,980
right

372
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,800
what farm isn't interested in creating

373
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,519
their own see suck especially something

374
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:33,559
in the CBD industry is where the MMJ

375
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,990
industry was ten years ago

376
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:38,509

00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,169
lot of us and if you think that six

379
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,550

freaking awesome so what we brought you

394
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,649
here for is to actually talk about

395
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,300
integrated pest management so Wow you're

396
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,259
just running a huge outdoor you were

397
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,659
telling me what you were doing earlier

398
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:22,429
do you want to tell me about you can

399
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:26,419
start with the posting of the Instagram

400
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:29,449
picture and just be real with you guys

401
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:32,269
cuz people run into problems and I ran

402
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:35,390
into some problems so we'll just kind of

403
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:38,000
go over what happened to me what I used

404
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:41,179
is treatment and then what we do now is

405
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,070
weekly preventative measures and yeah

406
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:44,778
what kind of start there so yeah keep in

407
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,970
mind you guys this is in a greenhouse

408
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,230
and outdoor setting and then once you

409
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,470
get to do with this I will ask questions

410
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:54,070
about indoor stuff okay so well yeah

411
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,060
this is you can run this this is

412
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,970
everything that we're talking about can

413
00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:02,958
be ran in an indoor environment also so

414
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,790
we were you know running in our

415
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,409
greenhouses transplanting plants we

416
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:08,269
actually just moved from an indoor

417
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:11,299
environment we were growing in a small

418
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:13,458
warehouse and then moved everything into

419
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:16,909
her greenhouse and if anybody out there

420
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:18,018
is familiar with greenhouse growing it's

421
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,208
not easy

422
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,220
it's not it's not an indoor environment

423
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:26,778
this isn't something that you can just

424
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:28,850
fire up put plants into unfortunately

425
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,350
investors don't see it that way business

426
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,019
owners don't see it that way they want

427
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,850
plants in there so we introduce plants

428
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:38,509
as fast as possible the environment

429
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,249
isn't where it needs to be the you

430
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,048
there's just a lot of stresses that are

431
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,790
going on at the time and that kind of

432
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:45,970
goes to the first step in integrative

433
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:49,308
pest management this is a real dumb

434
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:56,028
statement but healthy plants are less

435
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:59,118
likely to get sick yeah and what you're

436
00:16:56,028 --> 00:17:01,489
saying that I really mean that if your

437
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:03,259
environments in good condition and your

438
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:05,449
water is in good condition and your

439
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:07,730
light is good condition and it's like a

440
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:11,120
report card if you're hitting aids and

441
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:13,788
all of these things if one fails you're

442
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:17,719
still gonna have a doubt so you need we

443
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:20,838
rely on this system to catch us so if

444
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,990
you're half-ass in everything you're

445
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:26,599
gonna run into problems yes so we

446
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,690
stepped into this greenhouse not fully

447
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:32,269
ready we have asked some things and we

448
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,308
ran into some problems and it's life I

449
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:37,220
mean I'm not I'm human so we run into

450
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:38,839
problems so we were we ran in there

451
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,460
running into some environmental issues

452
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,928
we were getting them straightened out

453
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,139
and the plants weren't as healthy as

454
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,880
they should have been soil was on point

455
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:49,129
and you know feeding schedule everything

456
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,049
was right where it should be but things

457
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,480
were lagging you know plant growth was

458
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:54,950
slow and we were having some issues

459
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,190
couldn't really figure out what they

460
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,819
were

461
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,470
we were actually posted some I'll let

462
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:01,970
you guys be the judge go my Instagram

463

00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:10,519
where I was actually contacted by a

467
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,558

00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:18,038
even if it's through sky person yeah

471
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,870
they're yet you have to they're just

472
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:25,129
pioneers at what they do really hope

473
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:26,778
they're really helped the you know

474
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,570
influence the way that I'm setting my

475
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:31,339
farm up for sure you know okay but so

476
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:35,240
they actually contacted me

477
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:37,069
we had some you know leaf curling the

478
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,960
way that they were curling kind of some

479
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:42,980
of the discoloration problems that we

480
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,860
were having and through a few other you

481
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,778
know things they actually saw the

482
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:52,819
pictures and said hey man you have broad

483
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:57,710
mites and I said oh no but before I

484
00:18:52,819 --> 00:19:00,230
could cry they had taken care of it and

485
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,269
sent me over some predatorial mites and

486
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:06,970
along with that they actually sent me a

487
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:09,409
little IPM program so immediately you

488
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,868
know we were gonna implement these mites

489
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:15,528
so but before I implemented these mites

490
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:17,509
this is what we actually did I heat

491
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:18,769
treated the greenhouse I don't know if

492
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:20,149
you've ever heard this you can do this

493
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:23,690
in your grow room if you have spider

494
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:25,418
mites also your plants can handle it

495
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,710
don't be scared

496
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:29,929
ours did and I had to have a lot more

497
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:34,069
money invested in mine than you do your

498
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:36,379
grow room so yeah but a heat treatment

499
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:38,148
so we actually you can run your grow

500
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:42,128
room at about a hundred and twenty

501
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:46,339
degrees for about 45 minutes holy [ __ ]

502
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:48,859
your plants will survive the spider

503
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:51,740
mites won't any bugs won't your gonna

504
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:53,508
nuke alive any beneficials or anything

505
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,460
in there but you're gonna sterilize your

506
00:19:53,509 --> 00:20:00,169
room to a greater extent I mean it's not

507
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:02,179
gonna be perfect and then went coming by

508
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:04,119
you know so run it for 45 minutes coming

509
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:08,210
back off of that for the next 15 minutes

510
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:10,699
no direct sunlight to hit the leaf no

511
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,159
water so you want to slowly you know

512
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,869
cool your room back down give it about

513
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,720
15 minutes before you start introducing

514
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:19,638
light you there's actually a lot of

515
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,899
research on that so if you're interested

516
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:22,398
if this is something that you're

517
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:24,739
interested on you can just go on google

518
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:27,558
google green house heat treatment and

519
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,749
then kind of go their steps okay but uh

520
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:32,599
so that was first step hit him with the

521
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:34,700
heat burn those [ __ ] alright so

522
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:37,849
we hit him with the heat treatment and

523
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,730
then after that dragon fire earth

524
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:43,490
medicine had sent me some beneficial

525
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,049
insects so we had predatorial mites

526
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,920
they actually sent me two different

527
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:51,319
packs we got a I believe it's a ski and

528
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,929
three packs I'm probably pronouncing it

529
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:56,629
all wrong but so two different types

530
00:20:53,929 --> 00:21:00,019
both of them can protect against the

531
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,660
broad might okay one of them the sworsky

532
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:05,720
I believe it's called protects against

533
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:08,509
the russet the spotted the brown suit

534
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,900
that one ass or skis all spider mite and

535
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:15,710
it's the broad thrip x is for thrips and

536
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:18,050
white fly and then also these predatory

537
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,990
mites also fight some broad mites and

538
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:23,149
they feed off each other cuz they're

539
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,710
carnivorous okay so we introduced some

540
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:28,550
takes about three weeks for them to

541
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,920
inoculate the plant and before I started

542
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:34,099
like you guys run out and you you want

543
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,710
to start trying this this doesn't work

544
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:40,699
in a synthetic system it right only

545
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:44,058
works in an organic system you cannot

546
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,819
use since you can't you certainly can't

547
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:49,549
use any systemics so you know don't go

548
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:51,319
and spray things that kill mites and put

549
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:54,169
beneficial mites on your plants because

550
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:56,980
that's counterproductive second thing

551
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:59,420
don't use synthetic nutrients because

552
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,190
the thing is is when you use synthetic

553
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,190
nutrients you're bypassing natural

554
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:08,049
processes you're feeding your plant

555
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,240
through an IV there's no need for

556
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:13,250
microbiology there's no need for

557
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,929
protozoa and nematodes and anthropods

558
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,150
because you're just feeding it straight

559
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:20,030
to the root zone so when you bypass

560
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:23,120
these natural processes what's happening

561
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:27,769
is you're not allowing the plant to

562
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:30,019
build its natural immune response so if

563
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:32,480
you can keep it organic and you can keep

564
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:35,299
this biological system just in check

565
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,940
throughout the whole cycle then when

566
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:41,450
your plan gets infected your ally the

567
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:44,330
plant itself can react to it your plant

568
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:48,920
is can finde off spider mites you know

569
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:50,419
the if your plant couldn't then there

570
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,640
would be way more spider mites than

571
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,200
there would be marijuana plants but your

572
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,540
plant can naturally fight off spider

573
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,860
mites the problem is is the

574
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:59,690
a synthetic growing environment

575
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:02,750
especially indoors you play has no

576
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,900
resistance if I has it's a puss grew up

577
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:07,809
in a plastic bubble yeah so you know and

578
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,759
that's kind of the same thing is that

579
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,980
you your plane isn't going to build any

580
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:15,710
resistant if you're feeding a space food

581
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:19,430
the whole time you know it needs the it

582
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:21,350
needs to digest it it needs to chew it

583
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,690
it needs to you know work that whole

584
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:26,449
process out itself otherwise it's just

585
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,150
going to become weak and decrepid and

586
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:32,809
have no defense because at that point

587
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,390
what is your plant doing it's quick

588
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:37,369
vegetative turnovers fast veg times and

589
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,750
high yields that's all you care about

590
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:40,339
and that's all you're focused on so

591
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,359
you're focused on increasing leaf

592
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:45,829
surface area an increasing bud area

593
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,259
you're not worried about increasing root

594
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:50,899
zone you're not include about increasing

595
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:52,670
you know the the bricks County you're

596
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,250
playing well you're focusing on the

597
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,720
wrong things and there's a lot more to

598
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,819
it than that so when you miss these

599
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,460
things you plant you know can't defend

600
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:03,409
itself so just wanted I've forgot to

601
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,920
mention that is this is for organic

602
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,900
systems only and if you're not running

603
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,259
an organic system you're gonna have to

604
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,610
spray unless you keep it completely

605
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,349
clean you're gonna have to keep a very

606
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:17,449
clean environment but in an outdoor

607
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:19,819
system something like we're running in a

608
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,700
greenhouse and an outdoor hybrid

609
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:25,819
environment where you pull in fresh air

610
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,350
not through a HEPA filter you know we we

611
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:30,829
have shutter fans we got we've got

612
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:33,679
outside exactly it was seven degrees

613
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:36,819
this morning man but the plants are a

614
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,289
lot tougher than we give them credit for

615
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:41,389
even though you know honestly even

616
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:42,409
indoors plants are a lot tougher than we

617
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:46,190
give them credit for then we've grown

618
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:47,360
from millions of years by themselves we

619
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,220
should give them a little bit more

620
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,019
respect they can they've been fighting

621
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,360
for themselves for a long time and I

622
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:56,930
think that a lot of the problems that

623
00:24:53,359 --> 00:25:01,309
modern growers run into or because of

624
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:03,650
the modern methods that they use so it's

625
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:05,029
the center at my opinion this is you

626
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,150
know just me speaking it but it's the

627
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:09,859
synthetic systems and the synthetic

628
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,250
environment too when I say synthetic

629
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:11,769
environment

630
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:16,009
I'm not meaning grow lights I mean in

631
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:17,349
synthetic pesticides and yeah but uh we

632
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:20,210
you know with these synthetic systems

633
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:23,240
that's what's creating this influx these

634
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:25,370
super Hardy spider mites these crazy

635
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,569
resistant powdery mildew strains is

636
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:32,239
because you're creating a feeding your

637
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:35,179
Colorado is a whole is creating a

638
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,049
feeding ground for pest and disease you

639
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:41,240
know every single dispensary is spraying

640
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:44,419
the same thing you know they're spraying

641
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,359
neem oil or you know the it's a very

642
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,740
short list for a whole lot of plants

643
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,939
right and they're not using these

644
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:55,640
biological controls so if you don't want

645
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:59,059
to run into problems kick it you know

646
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,880
start using organic methods ASAP

647
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:04,099
and then you know you can these

648
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,660
beneficial insects they're not something

649
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:08,629
that are hard to get you can go to your

650
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,420
local hydro store go to top-notch calm

651
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,010
go to Cooper try to contact dragonfly

652
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,700
maybe bug them enough they'll get them

653
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:20,629
for you but uh you can get these mites

654
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,819
um you don't have to spray you know we

655
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:26,300
in you know for example we put these

656
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:27,919
beneficial mites out we top dress with

657
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:31,759
neem and karanji

658
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:34,789
we table dress with diatomaceous earth

659
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,950
I fold your spray with natural mystic

660
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:40,369
which is a dragonfly or it's nice

661
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:45,559
product so it's just like nettle thistle

662
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:47,029
horsetail lavender petula all sorts of

663
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:49,369
[ __ ] it almost take a bite out of eight

664
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:50,960
smells wonderful and yeah I'd love to

665
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:55,429
spray the greenhouse with it but you

666
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,370
know we spray natural mystic so natural

667
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:02,750
mystic barley and earthworm cast or like

668
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:06,139
a barley malted tea near CTC sprouted

669
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:08,509
team [ __ ] but yes so barley natural

670
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,540
mystic earthworm castings that was a

671
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:16,759
preventative that we were foliar

672
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:21,049
spraying with natural mystic earthworm

673
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:22,819
castings and bacillus third iNSYS that's

674
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:23,759
great for the fungus gnats

675
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:25,619
exactly

676
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,779
wife doesn't that's what that yeah so

677
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:30,599
you know a lot of these things are just

678
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:32,190
this the same thing over and over again

679
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,159
right just different forms different

680
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:37,559
ages actually so right now on a weekly

681
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,860
basis we give them a weekly app of

682
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:45,059
natural mystic Rocky Mount worm castings

683
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:47,579
and then see crop yeah so yeah so yeah

684
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:50,429
trace so trace minerals natural mystic

685
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:53,490
worm castings weekly basis you'll be

686
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:56,580
right that on top of just maintaining a

687
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:59,130
healthy plant I mean you know like I was

688
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:01,379
saying the key is to just maintain the

689
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:03,930
biological immune response through the

690
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:07,500
entire growth cycle so no synthetic

691
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:09,390
nutrients no pesticides period no

692
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,940
bypassing natural processes

693
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:14,130
don't put your plant in a bubble I got

694
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,480
that in exclamation points on both sides

695
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,150
so nobody would know you're reading

696
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,890
anything and I just say it's very

697
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:26,400
important in there not let's see what

698
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:29,280
else we got so we got Ben if we went

699
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,300
over the beneficials so Lister Genesis

700
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,289
you know I mean the big thing with

701
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:39,659
integrative pest management is

702
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:43,829
maintaining a natural system is going to

703
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:45,660
be looking scouting you know stay

704
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:48,569
observant you need to mean you know the

705
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,880
time when you notice a bug problem it's

706
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:53,129
too late right you know stay on top of

707
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,810
these things look out for yellowing

708
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,800
leaves here there's a reason sticky

709
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:58,919
traps are yellow

710
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,269
bugs are attracted to dying leaders so

711
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,240
keep all the other leaves out of your

712
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:06,450
grow room if you are a no-till gardener

713
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,660
and you are somebody who top feeds with

714
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,009
your leaves know what you're doing top

715
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,570
dress with make sure your top dressing

716
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:14,579
with neem and car wash you make sure

717
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:16,319
that you do have beneficial nematodes in

718
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:18,509
there maybe you do treat with bacillus

719
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,399
thuringiensis every now and then because

720
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:23,670
otherwise you're gonna run into fungus

721
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:26,040
gnats so you just need to be a little

722
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,650
bit more educated that's how I got my

723
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:31,019
fungus gnats trying to go no-till yeah

724
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,570
and I did it before too and I mean you

725
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,490
know that's it it is what it is but you

726
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:36,490
know you learn these things it's a

727
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:41,079
process

728
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:42,819
and your plan will work itself out

729
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:46,449
you know it'll you lil end up with

730
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:49,649
different sprig tails and different soil

731
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:52,809
mites and shredders and anthropods and

732
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:55,330
it'll balance itself out yeah it's just

733
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:57,909
nature does its thing they're not

734
00:29:55,329 --> 00:30:00,699
welcome you know your plants are healthy

735
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:02,400
you treat them you know you keep doing

736
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,569
what you're doing you hit them with your

737
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:08,980
bacillus thuringiensis hit him with some

738
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:10,659
diatomaceous when your so my guy is at

739
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,789
work I can't [ __ ] get this through

740
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:18,130
their heads man the diatomaceous doesn't

741
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:21,399
work when it's wet love-god abrasive

742
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:24,190
rough yes yes yeah and that also goes

743
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,190
for right after you water I said when

744
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:29,620
the soil still wet

745
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:32,350
don't put diatomaceous on it having a

746
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:34,719
hard time getting these guys to put

747
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:38,079
diatomaceous out correctly and that goes

748
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,970
back to just education is key know how

749
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,470
to put your pests you know earned I say

750
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,210
pesticide about how to put your products

751
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,759
out correctly you know like I said the

752
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,680
cd8 came by our farm last week but

753
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,839
nothing on our farm is considered a

754
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:53,920
pesticide or really even a fertilizer

755
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:56,259
you know our diatomaceous earth is

756
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:59,980
bought as an anti-caking agent for

757
00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:02,849
animal feed we use food grade aloe and

758
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:06,400
cocoa our neem and caranas bought from

759
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:08,949
you know Nate natural select source a

760
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,440
Rocky Mount worm company so in its other

761
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,509
three great yeah so you know Jay only

762
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,029
uses food grade material for his worms

763
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:17,710
so I'm only getting food grade material

764
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:18,730
for the plants that's awesome it's good

765
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:22,299
to know the patients are being taken

766
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:23,259
care of man awesome yeah yeah so a lot

767
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,509
of what you covered you said organic

768
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:27,400
only and then you said if you're doing

769
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:30,039
synthetic nutrients you're gonna have to

770
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,480
spray so now here's what we're gonna

771
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:33,430
have to talk about that one the dreaded

772
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,289
I'm gonna have to spray let's say walk

773
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,960
in and I see freaking spider mites in my

774
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:39,759
grow room I've got a light infest day

775
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,950
infestation I've never sprayed anything

776
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,799
before what is something we can spray

777
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:47,230
that's not gonna do too much damage

778
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:49,059
biologically to my planet and also to me

779
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,140
when I smoke it and also not make my

780
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:52,569
concentrate States

781
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:56,370
like [ __ ] you see you your first go-to

782
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:58,779
would obviously be the nîmes okay I know

783
00:31:56,369 --> 00:32:01,839
then the first thing that you want to do

784
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:05,230
is throw down a nicety of some neem

785
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:08,289
karanji earthworm castings just right

786
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,880
drench into the root zone the roots okay

787
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:11,740
yeah or you know if you don't want to

788
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,560
make it too you can top dress that's how

789
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:17,349
we ran it at our farm okay just wheeze

790
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,019
and I say neem and karanji it's because

791
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:22,209
garage is cheaper than me so you can cut

792
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:25,839
it 50/50 and save a good bit of money

793
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:28,930
there you go so yeah we cut yeah I cut

794
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:32,589
those in neem oil wouldn't spray it

795
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:34,779
after veg obviously essential oils

796
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:38,279
you're gonna pay a whole bunch of money

797
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:40,750
but S&amp;S does kind of work okay um

798
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:43,149
rosemary oil yeah they'll kill spider

799
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:45,670
mite eggs on contact and it'll irritate

800
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:48,120
the spider mites push them back a good

801
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:50,830
bit and inhibit their growth so

802
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:53,019
essential oils things like S&amp;S 70 I'm

803
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:55,869
not like a huge fan of like ladybug

804
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:58,480
killer red Rosenthal's to your tolerance

805
00:32:55,869 --> 00:33:00,429
I haven't seen great too good results

806
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,500
but as soon as I have it's extremely

807
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,960
pricey you can make it yourself it's

808
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,180
rose 90 you know it's like nine percent

809
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,880
rosemary or two percent rosemary oil or

810
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,529
something like that so you could make it

811
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,450
if you feel like being a little

812
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:15,399
experimental I have cooked some plants

813
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,470
before with essential oils oh yes so

814
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,470
they're extremely volatile I got to be

815
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:23,799
really careful outside of that I would

816
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:26,680
go to biologicals you know would be my

817
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:30,399
next step so that's when I would step

818
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:33,880
into the predatorial mites ladybugs

819
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,650
ladybugs don't eat spider mites lady

820
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,780
bugs eat larger insects like aphids

821
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:40,570
things like that it's actually ladybug

822
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:43,359
larva they'd eat the spider mites so you

823
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:46,210
need to bring them in and then give them

824
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,639
enough time to you know lower the lights

825
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:50,590
light some candles play some music and

826
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,390
then have them make babies all over your

827
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:54,819
garden need a little lake bug or J there

828
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:58,000
you go dude just would stockin in your

829
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:59,500
garden and their ladybugs limit any to

830
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,900
their larva will emerge little alligator

831
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,349
larvae and then those elite soft-bodied

832
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,100
ends

833
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,839
you know

834
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:07,178
smaller soft-bodied insects mites things

835
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:11,378
like that okay so you can you know start

836
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:13,690
implementing that system defoliating

837
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:16,239
taken off the infected areas people

838
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,909
overlook that so much I can't tell you

839
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:22,029
how many times I've gone to an infected

840
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:25,269
garden and seen stippled plants and

841
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:27,100
these things look just Fox and you know

842
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:29,349
my first question why are these leaves

843
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:31,509
still on here see you know the spider

844
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:33,878
mites are still on your plants man yeah

845
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:38,740
so remove that vegetation unless it's

846
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:41,049
absolutely needed you know and I'm

847
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:43,719
learning a lot from plants running on a

848
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:47,080
larger scale like I am plants can take a

849
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:50,378
lot and if you need to thin your plan

850
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:53,889
out to two tops from a [ __ ] 12 top

851
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:55,960
five-gallon it's gonna survive yeah and

852
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:57,670
if if all you're trying to say and

853
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,440
that's maybe something that you need to

854
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,150
assess too so and you fight you walk

855
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,250
into your garden and you find the spider

856
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,630
my problem which you know may be the

857
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,909
first thing that you really need to do

858
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,730
is think about what is this plants

859
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:13,179
intention is it getting ready to be

860
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:15,280
flowered can I just kill it could you is

861
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:17,409
it too much right now for you know if

862
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,920
perfect world I would tell you to throw

863
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:22,750
the plan away yeah you know yeah and

864
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,010
maybe you can't maybe you're too far in

865
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,019
you've already got too much invested

866
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,270
growing cycle that's what I'd say you

867
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:30,070
know neem oils and then the essential

868
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:32,679
oils and the predatory you know the

869
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,240
predatorial 's and things like that by

870
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:38,289
the time you notice it's usually too

871
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:40,118
late unless you can you know veg for

872
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:42,880
another four weeks cut her back take

873
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:45,850
clones off of that and inoculate the

874
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,349
clones and usually what what I try to do

875
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:49,539
if I find something to out of control if

876
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:51,279
I I do consulting as well and if I go to

877
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:52,690
someone's grow and I can see that their

878
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,460
mother plant or their vegetable and has

879
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,440
gotten too far I just say take Collins

880
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,179
bro we can kill you no bugs on clones

881
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,590
and get rid of those big-ass plants less

882
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:01,179
vegetation like you were saying around

883
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,890
to keep all those bugs around so cuz

884
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:04,329
some clones clean the room start fresh

885
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:05,639
that may be your only option sometimes

886
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:08,400
yeah and

887
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:12,150
you know and a lot of people don't they

888
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,298
don't understand start fresh means get

889
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:18,690
off your ass scrub your wrists rub

890
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:22,889
change your filters you got pain to film

891
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:24,450
go and buy some new rolls you you're not

892
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:27,268
you don't just pull your plants out

893
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:30,058
these the spider mites got in there two

894
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:31,588
ways they got in there because you

895
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:33,180
didn't change your clothes and you

896
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:35,338
walked into an effective garden and

897
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:39,108
brought them in or somebody you know

898
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:42,630
brought them in or the second option is

899
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:44,068
they brought themselves in and I you

900
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,460
know have an agricultural background

901
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:50,190
I've worked in a cucumber a of grown

902
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,409
cucumbers tomatoes and Falcon up and

903
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:55,440
north of herb Western or Eastern

904
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:57,480
Colorado all [ __ ] up but no so like

905
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,548
when we would do I was in charge of IPM

906
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,039
there and we would do scouting programs

907
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:04,259
so every morning you would walk out with

908
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:06,210
your magnifying glass and your clipboard

909
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,819
with your map of the greenhouse and

910
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:11,099
would have your rows marked out and you

911
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:12,900
would be surprised to see that you know

912
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:15,059
we would find stippling and we would

913
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,160
mark him on the map as we found

914
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:18,420
stippling in these rows once we would go

915
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,480
through all these rows you could follow

916
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,559
this map back to a cracked seal in the

917
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,909
greenhouse Wow

918
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,829
to where there was a broken because it

919
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:28,710
was a glass greenhouse - a broken pane

920
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:32,039
where weeds had grown through same thing

921
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:33,568
in your grow room you notice that the

922
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:36,539
spider mites in the back corner of your

923
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:38,250
room maybe it's not sealed you know you

924
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:40,650
might have a draft back there maybe

925
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:42,568
that's where your window is and you put

926
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,500
a piece of plywood over it with hand

927
00:37:42,568 --> 00:37:44,788
film because you thought that was gonna

928
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,199
be enough to cover it you didn't whether

929
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:53,210
seal it but that is that's how spider

930
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:55,558
mites get into your gray room they it's

931
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:59,009
evolutionary thing to want to survive

932
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,960
and in Colorado when it's four degrees

933
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:04,380
outside and you have a ninety you know a

934
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,798
75 degree grow room that's where I'm

935
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,259
going

936
00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:10,349
oh yeah like going on buck your plants

937
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:12,139
an outtake in vacation time in there bro

938
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:13,100
yeah go get warm go slow

939
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:15,920
I've been doing during this winter

940
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:17,539
hiding in a grow room so you nailed

941
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,710
something you nailed two things off the

942
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:20,449
list I had written down there's your

943
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,179
environment will contribute to your bugs

944
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:24,829
heavily and also you bring those bugs in

945
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:26,389
so I get to cross off two things on the

946
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:28,519
list without even asking that's amazing

947
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:30,409
you guys if you're going from grow to

948
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:33,050
grow you're bringing something back with

949
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:36,409
you every time you come and go and if

950
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:38,960
you if you really want to you can buy a

951
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:41,469
lab coat and that's something that I

952
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,610
recommend to all of my growers every

953
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:45,589
consultation every we do it at my you

954
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,780
know will do it at my work when we're

955
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:51,710
not growing in a when we get back into a

956
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:53,840
more of an indoor environment but yeah

957
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:55,250
get a lab coat they don't cost anything

958
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,590
you can order them I get one for your

959
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,269
home grow and put it on every time you

960
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,890
go on your grow room hang up on the

961
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:02,449
outside right by the door exactly right

962
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:04,159
next to your clipboard yep don't take it

963
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:08,049
anywhere you know buy yourself a grow

964
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,049
room Tam and then you don't wear that

965
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:14,360
box might carry something there that

966
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:15,829
might get caught in a fan everything if

967
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,079
I don't keep them off I have a hat

968
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:19,309
specifically for the grow and it's you

969
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,090
could probably collect a quarter gram of

970
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:25,699
hash off of that thing but that's the

971
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:28,910
key though is just that contamination

972
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:32,719
it's as simple as not wearing the hoodie

973
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:34,869
that you were hiking in Indian you know

974
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,069
you laugh but to a lot of people it's

975
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:41,809
Eid they don't think about that stuff

976
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:44,269
absolutely a lot of the guys hid my work

977
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:47,960
probably go home to their gardens

978
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:49,909
right after my work do I worry about

979
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,519
them bringing things back now really

980
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:53,869
because you know they're an indoor grow

981
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:57,320
bringing it to an outside environment

982
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:58,819
now am i you know they should be really

983
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,250
[ __ ] worried about bringing something

984
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:03,470
home because if a spider mite comes into

985
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,719
my garden it's not gonna like it very

986
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:07,129
much it's gonna jump onto your shirt try

987
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,919
to come home with you and see what you

988
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:11,930
got but that's you know everybody's

989
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,400
garden so the next time you go to your

990
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:20,210
friend's house and his garden looks a

991
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:23,269
lot better than yours yet change before

992
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,900
and after oh yeah yeah do him a favor -

993
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:27,840
don't don't be a dick and go

994
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,180
your friends grow after walking in the

995
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,530
woods yeah don't tell me don't come to

996
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:33,480
my grow and be like all your plants are

997
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,950
great I'm fighting spider mites don't

998
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,260
come over if you got spider mites stay

999
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:38,759
away from my garden exactly yeah don't

1000
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,110
bring your powdery mildew to my grow

1001
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,710
yeah and that's you know and that's

1002
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:45,420
another thing too is the the powdery

1003
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:49,110
mildews you know now that you said that

1004
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,420
it's traded you know so frequently back

1005
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:54,900
and forth and within the community and

1006
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:57,869
that's another one that when you know

1007
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:02,010
when when I say kill and start over

1008
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:04,589
I mean scorched earth IV burn it down to

1009
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,180
the ground and build her back up yep you

1010
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:09,570
have to sometimes and you know and

1011
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:11,849
honestly when you your grow room should

1012
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:16,260
bill be built with that capability and

1013
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:18,539
if it's not rebuild your grow room with

1014
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,520
either walls that you could clean with

1015
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:22,949
bleach or peroxide or whatever cleaning

1016
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,750
agent or maybe it's paying to film but

1017
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:27,839
build it to where you can replace it

1018
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:30,599
been a frequent basis you know you spray

1019
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:34,170
foam insulation don't you shitty you

1020
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:37,019
know stuff wall insulation exactly don't

1021
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:40,289
you know and if you can't afford you

1022
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:42,239
know these nicer options paint a film's

1023
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,969
not expensive if you build the room

1024
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:46,589
right you know it's really expensive if

1025
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:49,439
you don't know what you're doing and

1026
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:51,840
you're running it 15 times around it but

1027
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,210
yeah you know build your rooms correctly

1028
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,500
make sure they're sealed yeah pay

1029
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,909
attention to what you're doing yeah

1030
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,650
that's that's one of the main keys to

1031
00:41:56,909 --> 00:42:00,659
growing is a good room and it you only

1032
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,920
get that one shot to build it correct

1033
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:04,379
before you put your plants in there so

1034
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,240
do it right I'm like Sean said try to

1035
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,890
replace that room if you if you're using

1036
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,359
pan to film that's not gonna last

1037
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:11,519
forever you guys take it down every like

1038
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,410
six months like every couple of harvests

1039
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,820
pull that [ __ ] down clean behind it get

1040
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:16,170
the shot back out clean out all the

1041
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,260
corners behind there where all that dust

1042
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:21,510
built up no I don't know how many like

1043
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:23,010
especially home grows I've been to I

1044
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,930
don't know why people like to build

1045
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,820
floors

1046
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:28,019
there's no weirdest thing to me but I

1047
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,570
don't know how many grow rooms I've been

1048
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:32,579
in where people have floors built up

1049
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:34,530
just a couple inches or you know they'll

1050
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:36,809
have pain to film rolled out on top of

1051
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:38,610
concrete for extra reflective

1052
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:41,789
this is just creating more space for

1053
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:47,099
bugs pests mildew and problems like that

1054
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:51,570
so less is more in a grow room if you

1055
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:53,069
can hold temp and you you know don't

1056
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,650
need to cover your floor if you have

1057
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:58,019
your growing in your garage utilize that

1058
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,660
concrete floor man you know it's nice

1059
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:03,179
it's clean it can be cleaned easily yeah

1060
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:05,429
you know drop you some two by fours and

1061
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:08,219
call it to the floor go get some great

1062
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:10,319
stuff foam insulate it no bugs are gonna

1063
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:12,359
crawl through that but just little steps

1064
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,730
through like that's what's gonna prevent

1065
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,340
you know for you from having a massive

1066
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:19,829
infestation like that what you said once

1067
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,970
you see it it's probably too late that's

1068
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,829
that's something that people are

1069
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:23,699
probably not aware of especially if

1070
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:25,049
you're in flower

1071
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:26,609
if you're in flower you just got to

1072
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:30,030
start pulling off leaves and write it

1073
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:31,890
through yes and I can't tell you how

1074
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:35,610
many times I've had to do it you know I

1075
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:37,739
mean you know it's in spider mites can

1076
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:39,660
be dealt with they can be gotta get you

1077
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:41,519
can get rid of them it's not the end of

1078
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:44,670
the world and you don't have to kill

1079
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,889
your plants you know but like you said

1080
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,559
if you if you're getting ready to go

1081
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:52,440
into flower and you see stippling don't

1082
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:54,630
flower don't be that guy you know

1083
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,880
because when you find yourself with that

1084
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,760
decision of an old man am I gonna have

1085
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,230
to spray in week four with neem oil

1086
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,760
you're gonna have to spray a week for an

1087
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,409
emo because you put yourself in that

1088
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,910
position because by week six you're just

1089
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:07,920
gonna have crispy ass leaves and

1090
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,960
nobody's and you know and you know it

1091
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,530
but what was worse is or even if you

1092
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,990
were a week into flower would been worse

1093
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:18,750
reverting back to veg or you know

1094
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:20,399
holding on to this spider mite

1095
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,929
infestation and having to ride it

1096
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,539
through and potentially losing

1097
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:27,179
everything you know it's another month

1098
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:29,909
to power bills versus losing your entire

1099
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:31,529
harvest so you know you gotta weigh your

1100
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:33,449
options on that goes back to really

1101
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:36,840
think about your situation what are

1102
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:38,369
these planes for true that yeah you

1103
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,809
grown your own personal medicine or you

1104
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:40,889
got a crop out there that you're trying

1105
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:42,179
to make some Bank on you're trying to

1106
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:43,829
buy that new car yeah is it a

1107
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,618
dispensaries and not your plants is

1108
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:48,028
somebody else's money in you that's a

1109
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:50,338
that's a stress that people don't

1110
00:44:48,028 --> 00:44:52,440
realize exist out there is you know we

1111
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:55,440
me and you both we grow personally and

1112
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,349
stuff but we manage other people's

1113
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,880
gardens I mean they're our gardens but

1114
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:01,739
it's other people's money ultimately

1115
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,809
absolutely somebody else's you know so

1116
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:06,088
what do you do in that situation you

1117
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:09,298
know how do you as a grower come to the

1118
00:45:06,088 --> 00:45:13,170
decision of to Kola plant you know like

1119
00:45:09,298 --> 00:45:15,389
wait yeah I mean that's the stuff that's

1120
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:18,539
the daily decisions that we have to make

1121
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:21,478
and if we can do it you can do it at

1122
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:23,640
your home oh yeah you know I mean but

1123
00:45:21,478 --> 00:45:25,318
that's what you really people have to

1124
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:27,778
start thinking about things a lot

1125
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:30,058
differently I meet a lot of people and

1126
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:31,858
it's I got spider mites what can I spray

1127
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:34,259
I got powdery mildew what can I spray

1128
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:36,960
it's not what can you spray it's what

1129
00:45:34,259 --> 00:45:38,608
should I have sprayed you know if you

1130
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,259
should be spraying ahead of time stay on

1131
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:44,219
top of these for your compost tea

1132
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:46,650
folders you do compost tea foliar sprays

1133
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:50,309
on a regular basis along with beneficial

1134
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:51,989
insects mites nematodes you know top

1135
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:55,650
dress with diatomaceous earth neem and

1136
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:58,048
karanji I don't see you having a pest

1137
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,568
problem you know and then for in my

1138
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:02,460
greenhouse you know like I was saying we

1139
00:46:00,568 --> 00:46:04,170
thought that we had a broad mite

1140
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,318
infestation actually turned out that it

1141
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:09,659
was a another problem was a water issue

1142
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:11,849
because our well had collapsed we had

1143
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:14,670
brought water from another well at a

1144
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:17,489
different location um and did the very

1145
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:19,559
foolish thing of not fully checking the

1146
00:46:17,489 --> 00:46:22,409
water's chemistry before we ran it

1147
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:25,229
through an RO ended up putting high

1148
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:28,739
levels of salt in the plants but I'm a

1149
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:31,048
firm believer that it was the soil the

1150
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:33,778
environment and the overall health it

1151
00:46:31,048 --> 00:46:36,509
was that natural immune response that

1152
00:46:33,778 --> 00:46:39,719
pushed me out of it you know if if I was

1153
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:41,909
in cocoa growing with mills and I put

1154
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:43,920
that much salt on my plants it would've

1155
00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:46,139
been over the instantly it'd have been

1156
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,469
like a pepper sprayed I've been

1157
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:52,259
screaming yeah but we rode it out and

1158

00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,099
are that's the truth if your misery you

1195
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:13,289
know if you go into your grow room and

1196
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:16,079
you're looking at it is work and you're

1197
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:18,360
and you think of it is I gotta get in

1198
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,039
here I gotta check these plants and I

1199
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,289
gotta hurry up in water so I can get out

1200
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:25,289
of here and I can go and do this stop

1201
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:27,090
and quit growing yes because that's the

1202
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:28,860
wrong approach yeah and that's when

1203
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:31,140
you're gonna run into these you're gonna

1204
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:33,120
miss the stippling you know cuz you're

1205
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:34,889
not gonna have stippling if you're

1206
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,719
staying on top of it you're checking

1207
00:48:34,889 --> 00:48:38,579
your environment on a regular basis and

1208
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:41,849
you know that there's no air leaks or

1209
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:42,900
you know ventilation issues and if

1210
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:44,130
you're staying on top of your

1211
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,289
maintenance and you're pullin your

1212
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:48,300
yellow leaves and you're cleaning up the

1213
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:49,889
inside of the plant so they've got the

1214
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,660
you know airflow and you don't have to

1215
00:48:49,889 --> 00:48:55,799
worry about the mildew I met with the

1216
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:57,210
guy today was telling me that one of

1217
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:04,560
their greenhouses like that powdery

1218
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:11,340
mildew it is February 3rd in Colorado it

1219
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:12,929
was 4 degrees with like 0% humidity

1220
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:16,680
and these [ __ ] got powdery

1221
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:18,869
mildew why because they were growing

1222
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:20,549
with synthetics they didn't clean their

1223
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:24,029
plants bright it was operator error

1224
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:26,510
yeah you know it's not plant error you

1225
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:29,940
know these and that's something that

1226
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:31,680
don't blame yourself and don't blame

1227
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,539
other people because that's really not

1228
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:37,949
the way to view a pest problem

1229
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:41,009
you should always view it as what can

1230
00:49:37,949 --> 00:49:44,129
you do to improve it if your buddy gives

1231
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:46,320
you spider mites don't punch him in the

1232
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:51,240
face because he's dealing with the

1233
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:54,030
problems too but now you know if

1234
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:55,079
honestly though if you get spider mites

1235
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,120
from your buddy

1236
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:59,190
then you're kind of a dumbass for

1237
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,960
bringing a plane without checking it for

1238
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,720
spider mites and that goes back to you

1239
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,579
just being educated enough to identify

1240
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:07,619
what stippling is to know what spider my

1241
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:12,029
eggs look like to know how to use a

1242

I'm not afraid to tell you I got spider

1270
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:28,750
mites you know I'll post that if I get

1271
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:32,110
powdery mildew you know we were dealing

1272
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:33,789
with algae blooms on our root riot we

1273
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:35,920
had algae growing on root riot blocks

1274
00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:38,259
that's because the temperature

1275
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,210
fluctuation our air temp was staying

1276
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:42,340
warm enough but the cube temp was

1277
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:45,970
dropping okay I can you they don't make

1278
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:48,910
thermometers to check cube temp but you

1279
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:52,629
know so we were basically keeping the

1280
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:56,920
cubes too cold we had our so when we

1281
00:51:52,630 --> 00:52:01,240
claimed we'll do like a allo cocoa I'm

1282
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:02,769
sorry allo protec and full power and

1283
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:04,779
then we'll usually fall your spray with

1284
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:07,179
like a seed crop or a compost tea but

1285
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,040
basically we had some nutrient content

1286
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:10,960
and the plants wouldn't take it because

1287
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:14,199
roots never develop because it was too

1288
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,579
cold the plants didn't die but you know

1289
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:19,960
there was nutrient content excess

1290
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:21,579
sunlight algae bloom you know but yeah

1291
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,170
you just got to live in you learn man

1292
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:24,400
look you had a little pond happening

1293
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,960
exactly yeah

1294
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,240
but you can fish in there see yeah we

1295
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,679
now we're running easy cloners I'd love

1296
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:31,659

1297
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:34,269
planners it's it's wonderful yeah but

1298
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:36,730
indoors in micro room it's you know

1299
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:39,159
anywhere that else that we've run it we

1300
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:41,969
do the same cloning method over and over

1301
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:45,369
again hitting you know ninety percent

1302
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:47,109
you know clone rates bring him into this

1303
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:50,319
greenhouse

1304
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:53,860
I have plant I have clones that aren't

1305
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:56,769
dead aren't rooted still green and lush

1306
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:59,140
they were taken almost a month to go Wow

1307
00:52:56,769 --> 00:53:00,940
and the reason I haven't thrown them is

1308
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:04,239
because I'm really anxious to see what

1309
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:05,769
happens they're gonna live or die dude

1310
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:08,619
I've got plans

1311
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:11,889
I've got plants like that I've taken

1312
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:13,359
clones off of from like clones I took

1313
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:17,769
with you know I took that clone right

1314
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:21,280
yeah but so yeah roll with the punches

1315
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:23,170
you know information is key preventive

1316
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,120
is key or preventive is key and

1317
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:27,519
information is a big part of that

1318
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:30,219
preventive is know what you're doing and

1319
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:31,210
don't don't go and conceited and cocky

1320
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:33,358
like you know what you're doing but

1321
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:36,389
really do your research yeah

1322
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:38,130
spend some time you know looking at what

1323
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:42,328
spider mites looks like if you hear that

1324
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:45,778
your friend has a spider mites go and

1325
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:47,880
for the love of God find an old t-shirt

1326
00:53:45,778 --> 00:53:50,369
or something but volunteer to go over to

1327
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,809
his house with the microscope look and

1328
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:53,579
see what the spider mite damage looks

1329
00:53:51,809 --> 00:53:56,700
like because you're not gonna know

1330
00:53:53,579 --> 00:54:00,269
unless you look and but that's what I

1331
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:02,098
think is so important is the education

1332
00:54:00,268 --> 00:54:03,659
you know what you're looking for

1333
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:05,609
yeah yeah so if you can become familiar

1334
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:08,159
with stippling you can become familiar

1335
00:54:05,608 --> 00:54:09,808
with fungus mat or your new difference

1336
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,548
between a fungus gnat a flying rude

1337
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:14,298
aphid if you become familiar with the

1338
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:17,219
thrip or all three or Wi-Fi you know

1339
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:19,288
people these small-time guys aren't

1340
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:20,700
familiar with it you know we me and you

1341
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:23,278
run into it because we're growing

1342
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:26,218
hundreds and thousands of these plants

1343
00:54:23,278 --> 00:54:29,009
but when you're in your home grow and

1344
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:35,039
you run into these prized is you're not

1345
00:54:29,009 --> 00:54:37,309
perfect it happens but you stop you know

1346
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:40,199
evaluate the you know situation and

1347
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:42,479
don't panic exactly educate yourself you

1348
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:45,509
know don't run down to that gross store

1349
00:54:42,478 --> 00:54:48,389
and buy a chemical and spray your plant

1350
00:54:45,509 --> 00:54:50,880
if you've never used a synthetic you

1351
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:53,940
know nutrient if you haven't you mean

1352
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,559
even if you had so if as long as you

1353
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,469
haven't sprayed there systemics is

1354
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,719
really the big thing um if you're in veg

1355
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:06,179
and you hit it with some advanced newts

1356
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:07,920
or something like that um stop go and

1357
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:09,808
hit it with the compost tea top dress

1358
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,289
with some earthworm castings try to make

1359
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:15,630
start that biological system implement

1360
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:19,170
some beneficials start foal you're

1361
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:20,519
spraying and then just ride it out like

1362
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,619
nature intended and they won't want to

1363
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:31,198
hang out don't get exactly the plate of

1364
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:33,180
the bugs a leaf no yeah so I don't think

1365
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,459
I would be as experienced of a gardener

1366
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:37,198
and in the position I am in if I did not

1367
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:38,458
[ __ ] up a whole bunch that's how I

1368
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:39,869
learned the most I think that's how

1369
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:41,399
humans learned the most is by making

1370
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:43,588
huge mistakes the more mistakes we make

1371
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,759
the more we're able to learn so accept

1372
00:55:43,588 --> 00:55:46,349
your mistakes guys when you see some

1373
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,588
