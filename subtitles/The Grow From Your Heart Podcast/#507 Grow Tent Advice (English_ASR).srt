22
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,369
tradition that I start this podcast off

23
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,710
by talking about what I'm dabbing I just

24
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:00,750
took a dab of copper chem full spectrum

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,579
extract that made me go sit down on the

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,379
couch for 5 or 10 minutes and try to get

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,960
my life together before I could do a

extract is a blend of chem 4 and star

30
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,408
dog two of my favorite strains

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,420
individually they were bred together to

32
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,189
make a beautiful strain this stuff

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,500
tastes delicious on the package the

34
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:21,539
flavor is described as globba juice and

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,269
watermelon I think I will agree with

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,890

00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,319
my name this one comes from my new

93
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,450
friend David what's up David thank you

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,739
for the wonderful email the message goes

95
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,799
like this

96
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,230
I've recently received a 6x6 tent with

97
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,530
two 600 watt closed hood lights with

98
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,909
dimmable metal halide HPS ballasts so

99
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,060
far we're off to a good start we got

100
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:46,949
1200 watts and a 6x6 it's gonna be a

101
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,729
little bit more than enough I think this

102
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,819
will work well

103
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:52,949
the tent is 6x6 and has two six-inch

104
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,409
fans to clip on the poles and two

105
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:58,109
six-inch inline fans and a carbon filter

106
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:00,239
that is a great setup I know exactly

107
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,070
what to do with this I can get you going

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,159
it says it has been a while since I've

109
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:08,250
ran HPS as I flour with LEDs now and I

110
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,109
only veg under metal halides NH PS I

111
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,030
would like to use this new setup as a

112
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,620
second flour room all right that makes

113
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,849
sense there's a few things we can skip

114
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,798
here in this we don't need to read all

115
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:18,810
of this here's the part we need to focus

116
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,269
on it says however I was wondering

117
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,038
mostly how to set everything up inside

118
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,168
the tent as to not have it collapse

119
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:27,000
under the weight of the equipment and if

120
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:27,549
the ballast should be outside of the

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,069
tent for

122
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,228
he issues also best practices for

123
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,449
venting the filter through hoods then

124
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:36,459
out of the room if I should have the fan

125
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,830
outside of the tent or inside because

126
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,839
again weight issues are real I do

127
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:42,609
appreciate all of the love good vibes

128
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,119
and knowledge you spread then they

129
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,270
signed it

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,090
respect Rasta from David he David this

131
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:51,848
is a great email I started off my grow

132
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:53,560
career in tents well when I got serious

133
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:55,120
about growing I started buying tents

134
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,500
before I had we all had those little

135
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,970
rooms that you just kind of hung up a

136
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,500
light and wished for the best when I

137
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,110
really thought I'm going to make this

138
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,240
happen one of my first investments was a

139
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,848
tent and then I got really good at

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,310
growing in tents and I set up a bunch of

141
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:11,680
tents for myself and friends all over

142
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,990
this town we were all growing in Nice

143
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,819
five by five and four by eight tents all

144
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,500
over I've got a lot of experience in

145
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:19,539
this let's talk a little bit about

146
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,158
setting up your tent I like that you

147
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:23,228
included the equipment list that makes

148
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:25,120
it very easy for me I know that I'm

149
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:27,310
working with a six by six tent I know

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,620
that I've got two 600 watt lights I know

151
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,180
we've got two blowers we've probably got

152
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,829
some ducting we've got a couple of fans

153
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,569
which are just small accessories to deal

154
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:36,699
with it sounds like we've got a nice

155
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:39,550
setup the main thing I would start

156
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:42,639
thinking about is can the room in which

157
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:46,300
you intend to set this tent up provide

158
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,329
enough electricity to run to 600 watt

159
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,250
lights and all of the accessories safely

160
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:52,508
I don't know what kind of ballasts

161
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,158
you're using I don't know if they're

162
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,020
magnetic I don't know if they're digital

163
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:57,699
I don't know what else is in the room I

164
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:59,680
don't know if this is in a house I don't

165
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,389
know if this is in a warehouse I don't

166
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,090
know if this is in a really old house or

167
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:06,788
a modern house I would start by doing a

168
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:08,589
safety inspection on my electricity I

169
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:11,228
would make sure that the plugins in the

170
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:12,968
wall are up to today's modern standards

171
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:15,668
I would make sure that all of the wiring

172
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:17,199
is up to today's modern standards I

173
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:19,658
would make sure that the breaker box and

174
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,960
all of the breakers are up to code and

175
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:25,899
up to today's modern standards many old

176
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:28,899
houses will have old sockets old plugins

177
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:31,689
old wiring and old breakers those old

178
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,620
houses will probably handle a 600 with

179
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,348
no problem

180
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:39,038
those old houses may not be able to run

181
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:41,209
to 600 watt lights in one room from the

182
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,009
same breaker you may need to do some

183
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:45,019
Electrical modification or some

184
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,879
electrical adjustments and if you do

185
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:49,038
that make sure it is done by somebody

186
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,800
who is qualified please don't burn down

187
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,839
your house in the name of growing ganja

188
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,400
please don't do that to the movement

189
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,978
please don't do that to the whole

190
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,839
cannabis legalization scene

191
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:01,219
now I know sometimes I get excessive

192
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,109
when it comes to talking about safety

193
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,270
and things but I really don't want you

194
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,770
to burn down your house I don't want you

195
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,939
to burn down the house and only to hurt

196
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,930
yourself I don't want you to hurt

197
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:10,699
anybody else

198
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,889
we have to be responsible cannabis

199
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:15,080
growers we have to be responsible people

200
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,418
I have to be a responsible educator and

201
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,668
podcaster so my first piece of advice is

202
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:22,038
to make sure that the place in which you

203
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:24,049
intend to plug in these two 600 watt

204
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:27,110
ballasts can handle that much

205
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:30,139
electricity safely 600 watts of light in

206
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:33,199
that 6x6 tent will be sufficient 1,200

207
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,389
would be really cool 600 will get you by

208
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,060
and your plants will be happy I would

209
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:40,310
much rather see you run one 600 watt

210
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,069
light and not burn down the house then

211
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,288
try to push to 600 s and possibly burn

212
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:46,759
down an old house all right I will move

213
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:48,050
forward and I'll quit talking about the

214
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,300
safety part because you've heard it

215
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,560
you're going to either heed my advice or

216
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,908
you're gonna do your own thing and

217
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,740
you've got freedom to do whatever you

218
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:56,149
want because America and you're an adult

219
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,610
so let's move forward

220
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:00,739
you do raise a really good question with

221
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,538
this email when they sell us those tents

222
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,079
and they recommend where to install

223
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:06,288
everything

224
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:07,788
it is a real prayer hoping that

225
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:10,370
everything stays where you put it

226
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:12,408
without that flimsy aluminum tubing just

227
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,240
collapsing on you and it's even more

228
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:16,339
stressful once you've got plants that

229
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,900
are growing in there every day just gets

230
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:20,388
more stressful you're like oh this thing

231
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,279
falls over now I've crushed ten weeks

232
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,829
worth of work so it does become

233
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:28,158
stressful I understand I don't like to

234
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:30,019
hang too many things from the tent they

235
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:31,519
give you those two or four poles that go

236
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,649
across the ceiling that you're supposed

237
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,319
to be able to mount your [ __ ] to I don't

238
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:38,389
trust that very much so I do agree with

239
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,010
you that it can be very stressful trying

240
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:42,288
to mount everything in a tent

241
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:44,389
sufficiently and efficiently so let's

242
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:47,809
talk about a few options you've got two

243
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:50,360
vented hoods you've also got two 6-inch

244
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:53,328
inline blowers but you have only got one

245
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,830
carbon filter so I do have a very good

246
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:57,559
set up idea

247
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,290
for this tent this will work if you

248
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:02,599
choose to run one or two of those vented

249
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:04,909
hoods now I have completely agreed with

250
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,040
you that it is sketchy hanging a lot of

251
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:09,289
items a lot of equipment from the top of

252
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,809
that grow tent so in this setup we are

253
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:13,849
only going to hang the one or two grow

254
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:14,838
lights whichever you choose to do and if

255
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,190
you're listening out there and you're

256
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,680
setting up a tent this will work

257
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,540
beautifully for you with one or two grow

258
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,309
lights I'm going to kind of focus the

259
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,778
lesson on one light and then I'll just

260
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:25,338
briefly talk about where to add the

261
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:26,838
second light it's basically just a piece

262
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,899
of ducting and you continue the chain

263
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,600
but this is exactly how I set up my

264
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,639
tents in a small room if I have got a

265
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,860
couple of blowers and a carbon filter

266
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,169
and ducted lights if you've only got one

267
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,120
blower we will talk about a different

268
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:43,250
option for that a little further in the

269
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,519
lesson this setup is going to focus on

270
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,230
two six-inch blowers a vented light and

271
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,879
when I say vented light let me talk

272
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,009
about that for a moment I'm talking

273
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,470
about a grow light that's got an input

274
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:56,299
for a duct on one side and an output for

275
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,040
a duct on the other and then underneath

276
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:00,109
where the bulb goes there's a piece of

277
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:02,419
glass in there so your bulb is basically

278
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,159
kept inside of a box which is sealed

279
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,860
with that piece of glass that allows the

280
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,990
light to illuminate down but then the

281
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,539
heat is moved away from that light away

282
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,070
from the grow area by using the blowers

283
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:15,139
which we're talking about the six inch

284
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,640
inline fans that hooks up the ducting

285
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,620
you turn that blower on it blows air

286
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,509
through there then the heat from that

287
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,850
light bulb gets removed from your grow

288
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:25,458
environment it is much easier to cool

289
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,800
the room the downside to that is you

290
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:30,319
lose a small percentage of your light

291
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:32,539
power because of that glass between the

292
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,399
bulb and the canopy and you've also got

293
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,889
to make sure to keep that glass clean

294
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,049
but in some environments this is an

295
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:42,110
ideal setup in a tent it will work

296
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:43,578
beautifully that's exactly what I do but

297
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,230
we've got the two blowers we've got the

298
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:47,120
two vented lights we've got the carbon

299
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,070
filter we've got the two clip-on fans

300
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,320
and I was agreeing that I don't want to

301
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:54,589
hang too many items too many heavy units

302
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,230
from that top bar of the tent it is

303
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,089
sketchy so in a perfect world we would

304
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,789
mount that carbon filter and blower at

305
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,410
the very top dead center of the tent but

306
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:05,719
we don't have that option because I

307
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:07,578
don't trust the tents in a tent

308
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,540
environment I'm going to recommend that

309
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:11,089
we set the carbon

310
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:13,069
filter in one of the back corners off of

311
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,750
the floor on either a cinderblock or

312
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,280
some sort of a crate or something like

313
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,320
that just to lift it up off the ground

314
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,879
just a little bit now I know you're

315
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,980
already thinking that's going to take up

316
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:25,189
some of the real estate in your tent but

317
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,870
it is worth every inch of space that it

318
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,880
takes up we need to make sure the air

319
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,129
leaving our grow environment does not

320
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,320
get us in trouble so I think it's worth

321
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:35,000
it and a carbon filter really doesn't

322
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,590
take up that much space just push it

323
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,570
into the corner you've got it crammed

324
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,639
into the corner it's doing its job it's

325
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,320
sucking all the humidity all this stale

326
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,909
air right out of that tent blowing it

327
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,740
out of the room and it's not snitching

328
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:47,929
on you while it does it so just put it

329
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,060
in the corner I like to set it on a

330
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:52,279
cinder block or on a crate I just like

331
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,989
to get it up off the ground if you can

332
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,789
make some sort of a stand or something

333
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,799
for it and get it higher and higher up

334
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:59,269
off the ground that is better but I

335
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,370
don't like to hang it you're absolutely

336
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:04,189
correct on the idea of not wanting to

337
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,679
hang that heavy carbon filter and blower

338
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,290
from the ceiling of that grow so get a

339
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,909
cinder block maybe two cinder blocks set

340
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:12,799
them in the back left corner of the grow

341
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:14,539
maybe the back right corner of the girl

342
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,889
I'm not sure where the exit duct is on

343
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:17,929
the top of your tent I don't know which

344
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:19,519
brand do you bought but put that carbon

345
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:22,729
filter right in the very back corner

346
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,620
then set the blower directly on top of

347
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,779
the carbon filter now you're off to a

348
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,460
really good start now we are almost done

349
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,289
with setting up the carbon filter and

350
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,230
that blower the next step is to run

351
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:34,879
ducting from the blower out of the tent

352
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,649
just go through that exit hole at the

353
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,840
very top most of them have a six-inch

354
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:41,419
hole right at the ceiling go right out

355
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,009
of that hole then continue that ducting

356
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:45,019
and run it wherever you need to to

357
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:47,779
efficiently get that air away from your

358
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:49,460
grow tent keep in mind that heat rises

359
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,679
so keep that duct up high

360
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,660
you'll be dispersing the hot air up high

361
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,339
wherever it goes you may be able to keep

362
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:57,709
it in the same room you'll keep that hot

363
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,780
air up high and the tent will bring in

364
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,400
the fresh air through the passive vents

365
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,500
at the bottom and you'll get that fresh

366
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,779
cool air on the bottom if I set up a

367
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,149
tent in my spare bedroom in my house my

368
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:10,909
normal air in my house we'll keep that

369
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,889
tent cool if I vent it properly if I

370
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:14,689
point the end of that ducting right out

371
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,159
of that room and it's blowing that heat

372
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,510
into the rest of the house to where it

373
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,579
could just be dispersed into the house

374
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:21,110
and kind of circulate and cycle and

375
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,278
become part of the regular atmosphere of

376
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,620
the house the center

377
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,929
air will cool that air and the central

378
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,759
air also blows fresh air into that

379
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:30,559
bedroom or I've got that grow tent and

380
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,480
with a little bit of thinking and proper

381
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,729
circulation I can keep the house and the

382
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,069
grow room very comfortable without any

383
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,079
extra strain on my HVAC system or

384
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:41,659
without any weird adjustments to my

385
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,878
daily life in my house so if you've got

386
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:46,039
two blowers and a carbon filter it is

387
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,629
really easy to put the carbon filter on

388
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,129
some sort of a shelf just get it up off

389
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,379
the ground put it in the back corner of

390
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:53,420
the tent then you've got carbon filter

391
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:54,829
put the blower on there put a piece of

392
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:57,349
duct tape between them so you make a

393
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:59,568
nice seal put ducting on there put a

394
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,220
plenty of duct tape on there a nice seal

395
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:03,318
on that so you don't get any air leakage

396
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,180
then run that ducting wherever you need

397
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:07,399
it to get it away from that tent or away

398
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,828
from that room now at this point all of

399
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,600
the air leaving your grow tent should be

400
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:13,549
passing through that carbon filter and

401
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,709
should be odor free and you should be

402
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:18,229
safe now let's talk about how to set up

403
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,969
the grow lights our main option for

404
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,769
hanging the grow lights is to use those

405
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,319
provided bars and hang them from the

406
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:27,049
ceiling just like recommended I would do

407
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:29,568
that I don't like to hang much more than

408
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:31,219
a grow light from that top bar but let's

409
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:33,620
go ahead and hang the grow lights from

410
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,350
the top as recommended I like to use

411
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,480
some sort of height adjustable light

412
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,860
hanger something like a yo-yo or

413
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,569
whatever is available at your local

414
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,909
grocer or because I like to be able to

415
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:45,769
adjust that light very easily without

416
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:48,198
any stress on my body and without

417
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:50,120
risking causing any problems in the grow

418
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:52,789
so I recommend one of those ratchet

419
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,490
style light mover hangers those are make

420
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:57,799
your life much easier so hang the light

421
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,079
install the bulb don't leave any

422
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,578
fingerprints or hand marks on the bulb

423
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,859
when you were screwing the bulb into

424
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:06,138
your reflector I recommend wearing a

425
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,178
rubber glove or even one of those felty

426
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,948
gloves so that you don't leave any marks

427
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:11,990
on the bulb then when you were done I

428
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:13,219
also recommend wiping that bulb off with

429
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,079
a paper towel or something

430
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,699
please don't leave any fingerprints on

431
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:18,769
it that's not good for your bulb and

432
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:20,778
it's very easy to prevent so let's clean

433
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:23,870
off the bulb you are potentially going

434
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:25,490
to hang two lights in this grow so let's

435
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,649
hang both of them up if that is what you

436
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,720
choose to do so now we have got two

437
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:31,639
lights hanging we don't have any ducting

438
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,360
on there but we've got the bulbs in now

439
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,220
it is time to install that ducting now

440
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,200
is the time to

441
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,600
about which direction you need to move

442
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,220
the air where does that air need to go

443
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,050
how are you getting it out of that room

444
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:47,100
where does it go once it leaves the tent

445
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:49,329
I would run that duct to where your goal

446
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,860
destination for that air is are you

447
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,360
going to dump it right by the doorway so

448
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,250
that it could cycle out of that room

449
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,960
into the other room are you gonna run it

450
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,580
just to the opposite side of the room

451
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,560
far away from the tent and hope that it

452
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,120
works that way it possibly will but now

453
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,639
is the time to think about that

454
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,919
put that ducting there then run it to

455
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,470
your tent and at the tops of the tents

456
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,849
there is an in and an out on each side

457
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,860
they don't come from the ceiling there

458
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,409
toward the top of the tent on the sides

459
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,750
most tents have these ducts in and out

460
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:19,209
for this exact purpose we're going to

461
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,610
run a length of ducting in one side of

462
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,860
the tent and we will attach that to one

463
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,110
of your grow lights I recommend a piece

464
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,659
of duct tape and I also recommend a hose

465
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,850
clamp around that then we're going to

466
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:33,189
run another piece of ducting from the

467
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,950
other side of that light to the other

468
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:38,350
light now make a nice little bend don't

469
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,030
make a nice sharp angle make kind of a

470
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,920
curve the more of a curve you can make

471
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:44,199
the better you don't want a super sharp

472
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:47,289
angle that lessens the efficiency of

473
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,390
your blower so we want a nice curve and

474
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:51,699
we need to attach that ducting securely

475
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:54,129
to our second light so you have got

476
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,860
ducting running from essentially your

477
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:58,750
exit point into the tent attached to the

478
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,370
first light then off of the other side

479
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,919
of that light you've got ducting

480
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,619
attaching that to the next light now the

481
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,869
obvious next step in this chain is to

482
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:10,389
run ducting off of light number two and

483
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,099
out of that vent on the other side of

484
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,590
the tent whichever side you went in

485
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,359
there is another exit port on the other

486
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,240
side of the tent run it right through

487
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,729
there we have now created a tunnel that

488
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,250
goes in one side of the tent over light

489
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,029
number one over light number two and out

490
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,039
of the tent

491
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:29,829
essentially the air that travels through

492
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,139
that tunnel never makes it into your

493
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:33,730
grow environment now how do we move that

494
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,580
heat and that air away from the lights

495
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:39,009
we use that second six inch blower that

496
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:41,710
we spoke of earlier you can attach your

497
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:44,140
second six inch inline fan to that

498
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,569
ducting outside of the tent and you can

499
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,640
either hang that six inch inline fan

500
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:50,049
from the ceiling or you can set it on a

501
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,600
cinder block on the floor

502
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:55,180
the main point of that fan is to blow

503
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:57,579
air through the ducting over the lights

504
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,370
and out of the other side all you were

505
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:02,379
doing is moving that heat away from the

506
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:04,569
grow tent and away from the lights you

507
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,880
don't have to worry about that air being

508
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:08,799
filtered because that air never comes in

509
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,320
contact with your gross space it's just

510
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,119
simply blowing through a tube it goes

511
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:14,589
right through the room it's kind of a

512
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,389
little subway tunnel that just runs

513
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:18,069
right through the city of your grow it

514
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,620
doesn't interact with the grow in any

515
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:22,899
way it's it's own little air chain now

516
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:25,119
you will need to run that end ducting to

517
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,740
your exit point wherever you need to get

518
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,389
rid of that heat wherever you're running

519
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,069
that other duct I would recommend

520
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,710
running them right to the same point and

521
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:34,779
get that stale stagnant air and that

522
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,210
grow like heat right away from your grow

523
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:39,009
tent as far as you can so that sounded

524
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,690
too simple in my mind when I said it so

525
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:41,379
I'm going to recap to make sure we got

526
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,809
it correct

527
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,450
the first blower and carbon filter will

528
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:48,490
simply set on the floor or on a shelf in

529
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,289
the back corner of the grow tent

530
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,059
you've got the carbon filter you've got

531
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:54,250
the blower on top of that pointing tour

532
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,470
it is sucking the air through the filter

533
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,210
and up to the ducting you run that

534
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,579
ducting out of the ceiling of the grow

535
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,100
tent and now you're filtered air your

536
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:04,839
stale humid air is leaving that grow

537
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:07,599
tent and now you run that ducting

538
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:09,399
wherever that needs to go that carbon

539
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,799
filter and that blower creating that

540
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,540
suction will result in fresh air coming

541
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,519
in through the passive vents in the

542
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:17,470
bottom of your grow tent so now we are

543
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,629
getting rid of stale air we're getting

544
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,299
rid of humidity and we're also replacing

545
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,730
that with fresh air and the aroma of

546
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:26,769
cannabis is not escaping the tent if we

547
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,269
zip it up appropriately now we have

548
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,230
installed the two lights they're hanging

549
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:32,319
in the middle of the tent

550
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,269
we've run ducting into the tent to the

551
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,579
first light out of the end of the second

552
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:38,920
light into the N of light number two

553
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:40,869
then out of light number two we've ran

554
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,720
ducting going all the way out of the

555
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:46,719
tent all the way to our second six-inch

556
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,690
inline fan you can set that six-inch

557
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,850
inline fan to push or pull that air over

558
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,070
the lights whichever way you prefer I do

559
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:56,589
not have any science to back it up but

560
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:58,809
in my experience I think that those

561
00:19:56,589 --> 00:20:01,359
blowers those inline fans are more

562
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:03,250
efficient at pulling air than they are

563
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,759
pushing air they've got more suction

564
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,400
power

565
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,589
been blowing power in my opinion so

566
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,030
simply run that ducting through the tent

567
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:12,009
through the lights and right back out of

568
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:14,230
the tent make sure that it is sealed in

569
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:16,359
every opportunity for air to leak you

570
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,700
need to seal that up make sure you seal

571
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:21,189
everything if you have got your blower

572
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,680
pulling air across those lights and it

573
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,289
is sucking air this way you have got the

574
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,660
opportunity to suck aroma up through the

575
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:31,420
lights and then out of that ducting if

576
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,850
it is not sealed appropriately so make

577
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,890
sure you seal everything and even though

578
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:37,779
it's more efficient to suck the air you

579
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,280
may want to push it because that way

580
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:42,190
you're pushing Aaron if you have any

581
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,990
leaks the leaky air will leak into your

582
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,090
grow tent and you won't be pushing

583
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,730
odoriferous air out of the environment

584
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:50,049
so that may be a safety factor if you

585
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,180
don't seal it up all the way

586
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:54,609
push the air that way the aroma gets

587
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,590
left into the tent and it doesn't sneak

588
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:58,839
out I hope that makes sense think of it

589
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,819
this way if you've got a blower and then

590
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:02,740
you've got some other things with gaps

591
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:04,240
in there and you were sucking you can

592
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,680
pull air through the gaps and since

593
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,019
we're not putting a filter on this

594
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,509
blower we can't pull any air through our

595
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:12,460
gaps because that air will have cannabis

596
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:14,319
aroma through it so if we're sucking

597
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,990
we've got the opportunity to pull

598
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,119
unfiltered air from the grow tent and

599
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,579
expel that into the environment if we

600
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,829
are pushing any leaks you'll actually be

601
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:25,990
pushing the fresh air from outside of

602
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:27,399
the grow into your grow tent and you may

603
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,680
get some of that heat from the grow

604
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,870
light but you won't be blasting cannabis

605
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,330
scented air out for everybody in the

606
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:36,429
neighborhood to smell so think about the

607
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:38,169
chain of airflow and make sure that

608
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,570
everything is sealed so that you don't

609
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,160
get any aroma leaks you can't see it so

610
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:44,169
you can't see if it's happening and

611
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,420
you've been around those plants so often

612
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,460
that you probably don't smell it so be

613
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,680
very careful and seal it up so that

614
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,900
nobody else it's the opportunity to

615
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,910
smell that grow I say it a lot and this

616
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,759
is a good opportunity to remember to set

617
00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:00,670
yourself up for a success now let's talk

618
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:03,009
about the same setup but with just one

619
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,450
blower maybe you don't have two blowers

620
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:05,950
maybe it doesn't fit the budget maybe

621
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,069
you didn't score two blowers in your

622
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:12,069
deal let's do the same setup but with

623
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:14,769
only one six inch inline fan we're going

624
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:16,359
to start off with the very same theory

625
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:17,710
with the carbon filter we don't want to

626
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:19,298
hang that heavy filter

627
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,500
from the ceiling we don't want to break

628
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:22,599
our plants we don't want to break the

629
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,460
tent so let's put the carbon filter on a

630
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:26,589
couple of cinder blocks or on a couple

631
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,360
of milk crates on the floor in the grow

632
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:30,730
tent it does take up a little bit of

633
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:32,889
space but not enough to make me complain

634
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,259
it is very well worth the space in my

635
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,419
opinion now we've got the carbon filter

636
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:39,220
set on our makeshift shelf I don't know

637
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:40,570
if you're using a cinder block I don't

638
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,130
know if you've built an actual shelf

639
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,450
maybe you went and bought a fancy table

640
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,700
I don't know what you're doing but we've

641
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,380
got the carbon filter now we've got the

642
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,720
blower sitting on top of the carbon

643
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,820
filter put a ring of tape around that to

644
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,130
seal that make sure you have got the

645
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:56,648
blower pointed the right direction so

646
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,570
the air is being sucked through the

647
00:22:56,648 --> 00:23:01,028
carbon filter then out of the blower

648
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:04,000
then we are going to attach ducting to

649
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:06,940
that blower that ducting is going to run

650
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,099
directly to our lights if you've got two

651
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,759
lights it should be fairly obvious you

652
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:14,678
go carbon filter blower ducting into

653
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,808
light number one you will come out of

654
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,028
light number one into light number two

655
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:21,490
you will come out of light number two

656
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:23,140
then you will take ducting and you can

657
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,058
either run it out of the top like the

658
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,850
chimney or you can run it out of one of

659
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:29,319
those top side vents that is up to you

660
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:31,240
whatever works best for your setup

661
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:32,408
whatever makes you comfortable whatever

662
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,419
looks best whatever is most

663
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:36,520
aesthetically pleasing go ahead and do

664
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:38,770
that as long as that ducting is running

665
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:41,408
out of your grow tent and it extends

666
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:43,509
away from the tent to get that like heat

667
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:45,250
and also the humidity and stale air away

668
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:48,129
from your tent it will work beautifully

669
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,869
I run that ducting right to the edge of

670
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,730
that room right to the door and point it

671
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:53,288
right at the door so as you walk in you

672
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,339
get a little blast of warm air on your

673
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:56,140
forehead but then it goes away

674
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:58,000
immediately and once you're in the room

675
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,740
you don't notice that there is heat or

676
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,859
humidity in there because I've removed

677
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:05,440
it with that six inch inline fan so that

678
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:08,829
is a very affordable and very efficient

679
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,169
way to duct and cool your grow tent all

680
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:13,990
in one move and I'll repeat it for you

681
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:16,450
I'm doing carbon filter then the blower

682
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,370
the blower is sucking the air through

683
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,250
the filter and pushing it through the

684
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:23,349
duct then that air goes through light

685
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,269
number one if you've got light number

686
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:27,189
two it goes through light number two if

687
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:30,009
you don't have light number two skip it

688
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,500
it's that easy just don't add the second

689
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:33,538
light and the second piece of

690
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,909
that should be really obvious for you

691
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:38,250
then we come out of light number two all

692
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:40,020
we've got to do now is run ducting to

693
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,759
wherever we want that air to end up

694
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,710
where is the final destination of that

695
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,210
air where do we want to dump it do you

696
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,890
want to run it to the top corner of that

697
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,600
bedroom do you want to run it out of the

698
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,100
bedroom are you able to cut a hole in

699
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,439
the wall and run it right into the attic

700
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:54,089
it is safe to dump that air wherever you

701
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,769
need because it will not smell like

702
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:59,158
cannabis because it has gone through

703
00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:01,019
your carbon filter again be careful make

704
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,700
sure that you seal up all of the steps

705
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,740
make sure you seal up every duct to

706
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,529
joint between the lights and the filter

707
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,019
every opportunity for a leak please put

708
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:13,649
some duct tape on there do keep in mind

709
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:15,210
that this air may be warm you're going

710
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,340
to run it over the grow light you may

711
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,350
have a 600 you may have two six hundreds

712
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:21,119
you may have multiple thousand watt

713
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:23,069
lights if you're doing multiple tents or

714
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,229
if you've done this in a large room keep

715
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:27,230
in mind that the air is going to be warm

716
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:29,880
if you're going to run this air outside

717
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,819
think about that air being warm people

718
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,200
may realize you've got some

719
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:36,119
inappropriately weird air coming out of

720
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,690
your house at a weird random spot all

721
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,279
year long maybe it snows and maybe the

722
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,500
back of your house has just one little

723
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,730
3x3 section where there is no snow and

724
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,130
you're telling everybody there's some

725
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,870
weird [ __ ] happening here in my backyard

726
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,990
be aware of that sort of stuff it

727
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:53,969
doesn't stink but that air will be warm

728
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,620
alright I feel like I went over both of

729
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,500
those setups quite quickly so I'm going

730
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,589
to reiterate the one blower style that

731
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,869
is basically carbon filter blower

732
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:05,069
ducting light out of the tent run the

733
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:07,798
ducting where you need it

734
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:10,139
keep it simple stoner and you will

735
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:11,700
succeed I think a lot of the time we

736
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,950
were really trying to overcomplicate

737
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,319
growing now let's talk about some of the

738
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:19,740
other accessories that you have got to

739
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,509
go with your grow tent those two small

740
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,960
clip-on fans if they're a small clip-on

741
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:23,490
fans

742
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,230
I think the tent will do just fine

743
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,329
supporting those fans click those

744
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,099
wherever you feel comfortable I usually

745
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:30,928
like one about canopy high right at the

746
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:32,879
top of the plants and then sometimes

747
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:34,710
I'll put one about the light height just

748
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,169
to move the heat away from the light if

749
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:40,019
you've got to you can experiment move

750
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:42,090
them as you feel necessary make your

751
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,740
plants happy have fun with it maybe put

752
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:45,279
some sort of a monitor in there and

753
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,769
check out the VPD

754
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,410
and get the fans moving to keep that VPD

755
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:53,109
in line now one of your major questions

756
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:56,230
was where do I put the ballasts I would

757
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:58,839
absolutely recommend those ballasts do

758
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,500
not go inside of the tent keep them out

759
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:01,659
of the tent

760
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,250
those ballasts are going to create a lot

761
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,290
of heat you don't want to fight that

762
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,569
heat inside of the tent so set yourself

763
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:10,359
up for a success by putting them outside

764
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:12,429
of the tent don't add more heat in that

765
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:14,409
environment than you've already got from

766
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,150
the grow lights all right I've got one

767
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,310
more detail we should talk about when it

768
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,650
comes to setting up a grow tent when we

769
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:23,500
run all of this ducting over our vent at

770
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:26,710
lights we create a great opportunity for

771
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,210
a light leak many people will say these

772
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,980
tents are sealed up I shouldn't get any

773
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,319
light leaks in here you really shouldn't

774
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,990
but we are using ducting that is

775
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,210
reflective on the inside I don't know

776
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,880
why the companies that make the ducting

777
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,160
for hydroponic use insist on making it

778
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,440
reflective on the inside it would be

779
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,930
much better if it were flat black and

780
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,900
did not reflect light what will happen

781
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:52,539
in many situations is light will get up

782
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,640
into the ducting and reflect all the way

783
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:56,559
through that ducting and shine through

784
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,290
your light hoods just like you've got a

785
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,269
light on in your grow tent so make sure

786
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:03,730
you check that the light is not

787
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:05,859
reflecting down your ducting through

788
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,200
your lights and into your plants when

789
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:09,789
you think the lights are off if your

790
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,529
plants are getting light when you think

791
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:13,269
they're dark they might not go into

792
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:15,279
flower you may think they've been in

793
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:16,990
12/12 but since you've got that light on

794
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,910
in your bedroom all day they've never

795
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,380
gone into flower they've been getting 24

796
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,870
hours of light and you're way off

797
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,430
schedule now or you may be going in

798
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,899
there just occasionally and flipping on

799
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,220
the light while you're playing video

800
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,690
games for a couple hours and then you

801
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,430
turn it off and leave or maybe you go in

802
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,170
there and read a book maybe just go and

803
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,190
hang out and [ __ ] smoke a bowl in

804
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,110
there and then you turn off the lights

805
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,850
and leave and the light cycle in your

806
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:38,679
grow tent just got interrupted because

807
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:41,679
it was supposed to be on the dark cycle

808
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,960
so I recommend that you go in that tent

809
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,299
before you put plants in there turn on

810
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,700
the lights in the room in which the tent

811
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:50,799
is in then go in the tent with no lights

812
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,750
and hang out and see if you can see any

813
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,359
light if you can see your hand in front

814
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,220
of your face at all in the dark it is

815
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,019
not dark you've got to make it

816
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,230
completely dark in that

817
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:05,319
when it is dark so make sure no light is

818
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,329
coming through your ducting another spot

819
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,700
where people often get light leaks is

820
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:12,309
from the passive intake vents on the

821
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,410
bottom of the tents on most of the tents

822
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:16,539
there is basically a small mesh window

823
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,400
at the bottom with a little flap that

824
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:20,200
you can velcro and roll it up or let it

825
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,750
down kind of just works like a little

826
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,819
shade many people like to roll that up

827
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,289
or lift that up and let some air flow

828
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:28,779
into the bottom of that tent

829
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:32,409
I do not lift those things all the way

830
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:34,480
up I leave them about 50% velcro to

831
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:36,970
where they can't flap up but some air

832
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,450
can flow through there you've got a six

833
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:43,120
inch inline fan sucking air out of that

834
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,279
tent if you close the zipper and close

835
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,169
most of those passive vents you will

836
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,759
notice that your tent wants to cave in a

837
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,070
little bit it's sucking in on itself

838
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:53,109
that inline fan will create enough

839
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:54,639
pressure that you will get air coming in

840
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:56,319
through the gaps in the fabric through

841
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,390
the gaps in your zipper through all of

842
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,879
the little tiny holes in that material

843
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,830
you will replace all of the air that

844
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,930
goes out of that blower so you don't

845
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:07,240
have to lift up those passive flaps all

846
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:09,220
the way they will suck enough air

847
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,529
through their air travels through the

848
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,299
path of least resistance and physics

849
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:15,670
dictates that all of the air that comes

850
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:17,619
in has to go out all of the air that

851
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:20,710
goes out has to come back in it's called

852
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:23,649
displacement so power that blower up and

853
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,420
roll those vents down and just let the

854
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,220
walls of that tent suck in a little bit

855
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,990
and I don't think you'll get any light

856
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,600
leaks and I do think you will get plenty

857
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:34,120
of air exchange if you are running that

858
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:36,429
six inch inline fan like my new friend

859
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:38,739
David another thing I've seen people do

860
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,200
is simply make a little bit of a shade

861
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,329
cloth on the outside of those tins I've

862
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,850
seen guys buy those strips of HEPA

863
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:47,710
filters and just duct tape that over

864
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:50,109
those bottom vents that helps to keep

865
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,450
out extra light and it also works as an

866
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:54,159
extra layer of filtration you'll notice

867
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,990
that those vents down there at the

868
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,240
bottom they'll get kind of you'll get a

869
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,130
bunch of dog hair if you've got a dog

870
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,750
you'll get a bunch of hippie hair if you

871
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,280
got a hippie you get a bunch of dust

872
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,960
bunnies and crap built up along the

873
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,399
bottom of there make sure you dust that

874
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,019
off and clean it up more than

875
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,550
occasionally get to that about once a

876
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:11,349
week or it'll really start to build up

877
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:12,549
but if you've got light leaks I

878
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:14,619
recommend just roll those

879
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:16,450
flaps down and only do half the velcro

880
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:18,069
that way they'll be able to lift up

881
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,410
halfway they'll let air in but they

882
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:22,240
won't let any light in and if you don't

883
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,370
feel comfortable with that put something

884
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,710
over the outside just a black sheet a

885
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:29,259
black cloth or I've seen guys use those

886
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,240
long strips of HEPA filters and you just

887
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:33,160
put some duct tape on the outside of it

888
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,720
and tape it right to the outside of your

889
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,130
tent you could probably do it on the

890
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,350
inside but since we get that natural

891
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,480
suction when you do it on the outside it

892
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:41,949
just sucks itself right to the tent tape

893
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,019
it in place it'll stay right there for

894
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,759
you all right David I feel like I really

895
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:47,650
talked for a long time about setting up

896
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,569
