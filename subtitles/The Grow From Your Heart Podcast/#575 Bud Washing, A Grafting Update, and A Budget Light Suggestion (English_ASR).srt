00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
smoking

30

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,719
paris larry

34
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,239
on the package the flavor is described

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,319
as banana sugar

36
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,920
and oatmeal i think i agree with that

37
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,719
that's a really unique combination of

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
flavors

39
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,759
sort of like a banana sugar cookie or

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,359
something like that it's got that

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,118
candied banana flavor and there's

42
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,719
definitely a sweetness maybe an oatmeal

43
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,200
cookie aftertaste

44
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,959
i really love the banana terps and the

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,118
buzz i get from banana

46
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,000

i pop up thank you for checking me out

119
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,000
the message goes on to say i thought i

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
would share this on grafting

121
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
a rather obscure topic in the command

122
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,759
cannabis community

123
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,400
but after listening to your assertions

124
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,280
correction

125
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,120
and recorrection i found this and while

126
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,000
not conclusive the following offers

127
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
indication if

128
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
not evidence that offspring from grafted

129
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,680
plants

130
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,200
contain dna from both plants

131
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
who would have thunk it thanks for

132
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,959
fighting the good fight rock on bro

133
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,879
from our friend austin ron so

134
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,399
a few episodes back i did talk about

135
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,918
grafting somebody asked me if i was

136
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,439
interested in grafting if i could give

137
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,079
advice about grafting

138
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,079
i said that in my opinion that if we

139
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,159
graft one plant to another plant

140
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,758
that over time those genetics will

141
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,600
mingle and we will not have true

142
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,000
genetics on both branches

143
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
i've been receiving controversial

144
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,879
messages no hate mail or anything like

145
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,960
that but some people are saying

146
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,279
that is possible some people say it is

147
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,758
impossible some people told me i was

148
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,559
reaching no longer reaching here is

149
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,560
volunteered

150
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,160
scientific evidence i think all of the

151
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
evidence points to the fact that the

152
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
genes

153
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,840
will move uh i tried to explain it

154
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
succinctly in my last episode but

155
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,198
if i cut off your arm and i cut off my

156
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,800
arm and we swap arms

157
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,319
sure that's your arm that's my arm

158
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,240
mine's gonna be the real pale long

159
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,599
gangly arm you'll be the darker arm and

160
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,759
thicker arm on my body

161
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
we'll know where they came from but the

162
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,960
blood will move

163
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,639
eventually the dna will move all of

164
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,319
what's me will be in that arm all of

165
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,120
what's you will be in your arm will be

166
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,038
your arm

167
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,879
i think it'll mix i think the trees the

168
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,519
plants the branches will do the same

169
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,120
thing

170
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,120

big respect it says and may your

205
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,478
genetics be strong and your flowers

206
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,560
beautiful you have seen evidence of such

207
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,240
so your blessings are working

208
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,399
it goes on it says i was hoping to ask a

209
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,600
few questions and i do not object of you

210
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,799
using any of this

211
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,800
in any formal uh format oh any formal

212
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
format except sharing my email of course

213
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,879
i'll keep you safe and private bro

214
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,239
it goes on to say i was hoping i know

215
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,800
you're into concentrates

216
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,759
but uh which feminized seeds from irie

217
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,879
would you recommend

218
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,319
for a flower smoker i primarily smoke

219
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,038
with bongs and sometimes

220
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,360
joints growing is limited to a couple 10

221
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,839
to 15 gallon containers outdoor

222
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,160
and stealth is appreciated shorter and

223
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:03,598
not quite so fragrant

224
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,800
um so you want a recommendation on an

225
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,719
irie genetics

226
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,319
strain you're not a concentrate smoker

227
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,400
you're going to be smoking the flowers

228
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,000
probably through the bong or sometimes a

229
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,318
joint i like your style

230
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,720
uh you want to grow in 10 to 15 gallon

231
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,160
containers outdoors stealth would be

232
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
ideal so you don't want something that

233
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,599
smells like skunks and feet and [ __ ]

234
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,120
so far i think that we need to recommend

235
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,598
orange gasm to you

236
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,439
orange gasm is really easy to grow it's

237
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,159
a beautiful plant it's easy to handle

238
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,000
outdoors

239
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,360
it's not going to smell like skunk ass

240
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
and dirty feet and cannabis it's going

241
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,240
to smell like oranges

242
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,160
and orange creamsicles so you're going

243
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
to get a different aroma that's a little

244
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,000
bit less suspicious

245
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,759
it's also easier to grow outdoors it

246
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
doesn't take super long to finish

247
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,199
and i think it'll make you really happy

248
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,000
in the joint and in the bong it's gonna

249
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,079
taste like

250
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,439
[ __ ] sweet delicious oranges and if

251
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,758
you're into that orange flavor

252
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,038
that'll be beautiful for you if not i

253
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,639
may recommend

254
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,318
we're gonna want something outdoors a

255
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,519
little bit shorter ah

256
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,360
man it's hard to get away from the

257
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,120
skunky stuff maybe some strawberry

258
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,560
starburst but it may take too long to

259
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,639
finish wherever you are

260
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,478
the prana may get you away with it but

261
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,800
that prana's got that herb smell to it

262
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,240
although it's a wonderful plant outdoors

263
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,240
there is a lot more to this message let

264
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
me keep moving

265
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,519
excuse me for the cough there i did take

266
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,399
dabs before the show and it's a cannabis

267
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,359
podcast

268
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,399
i make off again it goes on to say i was

269
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
also wondering about

270
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,239
autoflowers outdoors is that worth

271
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,680
starting for the fall

272
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,360
or the winter i'm pretty sure i could

273
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,199
keep them out of any rain

274
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,120
but is there enough light and warmth to

275
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,800
produce any quality

276
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,879
flower uh i am not an

277
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,559
autoflower expert i don't really i don't

278
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,759
grow any autoflowers i don't know much

279
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,319
about autoflowers

280
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,919
but if you can get them to finish before

281
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
any adverse conditions

282
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,799
yeah they'll flower out there put them

283
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,159
out there they'll grow they'll flower

284
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,759
you'll get usable product

285
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,439
uh depending on who you buy your seeds

286
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,838
from and how you take care of them

287
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,519
your results may vary but uh yeah

288
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,200
autoflowers will work as long as they

289
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,480
don't get snowed on and get destroyed by

290
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,920
the winter environment

291
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,278
um outdoor autoflowers are a great idea

292
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,958
it goes on to say i'm pretty sure i

293
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,879
could keep them oh we read that part

294
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,159
uh if so any recommendations for

295
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,519
breeders on

296
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,240
feminized autoflower seeds um i am

297
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,480

298
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,320

so i'm going to return the favor and say

302
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,519
i would recommend

303
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,200
mephisto m-e-p-h-i-s-t-o

304
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,200
mephisto for feminized seeds ah that is

305
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,959
who i've seen the best results from uh

306
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
that's who i've heard the best from

307
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,319
again disclaimer huge disclaimer i do

308
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,120
not grow femme or

309
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,800
autoflowers so i can't testify firsthand

310
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,120
this is all from what i've seen

311
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,319
read and heard also the dude's a friend

312
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
of mine so i want to give him a shout

313
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,519
out and rep him

314
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,278
uh but mephisto otter autoflowers would

315
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
be the way to go

316
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,278
it says i'm in norcal and i've had some

317
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,120
uh falling ash

318
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,559
and it keeps swirling around the breeze

319
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,159
and getting on the plant

320
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,439
i don't know what to believe about bud

321
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,719
washing all right so we're working into

322
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,240
a brand new question here

323
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,759
i don't know what to believe about bud

324
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,079
washing i was hoping you could shed some

325
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,078
light

326
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,159
on that subject should i even be

327
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,879
considering it it's only a little bit of

328
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,719
ash

329
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,039
there's a lot of differing opinions and

330
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,200
i really don't know who is reputable

331
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,078
but the bud washing recipe i've been

332
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,240
considering

333
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,000
are and then he shares his recipe with

334
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
me and i'm going to [ __ ] all over that

335
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,559
recipe don't do that i've got a better

336
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,159
idea for you

337
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,719
not even going to read that plan here on

338
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,480
the air so our listener friend is in

339
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,278
california and unfortunately they're

340
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,360
being

341
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,958
ravaged and devastated by wildfires

342
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
right now big love and big shout out to

343
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,639
everybody who's having to deal with that

344
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
fire

345
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,000
my heart goes out to you fire is [ __ ]

346
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,519
terrible i've seen several people

347
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,759
displaced due to fire

348
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,959
uh thank your uh thank you or whatever

349
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,480
you believe in thank you that your

350
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,319
shit's not burned down because a lot of

351
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,159
stuff burned down this summer and is

352
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
continuing to burn

353
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,278
the point is there is ash falling from

354
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,519
the sky

355
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,200
in california there was ash falling from

356
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,039
the sky in colorado

357
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,720
a lot of people were getting ashes in

358
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,639
their plants we could see the ash

359
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,079
building up in the buds we could see ash

360
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,759
laying on the leaves

361
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,039
a lot of people were scrambling and

362
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,240
turning i said scrambling a lot of

363
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,519
people were scrambling and trying to

364
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,879
figure out what to do

365
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,720
some people were out there with shop

366
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,919
vacs trying to suck off the ash

367
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,920
some people are out there with leaf

368
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,360
blowers trying to blow the ash off some

369
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,639
people just said [ __ ] it and let the ash

370
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,159
develop because there's nothing they can

371
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,720
do about such a large crop

372
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,240
with ash falling from the sky some

373
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,600
people are going to result

374
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,759
to or resort to what is known as bud

375
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,879
washing and it is exactly what it sounds

376
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,519
like it is a post

377
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,838
harvest bud wash just like giving your

378
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,639
car a wash giving anything else a wash

379
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,600
it is the same idea this is most

380
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,519
commonly done

381
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
for crops that have been infested with

382
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,799
powdery mildew this will wash the

383
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
powdery mildew off of there

384
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,879
you can do this to a commercial crop you

385
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,240
can run this commercial crop that has

386
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,639
been treated the way i'm going to tell

387
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
you

388
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,000
through microbial testing after it's had

389
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,399
powdery mildew on it

390
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,078
if it's done properly this method will

391
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,720
remove the powdery mildew and he will

392
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,159
pass

393
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,759
colorado regulated microbe testing so

394
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,240
if you've got powdery mildew on your

395
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,679
buds if you've got ashes on your buds

396
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,680
that is the only reason i would

397
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,759
recommend bud washing

398
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,439
in most cases i don't find it necessary

399
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,879
i find it to be more

400
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,480
you're going to cause more problems than

401
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,879
you are good unless

402
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,680
you've already got powdery mildew or

403
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,399
ashes

404
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,399
i honestly don't want to recommend that

405
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,480
you wash powdery mildew off

406
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,000
however i understand that people are

407
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,079
going to do what they've got to do

408
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,759
people grew a big ass crop if it's a

409
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,599
private grow if it's an indoor grow an

410
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,200
outdoor grow a commercial grow

411
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,278
people grew a product and they see it

412
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,959
and they do not want to throw it away

413
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,958
if it were up to me that would get

414
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,919
tossed that is a non-viable product

415
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,359
that's a failure

416
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,639
we've got to chalk that one up to me

417
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,440
[ __ ] up and having to correct an

418
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,039
issue

419
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,720
not everybody thinks the way that i do

420
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,159
not everybody operates the way i do so

421
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,639
there are going to be

422
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,759
different solutions when it comes to ash

423
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,680
and powdery mildew

424
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,278
sometimes you gotta scramble the ash i

425
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,719
that's not your fault i understand you

426
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:57,600
gotta make a product so you gotta wash

427
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,959
it off

428
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,440
that's more acceptable than powdery

429
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:04,719
mildew to me but if you're going to do

430
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,680
a flower wash or a post harvest bud

431
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,200
wash if you insist on doing so this is

432
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,399
how i recommend you do it i'm going to

433
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:20,320
take a quick drink and then we'll jump

434
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:22,320
into it all right

435
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,839
so you had a three bucket method in mind

436
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,160
i don't recommend the three buckets at

437
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,120
all

438
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,480
i use one five gallon bucket and i dump

439
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,240
my five gallon bucket

440
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,240
uh frequently you can see the powdery

441
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,320
mildew layer you can probably see the

442
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,959
ash layer develop on the top of the

443
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,480
water

444
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,719
so as soon as you see that nice little

445
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,839
funky layer dump it and start over that

446
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,278
way you know you're getting a good

447
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,320
cleaning out of this

448
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,600
so the basic way to do bud washing i get

449
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,440
a five gallon bucket

450
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,399
and i fill it most of the way with water

451
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,600
you've got to leave some room because

452
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,399
you're going to put buds in your hands

453
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,159
in there you need

454
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,600
room to work in there fill it most of

455
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,198
the way with water

456
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,320
you got 5 gallons of water in a 5 gallon

457
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:57,759
bucket there's an inch to work with

458
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,360
maybe 2 inches

459
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,639
then i use 30 hydrogen peroxide the

460
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,399
expensive [ __ ] the good

461
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,399
[ __ ] that is what i buy that is what i

462
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,320
use depending on

463
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,159
the amount of powdery mildew i'm trying

464
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,079
to rinse off of my plants

465
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,919
or perhaps the amount of ash i'm trying

466
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,519
to wash off of my plants

467
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,240
that will help me determine how much

468
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,759
peroxide i want to add to this water

469
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,198
i may start with approximately 25

470
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,759
milliliters per 5 gallon bucket

471
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,719
if my [ __ ] is real intense and real bad

472
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,240
i may consider

473
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,120
50 mils i would never go above 70

474
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,919
milliliters

475
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,799
of hydrogen peroxide per 5 gallon bucket

476
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,479
of water

477
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,078
if it's if you need more than that it's

478
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,240
a lost cause you done [ __ ] up don't

479
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,559
even bother washing it

480
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,278
so we've got our five gallon bucket and

481
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,078
we have put

482
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,958
30 to 50 maybe a little bit more

483
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,239
milliliters

484
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:55,039
of 30 hydrogen peroxide in this bucket

485
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,839
disclaimer time sidebar personal

486
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,278
protective

487
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,760
equipment must be used

488
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,360
before you even pick up the bottle of

489
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,759
hydrogen peroxide

490
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,720
before you think about it put on rubber

491
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,039
gloves

492
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,639
before you pick up the bottle put on

493
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,799
some sort of goggles

494
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,240
the hydrogen peroxide will [ __ ] your

495
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,319
skin and your eyes up

496
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,519
very bad if it comes in contact with

497
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
your skin and or

498
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,000
eyes it will burn your eyes to [ __ ]

499
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,838
it will burn your skin and make your

500
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,440
skin turn white and bubbly depending on

501
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,120
how sensitive your skin is

502
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,360
you will have different reactions i've

503
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,198
seen hydrogen peroxide and zero tall

504
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,079
reactions on skin before

505
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,719
you don't want it it's really easy to

506
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,359
prevent

507
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,040
put on gloves put on a long sleeve shirt

508
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,800
put on you're wearing a mask already

509
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,838
because it's coveted time put on a mask

510
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,679
over your face

511
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,120
put on some rubber or some goggles not

512
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,319
rubber gloves put don't put rubber

513
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,519
gloves on your face

514
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,639
if i catch you with rubber gloves on

515
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,679
your face you're going to get a drug

516
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,519
test and get rid no

517
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,039
put some goggles on your face so you

518
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,278
don't get that [ __ ] in your eyes

519
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,198
protect yourself this stuff will

520
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,320
dissolve the powdery mildew that means

521
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,159
it will also dissolve

522
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,720
other organic components which could be

523
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,759
your eyeball let's not do that

524
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
now you're going to get paranoid that

525
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,639
it's going to dissolve your trichomes

526
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,680
we're just going to rinse it and pull it

527
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,039
out we're not going to be in there long

528
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,719
enough to do anything

529
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,078
to get rid of the trichomes it's not

530
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,278
intense enough to do that

531
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,120
it's just going to wash that powdery

532
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,399
mildew right off of there so you've got

533
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,078
your personal protective

534
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,320
equipment you've got gloves you've got

535
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,319
goggles and i say before you even get

536
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,000
the [ __ ] peroxide out because

537
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,199
i've seen people reach for a product on

538
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,799
a shelf and they pull it off the shelf

539
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,159
and the lid wasn't on it all the way and

540
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,319
they poured it on themselves

541
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,759
i've seen people shake a bottle just you

542
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,278
go to grab whatever and you shake your

543
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,600
drink like this and the lid's not on it

544
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,278
and it [ __ ] splashes into your face

545
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,040
wear some protective equipment that [ __ ]

546
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,278
won't happen so you've got your

547
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,879
proper personal protective equipment you

548
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,120
got your gloves you got your goggles

549
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,919
uh maybe a mask hopefully long sleeves

550
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,600
always

551
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,879
guys wear shoes i know it's fun if

552
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
you're outdoors you're being a [ __ ]

553
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,120
hippie

554
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,519
wear some shoes you don't want

555
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,278
pesticides and products on your feet the

556
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,198
soles of your feet are one of the number

557
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,958
one most absorbent parts of your body

558
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:59,838
for absorbing pesticides and toxic

559
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,919
chemicals

560
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,199
uh probably also absorbing positive [ __ ]

561
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,240
but we don't think about that we don't

562
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:05,359
stress on it

563
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,199
i know that you shouldn't be running

564
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,879
around barefoot in a grow because if

565
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,480
i've applied a pesticide in the grow

566
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,760
it landed on the floor and now it's

567
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,160
going up through the bottoms of your

568
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,318
feet

569
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
into your body protect yourself stay

570
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,279
safe i know you want to have fun and be

571
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,198
a hippie it feels real good

572
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,119
but this is growing we need to be safe

573
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,558
we're smoking medical cannabis so we

574
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,759
don't get cancer

575
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,918
let's not go [ __ ] play with

576
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,679
pesticides and absorb them in our feet

577
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
to give us cancer we need to balance

578
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,720
this [ __ ] out so personal protective

579
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,839
equipment you've got your hydrogen

580
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,600
peroxide

581
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,759
30 to 50 maybe a little bit more

582
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,599
milliliters mixed into your five gallon

583
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,038
bucket of water i just use plain water

584
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,319
right from the tap

585
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,000
just room temperature or whatever

586
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,000
temperature you can [ __ ] with hose

587
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,480
temperature i guess you probably have

588
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
uh then i've got gloves on i've got my

589
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
plants i've harvested my plants

590
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,480
i cut it into manageable sections that's

591
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,200
just chunks probably branches

592
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,000
somewhere between 6 8 10 12 maybe 14

593
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,080
inches long

594
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,519
however deep that five gallon bucket is

595
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,279
i want to grab my buds

596
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,720
my branches just one branch at a time

597
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,960
you can do a handful if you want to i

598
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
prefer one at a time it's more effective

599
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,000
dunk that [ __ ] right into the hydrogen

600
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,919
peroxide solution

601
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and give it a good swirl just shake it

602
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,759
around you're trying to just

603
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,359
jostle that powdery mildew right off of

604
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,319
that bud and then pull it out of there

605
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,240
and give it a look

606
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,918
do you still see more powdery mildew on

607
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,759
there does it need another rinse

608
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,000
put it in there give it a jostle shake

609
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,279
it around once you are confident

610
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,599
that you have knocked off all the

611
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,519
powdery mildew and don't go [ __ ]

612
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,119
crazy with this jostling motion

613
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,480
we're just trying to knock it off gently

614
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,119
knock off the powdery mildew we're not

615
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,519
trying to

616
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,959
smack the trichomes off of the branches

617
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,038
not trying to smack the trichomes off

618
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,558
the buds knock the buds off the branches

619
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,319
not trying to destroy everything we're

620
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,440
trying to fix our problem we [ __ ] up

621
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,200
so just gently

622
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,038
jostle it in that water knock those

623
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,600
tricoms off give it a good rinse

624
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,480
pull it out then hang it up and let it

625
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,558
drip dry

626
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,160
and put a fan near it for a little while

627
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,720
while it's drying don't put the fan

628
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,400
right directly on it but have air moving

629
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,798
have a dehumidifier near it so you can

630
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,280
get rid of all that excess moisture

631
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,558
do not trap these plants that you just

632
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,798
dunked into a

633
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,639
humid area you do not want to cause

634
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,038
mildew problems in these plants give

635
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
them

636
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,200
plenty of airflow and a wide open space

637
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,558
or somewhere you can evacuate all of

638
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,080
that stale air you need

639
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,000
if you're indoors you need a blower

640
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,960
extracting air you need a dehumidifier

641
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,720
if you're outdoors

642
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,960
just let that water evaporate as it

643
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,000
needs to the buds will take a few hours

644
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
to dry

645
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,119
but they were already wet inside they

646
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,960
were moist

647
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,879
there's natural water in there they get

648
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,360
rained on the environment does that to

649
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,400
them

650
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:37,439
they will dry again don't trap them

651
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,200
in a stagnant humid environment

652
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,558
so basically what we're going to do

653
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,319
we're going to mix up our we're going to

654
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,519
put on our personal protective equipment

655
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,879
we're going to mix up our hydrogen

656
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,240
peroxide solution

657
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,679
we're going to dunk each and every

658
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,038
branch into there then we're going to

659
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,200
hang it up in a well

660
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,640
ventilated area that it will not get

661
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,440
moldy that is our basic

662
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,360
method for bud washing i don't like the

663
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,798
method that you chose because

664
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,479
mixing a couple of those ingredients

665
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,639
together is going to make foam like a

666
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,400
volcano like we used to do in school

667
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,240
and that doesn't seem necessary to do to

668
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
my plants it's also going to add

669
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,599
different flavors a couple of the things

670
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,678
you added in your recipe we'll add

671
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,079
flavors we don't need those flavors

672
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,038
the hydrogen peroxide will evaporate or

673
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,918
dissipate

674
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,359
very rapidly very very rapidly it will

675
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,280
be gone before the water

676
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,399
so there will be no remaining aroma no

677
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,319
remaining flavor

678
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,880
no residuals at all if you do it

679
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,519
correctly if you've got big giant buds

680
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
that are

681
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,558
[ __ ] footballs or donkey dicks or

682
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,319
whatever you want to call them

683
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,158
you may need to cut those big chunky

684
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,879
buds down to smaller more manageable

685
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,559
pieces

686
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,159
because inside there you're going to get

687
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,759
moisture trapped in there and you may

688
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,679
cause potential problems

689
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,119
so if you've got big chunky football

690
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,720
donkey dick whatever you want to call

691
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,479
them buds big spears

692
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,839
maybe break them down into smaller more

693
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,960
manageable pieces

694
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,720
pieces that aren't going to have a bunch

695
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,558
of moisture trapped inside of there so

696
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,679
that you create your own problem after

697
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,759
doing your dunk

698
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,679
be very mindful that you just added a

699
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,440
bunch of unnecessary water

700
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,200
to your hanging drying and curing

701
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,279
environment you need to remove that

702
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,640
water you need to keep airflow happening

703
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,639
the shit's going to drip all over the

704
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
floor you may have to come mop that [ __ ]

705
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,120
up off the floor just to get the water

706
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,640
out of the room

707
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,639
now is the time to really think you're

708
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,679
trying to save the crop not make it

709
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,919
worse

710
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,360
all right c-dub in norcal i hope i

711
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,440
helped you out that was a great question

712
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,119
i do see a lot of people out there

713
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,960
talking about it and performing bud

714
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,399
washes right now it's not something i

715
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,159
would do unless it's highly

716
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
highly necessary but i understand that

717
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,679
ash is undesirable

718
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,200
we don't want ashes on the buds until

719
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,519
right before we hit it

720
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,880
or right before it gets to our lungs so

721
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,158
that's the way to rinse them off

722
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,200
uh 30 hydrogen peroxide you can also use

723
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,600
zero tall

724
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,600
maybe use less zero tall than hydrogen

725
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,480
peroxide if you choose to do so

726
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,000
but the 30 hydrogen peroxide at 30 to 50

727
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,919
mils per gallon

728
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,159
drop it in there give it a shake knock

729
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,919
that pm off knock those ashes off

730
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,120
then hang it up to dry let me know how

731
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,080
this works for you if you've got any

732
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,918
follow-up questions

733
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,839
i would be more than happy to help you

734
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,080
out send me an email i read genetics

735
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,959
hotmail.com or hit me on patreon

736
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,359
patreon.com forward slash grow from your

737
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,558
heart

738
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,839
i'm gonna take a quick look here to see

739
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,279
how long we've been recording i've got

740
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,879
my time going on my phone

741
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,119
we've got plenty of time for at least

742
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,799
one more message this one comes from our

743
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,239
friend north north terps

744
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:17,759
what up north good to hear from you bro

745
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,440
i hope you're doing well i talked to

746
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,158
north quite a bit

747
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,600
this message goes what up rosta jeff

748
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,039
it's always a pleasure to communicate

749
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,959
with you it's always great to hear from

750
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,798
you too brother says shout out to white

751
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,840
mike on his recent episode on

752
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,558
operation legalize the world i love that

753
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,639
bro mike

754
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,000
uh your next operation is legalize the

755
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,919
world we're not doing just states

756
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,880
anymore we're not doing our nation

757
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,720
it is a global mission legalized

758
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,960
worldwide mike you are heading that

759
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,839
that is yours uh you are in charge you

760
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,360
direct the army

761
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,439
let us know what you need we're going to

762
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,479
legalize worldwide let's get serious it

763
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,558
says anyways

764
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,400
with that being said i have a question

765
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,279
if maybe you could clarify on using

766
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,880
microbes

767
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,639
okay i have a question maybe you could

768
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,679
clarify on using microbes there should

769
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,679
be a period there

770
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,880
it says i've been experimenting with it

771
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,240
using hydro

772
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,039
and i'm just curious if there is a

773
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,359
preferred method of microbes and feeding

774
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,158
and process for the best way to balance

775
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,399
your ph

776
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,240
as quickly as possible so that i don't

777
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,480
run into deficiencies

778
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,759
or if i'm asking the right question i

779
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,400
think you might know what i'm trying to

780
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,720
get at

781
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,440
and i'm hoping you can help thank you my

782
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,120
guru

783
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,798
peace love and respect i do know exactly

784
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,119
what you're talking about

785
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:29,839
when we add our microbes to our ph

786
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,719
solution

787
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,599
it can drastically change the ph of our

788
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,319
feeding solution

789
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,678
it can drastically change the ph i don't

790
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,119
know if it's going to go up or down it

791
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,559
depends on where your solution is and

792
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,000
what microbes you're using i think it

793
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,158
goes way up i think when we

794
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,599
add the when i had recharge i think my

795
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,480
ph goes up

796
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,959
so this listener so north is concerned

797
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,519
that

798
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,319
we are disrupting the ph to a manner

799
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,798
which it will

800
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,399
disrupt the uptake of the elements and

801
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:56,798
nutrients that are available to the

802
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,320
plant

803
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,639
in that nutrient solution which is a

804
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,558
valid concern we just put a bunch of

805
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
expensive nutrients into a reservoir

806
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,759
into a tank into a feeding system

807
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,278
and then we're going to feed it to our

808
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,319
plants and hope the plants get the best

809
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:09,679
out of that but now i'm going to add

810
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,480
another product that's going to [ __ ]

811
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,159
that all up

812
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,319
and mess up the ph and make some of the

813
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,039
veil the nutrients unavailable to my

814
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,359
plant

815
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,240
i think i understand what you're asking

816
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,000
um

817
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,919
so we mix up our stuff we add a liquid

818
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,319
or a powder uh some are gonna some

819
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,159
people are gonna say to adjust your ph

820
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,079
before you add your microbes and some

821
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,400
people will say to adjust the ph

822
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,278
after you add your microbes i think if

823
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,038
you

824
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,720
get your solution mixed up adjust your

825
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,200
ph and then add your microbes you'll be

826
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,120
fine

827
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,880
i also think it will work perfectly the

828
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,719
other way i bet you

829
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,480
scotty and guru have some information

830
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,000
maybe an update on this

831
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,599
i want to see what happens if you ask

832
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,759
them the exact same question because

833
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,678
they make a microbial product

834
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,679
and i'm using a lot of my experience and

835
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,519
knowledge uh to talk from

836
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,360
using that microbial product shout out

837
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,599
to recharge real grover's recharge

838
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,278
this is not a recharge ad but that's one

839
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,480
of the main products i use so

840
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,159
i know where you're coming from with

841
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,880
this question when we mix in that

842
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,278
recharge

843
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,400
it makes the ph go crazy then we add

844
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,038
that to our plant

845
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,960
you are concerned that since we have

846
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,400
usually we are stubborn about the ph we

847
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,798
want to adjust the ph we're in the right

848
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,038
a

849
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,879
range to make elements bioavailable to

850
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,400
our plants

851
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,360
when those microbes come in contact with

852
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,559
the water

853
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:28,079
and the rhizosphere there is a

854
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,119
carbonic reaction that happens uh to the

855
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,038
best of my knowledge

856
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,798
almost instantly it doesn't take a lot

857
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,720
of time for

858
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,480
the other elements the water the

859
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,679
rhizosphere the other nutrients to

860
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,240
neutralize

861
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,679
that effect within the microbe so that

862
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,839
ph swing will be

863
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,880
minimized within seconds if not minutes

864
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,759
depending on the size of your

865
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,960
rhizosphere

866
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,960
and the amount of water but you're not

867
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,000
using [ __ ] hundreds of gallons so i

868
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,480
think it's gonna happen

869
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,679
almost instantaneously when that water

870
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,599
hits the rhizosphere

871
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,960
i think it's all just gonna go oh wait i

872
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,798
was way out of whack because i was in

873
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,640
water i was in suspension but now

874
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:01,839
i have hit something that i know what to

875
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,240
do with and it all

876
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,199
i think it balances itself out almost

877
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,519
instantly

878
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,200
um again i would like to hear guru and

879
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,960
scotty's feedback and input on this if

880
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,558
you guys are listening dude chime in

881
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,038
either send me a message or just do a

882
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:18,000
podcast about it the question is

883
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,759
uh are my microbes is the ph of my

884
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,038
microbes gonna mess up my uptake of my

885
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,240
plants and how do i prevent that from

886
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,960
happening that's the gist of the

887
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,640
question so

888
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,079
if you guys have feedback i invite you

889
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,919
uh to send me a message

890
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,759
or uh do your own show about it scotty

891
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,278
and guru check out the dude grow show

892
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,798
of course uh scotty real is the

893
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,480
proprietor of

894
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,119
recharge so he's gonna have answers to

895
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,400
this um i hate to just pass the buck on

896
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:39,439
a question but when i know that there's

897
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,559
an expert

898
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,000
right down the street that we can

899
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,960
contact i think that's what we'll do i'm

900
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,720
going to write down a note

901
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,038
to ask guru i'm writing that

902
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,798
i'm going to write it on this page also

903
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,640
so i can find this one

904
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,158
and then we'll ask guru and scotty real

905
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,679
but i think i gave you the appropriate

906
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,919
answer i think that that

907
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,519
i think the carbonic reaction happens

908
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,120
almost instantaneously

909
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,798
to where you don't have to worry about

910
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,479
that ph fluctuation

911
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,639
uh for just a very short amount of time

912
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,240
i don't think it's of any concern

913
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,000
i am going to talk to people who are

914
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,599
absolutely more qualified to answer that

915
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,079
question i'm not shy to admit that

916
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,678
i am not a microbe expert and since guru

917
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,439
and scotty are just a text message away

918
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,440
i will ask them however it is

919
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,720
not an appropriate time to message them

920
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,519
i'm recording kind of late at night i

921
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,600
get some self

922
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,879
time to myself late at night here they'd

923
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,918
probably be mad at me if i text them

924
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,278
right now so i'm not going to do that

925
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,000
but i will get in touch with my friends

926
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,359
we'll get you

927
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,359
some more useful information all right

928
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,038
north north terps uh i hope i helped you

929
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,798
out a little bit and hopefully scotty

930
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,798
and guru heard this and they will chime

931
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,798
in and give you a little bit more info

932
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:41,918
if not i'll get it going for you alright

933
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:43,679
i've got one more

934
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,120
great message that i want to answer on

935
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,840
this episode thank you guys for hanging

936
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,439
out it's two long episodes in a row

937
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,119
feeling good on this episode again thank

938
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,159
you i got my groove back i got my rhythm

939
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,278
back

940
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,159
this message comes from girls grow 2 and

941
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,480
it goes

942
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,640
just like this it says hey ross to jeff

943
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,759
i love the legalization presentation

944
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,038
with white mike

945
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,079
and just became a patreon of his that is

946
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,319
awesome

947
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,158
our friend girls grow too saw the

948
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,759
legalization presentation that featured

949
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,919
white mike and they went and signed up

950
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,519
for white mike's patreon thank you

951
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,038
i appreciate that i'm sure mike

952
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,720
appreciates it as well

953
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,079
and absolutely i'm sure that mike's wife

954
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,919
and little kids appreciate that because

955
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,119
he spoils them he doesn't spend money on

956
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,520
himself he's going to spend

957
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,639
that contribution on his family so shout

958
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,158
out to mike and his family he

959
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,600
appreciates your help

960
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,440
let me keep moving because i'm [ __ ]

961
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,000
rambly it says mike is great and i love

962
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,240
the chemistry you two have he did well

963
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,759
staying on the mic that is a huge

964
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,599
compliment because sometimes mike does

965
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,000
have problems staying on the microphone

966
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,678
uh thank you i kept him on the mic he

967
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,319
kept himself on the mic that is a huge

968
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,919
notice

969
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,000
good job mike people are liking your

970
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,799
show now there is a question here it

971
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,759
says

972
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,519
uh my family my wife finally said yes to

973
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,960
me getting a real grow light for

974
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,398
christmas this year

975
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,399
ah that's pretty awesome i love it that

976
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,558
the wife has given you some permission

977
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,798
uh it says i'm looking for a light that

978
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:06,240
would work in a four by five room

979
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:06,798
my budget is a hard 250. so he's got 250

980
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,000
bucks

981
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,679
to light up a 4x5 room uh probably

982
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,919
looking for an led it doesn't say does

983
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,559
it say oh it says i would love a cannon

984
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,038
i don't think it's in the budget i don't

985
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,359
think a canon led is in the budget even

986
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,480
if you go to

987
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,439
blacksailmarket.com and use coupon code

988
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,200
rosta jeff

989
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,840
and get yourself a nice deal but i don't

990
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,080
think that 250 is gonna get you there

991
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,558
it says i don't think it's in the budget

992
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,439
as a disabled combat veteran with

993
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,918
epilepsy

994
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,600
my grow is my life and gives me purpose

995
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,080
this is the second episode where i've

996
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,319
read

997
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,199
about somebody being a combat veteran

998
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,439
with a grow

999

the last episode

00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,440
i appreciate veterans and especially

1015
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,038
combat veterans and people who've been

1016
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,320
blown up in war and [ __ ]

1017
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:18,558
uh i guess i'm a giant [ __ ] because

1018
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,918
i don't see myself armed and equipped

1019
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:21,519
and shooting at people and

1020
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,880
i said in the last episode if you shoot

1021
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,398
at me or throw a grenade at me i'm

1022
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,799
[ __ ] running i quit

1023
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,319
[ __ ] that game over so i appreciate you

1024
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,240
and respect you for what you do

1025
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,359
uh that does mean a lot to me i said it

1026
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,359
in the last episode

1027
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,879
without people protecting my freedom i

1028
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,240
don't know how much freedom i would have

1029
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,760
so without getting all patriotic and

1030
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,960
weird on the episode and political

1031
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:43,720
thank you i appreciate your service um

1032
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,519
man i don't know what to recommend for a

1033
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,640
250 dollar

1034
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,000
light to fill a four by five sealed room

1035
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,720
i wish we could get you a couple of

1036
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,319
canon leds i think one canon led would

1037
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,839
fill a three by three space

1038
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,278
and get your plants happy in that three

1039
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,879
by three and then slowly we could

1040
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:00,000
upgrade maybe next christmas maybe next

1041
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,080
birthday or something

1042
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
we could talk the wife into a new light

1043
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,240
but 250 is not going to cover

1044
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,319
a canon led it's going to get you close

1045
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,919
also here is where i'm torn i kind of

1046
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,200
work with black sail they're friends of

1047
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,200
mine we've got agreements

1048
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,360
i shouldn't be advertising other lights

1049
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,798
in here i really don't know what other

1050
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,278
light company to recommend

1051
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,398
but i do have a large audience with a

1052
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,079
lot of reach

1053
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,000
and a lot of compassion so here's what

1054
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,599
i'm going to do for you for my friend

1055
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,240
girls grow 2.

1056
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,839
i need some advice will you guys that

1057
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,599
are listening and are watching please

1058
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,480
comment on the youtube channel

1059
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,319
and recommend a good solid grow light

1060
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,640
for around

1061
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:40,558
250 bucks for a disabled veteran

1062
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,240
who needs some help they're a combat

1063
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:43,678
veteran with epilepsy we need to grow

1064
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,159
them some quality medicine

1065
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,278
we need to improve their garden so i

1066
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,640
need some advice

1067
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,798
on a 250 dollar light it doesn't have to

1068
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,720
be an led it doesn't say led in here

1069
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,079
led would probably be best it's going to

1070
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,960
save on electricity it's going to be

1071
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,158
easier to cool

1072
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,720
so if we can get a 250 watt led light

1073
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,519
that will work in a 4x5 room that would

1074
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,440
be awesome

1075
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,278
please leave comments details and

1076
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,679
information in the video description

1077
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:09,200
here

1078
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,720
so that our friend knows where to go

1079
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
look all you've got to do is go to

1080
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,519
youtube

1081
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,439
pull up episode 475 and there will be

1082
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,798
advice left in the comments and thank

1083
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,240
you to my audience members

1084
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,558
that are going to help us out i do

1085
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,679
appreciate that now here's another thing

1086
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:22,960
that i'm going to do

1087
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,798
and i'm going to do it completely

1088
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,679
shamelessly this is not for me

1089
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,720
this is for a disabled combat veteran

1090
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,559
this young man

1091
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,159
has served our country and helped us out

1092
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,480
and he's [ __ ] up because of it so

1093
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,960
it's our turn to serve him back uh he's

1094
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,880
got 250 and he needs some grow lights

1095
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,319
is there a grow light company out there

1096
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,080
that can fill in his gap

1097
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,839
if 250 is a good start and your light

1098
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,278
costs three or four hundred bucks

1099
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,119
is there somebody out there that wants

1100
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,038
to help out a disabled veteran

1101
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:50,398
