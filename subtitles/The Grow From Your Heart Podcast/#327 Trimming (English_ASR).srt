30
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:05,659
you know what I'm smoking on today I'm

31
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,599
taking dabs of this New York City diesel

32
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:10,700
ambrosia batter from apothecary farms

33
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:13,009
I'm giving it a nice smell right now

34
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,228
this stuff smells like like diesel fuel

35
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:16,998
with a little bit of lemons make int of

36
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:18,618
oranges and then there's kind of a sweet

37
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:20,929
tart sort of smell on top of it that I

38
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:23,149
really enjoy I one thing about the New

39
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:25,579
York City diesel and Broza batter here

40
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:27,560
that I'm smoking on my eyes really don't

41
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:28,728
get red when I smoke I can smoke and I

42
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,159
don't get red eyed but when I take one

43
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:33,528
dab of this New York City diesel my eyes

44
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,899
go fully bloodshot red I'm not sure what

45
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:37,728
does it but I get super red I get super

46
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,709
head hide from it and I really enjoy it

47
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:42,138
and if that weren't enough I've been

48
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:44,179
adding this sour amnesia high

49
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:46,638
cannabinoid full-spectrum extract into

50
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:48,498
the mix and it just adds a really a nice

51
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:49,699
it's like turbo charging my dad it is

52
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:51,769
really nice I like the lung expansion

53
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,349
and the flavor from the New York City

54
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:56,060
diesel then you put the high cannabinoid

55
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:57,978
full spectrum extract on top and it

56
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,109
really makes it like a turbocharged dad

57
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:01,578
so I am in the mood for a podcast you

58
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:03,738
guys I feel super rambley I feel like I

59
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:06,288
got a lot of energy let's get into a

60
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:08,659
podcast this episode is going to be all

61
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:09,770
about trimming your cannabis plants

62
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,000
that's right we've learned how to tell

63
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,620
when the plants are ripe we've learned

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
how to cut them down we've learned how

65
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,379
to harvest them we learned how to hang

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,060
them until they're ready to snap

67
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:20,019
we know pretty well how to dry and cure

68
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,979
now let's talk about trimming our plants

69
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,930
now there are two different ways you can

70
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:27,439
trim there's wet trim and there is dry

71
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,240
trim I definitely prefer dry trim I'm

72
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,909
gonna say why is dry trim better

73
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,370
I think dry trim is better because it's

74
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:37,909
less sticky and it's much easier to work

75
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:40,009
with it's also less work the leaves are

76
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:41,060
dry those leaves are gonna fall off all

77
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,560
you have to do is just brush them with

78
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,060
your thumb maybe touch them with the

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,189
scissors and those brittle leaves will

80
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,569
come right off of there the buds have

81
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:49,069
dried and tightened up and then it's a

82
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,629
little more obvious for a new trimmer

83
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,419
what to take off you just want to take

84
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,129
off that fluffy outside [ __ ] so it's a

85
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:57,530
little less work it's less sticky and

86
00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:00,079
there's also less chance to ruin your

87
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,879
buds by improperly storing them a lot of

88
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,260
people once the buds are trimmed if they

89
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,150
wet trim they like to just shove them

90
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:06,859
into a container or a package and then

91
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,200
those wet buds go into a container and

92
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,490
that's when they get ruined so we're not

93
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,500
even gonna let that happen we're gonna

94
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,670
let the buds dry then we're gonna trim

95
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,129
them then we'll put them in a container

96
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:17,659
now a lot of people have listened to the

97
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,090
dry and curing episode you may be

98
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,859
trimming these buds before they go into

99
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,030
the jar for cure you may be trimming

100
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,500
these buds after they've been in the

101
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,210
cure jar for a little while it's all the

102
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,949
same process the leaves should be

103
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,659
similar in dryness they should just be

104
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:31,000
popping right off of there you might not

105
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,319
even need scissors for this

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,969
sometimes when I'm dry trimming the only

107
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,229
thing I use my scissors for as for

108
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:38,150
cutting the plant into smaller pieces

109
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:40,250
and cutting the sticks out and cutting

110
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,770
the bigger buds down to smaller buds now

111
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,689
let's talk about a few preparations we

112
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,000
can make and a few items we can have to

113
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:48,439
create a comfortable and successful trim

114
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,330
environment for ourselves

115
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,669
trimming sucks it's going to take a long

116
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,920
time you're sitting in a chair with your

117
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:56,750
elbows up high staring straight into

118
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,239
something for a long time your neck your

119
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,090
elbows your eyes your back that stuff

120
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,740
all gets sore and tired so let's try to

121
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,140
make it as comfortable as possible I

122
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,760
like to have a nice clean space I've got

123
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:09,109
this table where I like to do my work I

124
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,969
clean the whole table off there's

125
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,010
nothing on the table except my dr.

126
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:14,810
pepper and some trim supplies maybe my

127
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:16,129
phone for some entertainment but it's

128
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,660
just there for music I'm not gonna be

129
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:19,009
touching it don't have your phone out if

130
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,120
you're trimming you guys it's so [ __ ]

131
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,769
distracting and it'll slow you down

132
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,939
it'll take twice as long put on a

133
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,829
podcast hit play

134
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:25,969
start [ __ ] trim it anyway I like to

135
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:28,189
have the table nice and clean I don't

136
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,969
need [ __ ] in my way I need maybe my

137
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:30,618
scissors for cutting

138
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,088
my buds into smaller pieces and then

139
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:34,279
just a few basic essentials and we'll

140
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:35,838
talk about those a nice clean space I

141
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:37,428
also like a nice comfortable chair

142
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:40,368
you're gonna be sitting there for a

143
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:42,378
while get a cozy chair so a nice clean

144
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:43,909
workspace in a cozy chair are super

145
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:45,528
important for me for trimming but then

146
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:47,298
you need some sort of entertainment

147
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:47,718
hopefully you got somebody there to talk

148
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:49,278
to

149
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:50,838
usually I got Mike or somebody around to

150
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:53,778
[ __ ] with some sort of conversation

151
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:55,639
makes trimming go much more smoothly but

152
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:57,139
if you don't have that option put on a

153
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,819
podcast you guys I like to put on a

154
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,989
podcast of course I recommend old

155
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,598
episodes if the girl from your heart

156
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:03,859
podcast put on some Joe Rogan something

157
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:05,748
like that maybe a YouTube video

158
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,299
something to entertain yourself to

159
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:09,649
listen to but nothing to look at back in

160
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:11,238
the day we used to trim all around the

161
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,158
TV and we would watch youtube videos and

162
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:15,588
trim I found that that is super

163
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:16,998
distracting don't watch videos people

164
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:18,348
will put their [ __ ] scissors down and

you're going to get extremely sticky you

182
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:49,488

scratch your face you're gonna be your

185
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:56,088
hands are gonna be covered in trichomes

186
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:57,499
and resin you guys wear gloves also you

187
00:05:56,088 --> 00:06:00,019
need some good scissors I like the

188
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:01,879
little tiny Fiskars diamond tip scissors

189
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:03,110
that you get you can they're expensive

190
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,610
at the gross store they're cheaper at

191
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,379
Hobby Lobby they saw them in the craft

192
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,119
section right the craft section of Hobby

193
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,619
Lobby that's all of Hobby Lobby there's

194
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:12,079
some in the fabric section over by the

195
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:14,419
fabric there Fiskars diamond tip

196
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,098
titanium scissors I really like those

197
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:17,448
they work really well for trimming

198
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:18,949
they're super light get something with a

199
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,119
spring in it that opens on its own

200
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:21,949
because you don't wanna have to be

201
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:23,239
opening and closing scissors you don't

202
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,348
want the kind of scissors to have loops

203
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:25,758
that go around your fingers cuz you're

204
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,899
gonna be cutting for so long those

205
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,639
little loops around your fingers are

206
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,428
gonna dig into you you just want

207
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,718
lightweight super fast trimming shears

208
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:34,848
they're easy to find and they're

209
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:36,649
affordable maybe get yourselves two pair

210
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:37,788
so that you can set one in the rubbing

211
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,649
alcohol to clean off

212
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:40,759
you can dirty up another pair swap them

213
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,560
out real quick and I'll have to spend a

214
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,120
lot of time cleaning your scissors so

215
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,280
you need some good gloves some good

216
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,470
scissors then you need some containers

217
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,659
you need a container for untrimmed buds

218
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,610
I recommend a five-gallon bucket for the

219
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,169
untrimmed buds maybe you don't have that

220
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,540
much herb maybe something smaller will

221
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:58,219
work then you need another container for

222
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,250
trimmed buds then you need another

223
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,500
container for savable trim and then we

224
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,139
need another container for waste so you

225
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,750
need trimmed buds untrimmed buds usable

226
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,980
trim and waste a couple other things I'm

227
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,240
gonna recommend and you're gonna say why

228
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,069
the hell would he recommend this for a

229
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,259
grow I would recommend either some

230
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:17,180
coconut oil or some baby oil for your

231
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,789
trim session you're gonna say why do we

232
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,259
need that here is why when your fingers

233
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,689
and hands and arms get all sticky

234
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:25,639
you can use the coconut oil or the baby

235
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,050
oil to remove the trichomes that's right

236
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,000
if your hands are all covered in resin

237
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,139
my thing is that my arms get covered in

238
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,279
rezident cuz i'm the one cutting down

239
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,150
the plants I'm reaching in there and

240
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,129
playing with them and turning them

241
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:36,679
around my arm hair and [ __ ] gets all

242
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:38,839
coated in trichomes and plant resin so I

243
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,699
use a coconut oil or baby oil to just

244
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,168
rub up on my arms and rub that [ __ ]

245
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,629
right off and all the resin comes right

246
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:45,740
off and then you're not all sticky

247
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,659
alright so that's a basic breakdown of

248
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,460
things that you're going to need for

249
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,930
your trim session you need a nice clean

250
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:53,120
space in which to work you need a nice

251
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,949
cozy chair in which to sit you need a

252
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,418
good podcast to listen to probably the

253
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,250
girl from your art podcast then you need

254
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:59,750
some gloves you need scissors then you

255
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,129
need your containers then you've got

256
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,379
your cleanup supplies now let's talk

257
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:05,750
about doing the manual work hopefully a

258
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:08,000
few days before harvest you went in and

259
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,439
did a pre harvest defoliation now what I

260
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,240
mean by that is while the plants are

261
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,639
still alive while you're flushing

262
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,350
anywhere between I don't know seven days

263
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,759
before harvest up to the day of harvest

264
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,370
you can go in there and just start

265
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,659
pulling off all of the big leaves the

266
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,009
plants are done growing they're just

267
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,479
flushing out they're just finishing up

268
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,279
the trichomes are ripening up you don't

269
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:26,629
need all that excess leaf in there so

270
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,509
just go ahead and tear all that leaf out

271
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:31,279
of the room having a pre harvest

272
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,750
defoliation session will save you a lot

273
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,899
of time when it comes time to trim

274
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,668
because all of that long straggly leaf

275
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,468
is already gone it's not even there to

276
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:41,208
deal with it's already been removed and

277
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,669
it will also help your drying and curing

278
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,588
time so go in and pull off all the big

279
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:47,299
leaves before you harvest then it's

280
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,339
harvest time I've done a highly detailed

281
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:51,169
harvest episode if you haven't listened

282
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,410
to that go listen to that then come

283
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:54,179
catch up

284
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:55,980
at the end of the harvest episode we're

285
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:58,109
left with our plants hanging upside down

286
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,550
in a controlled environment now we want

287
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,550
those plants to get to where the sticks

288
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:04,469
snap once the sticks get snappy you can

289
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:05,819
start trimming you can also start

290
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,649
trimming them after they've been in

291
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,840
their cure containers for a little while

292
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,579
I like dry trim I'm just waiting for the

293
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,440
buds to be dry enough to where the

294
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,879
leaves kind of just flake right off

295
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,110
there's still gonna be moisture inside

296
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,789
those buds there's moisture in the

297
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,080
middle but the outside is dry enough to

298
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,669
where you can just kind of knock the

299
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,560
buds off the leaves off the buds with

300
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:23,849
your thumb I'm making a little motion

301
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,439
with my hands that sort of looks like

302
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,940
I'm playing a video game like I've got a

303
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,070
game controller in my hand but my hands

304
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,480
are really close together in my mind I'm

305
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,670
just holding that little bud with my

306
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,310
four fingers or maybe with my left hand

307
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:37,949
and I'm just knocking the leaves off

308
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,149
with my right hand just like I'm just it

309
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,770
looks like I'm playing a video game I'm

310
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:42,059
just holding the bud and just rubbing

311
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:44,189
the leaves right off if you hold it with

312
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,929
the bud facing up if you rub down those

313
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,920
leaves will just rub right off you'll

314
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:48,329
see what I'm talking about when you

315
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,819
figure out the technique you go man that

316
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,710
is so easy so my point is that I want it

317
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,879
to where the buds are dry I want to be

318
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,040
able to just knock those leaves right

319
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,409
off so here is how I actually do my

320
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,389
trimming whenever I'm working with the

321
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:02,639
plants I like to wear gloves so step one

322
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:04,649
of trimming is put on some rubber gloves

323
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,730
I like the six millimeter nitrile gloves

324
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:07,350
I don't care if they're black I don't

325
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,269
care if they're blue I just care that

326
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,009
they fit and that they're comfortable so

327
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:13,319
glove up I don't want to get all sticky

328
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:15,569
and also I don't want to get my skin all

329
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,629
over the buds so step one is glove up

330
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,520
step two of trimming is to knock all of

331
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:22,830
the buds off of the sticks into a

332
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,779
five-gallon bucket this makes it so much

333
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,330
easier just go and get everybody off the

334
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,829
sticks into a bucket and then discard

335
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,290
all the sticks now you've compressed

336
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,509
your work into a much smaller space it

337
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:34,709
looks way less overwhelming and you can

338
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,629
see what you've got ahead of you you've

339
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,460
got a five gallon bucket filled with

340
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:40,649
buds that you need to trim it doesn't

341
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,269
look like this big sprawl of branches

342
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:44,129
and leaves and [ __ ] everywhere just a

343
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:46,169
bucket it's way less intimidating and

344
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:48,809
you can get through it so knock all the

345
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:50,399
buds into a bucket maybe you can use

346
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:52,079
just a small bowl maybe you can use

347
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,789
something smaller I'm not sure how much

348
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,500
you grew maybe you need five buckets I

349
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:57,059
hope you need ten or twenty five gallon

350
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,190
buckets but find the container that's

351
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,659
the right size for what you need a five

352
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,190
gallon bucket from Home Depot or Lowe's

353
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,799
is really affordable and they're

354
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,190
disposable so I like to use the buckets

355
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,039
so I knock everybody

356
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:11,200
into a bucket now I've got a five-gallon

357
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,120
bucket full of buds my next step is just

358
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,550
to reach in grab the butt off the top

359
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,110
and start trimming now I'll actually

360
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,000
start talking about trimming a little

361
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,300
bit and the actual trimming of the bud

362
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,009
process the idea is to knock or cut off

363
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:26,439
all of the excessive leaves and stems

364
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:29,139
and give yourself a nice pretty

365
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,760
presentable but you guys know what a

366
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:32,710
good trimmed bud looks like when they

367
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,169
start off they're covered in leaves it's

368
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,400
our job to knock those leaves off we

369
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:38,409
don't want to smoke leaves leaves

370
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,779
contain chlorophyll leaves don't taste

371
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:44,620
good leaves don't get you high what we

372
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:46,240
want is a nice frosty green nugget so

373
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,009
once you guys get started trim and

374
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,810
you'll see what's leaf material and what

375
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:51,009
is a usable but once you start digging

376
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,479
in there and just start knocking off

377
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,830
some of the leaf you'll find that bud in

378
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,379
the middle and it will start to become

379
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,330
very obvious what you do and do not trim

380
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:01,210
if your buds are kind of airy and fluffy

381
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,160
don't trim too deeply just knock off the

382
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,690
leaves I like to grab the bud by the

383
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:07,089
base by that little stick at the bottom

384
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,040
of the bud and just use my thumb to push

385
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,080
the leaves off I just kind of spin the

386
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,039
bud in a circle with my left hand I will

387
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,750
turn it I'm looking that's

388
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,730
counterclockwise no that is clockwise

389
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,799
I'll turn the bud clockwise and as it

390
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,389
comes toward me I'll use my right thumb

391
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,159
I'm using my left hand to spin the bud

392
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:22,809
toward me and is that one side come

393
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,669
towards me comes toward me my thumb just

394
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,589
knocks the leaves off right there I'm

395
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:28,329
just wiping them off like I'm just just

396
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,860
scraping the leaves off they're so dry

397
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,629
that they knock off on their own and

398
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,159
don't press so hard that you're [ __ ]

399
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:34,929
up the shape of the bud and knocking off

400
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,850
trichomes you can do this really gently

401
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:38,469
you'll find the technique after you do

402
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,970
it a few times it'll be really

403
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,710
comfortable and you'll get really fast

404
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,850
at it a lot of people like to do this

405
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,110
with scissors they'll hold it in the

406
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,879
left hand and they'll take their

407
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,710
scissors and just turn it and trim it

408
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,838
the leaves are sticking off horizontally

409
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,580
just keep your scissors horizontal you

410
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,170
can get adjust your angle as you need

411
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,550
and just spin that bud and keep cutting

412
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,929
just like you're giving it a haircut you

413
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,969
just want to take off those leaves and

414
00:12:55,929 --> 00:13:00,489
leave that bud there so just knock off

415
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,440
the leaves don't carve too deeply into

416
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,519
the buds and don't squish the buds while

417
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,200
you're trimming them don't squeeze them

418
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,569
super hard and try not to handle them

419
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,280
too much a little tiny bud doesn't need

420
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,780
a lot of handling you don't want to get

421
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,149
all those trichomes on your gloves you

422
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:14,740
want to leave the trichomes on the bud

423
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:16,120
so you can use scissors if you want I

424
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,980
like my thumbs for most trimming you

425
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,419
guys the little edge of my thumb and my

426
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,778
thumbnail is a perfect little trimmer

427
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:22,149
form

428
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:23,919
I've mastered that technique I knock off

429
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:25,870
the little leaves and cut the big buds

430
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,059
into smaller sizes if you guys can see a

431
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,709
stick in there and it's like one bud and

432
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,328
then a little stick in another bud take

433
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:33,849
that [ __ ] out nobody wants to buy a

434
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:36,609
stick connoisseur quality bud is taken

435
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,620
down to the small part if you want to

436
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,829
leave your buds in big buds that's fine

437
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,269
it's up to you I like them smaller a lot

438
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:44,620
of people don't want to buy a big stick

439
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,269
you'll see people I don't know you'll

440
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,740
have some customers that want big buds I

441
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,419
used to have people that just wanted big

442
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,499
buds and then some people know better

443
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:52,958
they're like man I don't want to buy

444
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:54,220
that quarter that one one bud that

445
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,719
weighs a quarter because I know right up

446
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,100
the middle of it as a gram of stick and

447
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,180
I'm getting ripped off so some people

448
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,329
want it some people don't

449
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:02,859
that's up to you so once you've got it

450
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:06,338
trimmed up to the size you want it and

451
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,749
the the amount of trim you want I cut

452
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:09,819
off all the little leaves at the bottom

453
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:11,170
also there's like a lot of people leave

454
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:12,490
a little cabbagey looking leaves at the

455
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:14,438
bottom I cut that [ __ ] off

456
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,360
I call it cabbage and I also take out

457
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:17,588
the handlebar sticks on the bottom

458
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,839
you're gonna have the branch that the

459
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,189
bud was actually stuck to the branch to

460
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,449
and then there's two little sticks that

461
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:23,588
come out that those first leaves were

462
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:24,909
attached to and they're all dry and

463
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:26,949
should you look and cut those off of

464
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:28,778
there if you've got a pound of weed and

465
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:29,198
you've got all those little tiny stakes

466
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:31,360
in there

467
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,649
those little sticks make your pound look

468
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,120
like [ __ ] just take it out and your

469
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,889
pound is gonna look so much better it's

470
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,629
gonna be so much more desirable it's

471
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:39,039
gonna get you more money all right so

472
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:41,230
that's the bottom line here trim it and

473
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,179
it's worth more money so take off all

474
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,800
the leaves take off that little stick at

475
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:46,778
the bottom knock off all the crow's feet

476
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,669
if you've got a little tiny pointy leaf

477
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:50,350
sticking out of somewhere cut that out

478
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:51,909
or knock it off with your thumb those

479
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,069
little triangle leaves make you look

480
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:55,419
lazy if you did a whole good job on most

481
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:57,188
of the bud and you just left one or two

482
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:59,919
little triangles at the tip you look

483
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:01,750
lazy take that stuff out of there so

484
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,789
while I'm doing this all the trimming

485
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,250
work I trim over a tray or a container

486
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:08,198
to catch what I trim off all that little

487
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,299
stuff that gets clipped off is going to

488
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:12,669
be used to make concentrates or edibles

489
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:14,948
in the future so gather all that stuff

490
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:16,299
up take care of it don't just don't trim

491
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,979
into the floor and then sweep it up

492
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:19,508
don't trim onto the table and then scoop

493
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,459
it up trim onto a tray trim into a

494
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:23,019
container so that it is kept clean so

495
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,878
it's treated with respect because it may

496
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,740
go into edibles and things that you're

497
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,688
gonna eat need to be treated with

498
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,308
respect things you're gonna smoke need

499
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:32,379
to be treated with respect this is our

500
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:33,969
medicine so gather this stuff up and

501
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,649
vacuum seal it I like

502
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,139
to keep the trim in a vacuum-sealed bag

503
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:40,149
in the dark until I'm able to use it get

504
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:42,938
that to your extractor as soon as you

505
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:45,188
can now the sticks those are thrown away

506
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:46,990
I throw all the sticks away and a

507
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:48,639
commercial grow they're thrown away in a

508
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,350
home grow those should go to the compost

509
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,990
pile or they can be burned or something

510
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,879
but the sticks are trash don't try to

511
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,649
extract sticks you guys that's a waste

512
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,120
of time it's a waste of energy you're

513
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:00,339
not gonna get anything out of it and

514
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,500
also if you're adding the sticks to the

515
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,949
trim you're just making the hash worse

516
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,750
you're not making it better what goes in

517
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:09,609
comes out and if you just put [ __ ] in to

518
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,049
make more you're gonna get more but it's

519
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:16,120
gonna be [ __ ] so gather up all your trim

520
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:18,399
vacuum seal the trim keep the trim in a

521
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,990
dark place and get that to somebody that

522
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,799
can turn that into concentrates for you

523
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,740
also

524
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,778
if you've got like yellow or brown or

525
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,399
funky leaves that are falling off as

526
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:29,350
you're trimming separate those pull

527
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,970
those out of the trim don't send that to

528
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,379
the extractor that's gonna make your

529
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,180
hash and dark that's gonna make your

530
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:35,920
hash taste like [ __ ] it's gonna make it

531
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:38,258
less potent and it's gonna make it less

532
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,759
desirable so do a little work clean it

533
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:42,550
up get it out of there and you will have

534
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,050
a better product so use your thumbs or

535
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:45,609
some scissors to gently remove the

536
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:47,169
excess leaves and the little stems from

537
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,159
the buds get rid of the handlebars get

538
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:49,929
rid of the crow's feet

539
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,088
now once the buds are trimmed to your

540
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:54,489
satisfaction you can place them into a

541
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:56,709
container for finished products now when

542
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,000
I say to your satisfaction how you want

543
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,888
to trim your buds is up to you if you

544
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,688
want to leave it a little fluffy go for

545
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:05,019
it you want to trim it nice and tight go

546
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:06,908
for it that is up to you if your product

547
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:08,650
is for you personally then you can leave

548
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:10,120
it as leafy as you want you can knock

549
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,069
those leaves off right before you smoke

550
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,509
it you can clean it up yourself if you

551
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:15,578
plan on getting top dollar for your

552
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:18,099
product you'll need to have a tight

553
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:19,658
clean trim job one thing I should

554
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:21,908
mention that will help us speed up the

555
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:23,650
process of trimming is the rule of thumb

556
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:25,600
if the bud you were trimming is not

557
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,339
bigger than the tip of your thumb it's

558
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,469
probably better to let that bud go to

559
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:31,298
your hash pile and trim something more

560
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,279
substantial put those little popcorn

561
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:35,109
buds in the hash pile put it in your

562
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,639
trim pile and you can make better hash

563
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:38,500
that will improve the quality of your

564
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,270
concentrates so if it's a little tiny

565
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,279
bud don't waste time trimming it just

566
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,629
throw it in the hash pile and don't

567
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,190
waste your time trimming little tiny

568
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,740
buds if you feel like that little tiny

569
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,900
bud is worth less money then

570
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,640
time it is taking you to trim it set it

571
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,309
aside and put it in the hash pile you

572
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,759
don't have to trim that if herb costs

573
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:59,500
ten dollars a gram and it takes you like

574
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,359
a minute to trim that little nug it's

575
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,069
not cost-effective so toss that little

576
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,569
nugge into the trim bin we'll add that

577
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:06,069
to the concentrates grab something that

578
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:09,399
we can trim and get on the shelf and

579
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:11,349
make it purchasable for the consumer so

580
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,670
if it's real tiny if it's ugly

581
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:14,919
don't bother trimming it you can put

582
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,380
that in your hash pile you can add that

583
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,330
to the to be extracted pile and that

584
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,250
will just improve your concentrates it

585
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:24,189
will also speed you up of course if you

586
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,720
need every little half gram every piece

587
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,610
of gravel out of that crop to make your

588
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,259
goal to make your wait go ahead and trim

589
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:31,629
that up add that that'll be weight in

590
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:33,519
the bottom of the bag but if it's not

591
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,870
necessary if it's just for you put that

592
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,569
in the concentrate pile and speed

593
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:40,119
yourself up and the commercial grow the

594
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:42,460
growers are expected to kick out a pound

595
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,678
minimum per person per shift some people

596
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,179
turn in two pounds every day and if they

597
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:48,040
spend time trimming that little gravel

598
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:49,870
[ __ ] they would never get there we have

599
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,250
a way of separating all those little

600
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:52,959
tiny buds all that little stuff gets

601
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,329
filtered out it gets pushed to the side

602
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,190
and then all of that those little buds

603
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:59,500
and the trim and they're combined and it

604
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,970
gets turned in to concentrates so do a

605
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,369
nice tight trim if you want to sell it

606
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,200
but don't go overboard don't trim it too

607
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:06,609
tight and also don't try trimming all

608
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,170
those little buds or you're gonna put

609
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:10,389
yourself in debt you've got to pay your

610
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,890
trimmers you're spending your time make

611
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,480
it cost-effective

612
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,370
now something I want to mention trimming

613
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,240
will be very strain dependent some buds

614
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:20,949
are tight some buds are real fluffy some

615
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,420
buds are a little compacted little rocks

616
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,490
you can just kind of rub your fingers

617
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,140
over those and those are gonna trim some

618
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,240
buds are airy and have a lot of texture

619
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,590
to them those are gonna be a little

620
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,269
harder to trim because you don't want to

621
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:33,699
knock off all those calyxes you're going

622
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:35,349
to have to adjust also if you're working

623
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,210
for somebody else you're going to have

624
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:39,039
to adjust to how they want it trimmed

625
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,140
when you go to a grow and you're working

626
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,839
for someone else they get to dictate how

627
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,030
tight your trim is don't over trim don't

628
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,199
under trim you trim to their expectation

629
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:48,789
if you're not sure what they want

630
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,710
have them trim up a bud and show you

631
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:52,089
have them trim up two or three buds and

632
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,679
set those at your workstation so you

633
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,569
have something to refer to as the day

634
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,100
goes on so that you don't forget and

635
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,480
also if they come by and say hey why you

636
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,829
doing it like that you got a couple

637
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,548
little buds to show them you can say

638
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:03,048
these are what you showed me this is

639
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:04,548
what I did show me the difference show

640
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:05,658
me where I'm going wrong then they can

641
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:07,429
say [ __ ] you're doing it just like I

642
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:09,289
showed you I'm sorry so we got a nice

643
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:10,879
tight trim we're setting the trim in one

644
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:12,618
pile we're setting our little tiny buds

645
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:14,089
in another pile we're mixing that up so

646
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:16,819
we can make good concentrates out of it

647
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:18,558
we're getting rid of all the sticks you

648
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:20,239
guys I think we have covered most of

649
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,819
trimming one great thing about trimming

650
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:24,200
is scissor and glove hash all that

651
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:26,450
sticky [ __ ] that builds up on your

652
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,909
gloves and scissors is smokeable you can

653
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,009
smoke that right away Mike loved scissor

654
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:32,450
hatch Oh what I like to do if I've got

655
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:34,399
if I've been trimming so see even trim

656
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,830
and you've got this weird layer of like

657
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:38,358
sticky gooey looking [ __ ] all over your

658
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:40,819
gloves that's resin that's trichomes

659
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:42,499
that is potency rub your hands together

660
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,759
and you'll start figuring out how to rub

661
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:45,499
your hands in a circle to make that

662
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,028
stuff stick together a little bit of

663
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:49,038
heat goes a long way so if your hands

664
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:50,898
get warm it'll start taking that resin

665
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,058
right off of your hands I don't want to

666
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:54,918
smoke it off your skin back in the day

667
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:57,048
we used to call it finger hash but

668
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,149
please wear gloves now and we're gonna

669
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:00,528
call it glove hatch you can scrape it

670
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:02,418
off your scissors you can smoke it off

671
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:03,980
your gloves then put it in a bowl you

672
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:05,778
can put it on top of some pot or just

673
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,210
put it in an empty bowl and just put a

674
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:09,648
flame to it and melt it just slowly melt

675
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,119
that [ __ ] until it starts smoking and

676
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:13,398
you can smoke that sizzurp hash that

677
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:16,069
glove hash you can smoke it right away

678
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:18,048
but please don't pass that [ __ ] to me if

679
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:19,819
you did that off your skin and weren't

680
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:22,519
wearing gloves I don't want to smoke

681
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:24,558
your skin so that's one good thing about

682
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:26,659
trimming is you get scissor hash right

683
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:27,288
away I think that anything that sticks

684
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:28,669
to your gloves

685
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:30,288
that's yours you get to smoke that if

686
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:31,669
you come trim for me and that [ __ ]

687
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,808
sticks to your gloves I have no problem

688
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:34,249
with you rolling that right off your

689
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:35,418
glove put that in a pipe and smoke it

690
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,798
right in front of me you earned that

691
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,019
that is your scissor hatch that means

692
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,668
you're trimming your ass off if it's on

693
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:43,220
your scissors scrape your scissors off

694
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:44,749
smoke that [ __ ] what a lot of people

695
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,009
will do all the trimmers in the room

696
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:47,600
will just gather all their scissor hash

697
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:48,558
into one pile and put it into a big ball

698
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,058
and then at the end of the day you guys

699
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,730
all smoke that together it's like a

700
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,509
little celebration but it's smokeable

701
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,919
that's my point

702
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:57,200
you can make edibles out of it if you

703
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,239
want to but I would recommend smoking it

704
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,590
Mike loves smoking it's not my favorite

705
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:02,450
to smoke it's a little law it's heavy on

706
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:04,849
the lungs and it tastes kind of wet but

707
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,909
it is potent and it will give you a big

708
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:09,288
fat hit another great thing about dry

709
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,909
trimming that I didn't mention is that

710
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,558
when you were done trimming you can now

711
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:13,879
weigh your product you've been cutting

712
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,319
off the extra crap and throwing that in

713
00:22:13,878 --> 00:22:17,359
one piled and even throw in those spin

714
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:18,619
buds into one pile all you got to do is

715
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,119
set that container on the scale and

716
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:22,129
weigh it now one thing I would recommend

717
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:23,629
it's a good idea whatever container

718
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,280
you're going to throw your buds into

719
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,990
your finished buds if it's gonna be a

720
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,210
bucket if it's gonna be a Tupperware

721
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,370
container wave that and write the weight

722
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:33,140
of that on your container so that when

723
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:34,579
you're done trimming into that container

724
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,259
you know how much that weighs

725
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,699
so just subtract the weight of your

726
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:39,589
container and now you know how much

727
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,360
product is on the scale so it's always

728
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:42,889
rewarding knowing how much product

729
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,659
you've got right at the end of the trim

730
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,280
process when you wet trim you don't know

731
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,930
cuz you've got a way for it to dry still

732
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:49,099
so when people say how much did you trim

733
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,660
today and they said I trimmed a black

734
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:52,069
pound how do you know bro it was wet

735
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,259
it's got a dry we'll find out in a few

736
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:56,240
days so if you're paying people to trim

737
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:58,400
by the pound dry trim is the way to go

738
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,720
because now you've got dry pounds to

739
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,850
weigh you don't have a wet pound to

740
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,620
guess on the weight so here's one more

741
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:04,969
thing I should definitely mention to all

742
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:06,559
of my friends who have never trimmed

743
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,049
before everybody who is new with

744
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,269
cannabis here's something that I have to

745
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:13,490
tell you when you were trimming or

746
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:16,359
working with plants in general do not

747
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,769
touch your eyes with sticky trim fingers

748
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:20,959
don't rub your eye with the back of your

749
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:23,569
hand go wash your hands before you touch

750
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,670
your eyes if you rub your eyes with

751
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:27,950
trichomes or plant resin on your finger

752
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,440
it is going to burn for the next hour

753
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,150
and it is sticky every time you blink

754
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,680
most of the time you think you can blink

755
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,210
and it'll fix your sticky eye or

756
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,590
whatever is in your eye not when you

757
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,210
have resin in your eye every time you

758
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:39,439
blink it gets [ __ ] stickier and it

759
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:42,350
feels like your eyelid is sticking to

760
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,210
your eyeball and it just burns so wear

761
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:46,579
gloves and if you need to itch your eye

762
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,130
take your [ __ ] glove off your hand

763
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:51,230
VIN it your eye I would almost consider

764
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,940
washing my hands before the itch take

765
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,230
the glove off go wash the hand then

766
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,279
scratch the eye but I understand

767
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,450
sometimes you just got to stick your

768
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,430
finger in your eye cuz shit's going

769
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,370
weird take that glove off you guys don't

770
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:04,070
put plant resin or trichomes in your eye

771
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:05,809
it will [ __ ] suck that's the

772
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:07,339
technical term for it it [ __ ] sucks

773
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:09,049
there's no other way to describe it it

774
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:10,279
[ __ ] sucks you guys alright

775
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:12,259
so I feel like I've given you a pretty

776
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:15,289
good lesson on trimming I know I didn't

777
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:17,329
teach you exactly how to trim be active

778
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:18,799
holding the bud and putting the scissors

779
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:20,179
to it is something you're going to have

780
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,309
to experience you will develop your

781
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,720
technique in your style I feel like I've

782
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:25,069
given you a pretty good outline you know

783
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,660
what to do with the product you know how

784
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:29,058
to get it there you just need some

785
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,860
practice doing it get some buds

786
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:32,148
put some scissors to him that's the only

787
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:33,709
way you're gonna get good at it it's the

788
00:24:32,148 --> 00:24:36,408
only way you're gonna get faster at it

789
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,450
when we hire new trimmers at the grow we

790
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:40,100
don't always hire the people that claim

791
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,600
to be the fastest trimmers we hire the

792
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:43,038
people that interview well and seem like

793
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,959
they're gonna fit in with the crew if

794
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,788
they say they can only trim a half a

795
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,528
pound of weed when they start that is

796
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:50,419
fine if that is real if they say they

797
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,950
can trim a half a pound and they only do

798
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,840
a quarter pound then I've got issues but

799
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,850
they say I can trim a half a pound in a

800
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,798
day I'm fine with that we will train

801
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:59,178
them we will teach them our system we'll

802
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,528
teach them some tricks they'll get in

803
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:02,419
they'll get a rhythm they'll get a

804
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:04,368
routine and eventually they'll be

805
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,629
trimming a pound and a half a day so

806
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:07,428
it's all about just finding the rhythm

807
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:08,658
it's all about finding the groove and it

808
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:09,980
takes you a little bit of time and

809
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:12,860
experience to get in there and do it

810
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:15,470
also these are buds these are precious

811
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:17,689
to people I've been in this industry for

812
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,490
a long time I can grab a flowering plant

813
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,139
that's a few days in and just cut that

814
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,308
[ __ ] down and feel no remorse or

815
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:23,628
anything if that's what needed to happen

816
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:25,759
in a commercial grow

817
00:25:23,628 --> 00:25:26,868
I killed a plant a lot of people treat

818
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,639
little buds like they're the most

819
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:30,439
precious thing they've ever seen which I

820
00:25:28,638 --> 00:25:32,778
respect you don't get to grow a bunch of

821
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,210
plants I have produced over a ton of

822
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:36,319
cannabis in my life I am responsible for

823
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,389
a ton of cannabis but having been

824
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,668
produced a lot of people don't have that

825
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:42,319
under their belt so every bud is

826
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:44,899
precious to them they don't want to [ __ ]

827
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,579
up one single but I get that so when

828
00:25:44,898 --> 00:25:48,558
they're new at it they go really slow

829
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:50,148
especially a higher trimmer that is not

830
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,710
their product that is your bud that

831
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:53,449
they're playing with respect them for

832
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,360
taking their time and going slow with it

833
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:58,730
but also encourage them to go faster you

834
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,258
have to learn and go faster but people

835
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,909
like to go slow in the beginning because

836
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,710
they're playing with gold they don't

837
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:05,269
they're playing with a little pieces of

838
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,980
gold they got little babies in their

839
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:09,048
hand and they're new so they're kind of

840
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,519
intimidated so keep that in mind you'll

841
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:11,509
get faster as time goes on is what I'm

842
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,710
trying to say you guys you just need

843
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:14,118
some practice you'll become a good

844
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,069
trimmer if you want to become a good

845
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:18,048
trimmer and if you want to get your foot

846
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:20,960
in the door in the commercial marijuana

847
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:22,700
industry being a trimmer is probably the

848
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,409
number one way to get in the door

849
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,119
trimmers and bud tenders are how you get

850
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:28,580
started so trimming can be really

851
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:30,709
time-consuming and tedious but it is the

852
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:33,019
last step before you claim victory in

853
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,179
your garden if your garden is for sale

854
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:37,579
you're one step away from money if your

855
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,990
garden is for medicinal uses you're one

856
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:42,599
step away from feeling better

857
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,759
so trimming sucks but you're almost

858
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,349
there it's it's the hardest most

859
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,509
time-consuming tedious part in my

860
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:51,240
opinion it is my least favorite part but

861
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:53,009
it is one step away from sweet success

862
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,930
all right podcast rolled I hope this

863
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:56,730
trimming lesson made sense again the

864
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,830
only way to get good at trimming is to

865
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,089
get sticky and get some practice get in

866
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:01,799
there get your gloves dirty get your

867
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:03,509
scissors all sticky and start trimming

868
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,099
up some weed if you want to learn and

869
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:07,349

870
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,969

00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:12,990

paid content which will be bonus content

916
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,240
but this version of the podcast in this

917
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:44,220
format always will be free iTunes

918
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,230
stitcher and the YouTube channel as it

919
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,360
is will always be free I do this because

920
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,269
I love cannabis and I love you and I

921
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:53,129
want you to be able to medicate and

922
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:53,970
recreative esthe ways possible with the

923
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,070
highest quality

924
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,870
cleanest safest products available and I

925
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:59,519
think the only way you can do that is by

926
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:01,019
growing it yourself so I've got to teach

927
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,839
you how to do that so that you don't

928
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,819
have to rely on anybody else so my point

929
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,169
is that the podcast will be free but I

930
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:08,519
know there are people out there who

931
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,050
would like to contribute because they

932
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,099
emailed me and they said hey Jeff how

933
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:13,259
can we help you out

934
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:16,189
