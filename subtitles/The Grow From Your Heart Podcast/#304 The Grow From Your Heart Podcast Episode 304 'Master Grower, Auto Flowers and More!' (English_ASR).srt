55
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:07,359
heavy face hi I feel like my head got

56
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,969
slow it was like putting cinder blocks

57
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,710
on my brain anyway great concentrates

58
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:14,719
tastes great smells great and the dabs

59
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,189
were super super smooth I felt like I

60
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,319
took a little tiny dab and got a whole

61
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,000
bunch of smoke remember I was talking

62
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,699
about I go through those phases where I

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,229
can smoke super heavy and I don't get

64
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:25,699
lit and then I go through phases where I

65
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:28,219
can take a little tiny dad and I get

66
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:29,599
super wrecked the past few days have

67
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:32,030
been those phases where I could take a

68
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,889
little tiny bed and I get super duper

69
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,300
wreck that's been pretty nice kind of

70
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:37,459

118
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,799
goes we'll start from the day I went to

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,149
go buy it I walked into Best Buy

120
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,220
and I was like hey I've got this picture

121
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,509
of this computer on my screen I'd like

122
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,739
this please and I'm like oh give me a

123
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,269
few minutes I'll find that for you you

124
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:25,279
went to go find it and he came back with

125
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:27,019
a bewildered look on his face and he

126
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,399
said sir I hate to say this I can't find

127
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,079
that computer in my store and I was like

128
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,549
well I've got money I'd like to buy it

129
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,870
now if you've got it just to encourage

130
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,250
him you know like maybe he thought it

131
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,050
was just browsing or something to sort

132
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,610
of know I've got money I will take it if

133
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,129
you can find it I'm gonna look around

134
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,810
for a minute so I looked around and him

135
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,610
and another guy came up the other guy

136
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,839
can't claim to be the inventory manager

137
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,240
he's like sir we cannot find that

138
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,769
computer here but we can order it for

139
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,990
you so they ordered it in from another

140
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:52,549
store and they also gave me a pretty fat

141
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,319
discount for making me wait around and

142
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,419
having to look for it so I got a nice

143
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,930
deal they ordered the computer they told

144
00:04:56,418 --> 00:05:02,120
me it would be here on Thursday

145
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,550
Wednesday night at 8:55 I got an email

146
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,870
saying hey your computer is available

147
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,728
the shitty part about that is the store

148
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,228
closed at 9 o'clock and it's about 20

149
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:10,668
minutes away from my house so it was

150
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:12,199
kind of just a big tease they're like

151
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:13,399
hey your computer is in here you can

152
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,199
come stare at it through the window if

153
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,788
you'd like but that's the best you can

154
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,439
do tonight so I do wait till the next

155
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:20,509
day of course I had to work all day I

156
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,100
kept saying it's I would like to leave a

157
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:24,439
little bit early I would like to leave

158
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,879
just a little bit early but I I'm the

159
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,410
manager I can usually make that happen

160
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,689
but fate was just not letting it happen

161
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,300
everything needed my attention so I had

162
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:34,069
to work a little extra late that day but

163
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,270
I did get off work and I did make it to

164
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:37,370
Best Buy and here's the part you guys

165
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,439
want to hear I walked into Best Buy and

166
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,538
I said hey I'm here to pick up my

167
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,978
computer and she said you have an ID and

168
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:45,560
I showed her my ID and she turned around

169
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:47,089
and she picked up a box off of the

170
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,978
counter and she set it down and she said

171
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:50,449
have a good day sir and I walked out

172
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:52,279
with my computer there were no problems

173
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,589
there were no issues I did not have to

174
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,819
act a fool I got to high-five the guy on

175
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:57,288
the way on I drove home and played with

176
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:59,029
my new computer so I got the new MacBook

177
00:05:57,288 --> 00:06:01,430

179

181

thank you let's move on with the podcast

201
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,779
ladies and gentlemen I have got an email

202
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:48,339
from a friend of ours it's kind of a

203
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,779
long email I'm not going to read the

204
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:52,119
whole thing on the air a lot of it was

205
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,529
just kind of a personal thing to me he

206
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,060
asked a couple of questions that don't

207
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:57,399
need to be read on the air but there is

208
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,780
part that I want to put on the show so

209
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,310
I'm gonna start from the beginning and

210
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:02,288
then we'll get to the part I want to

211
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,240
talk about it goes a lot like this Ross

212

218
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,348
being such a great resource I'm emailing

219
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,000
you to ask you a question and maybe a

220
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:20,680
favor God knows you don't owe me

221
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,180
anything and you have no idea who I

222
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,650
really am but I'll try to keep this

223
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,168
short and maybe let you know where I'm

224
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,818
coming from he says if you refer to my

225
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:29,589
previous previous email I'm from

226
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,770
Albuquerque New Mexico and a big fan of

227
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:34,689
the podcast and your art recently I have

228
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:37,120
acquired my medical marijuana card in

229
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:39,069
New Mexico and I'm fully legal what a

230
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,750
difference in feeling it is what a

231
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:42,370
difference in feeling it is to walk out

232
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,189
of a shop and know I'm not a criminal in

233
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,718
the eyes of the law and that is such a

234
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:49,180
huge feeling I remember that the first

235
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:50,528
time I went to go buy medical marijuana

236
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,269
and I walked out of the place and I was

237
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:54,069
like dude you just walked out to the

238
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:55,750
weed place loud and proud with weed and

239
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,129
everyone knows that's the weed place and

240
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,500
you're walking to you and I had to like

241
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,908
call myself down and think oh yeah it's

242
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,829
the weed store and you got a weed card

243
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:04,329
in your pocket you can do this it is

244
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:06,699
such a great feeling it's almost surreal

245
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:07,839
the first couple of times

246
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:09,218
and then that first time that you're

247
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,779
driving and you got your weed in the car

248
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:11,709
and the cops get behind you and you're

249
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,809
like oh [ __ ]

250
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:15,489
and you go oh wait never mind and all

251
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,778
your worries go away because the only

252
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,939
thing I used to do that would get me in

253
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:21,339
trouble is have some herb in the car now

254
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:23,199
I'm totally golden alright the email

255
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:24,908
goes on he says I had never cared much

256
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,249
for being legal and always feared being

257
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:28,990
on in the system or on some sort of the

258
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:31,539
list I'm also not your stereotypical

259
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,158
stoner nothing against my stoner bros

260
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:35,370
but I do not fit the mold and people

261
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,599
generally assume I do not partake

262
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,879
contrary to this belief however I am

263
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,769
highly knowledgeable cannabis and I have

264
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:43,958
consumed countless hours of content and

265
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:46,570
research I've been a closeted activist

266
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,819
and a literal closeted glower grower for

267
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,670
a very long time Rasta Jeff you have

268
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,470
inspired me I am 33 and I money and I am

269
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:55,629
a new father and I'm a full-time

270
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,399
employee of the local university after

271
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:58,778
going through some complications with my

272
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,399
son's birth and having a small

273
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:02,409
interaction with child services

274
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,809
I've become fully motivated in becoming

275
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:07,719
a positive face in the cannabis movement

276
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:09,399
hey thank you for uh for joining us so

277
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,990
strongly I appreciate that thank you for

278
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,778
becoming a face in the cannabis movement

279
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,850
we need more articulate ah strong-minded

280
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:17,740
people like yourself joining this

281
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,810
movement so thanks for jumping in with

282
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,759
us he also says nothing negative came

283
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,169
from this interaction but I came out of

284
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,689
it with a better understanding of the

285
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:27,759
laws point of view I've held myself back

286
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,560
and I feel I have kept my talents and my

287
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,309
heart to myself and I am ready to

288
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:36,159
fulfill my destiny so to speak so here

289
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:38,859
is my question I said I had for you he

290
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:42,669
asks what qualifies someone to be a

291
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:45,970
master grower I mean he also says for

292
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:48,750
lack of better term um bets I kind of

293
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,509
want to jump off on a rant right there

294
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,240
in Colorado the term master grower is a

295
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:56,459
huge joke it's one of the most cringy

296
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,379
terms or words or phrases you could

297
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:01,309
throw out in the cannabis industry right

298
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:04,800
now anybody that's been growing cannabis

299
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,849
for quite a while before this medical

300
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,549
marijuana movement

301
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,329
cringes at the phrase master grower

302
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:13,639
technically

303
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:16,248
master grower simply means that you are

304
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:18,169
the boss of the cultivation facility you

305
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:20,569
were the lead grower it is another term

306
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:22,399
for lead grower I wish everybody would

307
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:25,488
just change their badge from master

308
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,789
grower to lead grower or cultivation

309
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:30,798
director or a cultivation manager or

310
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:33,259
something just a little less douchey and

311
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:34,730
egotistical sounding is calling yourself

312
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:36,079
a master grower is like saying that

313
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,489
you're the black belt that you have got

314
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,628
all of the knowledge that you were the

315
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:40,160
champion that you get a head kick

316
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:43,759
everybody that you know all the forms

317
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:48,319
all the tricks and a lot of us are not

318
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:50,360
masters I am the most qualified

319
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,820
most experienced grower at my facility

320
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,879
which makes me the cultivation leader or

321
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,250
the cultivation director but a lot of

322
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,470
people so technically it's a position

323
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,830
technically it's a title it's a stamp on

324
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:08,110
your paycheck position

325
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:10,000
master grower culturally and societally

326
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,710
it is more of a joke nobody takes you

327
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,080
seriously if you say I'm the master

328
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,820
grower so that's just something I want

329
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,280
to touch on here in Colorado the phrase

330
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,629
master grower is kind of a joke but you

331
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,250
don't mean it in that way you're asking

332
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:23,259
what does it take to be a master grower

333
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,090
and then you even said for example or

334
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:26,889
lack of better term you just want to

335
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,810
know what it takes to be at that level

336
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,220
and he says I refer to myself as a

337
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:32,319
humble green thumb and I'm not very

338
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,420
outspoken about my talent but the proof

339
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,580
is in my pudding I'm grounded in

340
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:38,620
caregiving and I follow exactly in line

341
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,070
with your thinking so what do you call a

342
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:45,580
guy like me all right I call a guy like

343
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:49,330
you a cultivation manager a cultivation

344
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:51,370
director now if you want to be a master

345
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,740
grower and the terms and the not douchey

346
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:56,289
terms in the terms of a blackbelt grower

347
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,620
as in the terms of a cultivation manager

348
00:11:56,289 --> 00:12:01,779
what you need is cultivation experience

349
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,980
you definitely need cultivation

350
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,959
experience you have to be able to look

351
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,120
at plants and say that plants too wet

352
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,310
that plan is too dry that is powdery

353
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,750
mildew that is spider mite damage those

354
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,399
plants are too close together those

355
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,379
plants are too far apart that light is

356
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,689
too close to those plants you have to be

357
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:18,549
able to identify what's going on with

358
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,700
the plants what is going on with the

359
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:25,359
room you have to identify things on the

360
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,730
fly every day at a rapid pace you have

361
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,430
to be able to think and adjust and adapt

362
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,009
you have to know you have to keep track

363
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:34,750
of 20 different rooms and know how much

364
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:36,460
water has gone in each room for the past

365
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,080
couple of days you have to be able to

366
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,210
manage people you have to have an eye

367
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,310
for detail you have to have a passion

368
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,379
you have to be there and you have to

369
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:46,629
give a [ __ ] that's what you need to be

370
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:49,000
the master grower it sounds like you

371
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,649
possess all of these qualities don't be

372
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,389
in too much of a hurry to call yourself

373
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:54,490
a master grower keep calling yourself

374
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:57,189
the humble green thumb because those are

375
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,330
the best master growers the humble green

376
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,610
thumbs are the guys that should be

377
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,860
running the large facilities you know

378
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,320
what to do you can go to certain pace

379
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,120
where you work fast enough but you don't

380
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,700
rush through anything you get everything

381
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,799
done without screwing up you don't drag

382
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,990
your feet you can lead the other people

383
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:16,349
to keep them going at a fast pace you

384
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,180
can make a plan you can make a schedule

385
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,800
and you can encourage your team to do

386
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,870
what needs to be done in a timely manner

387
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,969
and keep it fun and have everybody

388
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,279
motivated and Curt and encouraged and

389
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,560
still get all of the [ __ ] done and break

390
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,959
a sweat and at the end of the day

391
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,519
everybody is proud of what they did so

392
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,410
it sounds like you could do that that's

393
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,240
what a master grower needs to do in a

394
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:38,399
large cultivation facility it's

395
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,039
basically the same thing that any other

396
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,709
boss needs to do in any position plus

397
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,149
you have to have specialized skills for

398
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,370
your industry which is cannabis

399
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:49,590
knowledge now you have to have knowledge

400
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,210
all the way through the process you have

401
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,500
to know how to cut a clone and you have

402
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,960
to know how to get it all the way to the

403
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,529
store so knowledge of the full cannabis

404
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,629
grow cycle is necessary knowledge of how

405
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:03,629
to identify and manage pests is

406
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:05,580
necessary and diseases all the plant

407
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:09,200
stuff also you have to be able to pay

408
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:11,879
attention to electrical HVAC plumbing

409
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,820
also you have to manage employees also

410
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,100
you have to communicate between the

411
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,620
employees and ownership and whoever else

412
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:23,040
you may have i've got contractors in the

413
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,259
grower or in the grow on average three

414
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,730
days a week if it's not an electrician a

415
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:30,000
plumber um

416
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,560
maybe an HVAC guy if not the Department

417
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,870
of Agriculture or the Department of

418
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,009
Health there's somebody coming in to do

419
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,409
something you have to be able to

420
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:39,938
communicate with all different types of

421
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,558
personalities

422
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:42,879
you have to be able to give instructions

423
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:45,488
you have to be able to deal with

424
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,048
employees that kind of don't follow

425
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:48,309
instructions properly you have to be

426
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:50,798
able to correct things you have to be

427
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:52,478
able to document things you have to be

428
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:55,418
able to give praise you have to learn

429
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:57,519
how to separate your dab time and your

430
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:59,558
work time and your friendship and your

431
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,688
management from your co-workers because

432
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:03,278
once we go to lunch I take off the

433
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:05,259
nametag and we're friends we're gonna

434
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,609
take some dabs we're gonna hang out even

435
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:08,318
if you're the employee that [ __ ]

436
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,799
everything up all day when we go to

437
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:10,418
lunch

438
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:11,739
we're friends we're gonna be cool you

439
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:13,720
have to learn how to keep that balance

440
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:15,129
you have to be able to discipline your

441
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,449
friends you have to be able to fire and

442
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:19,418
write your friends up when the time

443
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:20,918
comes so those are things like any job

444
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:24,038
they are going to be part of being a

445
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:25,418
master grower but the way you are trying

446
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:27,098
to be qualified it sounds like you were

447
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:29,348
doing it you love the plant you have

448
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:31,089
passion you have an intention for detail

449
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:33,278
and you care about what you're doing and

450
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,229
it sounds like since you work with a

451
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,698
university you are able to communicate

452
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:38,889
and through the email you sent you can

453
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:40,389
certainly communicate so that's

454
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:42,788
basically what it takes to be a master

455
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:45,220
grower you continue to be the humble

456
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:47,528
green thumb and you will find a position

457
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,849
as a master grower I'm gonna keep

458
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:50,109
reading a little bit of the email and

459
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:51,369
then we're gonna cut it out short

460
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:53,079
because some of this was just for me

461
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,428
like I said he said what do you call a

462
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,769
guy like me I call you a passionate

463
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:58,058
grower I call you highly qualified I

464
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:01,119
call you somebody that respect as a

465
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:02,708
grower he goes on to say I have worked

466
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:04,778
with both small personal and large

467
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,488
commercial grows I have listened to

468
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:08,828
every girl from your heart episode as

469
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:10,899
well as all of the cannabis growing and

470
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:13,178
culture podcasts available on my iPhone

471
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:14,948
I follow and watch with all I follow and

472
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:17,730
watch all of the very best no-till and

473
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:19,889
sustainable growers I have found

474
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,990
and then he goes on to say that he's got

475
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,759
all this cannabis knowledge and skills

476
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,680
but nothing to show for it except for a

477
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,439
few jars of quality medicine and his

478
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,198
Irie feelings ah unfortunately a lot of

479
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,430
people fill feel that way in this

480
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,338
industry and when you're trying to get

481
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:36,229
into this industry

482
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,759
you can't bring your product to the

483
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,769
dispensary to show at least in Colorado

484
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,240
it's illegal to show up with product you

485
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:43,009
can't come to an interview with product

486
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,919
you're in New Mexico you've got

487
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:47,300
different rules there you can probably

488
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,039
bring in your product I don't know but

489
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,269

587
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,549
becoming a better grower you're building

588
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:03,170
your resume one thing you should do

589
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:06,349
while you're in these facilities is

590
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,820
write down everything you learn if you

591
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:09,589

592
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:12,169

594
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,580

595
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,990
resume if you can drive a scissor lift

596
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:20,240
now because you worked in a cultivation

597
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,829
facility put that on your resume if you

598
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,750
can drive us is her lift or a forklift

599
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:25,699
it makes you much more hireable for my

600
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,049
facility because we get deliveries we

601
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,549
need the forklift if there's a guy that

602
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:29,809
can't drive the forklift or there's no

603
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,909
that no one there they can drive the

604
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,169
forklift that [ __ ] stays on the truck

605
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,029
and the truck drives away and comes back

606
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,289
when it can so if you were able to

607
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:38,210
operate a forklift you're much more

608
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:39,920
hireable all the scissor lifts we got to

609
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,750
change bulbs the guy that knows how to

610
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,310
use the scissor lifts we call him in he

611
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,380
gets extra hours you can drive that says

612
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,549
you lift put up the bulbs so that kind

613
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,620
of stuff helps right

614
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:50,869
everything you do and then you will get

615
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:53,149
to be the master grower in a facility in

616
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:55,009
this email he mentions our friend

617
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,720
mentions that he was offered a job but

618
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:58,490
the place does not grow from their heart

619
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,380
so he's going to be patient and try to

620
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,599
find himself a job that meets his

621
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,160
standards I applaud you for that I

622
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:06,019
applaud you for not compromising your

623
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,370
standards just for employment in the

624
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:08,509
industry you want to work in that means

625
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:10,309
that you're gonna grow from your heart

626
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:12,529
that when you do find a facility that

627
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:13,549
appreciates your heart and your care for

628
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:15,859
the plant that you're gonna give them

629
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:18,680
your all so be patient keep looking

630
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:21,589
until you find a facility that does work

631
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,440

662
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:33,720
with humans there's no way to make an

663
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:36,029
impression online unless your resume is

664
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,370
super dope and they see we see so many

665
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:41,789
resumes but honestly we think the super

666
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:44,750
dope ones are fake so go there let the

667

people see who you are

668
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,950
you may not if you fit if they see you

669
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,450

670
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,799
person that would fit in with our crew

671
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,269

672
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:54,409
out with Jeff after work and they look

673
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:58,339

00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:17,529
OTO flowers outdoors to maximize the

779
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,690

788
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:38,889
discussion could you also cover OTO

789
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:40,990
flowers I really don't grow or mess with

790
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,659
OTO flowers I don't have a lot of

791
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,579
experience you said you were interested

792
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:47,530
in doing OTO flowers outdoors to

793
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:50,319
maximize the number of harvests per year

794
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:52,329
what do I think I think that everything

795
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,359
I know about OTO flowers that is the

796
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:57,759
perfect reason for OTO flower seeds a

797
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,678
lot of people hate on feminized seeds a

798
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:03,009
lot of people have hatred for OTO flower

799
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,950
seeds I believe that everything has its

800
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:08,609
application and your purpose is the

801
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,500
perfect application for OTO flower seeds

802
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:13,418
you can maximize your number of harvests

803
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,579
outdoors because you don't have to have

804
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:18,580
a veg time so it's beautiful I think

805
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:20,558
that your intention is going to work

806
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:23,619
perfectly with OTO flowers you're gonna

807
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:26,769
get what you want um there was a large

808
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:28,418
bust in southern Colorado just about 45

809
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:31,960
minutes south of me there's a National

810
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:35,220
Forest and a cartel had set up an

811
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,409
illegal grow in that National Forest

812
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,860
they were growing cannabis on a large

813
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:43,140
scale and when they got caught it was

814
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,869
not the right season for cannabis to be

815
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,520
flowering

816
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:49,129
the pictures that they showed were

817
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,950
straight-up flowering plants and fields

818
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,570
of plants in different stages

819
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,710
and me and my we'd head friends were

820
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:56,000
sitting here watching the news and

821
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,579
looking at the pictures gonna wait a

822
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,769
minute how did they do that because it's

823
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:02,359
if you know about growing cannabis it's

824
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:05,000
an annual plant you put it outside and

825
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:07,428
it flowers because of the Sun cycle

826
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,288
because of the night cycle so all of the

827
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:10,970
plants are outside how are some of them

828
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:12,440
flowered this far how are some of them

829
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,690
flowered this barn how are some of them

830
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,460
still in veg and then it dawned on me

831
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,509
they're using [ __ ] Otto flowers and

832
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,278
they're just plotting different size

833
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:21,379
plots so they've got a perpetual grow

834
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,929
happening with Otto flowers on other

835
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:28,610
people's property on the national forest

836
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:30,320
land so yes it is very very feasible and

837
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:32,599
that is a very good idea that is a very

838
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,668
good application that's honestly the

839
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,439
best application for Otto flowers is to

840
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:38,389
run them outdoors so that you can

841
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,730
maximize the number of harvest outdoors

842
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:42,048
I hope the Otto flowers work for you I

843
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,669
hope you're able to maximize your

844
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:45,918
harvests I hope you're able to get some

845
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:47,299
high potency Otto flowers the only

846
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,549
downside to Otto flowers is that you

847
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:51,528
have to keep buying new seeds hopefully

848
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:54,230
the cost of not having to veg them and

849
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:56,298
the opportunity to maximize the number

850
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,250
of harvests offsets the price of having

851
00:28:56,298 --> 00:29:00,079
to buy new seeds for every run because

852
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,669
that's the only the only catch there is

853
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,928
if you weren't running Otto flowers you

854
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:04,190
could just cut clones and put more out

855
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:05,298
there but they need have to veg them and

856
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,100
you have to have space and you have to

857
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:10,609
have a mom plant so what you're doing is

858
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:12,918
perfect I have no problems with your use

859
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:15,319
of Otto flowers and I'm usually kind of

860
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:17,059
a hater on Otto flower seeds so dude

861

frequent harvests and it's all gonna be

871
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:38,898

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,788
details but you uh you asked if this was

884
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,970

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,909
this next email this next email comes

890
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,619
from somebody who's very smart because

891
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:16,200
they said right away if this makes it to

892
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:18,148
the podcast please don't read my name

893
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,788
but I will read the subject it says

894
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:22,379
happy st. Patty's Day from Ireland

895
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:24,390
ladies and gentlemen we've got listeners

896
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,769
in Ireland a big shout out to everybody

897
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,139
out there in Ireland listening to the

898
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:29,940
podcast I do not know the rules on

899
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:32,189
cannabis in Ireland although I would

900
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,360
assume they do not tolerate cannabis

901
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,110
they don't seem like they take much

902
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,418
[ __ ]

903
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:38,519
seems like a place that if you fall out

904
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,649
of line you will quickly be put back in

905
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,899
line so be careful if you're growing

906
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:44,158
consuming or possessing or even talking

907
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:45,509
about cannabis in Ireland

908
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,370

909
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:49,950
curious what's it like what's the

910
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:51,928

926
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:24,089
grower given we are deep in prohibition

927
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:26,100
land the first few steps on the road to

928
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:28,199
medical have been taken in Ireland but

929
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:29,990
nothing approaching freedom yet but we

930
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,240
really enjoyed the grow episodes in

931
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:35,339
particular he also says I'm currently

932
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,558
smoking some UK cheese but missing the

933
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:39,569
quality of flour I enjoyed in California

934
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:41,308
he said they were smoking orange aka

935
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:43,798
from harvest off mission in San

936
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:45,599
Francisco and Green crack from kind love

937
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:47,889
and Denver where our favorite flowers we

938
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,750
tried

939
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:51,700
that green crack from kind love is a

940
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,769
great product I actually know the

941
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,230
consultant that set that grow up and I

942
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:58,869
have got this same clone of that green

943
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:01,539
crack in my garden at Three Rivers and

944
00:31:58,869 --> 00:32:03,489
it is a great cut so that is quality

945
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:05,589
product kind love is one of my favorite

946
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,920
dispensaries in Denver if I were going

947
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:10,839
to go shopping so I'm not bashing kind

948
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,370
love they are kind of a premium

949
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:14,230
dispensary they've got some of the

950
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:16,239
higher prices but they've also got some

951
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,309
of the better products if I'm looking to

952
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,720
spend money for cannabis for a concert

953
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:21,940
and I haven't had a harvest in a while

954
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,819
kind love is one of the few places I

955
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,680
consider shopping also of course Three

956
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,879
Rivers because I grow that product but

957
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,180
if I'm looking to spend too much money

958
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,280
kind of love is where I go anyway he

959
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:36,130
says we didn't get around to dabs yet

960
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,200
too much gear to sort for tourists yeah

961
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:39,970
I totally understand that the next time

962
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,529
you're in Colorado let me know I've got

963
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,000
all of the gear you won't have to sort

964
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:44,259
any of it and you won't feel like a

965
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,180
tourist you'll feel like you're right at

966
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:47,910

967

968
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:52,540

00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:11,369
podcast right now it's even more neat

978
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:13,569
knowing that you were unable to

979
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:15,699
participate in what I'm teaching you

980
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:17,619
can't grow it's probably hard to consume

981
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,870
there you're taking the first steps

982
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:21,609
toward medical but it's extra neat to

983
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:23,409
know that you're listening even though

984
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:24,939
you can't do it I'm saying you're kind

985
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,100
of living out the dream vicariously

986
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,630
probably a little bit but you're still

987
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:29,740
enjoying the show even though you aren't

988
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:32,140
able to practice what you're being

989
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,579
taught which means I'm entertaining you

990
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,770
and keeping your attention enough to

991
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:37,659
keep you here even though you can't do

992
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:39,250
the stuff that means a lot to me so

993
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,170
thank you for the huge compliment I hope

994

you go annoy your mom for me that sounds

995
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:46,180
great and when you do get some dabs take

996
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:48,609

997
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:51,039
