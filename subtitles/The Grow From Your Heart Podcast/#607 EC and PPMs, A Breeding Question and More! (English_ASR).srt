about i got a lot of comments and

81
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,679
messages lately

82
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,599
about how many times am i going to

83
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,560
adjust this microphone during the

84
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,280
podcast

85
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,640
the answer is as many as i need to i've

86
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,239
got notes on a computer

87
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,839
i've got notes on paper i've got

88
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,878
headphones on i can hear exactly what's

89
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,959
going on in the show

90
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,560
i'm doing microphone adjustments based

91
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,840
on where i'm looking i'm getting the mic

92
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,920
out of my field of view

93
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,200
but as i change my position of my face i

94
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,199
want to move the mic as close to my

95
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,719
mouth as i can to keep it sounding good

96
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,318
trying to be a professional broadcaster

97
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,318
that's why i got the fancy mic arm so i

98
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,679
can keep this bad dog right on my face

99
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,000
so how many times am i going to move

100
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,519
this mic as many as i [ __ ] need to

101
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,199
i'm going to make the show sound good if

102
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,080
it drives you crazy i do apologize but

103
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,759
i'm trying to keep it

104
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,120
uh when i read the computer i need it

105
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,399
kind of here when i read the paper i got

106
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,080
to move it lower to get it out of the

107
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
out of the view of the paper so that's

108
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,519
what's happening i'm not completely

109
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,759
crazy just a little bit like i said in a

110
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,920
previous episode my mother had me tested

111
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,280
we know i'm not crazy anyway that's why

112
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,399
i'm adjusting the mic so

113
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,878
uh erratically there is a method to my

114
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,879
mic

115
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,399
adjusting madness sorry if it drives you

116
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:14,959
crazy trying to get it out of my field

117
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,640
of view

118
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
also try to keep myself i can hear

119
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,679
exactly how much of me is coming through

120
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,878
these headphones i notice when i talk

121
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
right here it sounds real good you get

122
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,199
it about here it kind of fade off a

123
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,959
little bit so

124
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,479
that's why i'm playing with the mic so

125
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,878
much you can tell the mic arm needs a

126
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,359
little

127
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,359
i need some viagra or some tightening

128
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,879
it's getting a little droopy today

129
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,640
this show is not brought to you by

130
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,239
bluetooth so we won't go there

131
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,199
let me get myself back on track what are

132
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,719
we going to do with this part of the

133
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,518
show this is where we are going to work

134
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,158
into the

135
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,799
emails and patreon messages part of the

136
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,039
show

137
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
the first question on today's episode

138
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,639
came from the grow

139
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,519
help tab on the irie genetics website

140
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,878
that's right if you go to my website

141
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,280
iriegenetics.com you will find a grow

142
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:55,518
help

143
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,959
tab on that tab if you click there you

144
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,120
will be asked i think we determined

145
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,319
there are 16 preliminary questions we

146
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,920
ask your name

147
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,438
what name to use on the podcast if i

148
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,238
give you a shout out we ask what strain

149
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:05,919
you're growing

150
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
then we ask a few details about the grow

151
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,318
then we allow you to ask a question

152
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,680
about your grow so this first question

153
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,479
came from the grow help tab

154
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,079
on iregenetics.com and it goes a lot

155
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,279

calmag micro grow bloom

169
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,039
cool bloom floralicious plus diamond

170
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,519
next

171
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,040
diamond nectar and black strap molasses

172
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,359
that is a lot of nutrients

173
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
um that's a lot of nutrients in one feed

174
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,160
it says the ph of the last feeding was

175
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,160
6.0

176
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,280
i would bring that up to at least six

177
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
two maybe six

178
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,879
four uh somewhere in that range would be

179
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,399
uh better for your plants to absorb and

180
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,319
uptake some of those nutrients

181
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,519
the ppm or the ec of the last feeding

182
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,800
was 600 that's

183
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,159
uh with all those nutrients in there

184
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
that may be acceptable there was a lot

185
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,720
of [ __ ] in there though but you didn't

186
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,038
use a lot of it it looks like

187
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,080
the daytime temperature is 75 to 78

188
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,519
which is acceptable nighttime temps

189
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,319
70-72 here is where we get to the

190
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,279
question or

191
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,639
problem part of this message it says hey

192
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,918
ross to jeff i just want to thank you

193

you for thanking me that is like

197
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,038
recharge

198
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,478
uh you're giving me a little nutrients

199
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,038
here to keep me going so thank you for

200
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:32,959
that

201
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,800
it says last year i grew your orange

202
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,319
gasm which were some really great

203
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,439
genetics thank you that is one of my

204
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,038
favorite plants

205
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,759
it's really fun to grow i recommend that

206
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,680
for everybody growers of all skill level

207
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,919
all environments the orange gasm is a

208
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,519
champ i'm glad it went well for you

209
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,519
it said the smell was so sweet and the

210
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,680
plant structure was phenomenal

211
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,599
topped and scrogged that is a resilient

212
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,038
plant you can top it you can scrog it

213
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,879
you can let it grow with the giant glory

214
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,120
cola it does a lot of great [ __ ]

215
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,319
it goes on to say i'm now growing your

216
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,399
leonardo

217
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,720
to hopefully get some more color in the

218
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,399
garden i'm in week three of flour and

219
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,919
the tips of my leaves are slightly

220
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,079
discolored and burnt

221
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,399
i feed with every watering i feed one

222
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,279
gallon at 600 ppms every other day with

223
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,599
25

224
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,359
runoff so i was wondering if i should do

225
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
one of these three options

226
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,120
so the problem is that the leaf tips are

227
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
getting a little bit burnt i call that

228
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,199
getting your nails done

229
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,560
if you picture the leave as a giant hand

230
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,680
the fingernail tips they're getting a

231
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,959
little bit done they're just starting to

232
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
get their nails painted

233
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,560
that is a sign that you may be feeding

234
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,639
just a little bit too much

235
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,240
or is that the sign that you're pushing

236
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,400
them just enough that's the decision you

237
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,720
need to make does it look problematic

238
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,000
or is it like um like if you look at an

239
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,520
athlete and they're like sweating and

240
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
they look like they need a [ __ ] break

241
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,680
do your plants look like they're getting

242
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,639
worked out and they're right at the

243
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,560
point of like oh

244
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
feel the burn or are they like oh [ __ ]

245
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,598
feel the burn which one is it

246
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,360
that's the decision you need to make

247
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,478
there uh so they're getting their nails

248
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
done

249
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,758
one thing i did notice is that's a lot

250
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,279
of nutrients and you are feeding

251
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,439
uh you're in week three of flour and

252
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,519
you're feeding the grow and bloom

253
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,719
i don't know enough about the gh flora

254
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,519
series to know

255
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,599
if the grow and bloom are both required

256
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,399
but i wouldn't assume with most

257
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,879
lines that by week 3 they would ask you

258
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,519
to use the grow bottle and the bloom

259
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,199
bottle

260
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,879
you may be doubling up on some things

261
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,919
you may be getting more nitrogen than

262
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,399
necessary

263
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,839
but big disclaimer i don't know this

264
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,239
nutrient line i don't know their

265
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,239
nutrient calculator so if it says to use

266
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,319
the grow along with the bloom do that

267
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,918
but by now in most lines i would have

268
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,360
abandoned that grow nutrient we don't

269
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,120
need this much nitrogen

270
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,560
you may be doubling up on phosphorus and

271
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,240
potassium and getting

272
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,319
a whole lot of nitrogen which you don't

273
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
need so that may be one thing you could

274
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,039
adjust

275
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
just from reading your list of nutrients

276
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,079
i don't know that i would

277
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
feed them that many things all at once

278
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,159
if you're feeding multiple times a week

279
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,839
i would go with your base nutrients your

280
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,599
calmag maybe the armor sci

281
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,679
every time and then i would switch up

282
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,159
like the cool bloom and the floralicious

283
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
i would do those on different days uh

284
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,039
but that that's what i would do

285
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,639
if it's working for you bro you keep

286
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,318
doing your thing i'm just saying that's

287
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,478
a lot of [ __ ] to feed it all at one time

288
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,919
even though your ppms are only 600

289
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,000
it still seems like a lot of things to

290
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,478
go in there in one day i'm gonna get on

291
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to the

292
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,000
uh three options which you have

293
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,639
presented which uh you think may help

294
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,800
cure

295
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,400
your uh nails from getting too burnt it

296
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,000
says i was wondering if i should do one

297
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,918
of these three options should i keep

298
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,598
feeding as i've been doing

299
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,279
if the plants don't look like they are

300
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,319
super distressed if they're just getting

301
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,239
their nails done

302
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,598
you're pushing them right to the limit

303
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,719
you're going to get a huge

304
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,080
fat harvest super fat chunky buds don't

305
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
push them too hard

306
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,919
keep doing what you're doing and as long

307
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,439
as you flush properly and cure and dry

308
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,319
them properly they should taste good at

309
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,159
the end

310
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,320
the other option is feed with have

311
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,159
strength ppms once or twice to do a

312
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,760
light flush of the cocoa

313
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,039
uh you're in coco so um just one quick

314
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,319
flush would be enough and i would

315
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,000
probably do

316
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,440
i wouldn't even do half strength ppms

317
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that's not even a flush that's just a

318
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,560
weak feed i would just do water one time

319
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,278
until you get like 20 to that 20 runoff

320
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,799
is fair

321
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,879
which i don't know that that's necessary

322
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,079
unless they're really getting cooked

323
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,919
then it says feed only once or twice uh

324
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,560
feed only water once or twice to flush

325
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,838
the cocoa

326
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,599
yeah if you're gonna do a flush don't

327
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,760
put any nutrients in there

328
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,360
that's just uh i don't know it's what's

329
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,720
the word they're counter productive

330
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,080
you're trying to flush and you're giving

331
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
it nutrients at the same time so that's

332
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,200
not gonna help you

333
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,278
i would go with either option number one

334
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,399
or option number two keep feeding as you

335
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,480
have been

336
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,600
maybe no excuse me for that i'm not even

337
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,000
going to edit that

338
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,519
maybe spread out the feedings give like

339
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,958
i said give one bottle on one day and

340
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,959
the other bottle the next day

341
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,439
but with your ppms being at 600 of your

342
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,559
ec uh ppm zcc being at 600 i think

343
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,120
you're going to be okay with what you're

344
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,039
doing

345
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,720
so just pay attention to those leaves

346
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,039
maybe reduce the feeding just a little

347
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,639
bit

348
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,799
maybe separate some of the bottles on

349
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,639
different days but as long as the plants

350
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,000
aren't looking pissed off

351
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,759
keep doing what you're doing if they do

352
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,480
get too pissed off reduce the feeding a

353
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,080
little bit

354
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,759
if they stop eating if they look like

355
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,399
they've stalled out on you that's when i

356
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,559
would give them

357
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,639
one flush and i would use i think the

358
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,159
armor don't use the armor sci

359
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,759
i don't see an enzyme product in here i

360
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,399
would flush one time with an enzymatic

361
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,480
product

362
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,799
and then i would continue to feed

363
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,399
instead of 600 ppms maybe hit 500 and

364
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,159
see how they respond to that but i think

365
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,159
your plants are going to be okay

366
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,000
unless this burn is getting really

367
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,559
really ridiculous i would continue

368
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
to do what you're doing said also if you

369
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,599
can bring sean or one of the organic

370
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,919
guys back on the show again

371
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,200
uh from the beginning uh we would love

372
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,838
we would be awesome we'd love to

373
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,120
eventually give organic growing a try

374
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,959
i would love to get some of the more

375
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
organic guys on the show

376
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,239
uh also make sure you check out

377
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,800
embracing organics if you're not already

378
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,680
watching the embracing organics podcast

379
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:44,000
we they talk a lot about organic growing

380
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,879
embracing organics is a cannabis growing

381
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,480
podcast

382
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:51,200
it is live on youtube uh it is 7 p.m

383
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,200
mountain time on thursday that's when we

384
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,759
go live however the show is left up it

385
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,360
goes

386
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,799
up to youtube and stays up forever so

387
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,278
you can go to youtube right now

388
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,199
and search for embracing organics i am

389
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,559
not the host of the show i'm a guest a

390
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,920
panel member on the show

391
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,599
we bring on a lot of other people we

392
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,879
talk about organic growing we talk about

393
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,560
all types of growing

394
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,879
but you can learn a lot about organics

395
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,639
on the embracing organics podcast

396
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,000
and once we get some things settled in

397
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,759
with the pandemic and all this stuff i

398
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,399
do plan on adding another microphone to

399
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,078
the table

400
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,159
and we will get some folks to come talk

401
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,359
about organics we may just have to get

402
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,639
some people to zoom in if you're an

403
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,320
organic growing expert and you'd like to

404
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,838
be on a podcast send me an email

405

maybe include a picture send me an email

414
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,239
with a photo of these plants and we can

415
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
make better decisions on what to do

416
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,519
i'm sure you saw the last episode i

417
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,958
actually dropped a photo in to show you

418
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,480
the plant i was talking about

419
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,000
i'm trying to improve the show and that

420
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
is a great way to do it so send me some

421
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,958
pics

422
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,320
i'll put them in the podcast uh where do

423
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,799
we go from there i've got another great

424
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,200
message

425
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,199
this one says yo rasta jeff i'm really

426
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,040
enjoying the show even more so

427
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,200
since you switched to being on camera

428
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,000
instead of just having a static screen

429
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,519
podcast format thank you we've gone

430
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
through a couple of different iterations

431
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,120
of the video show now

432
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,320
we had the flag behind us in the old

433
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,839
crusty white wall

434
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,000
then we moved to the office where we had

435
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,839
the sneakers behind us now we got a new

436
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,120
painted set with a fresh new backdrop

437
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,639
and some brand new lighting

438
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,480
so thank you for noticing that i'm

439
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,680
making some improvement putting some

440
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,200
effort into the show

441
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,519
spending that patreon money here on the

442
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,720
podcast thank you for noticing that and

443
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,078
i'm glad it keeps your attention a

444
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,879
little bit better

445
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,479
it says i have a question about selfing

446
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,639
and of course selfing is when we

447
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,639
uh take a plant and we cut a clone of

448
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,480
that same plant we reverse one with a

449
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,159
silver thiosulfate solution

450
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,000
that plant will then create female

451
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,399
pollen you put that female pollen

452
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,078
on a clone of the same plant to make

453
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,679
seeds that are s-ones

454
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,359
that is selfing we're going to talk more

455
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,519
about that in the message but it says

456
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,680
i have a question about selfing if you

457
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,399
take a male and a female of the same

458
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,638
strain and you make seeds you get an f2

459
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,559
with a lot of variation right

460
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,639
that is accurate a male and a female of

461
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,278
the same strain you make seeds

462
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,480
you get an f2 with a lot of variation

463
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,360
that is accurate

464
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,000
whereas f or as s1 seeds this is where

465
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,079
we're gonna have some

466
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,440
some different conversation whereas with

467
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,679
s1 seeds

468
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,160
should show a lot less variation because

469
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,638
all of the genes are from the same plant

470
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,759
what if you grew out two females of the

471
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,879
same strain

472
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,200
from seed reverse one and breed them

473
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,799
will you get the same type of variation

474
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,639
as an f2 and would it be called an s2 or

475
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,838
would you just call them feminized

476
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,039
f2s thanks for all of the knowledge

477
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,399
thank you from spankynuts420 this is a

478
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,719
great question there are some things to

479
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,958
uh

480
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,320
to think about here so let's kind of

481
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,000
outline what he's trying to do here what

482
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,760
our listener is trying to ask about they

483
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,278
want to grow a pack of seeds

484
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,120
in that pack of seeds there are going to

485
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,039
be multiple phenotypes they want to find

486
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,879
a phenotype number one that's a female

487
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,799
and phenotype number two that's a female

488
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,320
they've got two different phenotypes so

489
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,919
that's a good start for this

490
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,639
uh what if we took two females at the

491
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,198
same strain reverse one of them

492
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,560
and then put the pollen on the other one

493
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,679
um

494
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,559
that is sort of an s2 now that i'm going

495
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,078
to call that an

496
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,319
r1 um that might be like an r1

497
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,439
inbred line i'm gonna call i don't know

498
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,278
what the official name for that is

499
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
because we don't do that nobody really

500
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,919
does that sort of stuff i've done

501
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,799
something like that and never knew what

502
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,000
to call it

503
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:30,479
uh it's not a self because in my

504
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,559
in my vocabulary the way that i see the

505
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,879
word self is it's got to be on

506
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,000
the same plan it's got to be a clone of

507
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,399
the same thing

508
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,278
so this is going to be an r1 but it's

509
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,480
going to be

510
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,198
i'm just going to pick a strain i'm

511
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,800
going to call it spanky's nuts 420 og

512
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,559
that's the strain we're working with

513
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,599
this is going to be a spanky's

514
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,359
nuts 420 og r1

515
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,120
it's a reversal because we used

516
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,480
technically two different plants they

517
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,320
may be the same

518
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,000
the same strain the same genetics the

519
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,800
same all that but they are different

520
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,799
phenotypes so we're going to see uh

521
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,159
different representations in the progeny

522
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,039
you're going to see a little bit of this

523
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,719
phenotype

524
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,078
and a little bit of this phenotype even

525
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,560
though they're the same strain

526
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,319
they are different plants it's like uh

527
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,838
it's like taking two different plants

528
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,079
they have the same parents so you're not

529
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,639
gonna see as much uh weird grandparent

530
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,719
expression you may see some crazy crazy

531
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,680
uh recessive great-grandparent genes

532
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,800
expressed in that

533
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:27,919
but um i don't think we would call that

534
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,240
an s2 i think that would be an r1 or

535
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,519
some sort of an r1 inbred project is

536
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,399
what that would be i would just call it

537
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,720
an r1

538
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,759
and explain to people i wouldn't label

539
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,720
it like uh

540
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,039
spanky's nuts 420 number one cross two

541
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,199
spanky's nuts 420 number two

542
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,639
uh and then just label it as an r1

543
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,120
because that is a reversal

544
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,360
i think that's the way we would do that

545
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,120
let me make sure i covered this question

546
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
let's see best ones would show a lot

547
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
less variation what if you grab two

548
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,278
females of the same strain reverse one

549
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,879
and breathe them well you get the same

550
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,159
type of variation all right

551
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,198
so um i think not as much variation as

552
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,838
the f2

553
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,599
because there aren't as many options um

554
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,880
with the f2 you know what the mom and

555
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,720
the dad are gonna look like you're gonna

556
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,159
see mom and dad options

557
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,399
and the grandparents definitely give you

558
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,919
more options we don't have uh basically

559
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,919
different grandparents here

560
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,120
so that recessive trait that pops up

561
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,759
from the grandparents

562
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,519
it's going to be very uh very similar

563
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,440
but you may see great grandparents is

564
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,120
what i think i was alluding to earlier

565
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,639
you may see weird great-grandparents

566
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,278
traits come out of that that you have no

567
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,360
idea

568
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,720
what you're expecting there uh maybe

569
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,320
great great-grandparents may be

570
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
expressed in that when you go

571
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,839
playing with genetics like this this is

572
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,000
when we open up weird stuff that's why

573
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,279
the f2 shows a lot of variation the f1

574
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,039
comes with a lot of vigor

575
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,320
the f2 we really start opening up

576
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,000
variation uh

577
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
f3 hopefully you've done selection to

578
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,958
start narrowing that down

579
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,800
when we're working with fems we don't

580
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,559
have as many uh many

581
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,919
pieces to our puzzles many colors to our

582
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,799
palette as many ingredients to our

583
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,439
recipe

584
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,039
so you shouldn't open as many things but

585
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
that's when you start seeing background

586
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,360
things pop up that you never expected

587
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,040
this is

588
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,240
a fun project it's something that you

589
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,879
should do if you haven't already done

590
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,120
this

591
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,240
uh do it bro and tell me how this goes i

592
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,599
would love to do it for you but i

593
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,599
honestly don't have time

594
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,678
or space so i think you're gonna see

595
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,240
variation but it's going to be

596
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,439
less variation and you may see great

597
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,798
grandparents at first i said

598
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,319
grandparents but then i had to

599
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:19,918
had to draw the family tree in my head

600
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:20,798
and talk it out you may see great

601
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,640
grandparents

602
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,078
uh come through in some of the rare

603
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,839
phenotypes but it's technically not an

604
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,599
s one because you're using different

605
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,159
plants so that is a

606
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,839
an r1 i hope i'm saying that correctly

607
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,160
it's an r1 it's a reversal

608
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,199
and you'll see uh number one and number

609
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,720
two in there but it's

610
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,558
gonna be you're gonna get a lot of them

611
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,960
that look 50 50 of number one and number

612
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:42,798
two

613
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,000
a lot that look like number one a lot

614
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:44,720
look like number two but then you're

615
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,880
gonna see

616
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,160
some outliers that look like whatever

617
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,280
that strain was crossed with you're

618
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,279
gonna get some weirdness there then you

619
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,558
may get some real mutants out of it too

620
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,480
because you're playing with feminized

621
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,839
genetics uh that's a really fun

622
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,279
conversation that i would like to open

623
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,558
up with other people i wish this was a

624
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,960
live chat i had some more people on

625
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,119
there

626
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,640
if you've got input feedback questions

627
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,079
corrections comments concerns on this

628
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,000
topic i would love to hear it

629
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,960
again my email address is grow

630
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,240
fromyourheart hotmail.com

631
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,679
all right i've got one more email this

632
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,440
one could get kinda long because there

633
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,798
are a lot of details to this one

634
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,440
this one is a question about tds ec

635
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,200
and ppms what are all of those things

636
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,640
what does all of that stuff mean

637
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,240
i tried to make some notes so that we

638
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,240
can keep this one concise

639
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,000
the question came from our friend

640
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,519
sequoia organic farms it says

641
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,599
hey ross to jeff i'm a new supporter

642
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,440
from colorado check us out we are

643
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,199
sequoia organic farms

644
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,558
they spell sequoia differently than you

645
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,919
probably assume it's s

646
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:41,759
e q u o y a h

647
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,120
and then organic farms the traditional

648
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,119
way it's all one word

649
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,199
it goes on to say i can't tell you

650
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,199
enough how much your knowledge means to

651
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,720
everyone thank you bro i appreciate that

652
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
says thank you for all of the positive

653
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,200
energy and keep killing the game

654
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
ah thank you bro just being me trying to

655
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,319
do what i do trying to get these seeds

656
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
and the message out to the people that

657
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,480
need it

658
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,160
thank you for noticing the hard work it

659
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,558
says it's people like you

660
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,240
who inspire people like me to tell you

661
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,079
the truth bro it's people like you

662
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,919
who inspire people like me so keep it

663
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,279
going we'll keep it going back and forth

664
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,480
it says i do have a quick question for

665
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,399
you that i hope you can

666
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,480
uh talk about on the podcast i do

667
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,919
apologize if you've already covered this

668
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,679
in a previous episode

669
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,759
uh that is okay if i already have with

670
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,759
600 episodes i realize people

671
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,038
probably don't go back and listen to all

672
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,480
600

673
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,480
if they've got a question it's probably

674
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
easier just to redo it and since we're

675
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,279
on this brand new

676
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,440
awesome video format why not have a new

677
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,440
episode on the old topics on the video

678
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,720
format anyway so if you already asked it

679
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,558
or if it's already been covered that's

680
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,798
okay i'm gonna re-answer it for you

681
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,000
it says can you dive into the specifics

682
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,038
of ppm

683
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,359
tds and ec what are they

684
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,960
and what are their relations all right

685
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,678
there are multiple parts to this

686
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,279
question

687
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,559
i'm not gonna answer all three i'll read

688
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,079
them quickly for you though it says i'm

689
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,759
an organic no-till

690
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,759
living soil grower i would love some

691
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,919
tips on how to specifically water

692
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,919
peat-based super soils i seem to be an

693
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,520
over waterer

694
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,120
my advice to that you already know that

695
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,798
you're an over waterer

696
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,319
wait another day bro wait until that

697
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,000
plant looks like it's thirsty it will

698
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,480
let you know it will tell you

699
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,279
then water it that's easy enough um then

700
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,200
it says

701
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,119
any organic references to increase

702
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,360
yields would be awesome maybe a

703
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,959
whole organic episode i did invite

704
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,158
somebody to come on and do some organics

705
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,000
and once again i'll recommend the

706
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,960
embracing organic show

707
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,359
um then i'm not your organic expert but

708
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,640
for

709
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,558
organic i think i can recommend budswell

710
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,400
i think budswell is an organic product

711
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,720
and i think that will help with your

712
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
bloom booster situation check out bud

713
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,600
swell the liquid

714
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,200
make sure that's organic before you use

715
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,719
it do not take my word for it i'm giving

716
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,159
you a disclaimer right now

717
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
not a hundred percent sure but that's

718
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,799
what i would recommend if it is organic

719
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,240
do that

720
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,599
now let's get into the part of the

721
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,079
question you actually wanted some help

722
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,119
with that i'm able to provide help for

723
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,519
let's talk about what are tds ppms and

724
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,158
ec what do all these letters mean

725
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,279
tds is actually what we are measuring

726
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,559
when we measure

727
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,720
ppm and ec tds simply stands for

728
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,000
total dissolved solids and there are a

729
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,240
couple of ways to measure

730
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,759
the total dissolved solids in a solution

731
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,640
so what we're going to do we're going to

732
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,679
have a solution

733
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,600
up a container of water and nutrients

734
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,320
that is our solution in this case

735
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,240
we want to know how much nutrient is in

736
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,798
our water the water if you've got ro

737
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,000
water

738
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,158
it should be zero ppms uh zero ec

739
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,038
so there are zero total dissolved solids

740
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,320
in there now we're gonna add our

741
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,400
nutrients into it

742
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,240
and there are several reasons why it's

743
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,120
good to know what your ec

744
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,720
or your ppms are first of all if you're

745
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,839
burning the plants like our one listener

746
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,400
may be doing

747
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,879
we can see what the tds is the ppms and

748
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,120
we can

749
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,960
lower that or if we're getting a perfect

750
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,639
crop we can see that it was perfect we

751
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,200
can write that down and we can repeat

752
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,200
that

753
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,200
or if the plants need new more nutrients

754
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
we can write down that 600 was a little

755
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,759
low

756
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,839
let's give it 700 next time so it's a

757
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,960
good it's a good gauge a good guide a

758
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,319
good reference point

759
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,159
and it can teach you a lot about your

760
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,359
plants and what they're uptaking

761
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,600
so let's talk a little bit more

762
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,719
specifically about what these things are

763
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,798
tds is the

764
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,240
total amount of dissolved solids in your

765
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,480
bucket with your water how many

766
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,159
dissolved solids are in there the units

767
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,240
of measure the common units of measure

768
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,840
of those total dissolved solids are

769
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,798
ppms and ec ppm stands for

770
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,279
particles per million so we've got this

771
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,599
many

772
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,639
particles of nutrients per million

773
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:31,599
particles of water in that solution

774
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,480
tds or no i'm sorry ec stands for

775
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,798
electrical

776
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,839
conductivity let's talk about electrical

777
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,759
conductivity

778
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,199
electrical conductivity is and i got

779
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,759
this from the internet shout out to

780
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,080
google

781
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,679
it says electrical conductivity is the

782
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,759
measurement of the ability

783
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,360
of something to conduct electricity i

784
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,480
know that sounds very basic it sounds

785
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,558
kind of redundant

786
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,319
electrical conductivity is the ability

787
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,960
to conduct electricity

788
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,519
the salts that we use for fertilizers do

789
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,279
have the ability to conduct electricity

790
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,119
uh all those salts you add in there are

791
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,000
conductive to electricity is what i'm

792
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,199
saying

793
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,119
the ec measures how much electricity

794
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,558
they are able to conduct it's not like

795
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,000
you can plug in a light with them that's

796
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,399
very small amounts of

797
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,798
electrical conductivity but that is what

798
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,960
the ec stands for

799
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,720
ppm excuse me with that let me fix my

800
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,200
voice and try that again

801
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,720
i'm not a 12 year old i promise ppm

802
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,798
meters particles

803
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,038
per million meters actually measure nec

804
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,038
and do a mathematical equation and

805
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,919
convert that to ppm

806
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,960
so in my opinion ec is much more

807
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,640
reliable

808
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,400
than particles per million it's more

809
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,600
used in science it's more used in large

810
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,840
scale application

811
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,639
you'll more likely see ec as a unit of

812
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,278
measurement

813
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,960
over particles per million so also there

814
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,240
are different conversion

815
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,880
rates just like the imperial and metric

816
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,960
system

817
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,880
there are different conversions so in

818
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,079
different regions different countries

819
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,080
different continents

820
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,000
uh particles per million will be

821
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,240
converted differently to ec

822
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,159
in their conversion calculator they use

823
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,759
a different number to do the conversion

824
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,919
unless you know where your nutrient

825
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:11,278
company is basing their conversion on

826
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,200
your ppm recommendations may be way off

827
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,278
so particles per million are telling us

828
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,120
how much stuff is in that water

829
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,880
electrical conductivity is basically

830
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,798
telling us how much stuff is in that

831
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
water but more specifically

832
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:23,839
and that makes it easier to remember to

833
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,639
notate

834
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,158
how much nutrient is in our solution you

835
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,640
may be mixing in five or six

836
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,520
different uh products into your solution

837
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,840
you can always

838
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,679
take your ec meter start off and see

839
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,359
what your starting water ec is if you're

840
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,880
using ro it's going to be zero if you're

841
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,439
using tap water you're going to have a

842
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,760
few

843
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,798
uh ppms or a little bit of ec in that

844
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:44,720
water

845
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,960
now add your nitrogen or your base

846
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,360
nutrient stir your ec meter around in

847
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,278
there

848
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,199
and you can see what your particles per

849
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:51,839
million or your electrical conductivity

850
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,159
level of

851
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,359
your base nutrient is a lot of people

852
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,120
like to measure the ec

853
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,959
and particles per million of their cal

854
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,000
mag a lot of plants are very critical on

855
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,319
how much calmac they

856
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,200
use this is a really good way to dial in

857
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,079
exactly

858
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,960
how much calmag or calcium or magnesium

859
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,798
or whatever

860
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,640
individual bottled nutrient you've got

861
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,240
you can definitely measure out exactly

862
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,799
how much of that is going

863
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,919
into your solution by measuring your ec

864
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,918
and your ppm

865
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,200
while you are adding that product to the

866
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,840
reservoir you can actually have the

867
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,840
meter

868
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,278
in the reservoir pour it in there see

869
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,558
what it is before you pour it and see

870
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:24,960
what it is after you pour it now you

871
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,519
know

872
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,278
i've got 600 ppms of nitrogen now you

873
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,000
can pour in your calmag if your goal is

874
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,599
200

875
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,839
particles per million of the calmag

876
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,278
bottle pour that in until you see 800

877
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,879
ppms of stuff or

878
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,440
whatever number you want on your ec

879
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,840
screen you can do exactly how much of

880
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,400
each

881
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,399
nutrient bottle you want at that rate so

882
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,720
i highly recommend using ec

883
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,400
i write down the ec of my solution

884
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,319
before it goes into the plants i write

885
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,640
down the ec of my solution that runs out

886
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,480
of my plants i also write down the ph

887
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,679
of that solution before i feed it and

888
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
what comes out of the bottom of the

889
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,960
plants

890
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,360
i also write down every single nutrient

891
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,319
that went into that nutrient solution

892
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,879
if i put 100 ml of one thing 80 mls of

893
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,798
another

894
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,919
20 mls of another and then a bunch of

895
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,558
grams of recharge

896
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,080
i write that all down on a spreadsheet

897
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,200
then i write down my ec

898
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,599
in my ppm's in my phn and then i write

899
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,000
down

900
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,719
the ec out and the ph out so i've got a

901
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,038
good documentation of what happened

902
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,079
then if something goes wrong i can look

903
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:25,440
back in my feed chart

904
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,199
i can look at the plants i can look at

905
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,679
my paperwork and that helps me

906
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,440
kind of decide kind of determine kind of

907
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,278
decipher what may have gone wrong

908
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,880
through a process of elimination

909
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,119
maybe we sprayed something that's

910
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,120
written down also maybe we defoliated

911
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,479
too heavily that's written down also but

912
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,359
i take a lot of notes

913
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,798
uh i use the ec as a reference guide i

914
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,798
always write down my ec

915
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,798
of my solution in and out then we can

916
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,519
use that data like i said earlier

917
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,158
to either correct an issue or to repeat

918
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,000
success

919
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,278
if you've got a problem the numbers will

920
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
tell you maybe where your problem

921
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,480
happened you can see

922
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,319
the ph coming out was a little funky the

923
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,519
ec coming out was a little funky it was

924
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,359
too high too low

925
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,720
maybe one of them went one way one with

926
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,278
the other that'll tell you what's

927
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,038
happening

928
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,720
with your runoff the runoff reports or a

929
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,319
whole nother podcast i think i may have

930
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,880
done that if not i need to do an updated

931
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,639
version

932
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,559
uh even if i did i should probably do an

933
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,120
updated version but you can use that

934
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,079
data

935
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,678
to either correct or adjust or mimic

936
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,960
your previous results and when you're

937
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,038
working with standard operating

938
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,200
procedures in a large scale environment

939
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,480
repeatable results are what we're after

940
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,000
if we nail this crop

941
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,319
we definitely want to nail that crop

942
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,839
next time get a bonus uh reach potency

943
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:32,798
goals reach harvest weights everybody

944
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,558
gets a bonus

945
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,240
everybody's after a bonus check all the

946
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,759
patients get a better product

947
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,159
that's what happens when we take good

948
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,480
notes so it's my recommendation to stick

949
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,399
with

950
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,839
electrical conductivity as it is a

951
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:45,439
little bit more accurate

952
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,038
uh when you're measuring each nutrient

953
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,720
you can do your ppms that way if you

954
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,599
want to it is easier to tell

955
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,798
the numbers are uh more they're uh

956
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,038
you're using like 600

957
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,798
700 800 when you're using the ec it's

958
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,640
going to be like 0.8.9

959
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,720
so it's easier to use the other scale as

960
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,600
you're measuring each thing individually

961
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,038
overall go with the ec find your zone

962
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,599
find what your plants love

963
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,960
stick with that and repeat it all right
