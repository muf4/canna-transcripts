just finished this container the last

18
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:42,859
container of the skywalker og live

19
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:47,399
batter from garden of Weeden quick

20
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:51,090
moment of silence to this empty jar

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,820
was a trusty jar it was a worthy jar and

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,520
it served a great purpose and now this

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,039
jar is empty and it will be retired to

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,780
the graveyard of empty hash jars

25
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,769
Skywalker oh gee I'll miss you that was

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,270
some good [ __ ] you guys

27
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,948
I bet Elijah has got a small tear in his

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,590
eye also hearing that it's gone we used

29
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:10,259
to dab the [ __ ] out on that Skywalker it

30
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,760
lasted a little bit there was a lot of

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,590
it and now it's gone

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,940
alright guys this guy Walker was

33
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,350
delicious it's obviously got me in a

34
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,780
good mood I'm nice and high having a

35
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:20,250
great day before we get too far I want

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,950
to make a correction in the last episode

37
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,989
if you listen to number 300 thank you

38
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,519
but I said that art Bell and George

39
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:28,978
Noory and coast to coast may have been

40
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,049
the og podcast I know that that wasn't a

41
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,728
podcast but it was what I thought maybe

42
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,920
the first type of show to have that

43
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:37,679
platform that long extended platform to

44
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,269
break the basic AM radio kind of a mold

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,700
but then when I was listening to the

46
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:42,780
podcast and editing it came to me that

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,210
there was somebody else that I should

48
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,659
give sort of a shout out some tribute to

49
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:50,368
and it's ironic because he did kind of

50
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,979
pave the way for podcasting and he was

51
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,840
never a podcaster he actually despises

52
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,750
podcasters I'm talking about Howard

53
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,850
Stern Howard Stern was a radio DJ that

54
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,500
broke all of his own rules who pushed

55
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,599
the limits who ended up with his own

56
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,519
show who ended up with his own TV show

57
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,639
who ended up with a movie after him who

58
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:12,120
is still on Sirius XM making tons of

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:15,479
money basically doing podcasting so in a

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,009
way Howard Stern may be the og podcaster

61
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,159
and I think it's funny that Howard hates

62
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:23,099
podcasting but it makes sense to me

63
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,620
because he's og he uh he had to bust his

64
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,319
ass and get on the radio and fight with

65
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,700
radio politics and business politics and

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,810
if you know anything about the radio and

67
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,458
if you know anything about Howard Stern

68
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,189
you saw the stuff he had to battle to

69
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,379
become Howard Stern I was able to go buy

70
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,909
some toys and plug them in and just run

71
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,799
my mouth into a microphone and post it

72
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,479
to iTunes and hope to get listens it's

73
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:45,090
so much simpler now so I understand why

74
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,219
how he despises podcasts but he is kind

75
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,989
of the og podcaster because he set the

76
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,699
standard he broke the mold

77
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,400
he showed us that we can do different

78
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,649
things so shout it to Howard Stern even

79
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,269
though you despise podcasters I think

80
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,789
you're the og of podcasting you

81
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,829
definitely change radio and broadcasting

82
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:03,449
so we oh shout out to him I'm gonna keep

83
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:05,579
going or this is not gonna be a quickie

84
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:08,578
holy [ __ ] I'm talking of today this

85
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:12,659
episode is going to be about adapting

86
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:15,510
and adjusting as a cannabis farmer now

87
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,340
being a cannabis teacher an educator I

88
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:19,289
come on my podcast and I try to teach

89
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,209
you guys how to grow cannabis in the

90
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,668
best way possible how to take care of

91
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,650
your garden the best way possible

92
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,650
sometimes that's hard because there are

93
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,829
no instructions everything I say is

94
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,010
basically a suggestion you can follow my

95
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:37,500
suggestions and it should work 9 out of

96
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:40,560
10 times it will work but I don't know

97
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,780
your grow room I don't know you I don't

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,759
know what's going on I the only if you

99
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,159
ask me a question the only info I have

100
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,048
or is those two paragraphs you sent me

101
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,400
and you may have left some things out

102
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,719
there may be things you didn't even

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,489
think about mentioning there may be

104
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,019
something that I can't see because I'm

105
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,769
not in the grow room that you don't see

106
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,989
because you don't know to look for it so

107
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:03,450
helping you guys out everything that I

108
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,400
say is kind of just going on the fly by

109
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,488
what you're telling me now you have to

110
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,579
be able to adjust and adapt to not

111
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,049
having real instructions but two

112
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:15,329
suggestions I don't know what strain

113
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,980
you're growing every strain is going to

114
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,980
require different treatment

115
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,109
I do recommend specific pH ranges and

116
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,930
feeding ranges but I try to give a range

117
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:27,509
because each strain is going to want

118
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,129
something different that strain may want

119
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,339
something different in a different grow

120
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:33,600
room if you've got an LED light you may

121
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,399
have to grow differently than if you've

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,710
got an HP S light or if you've got a

123
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,789
ceramic metal halide light everything

124
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:40,109
that we're reading in the books

125
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,720
everything that we're reading on the

126
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,449
bottles all of the instructions should

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,940
be taken as suggestions when it comes to

128
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:50,669
growing cannabis it's kind of like being

129
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,500
a doctor doctors are always practicing

130
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:54,810
we were practicing growing cannabis

131
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,300
because each plant we see is like a new

132
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,918
patient your body chemistry is different

133
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,590
the next guy's body chemistry is

134
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,658
different we could how many people do

135
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:05,519
you know that can smoke weigh more or

136
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:06,420
weigh less than you and get way [ __ ]

137
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,399
up or

138
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,480
and you're like what's going on how come

139
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,279
in that's because our bodies are

140
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,160
different our plants are just like that

141
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,709
you're gonna have to adjust and adapt to

142
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,260
each plant to each environment to each

143
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:23,519
situation different strains are gonna

144
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:27,779
want different feeds OG Kush &amp; Sour

145
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,479
Diesel and super Silver Haze they're

146
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,349
gonna want completely different feeds

147
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,270
environments they want to be treated

148
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,000
completely differently you're going to

149
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:37,169
have to adapt now sometimes the

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,670
different stages of your grow your

151
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,790
plants are gonna want different amounts

152
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,379
of water you're gonna have to adapt and

153
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,780
adjust maybe you're used to giving this

154
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,889
plant a gallon of water maybe you see

155
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,239
something wrong you're gonna have to

156
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,430
figure out do I need to give it a gallon

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,199
in a quarter or three gallons adjust and

158
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,840
adapt don't get stuck into your routines

159
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,819
and patterns because the bottle says the

160
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,119
instruction book says they don't have

161
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:01,469
your plants they don't have your eyes

162
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,269
take all of the instructions as

163
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,850
suggestions when it comes to growing

164
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:07,469
cannabis I said each different strain is

165
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,990
gonna want different things each

166
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,630
different phenotype of that strain is

167
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,540
going to want different things possibly

168
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:17,670
a lot of times you'll find a phenotype

169
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,530
that is this is kind of a typical thing

170
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,629
when you get seeds one will be taller

171
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,579
and skinnier one will be shorter and

172
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:25,290
more dense that's kind of a phenotypic

173
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,240
expression showing mommy and daddy

174
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,390
they're gonna want different things and

175
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,680
you're going to have to adjust and adapt

176
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,750
now when I run a Fino hunt the first

177
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,400
time those plants all get the same thing

178
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,870
for the sake of science so that I can

179
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,449
see what I've got so that every plant

180
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,329
gets treated the same I have a dialed in

181
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:44,789
basic feed regimen a good light schedule

182
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:47,009
and a good room so that all those plants

183
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,560
get with a good basic treatment that I

184
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,029
know works so I run all of those plants

185
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,939
under the same conditions in the same

186
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:55,739
environment and I can see what performs

187
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:58,050
ideally in the ideal conditions then I

188
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,970
can select the keepers though two

189
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,860
possibly three keepers out of that

190
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,300
usually out of a ten pack I find one two

191
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,639
three that I like to keep and run again

192
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,350
then I will I have seen what they do I

193
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,819
know they are keepers I know I can use

194
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,710
them I know that they grow well I've

195
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,029
seen them girl once I took plenty of

196
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:13,649
notes I paid attention to which one

197
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:17,229
stretches I paid attention to which one

198
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:19,899
stays Squa now I can adjust and adapt my

199
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:22,000
grow to grow those plants properly so

200
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:23,560
you can't always follow what it says on

201
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,060
the bottle you can't always follow what

202
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,519
it says on the internet you can't always

203
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,100
follow what I say nine times out of ten

204
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,319
I'm going to steer you the right

205
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,360
direction but you have to keep in mind

206
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,949
that I'm human and I may make mistakes

207
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,840
you have to keep in mind the only

208
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:40,569
information I've got to go by is what

209
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,789
you have told me and also whatever I

210
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:44,949
give you the advice I give you you're

211
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,300
going to have to adjust and adapt it to

212
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,769
your garden you're gonna have to use

213
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,329
your best judgment you're gonna have to

214
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,829
use your eyes you're gonna have to use

215
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:52,959
your nose you're gonna have to use your

216
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:55,509
sense of touch hell maybe even use your

217
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,339
sense of taste use all your senses what

218
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,560
do you got you got eyes ears nose mouth

219
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:00,789
and touching so use all your senses in

220
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,220
there get in there and smell it look at

221
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,180
it taste it touch it listen to it I

222
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,320
don't know if there's anything to listen

223
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,639
to if your plants are making noise

224
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,399
you're doing something wrong listen to

225
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,839
the equipment either way you guys you

226
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,779
know what I'm talking about adjust and

227
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,459
adapt pay attention to what's going on

228
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,599
maybe the book says give it a gallon of

229
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:18,669
water you pour it in a gallon of water

230
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,680
and that plant went crazy you're going

231
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,449
to have to adjust and adapt think about

232
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,519
it go pick up that pot is it too heavy

233
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,560
is it too light does the plant look like

234
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,180
it's too dry or too wet you're gonna

235
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,160
have to think about it you're gonna have

236
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,710
to adjust and you're gonna have to adapt

237
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,479
let's talk about things like I talked

238
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,519
about popping the sticks we call it

239
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,050
super cropping when you grab a portion

240
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,879
of the stem and you grab it another inch

241
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:42,459
above that and you twist opposite

242
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:44,110
directions and it makes this noise your

243
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,460
sticks will make that noise it's a good

244
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,710
thing as long as it doesn't tip over

245
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,930
sideways if you're twisting it's perfect

246
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,480
don't break it just twist it you want it

247
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:55,899
to pop when you're working with let's

248
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,909
say Blue Dream Blue Dream has tight node

249
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:00,549
spacing it grows really long strong

250
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:02,110
branches blue dream you could pop this

251
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:03,099
[ __ ] out of it all over the place and

252
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,860
it'll be just fine

253
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,810
Ghost Dog is kind of stretchy she gets

254
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,370
kind of tall you have to be careful

255
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:11,139
where you crack her because if you do or

256
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,000
too much she'll start getting kind of

257
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:16,029
droopy and get mad at you you've got to

258
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,860
adjust and adapt same strains Ghost Dog

259
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:19,959
and Blue Dream Blue Dream supports

260
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,519
itself like a champ Blue Dream you don't

261
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,930
need a lot of netting a lot of stakes a

262
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,549
lot of trellising it's a good idea

263
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,959
because the buds are gonna get big but

264
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:27,729
if you don't have them the buds will

265
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,730
hold themselves up that plants robust

266
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,560
Ghost Dog you better have

267
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,850
three layers of trellising because

268
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,500
they're gonna start tipping over at week

269
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,120
five those buds are gonna get floppy

270
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,250
they just can't support themselves

271
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,959
you're going to have to adjust and adapt

272
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,899
because you've got different strains

273
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:46,268
it's not always gonna be science you

274
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:48,220
guys plants are nature they've got a

275
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:50,560
life of their own don't try to fight it

276
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,079
and don't get sucked into your routine

277
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,489
get sucked into the plants routine be in

278
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:55,750
the rhythm with the plants just because

279
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,459
you get to the grow at 8:00 in the

280
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,600
morning doesn't mean those plants need

281
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,789
water at 8:00 in the morning if they're

282
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,560
not dry let them wait till noon if

283
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:04,689
they're still a little wet maybe let

284
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,039
them wait till 3:00 don't force-feed

285
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,470
them if they're not ready because it's

286
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,730
on your schedule all right you guys I

287
