feedback on the episode that i did

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,759
about never giving up i recently did a

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,519
podcast episode where somebody sent me a

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,799
message they said they were frustrated

51
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,519
with their grow they were thinking about

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,600
giving up i gave some advice that my

53
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,599
main advice was focused on the grow room

54
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,438
but most of that advice was also

55
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,438
applicable to life you could apply most

56
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,399
of what i said to most situations in

57
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:13,120

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,759
honestly i didn't know is going to have

72
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,759
such a big impact sometimes i put out

73
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,840
these shows i think the episode about

74
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,759
cutting clones and like selecting males

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
and female plants and identifying sex

76
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,560
and things i think those are super

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,239
important the thing sometimes when i'm

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,598
just rambling and saying things that i

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
was just touching on a subject here

80
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,719
that's when really people really seem to

81
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,640
respond the most so thank you that was

82
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,239

92
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,958
hasn't been very long since i put the

93
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,479
plants in the greenhouse since i'm

94
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,479

96
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,639

97
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,399

99
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,959
it but i did say that the male plant i

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,000
different places in the growth

105
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,318
strategically to work with the airflow

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,840
to get maximum pollination so if you're

107
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,839
wondering the plants that are in the

108
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,479
greenhouse the male is the jack the

109

117
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,958
really all i've got to report on those

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,598
plants i did recently in a podcast i may

119
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,438
have appeared on another show i may have

120
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,238
been on caribou heart tv where i

121
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,719
mentioned that i am now breeding with a

122
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,239
new male plant and a lot of people were

123
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,478
a little bit confused a little bit

124
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,519
excited um there's a lot of confusion

125
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,199
because i haven't talked too much about

126
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,720
it i do keep some things kind of secret

127
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,639
some things under wraps we talk about a

128
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
lot of stuff you have to have some

129
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,120
secrets that's how you win

130
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,719
but i didn't talk about this plant a lot

131
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,639
and then i did start talking about it

132
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,479
people were confused let me talk about

133
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,400
the plant i was mentioning

134
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:39,279
i've got a male plant i'm working with a

135
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:42,000
male plant that is a bc lemon skunk male

136
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,638
it is a bc lemon skunk bc is the seed

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,399
company bc seed company it's from

138
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,199
vancouver british columbia it's a

139
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,519
british columbia uh lemon skunk so the

140
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,600
bc is not a back cross a lot of people

141
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,680
were asking i saw on a message board i

142
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,240
saw on some forms is that a back cross

143
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,360
is bc for bat cross that could be what

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,519
bat cross is but in this instance it is

145
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
uh a bc that's why it's first if it was

146
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,399
bat cross it would have been at the end

147
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,639
and i would have used a bx which drives

148
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,839
p crazy shout out to my buddy f1p and i

149

151
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,679
right bc does work good for back cross

152
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,319
however it would have been at the end

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,800
this is bc lemon skunk that stands for

154
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,120
british columbia it's a lemon skunk that

155
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,439

about that in the future i wanted to

159
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,839
clear that up that it is not a bat cross

160
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,160
it is a bc seed company a bc lemon skunk

161

00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:47,120
the same lemon skunk that is used in the

166
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,680
lemon jeffrey or the lemon sunrise or

167
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,038
the jack the jack tripper this is a

168
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,840
different lemon skunk plant the

169
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,240
lemon skunk that is used for the lemon

170
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,119
jeffrey the lemon sunrise or the uh the

171
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,759
firefly the jack tripper that is

172
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,439
actually from greenhouse seeds um that

173
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,439
is a female it's only a female that's

174
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,038
actually a feminized seed that i've been

175
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,719
breeding to so there's another ramble we

176
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,478
could talk about when people talk about

177
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,319
you can't breed the femme seeds well you

178
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,478
sure as [ __ ] can because i'm reversing

179
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,759
femme plants and breeding them to other

180
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:18,879
fem plants i'm getting way off topic

181
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,759
here but we're just rambling at this

182
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,439
point anyway the bc lemon skunk that

183
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,520
i've been talking about is a bc lemon

184
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,560
skunk from bc seed company that's a boy

185
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,079
that's a dude the other lemon skunk i've

186
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,399
had for years and i've talked about a

187
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,399
lot that is a female from greenhouse

188
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,839
those are different plants completely

189
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,399
different plants don't get confused

190
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,560
wanted to clear that up i hope that

191
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,399
makes any sense to everybody out there

192
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,399
all right let's segue into my next batch

193
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,799
of notes here i am recording right at

194
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,239
the start of the month today is june 1st

195
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
so it is a good idea to take this

196
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,360
opportunity to remind you to calibrate

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,360
your equipment if you've got a ph meter

198
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,879
an ec meter whatever kind of meter

199
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,360
you're working with maybe you're using a

200
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,279
dosatron go calibrate all of those

201
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,720
devices now is a very good time to do it

202
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,119
the start of the month is a beautiful

203
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,039
time to clean up and calibrate things

204
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,639
if you've got filters

205
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,560
go clean them if you've got something

206
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,918
that needs to be cleaned up go clean it

207
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,598
take the first of the month just to go

208
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:14,959
polish it up it's the start of the

209
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:16,639
summer season get in there and clean

210
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,478
some [ __ ] up get a head start on summer

211
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,319
cleaning make the grow room shine get

212
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,959
ahead of any problems go in there and

213
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,879
find the issues go clean everything up

214
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,478
go calibrate all of your meters clean

215
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,159
the air conditioner vents if you've got

216
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,680
one of those portable air conditioners

217
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,199
that thing has a filter in it if you've

218
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,478
got another kind of air conditioner

219
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,639
could have a filter in it if you're

220
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,318
using a heater that sounds crazy but

221
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,160
last night in colorado the heater came

222
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,840
on because it got super [ __ ] cold if

223
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,759
you're using a heater maybe clean the

224
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,119
filter on the heater everything's got a

225
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,879
filter that needs to be cleaned maybe

226
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,319
you're running some kind of hydro gear

227
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,639
maybe you're running something maybe go

228
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,199
clean all the fans today is a good day

229
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,160
to clean all of your grow equipment for

230
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,080
now i'm going to focus on our ph meter

231
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,520
recently i was at somebody's grow and

232
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,680
they were excited because they just

233
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,598
bought i recommended a blue lab ph pen

234
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,360
blue lab doesn't pay me uh maybe i

235
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,439
shouldn't even have said the brand but i

236
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,360
recommended a brand new blue lab ph

237
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,639
meter to my friend they went and got it

238
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,840
we showed up at their grow together

239
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,120
we're gonna hang out and work on our

240
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:15,198
plants my buddy busted out a blue lab ph

241
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,720
pin took it right out of the box mixed

242
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,720
up some nutrients and plopped it right

243
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,599
into the solution and read it and said

244
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,319
ph is great and i was like bro

245
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,439
you didn't do that correctly at all and

246
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,039
he's like what do you mean i was like

247
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,560
you got to calibrate that and he was

248
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,959
like what do you mean and i was like

249
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,879
you've got to calibrate your ph meter

250
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,478
and he didn't even think about this

251
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,918
did you know do you know i'm going to

252
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,000
tell you now just because a lot of

253
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,478
people apparently do not know that when

254
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,719
you buy your ph pen in the instruction

255
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,759
book it is recommended that you soak

256
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,560
that ph probe in a ph calibration

257
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,120
solution for 24 hours before calibrating

258
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,958
it did you know that you just paid 100

259
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,519
for that device why not follow the

260
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,199
instructions and set it up correctly to

261
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,679
work correctly we're going to rely on

262
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,839
this device to measure the nutrient

263
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,919
solution which we are feeding our entire

264
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,680
crop these nutrients you paid a lot of

265
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,599
money for the nutrients you want those

266
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,199
nutrients to give you maximum benefit on

267
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,399
the crop which you were growing why

268
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,879
wouldn't you make sure the tools that

269
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,200
you just paid money for are not dialed

270
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,799
in and calibrated [ __ ] perfectly

271
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
that's what i would do if it were up to

272
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,000
me so

273
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,600
when you get that new ph pen when it

274
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,240
comes out of the box the first thing you

275
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,080
should do is set it in that calibration

276
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,399
solution for 24 hours it'll say 12 to 24

277
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,560
hours it may say 24 hours plus on your

278
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,240
package on your instructions read those

279
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,239
do that some of them may not recommend

280
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,759
it but in the blue lab it was definitely

281
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,600
recommended in the instructions and my

282
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,958
buddy didn't even bother to calibrate it

283
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,240
he took it sorry i'm calling you out bro

284
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,759
we're not going to say your name but

285
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,519
he's listening what's up bro fist bump

286
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,799
hope you're well salute anyway took it

287
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,839
right out of the box and plopped it in

288
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,679
there and stirred it around it was like

289
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,720
the ph looks good and i was like what

290
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,399
the [ __ ] are you doing bro but uh adjust

291
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,320
it calibrate that thing calibrate it

292
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,679
needs to be who knows how long it's been

293
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,200
sitting in the box who knows if it got

294
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,958
calibrated who know what the who knows

295
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
what the guy at the factory calibrated

296
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,359
at so let it soak in the solution then

297
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,360
take it out then there are very simple

298
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,639
steps for calibrating a ph pin most of

299
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,320
them it's going to be a couple of

300
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,000
buttons until one thing flickers you put

301
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,519
it in the four solution until it says

302
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
four then you're gonna put in the other

303
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,000
solution clean it off between solutions

304
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,920
pull it out of the four rinse it off in

305
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,679
clean water then put it in the seven

306
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,240
then make sure it comes on at the seven

307
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,838
then here's what i recommend buy another

308
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,360
batch of four and or seven solution

309
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,120
because

310
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,440
just like i don't trust that calibration

311
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,839
that original pen calibration i don't

312
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,480
trust these solutions either sometimes

313
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,399
they go dry sometimes they expire

314
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
i'm a suspicious [ __ ] person i got

315
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,720
trust issues i do not trust these

316
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,519
calibration solutions at all so i buy

317
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,879
another fresh bottle of four and seven i

318
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,759
pour a little bit of them into little

319
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,759
containers and then i re-dip my testing

320
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,159
so my testing probe into that and make

321
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,439
sure it shows me four clean it off dip

322
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,000
it into the other one make sure it shows

323
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,160
me seven on my backup solutions now i've

324
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,078
got four tests that are positive that

325
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,159
show me that it's actually calibrated

326
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,479
the way that i think it is so i would

327
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,600
soak it in the solution for 24 hours

328
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
then when you're going to go in the grow

329
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,440
the next day pull it out clean it off

330
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
put it in the for solution calibrate it

331
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,120
properly put it in the seven calibrate

332
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,240
it properly clean it off between each of

333
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,078
those

334
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,159
then pour your other brand your other

335
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,159
bottle of calibration solution your

336
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,559
backup standard is what that is your

337
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,159
backups testing sample then test those

338
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,639
again and make sure that they all come

339
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,240
out properly four and seven as you

340
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,919
calibrate it that way you're double

341
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,919
checking your equipment like i said

342
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,919
before we're paying a lot of money for

343
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,799
our nutrients we pay a lot of money for

344
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:44,639
the ph pen we're putting a lot of money

345
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,319
time space energy possibly felonies into

346
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,919
our grow there's a lot of things going

347
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,040
into this why wouldn't we calibrate our

348
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,399
ph bin and get the ph the best that we

349
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,078
can and if you're just buying the thing

350
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,759
and using it it might not be perfect so

351
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,159
i'm gonna keep saying it calibrate the

352
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,519
damn ph pen do it today do it while

353
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,120
you're thinking about it do it while i'm

354
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,560
rambling it's only going to take you a

355
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,799
few minutes if you've got the proper

356
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,399
solutions um

357
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,759
like i said before we're spending all

358
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,278
this money on nutrients we want the

359
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,519
plants to be able to uptake those

360
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,278
nutrients and without the proper ph they

361
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,519
won't some stuff will just get left out

362
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,200
you may be adding cal mag let's just say

363
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,639
the bot those are two separate nutrients

364
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,320
you need to we're gonna stick with the

365
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,680
bottle of cow maggots sold in one bottle

366
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,240
most of the time you're buying this

367
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,838
bottle of calmag if your ph isn't right

368
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,039
you're putting the calmag into your feed

369
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,399
solution you're pouring that into the

370
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,679
plants and guess what it's falling out

371
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,399
of the bottom they're not even eating it

372
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,399
because your ph isn't correct so adjust

373
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,078
correct that ph most of the plants i'm

374
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,320
not going to delve too far into ph i

375
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,239
wanted to ramble more about calibrating

376
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,399
your equipment but most plants are going

377
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,079
to like a ph of somewhere between 5 8

378
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,759
and 6.4

379
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,199
if you can get within that range most of

380
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,319
your plants will be happy do pay

381
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,839
attention uh maybe six three six two

382
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,160
will be a little bit better this will

383
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,680
depend on the age of your plants uh the

384
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,159
size of your plants of course the health

385
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,519
of your plants the growth stage of your

386
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,278
plants also the amount of food you're

387
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,200
giving them a lot of stuff will depend

388
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,879
on what makes also the medium i was

389
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,720
going to say if you are you're in cocoa

390
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,838
are you in soil soilless mix what are

391
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,560
you doing that's going to make a big

392
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,120
difference also so get that ph dialed in

393
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,958
most importantly get your equipment

394
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,039
dialed in go clean some [ __ ] up clean

395
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,119
the fans clean the air conditioners go

396
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,319
clean your scissors maybe buy some new

397
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,879
scissors if you've been cutting a bunch

398
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,240
of clones maybe today is the day to buy

399
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,320
some new scissors if you're using a

400
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,919
sprayer to spray the garden clean the

401
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,760
[ __ ] out of that thing

402
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,919
another thing we can think about is

403
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,278
inventory do you have enough nutrients

404
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,120
to get yourself through the crop that

405
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,879
you're working on now do you have enough

406
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,720
gloves to get yourself through the crop

407
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,078
which you're working on are you prepared

408
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,839
for harvest are you about to cut down

409
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,679
some plants are you ready are you

410
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,040
prepared right at the first of the month

411
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,958
is always a good time to go take an

412
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,159
inventory order all the [ __ ] that you

413
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,759
need for the rest of the month that way

414
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,759
you don't have to stress about it that

415
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,198
way like on watering day when it comes

416
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,958
time to feed you're mixing up you got

417
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,879
your ph probe in there you're like i

418
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,479
need some cal mag you go ah [ __ ] i'm all

419
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,000
out of calmag you don't want to find out

420
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,079
while you're in the grow mixing [ __ ] up

421
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
go check right now go shake the bottles

422
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,319
go make a google doc go make a

423
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,160
spreadsheet uh go start making a list of

424
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,240
things that you use and then mark how

425
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,679
much is in each bottle keep track of it

426
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,759
figure out how often you got to buy it

427
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,278
how often you got to order it also this

428
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,799
will help you keep track of how much you

429
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,039
were spending in the garden then you can

430
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,278
determine how much you are spending per

431
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,039
pound or per ounce every harvest in your

432
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,120
grow all right i've rambled on enough

433
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,799
about the first of the month adjustments

434
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,399
uh let's move on a little bit another

435
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,879
thing that i did notice in my friends

436
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,559
grow yeah your grow bro we're gonna talk

437
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,399
about this real quick uh my buddy's

438
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,159
running three and five gallon pots in

439
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,320
his grow room he's got cocoa amended

440
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,559
with perlite in there he's got plastic

441
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
pots the plants look pretty good for the

442
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,239
most part there could be he knows what

443
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,838
he needs to do to make them look amazing

444
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,198
we don't need to air his business we are

445
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,839
going to call him out for one thing

446
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,519
though my dude is way over filling his

447
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,760
pots when you guys are putting this is

448
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,360
my recommendation you guys and gals can

449
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,879
do whatever you want in your grow but my

450
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,278
recommendation this may help you out

451
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,639
this maybe uh just my buddy's brain

452
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,360
[ __ ] really dinged when i gave him

453
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,839
this advice um

454
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,839
he fills the pots completely with coco

455
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,199
so let's just say that a five gallon pot

456
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,880
is this tall it's not but we're going to

457
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,559
say that the five gallon pot is this

458
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,958
tall my dude had cocoa to here like it

459
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,638
was to here it was almost falling out of

460
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,919
the pot and i was like bro why'd you put

461
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,440
so much cocoa in there and he's like

462
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,360
it's a five gallon pot why wouldn't i

463
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,880
put five gallons of cocoa in there it's

464
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,360
like that's a really good thought

465
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,639
process but how am i gonna water this

466
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
[ __ ] and he's like what and i was like

467
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
i'm pouring in water and it i have to

468
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,638
stand here and just [ __ ] wait for it

469
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,919
dude so i've got my watering container

470
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,680
and i'm pouring in the water it's gonna

471
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,599
need somewhere between probably like a

472
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,958
half to maybe uh two-thirds of that

473
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,480
gallon of water that i've got but

474
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,479
instead of just being able to pour it in

475
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
there it's like running off the top of

476
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,639
the pot because he's got it so full in

477
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,000
that cocoa it's not hydrophobic but it's

478
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,519
packed in there pretty well to where i

479
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
can't absorb it as quickly as i want to

480
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,078
pour it if if my dude would have left i

481
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,000
don't know maybe an inch maybe two

482
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,679
inches maybe an inch and a half of space

483
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
at the top of that pot maybe just a half

484
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,958
an inch i'd be able to just pour that

485
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,440
water in and it would spread across the

486
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,359
top and then puddle down in there evenly

487
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,839
but instead i'm over there just [ __ ]

488
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,600
trickling water in so my advice to you

489
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,040
just leave a little bit of space so that

490
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,639
that way we can get some water in the

491
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,639
pot you just pour that water right on

492
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,399
there keep moving keep going keep

493
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,600
growing all right i've rambled on enough

494
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,078
i did say i was going to answer some

495
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,879
emails let's jump into the email portion

496
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,039
of this podcast this one comes from my

497
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,879
friend wickednuggs what's up wickednuggs

498
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,439
thank you for the great question

499
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,399
it does go on and it does say i was just

500
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,480
listening to episode

501
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,600
651 you're way behind brother ah maybe

502
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,278
you're caught up and going back but

503
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,440
thanks for listening it says and i had a

504
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,838
couple of questions how does a breeder

505
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,399
find a gem bag seed and create a new

506
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,880
strain from it not knowing the lineage

507
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,320
of that genetic strain and start

508
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,240
breeding from it that's a really good

509
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
question it says i love the show and i

510
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,720
listen to it during the grow during the

511
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,480
busy work life in the airpods and it

512
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,480
feels like i just gained so much

513
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,039
knowledge and helps pass time and i

514
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,480
learn and take notes

515
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,759
and that's what i'm thinking about when

516
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,038
i'm doing the show i'm usually thinking

517
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,480
that people are either watching on

518
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,640
youtube or they're working with me in

519
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
their air pods so big up for uh letting

520
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,520
me know that i'm getting you through a

521
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,798
work day that's what i used to do when i

522
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,400
was at the commercial grows i just put

523
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,400
on the airpods and there was something

524
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,160
good in the ears and just jam all day

525
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,600
and it would keep uh when people see two

526
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,519
airpods in they know that you're not

527
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,318
supposed to talk to you so that always

528
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,759
made life easy uh it goes on uh learning

529
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:29,200
a lot of knowledge thank you bro i'm

530
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,200
glad to hear that you're learning and

531
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,640
taking notes uh that's what the goal is

532
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,480
here is to teach people get everybody

533
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,960
grown the best herb they can grow so

534
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
thank you for that um

535
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,720
then it says thanks for all you do ross

536
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,120
to jeff keep up the growing p.s i gave

537
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,279
my mom a hug for you sincerely wicked

538
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,678
nugs big up bro thank you now let's talk

539
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,279
about the question the question is how

540
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,280
does a breeder find a gem bag so you

541
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,079
didn't breed from it not knowing the

542
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,160
lineage of that strain

543
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,759
um that's a good question

544
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,120
and i've got a couple of different

545
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,798
thought processes on that first of all

546
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,479
if it's a good strain if it's a good

547
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,918
plan you can tell

548
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,558
it doesn't matter

549
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,160
at all what the history genetics lineage

550
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,639
story behind it is

551
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,640
when a grower grows a plant

552
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,400
ah we just go oh [ __ ] that's the one

553
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,919
sometimes you just know sometimes you

554
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,240
know that's not the one sometimes you

555
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
hope it's the one sometimes you really

556
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,000
really know that that's the one and if

557
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,000
it's a random plant that nobody knows

558
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,759
really the story of it maybe it's just

559
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,079
if it came from a bag you know at least

560
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,759
one half of it it came from this bag

561
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,119
that's called this you know half of it

562
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,079
probably

563
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,119
but

564
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,199
um

565
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,119
now it's too easy to know all the stuff

566
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,880
back in the day so let's talk about a

567
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,279
very famous cross let's talk about our

568
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,000
very famous very very famous strain that

569
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,678
happened a lot like this i recommend um

570
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,839
after you listen to this podcast i

571
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,919
recommend checking out the legend of

572
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,319
chemdawg and the 13 beans if you're a

573
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,080
cannabis enthusiast a strain hunter a

574
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,359
pheno hunter that is something i

575
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,038
recommend you check out because that

576
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,639
will correlate very well with what i'm

577
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,440
about to say

578
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,360
so

579
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,840
um chem dog all of the chem dog line was

580
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,319
bag seed to be if you want to talk about

581
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,199
bag seed so this dude chem bought some

582
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,519
weed and in that weed were seeds and he

583
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,919
grew them and he found 13 seeds and out

584
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,319
of those 13 seeds some were boys some

585
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,919
were females some he still has

586
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,918
some of those famous plants that came

587
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,440
from that were the original chem dog the

588
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:30,799
chem 91 the chem d the kim's sister all

589
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,798
of those came from that bag of seeds and

590
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,879
we are all breeding all of the breeders

591
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,639
i know everybody that's bred some stuff

592
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,400
is breeding to one of those plants we're

593
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,880
breeding with one of those because

594
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
that [ __ ] is fire the only thing we know

595
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,080
about it

596
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
well since since it got so popular and

597
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,639
since cannabis culture has blossomed and

598
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,240
developed we know a lot more about it we

599
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,640
don't know the exact genetics we know

600
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,919
that a guy named i know his real name i

601
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,320
almost said it sorry bro i almost said

602
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,080
your real name a guy named kim got some

603
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,319
weed from some guys in colorado and

604
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,918
those guys called the weed the dog bud

605
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,839
um they called it the chem weed because

606
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,440
it smelled like chemicals and when you

607
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,519
smoked it it would make you roll over

608
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,080
like a dog so one guy called it dogweed

609
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,440
the other guy called it chemweed um

610
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,079
these guys met up at a grateful dead

611
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,919
concert they traded some of it later on

612
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,199
uh chemdaw got home and he called them

613
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,799
and he's like can you send me more they

614
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,798
mailed more of it from colorado kim

615
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,400
found seeds in it that's basically

616
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,200
that's the story the other guys don't

617
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,600
know

618
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,720
the origin genetics lineage or history

619
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,879
of these plants allegedly possibly maybe

620
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,400
so that's bag seed at that point when

621
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,400
chem dog got it and started breeding

622
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,720
with it it was just bag seed but he knew

623
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,640
the wheat it came from was [ __ ] fire

624
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,319
so that's all he had to go on then he

625
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,400
grew the plants

626
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,119
once the plants were grown some of them

627
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,400
were amazing that's why we all know chem

628
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,158
dog chem d chem 91 kim's sister

629
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,919
we've all smoked most of us have smoked

630
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,760
all of those if you're in a an area

631
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,360
where cannabis has any sort of

632
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,279
legalization you've probably smoked

633
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,038
those or something that somebody grew

634
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,119
and tried to tell you was that but

635
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,879
they're really prolific and dominant

636
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,558
strains in the cannabis industry so

637
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,919
we've all and a lot of the breeders have

638
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,359
gotten their hands on them too once you

639
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,200
see a plant like that and you grow it

640
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,798
and you smoke it you know that is

641
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,279
something you want to breed to just like

642
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,720
uh pick my king solomon when i saw that

643
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,558
i was like that's the dude right there

644
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,400
that's the guy to breed to and then when

645
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,558
i saw strawberry starburst i was like

646
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,400
that needs some pollen on it you just

647
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,599
it's a breeder intuition so the question

648
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,480
is how do you breed to it without

649
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,918
knowing the genetics or anything um you

650
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,440
don't need to know it's real it's really

651
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,000
cool to know the history it feels really

652
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,759
nice it's uh it feels good it's a lot of

653
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
cool details but you don't need to know

654
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,480
that we were breeding plants and

655
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,159
crossing cannabis plants long before we

656
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,038
knew all this fancy stuff a lot of us

657
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,400
are spoiled now the new generation

658
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,879
i'm a little bit older than a lot of the

659
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,559
youngsters out there but i am also part

660
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,159
of the internet generation where i'm

661
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,000
freaking spoiled where i could go on the

662
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,240
internet and type in i want to find

663
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,919
these cannabis seeds at 45 websites will

664
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,759
come up and i can order them luckily

665
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,360
i've got some i got a couple of friends

666
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,798
in the seed industry so i can get but

667
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,959
basically whatever seeds i'm searching

668
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,639
for but we're spoiled now back in the

669
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,558
day you had to get whatever seeds you

670
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,919
got if you got some bag seeds you had to

671
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,519
accept those and grow them if you got

672
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,200
some clones you just had to hope they

673
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,960
were good whoever selected those clones

674
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,840
did a good job for you now we're

675
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,279
freaking spoiled so um the answer is

676
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,798
just do it bro if the plants look

677
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,240
amazing if they have the traits you want

678
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,240
it's all about observation it's all

679
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,079
about knowing what traits you're looking

680
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,759
for knowing the goal having a goal

681
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,519
understanding the plant

682
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,798
understanding pairing what plants are

683
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,639
you going to put that to what does this

684
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,639
plant offer in a mix how are you going

685
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,400
to complement the other plants what are

686
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,679
you going to do and then of course

687
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,000
growing them out and testing the

688
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,759
offspring is another big part of it but

689
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,919
by not knowing the lineage and genetics

690
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,599
how do you start breeding from it um

691
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,280
throw some pollen on it bro and see what

692
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,719
it does that's the best way to do it

693
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,879
that's one of the funnest things about

694
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,720
breeding and growing weed just seeing

695
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,080
what the outcome is after you do some

696
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,759
crazy [ __ ]

697
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,599

you brother we're almost to 750 episodes

711
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,279
you guys it says come a long way since a

712
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,558
couple of years ago yes thank you for

713
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,720
noticing uh we're doing 4k video

714
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,639
sometimes it's multi-cam when both cams

715
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,079
want to cooperate uh when i feel like

716
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,679
[ __ ] with both of them sometimes i

717
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,599
just want to smash camera two right onto

718
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,080
the floor but we're gonna keep the vibe

719
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,399
the vibes positive here it says anyway

720
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,399
um i had a quick question about male

721
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,480
selection i can answer this question

722
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,640
really thoroughly when you make regular

723
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,720
seeds and you find a male you really

724
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,840
like do you have clones of that mail as

725
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,600
a backup or is that mail used once and

726
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,599
then you find a new mail to work with

727
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,719
for example when you discuss king

728
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,199
solomon

729
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,038
do you have a backup clone of him thanks

730
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,240
in advance stay irie my bro peace excuse

731
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,798
me for burping in the middle of your

732
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,798
message peace from buzzards bay buzzards

733
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,480
bay thank you for the great question um

734
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,720
so a lot of you may not know a lot of

735
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,480
you may know so i'm the head breeder the

736
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,400
sole proprietor of ivory genetics

737
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,000
premium seeds and i do make a lot of

738
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,759
seeds you may know you may have heard

739
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,960
about my male plant known as king

740
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,960
solomon it is in a rise f1 male i've

741
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,400
named him king solomon

742
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,558
if you research king solomon you'll get

743
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,400
the joke behind that uh but king solomon

744
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,960
makes a lot of plants our friend

745
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,880
buzzards bay is asking do i keep a

746
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,600
mother plant or a father plant if you

747
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,080
will of king solomon or do i find a new

748
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,359
one every time or do i have clones of

749
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,319
backups now that's a really good

750
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,879
question here is honestly how i do it i

751
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,439
do keep a plant of king solomon all the

752
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,200
time i've got one uh maine mother plant

753
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,798
that i keep it's a father plant i guess

754
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,240
it stays in a five gallon pot right

755
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,079
under the middle of all the lights in

756
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,440
the bedroom or in the mother room that

757
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,798
is where he chills that is king

758
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,200
solomon's spot

759
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,879
uh he'll get big he'll get bushy as soon

760
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,278
as he's big enough to start giving me a

761
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,799
few clones because i re i reclone him

762
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,038
every so often i talk about that

763
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,480
occasionally so i'll start growing him

764
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:13,919
i'll get a fresh clone of him let's just

765
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,079
say i just cut brand new clothes i got a

766
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,000
brand new clone of king solomon

767
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,439
put him into a pot grow him up as soon

768
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,159
as he's big enough to give me a cut i

769
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,440
take another cut um then i put that one

770
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,440
in a smaller pot and they just keep

771
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,038
going so i've always got one or two of

772
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,360
king solomon around just to keep that

773
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:32,000
one alive just because that's my gem

774
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,319
i've always got him around at least the

775
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,679
big one probably one or two other copies

776
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,639
of him as well

777
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,519
now

778
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,200
if i need clones for breeding from him i

779
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,639
generally take them from the biggest

780
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,240
plant i'll just go grab a few off the

781
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,759
biggest one because that one's getting

782
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,679
big it's gonna have to get cut down or

783
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,519
do something with it eventually i'll go

784
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,038
get as many clones as i need and then

785
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,480
i'll grow those out throw those into the

786
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,798
flower room so i can make my pollen

787
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,798
happen there um then when that one gets

788
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,119
too big cut him down let the next plant

789
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,359
keep going and just so basically i keep

790
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,038
one big father plant for approximately

791
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,199
three to six months depending on how big

792
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,278
he gets and how many cuts i need uh it's

793
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,080
a male so i generally generally only

794
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:12,798
need two clones of him at any time plus

795
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,798
a backup plus the mom so um yeah that's

796
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,879
how i do it probably keep one big plant

797
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,278
and i cut clones off that as needed and

798
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,039
then about every once or twice a year i

799
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,798
cut them down and start them over and

800
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,400
give them a fresh cut a bunch of clones

801
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,240
and keep the best two as the brand new

802
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,320
starters i wouldn't want to try to start

803
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,919
again from seed every time because i

804
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,000
know that king solomon's reliable

805
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,520
finding a male is a struggle uh maybe

806
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,880
not a struggle it's uh it takes a lot of

807
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,278
time it takes a lot of effort it's a

808
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,520
project it's a real uh it's work so

809
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,440
finding that male i have to grow out

810
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,720
seeds i have to eliminate the females i

811
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,400
gotta find the dudes that have the

812
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,720
traits i want then i gotta kind of

813
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,240
audition those and narrow them down once

814
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
i've chosen what i like then i have to

815
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,839
pollinate stuff then i have to grow that

816
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,759
