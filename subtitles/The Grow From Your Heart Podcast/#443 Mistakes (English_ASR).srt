00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,290
this episode we were going to talk about

41
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:00,389
some of the biggest mistakes that I have

42
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,490
made in a grow room before we get there

43
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,739
I would like to ask you for your email

44
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,780

45
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,590
mistakes or what is the biggest mistake

46
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,629
you have made in your grow

47
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,000

let's talk about some of the biggest

51
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,130
mistakes you have made in your grow room

52
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,810
I think by sharing our mistakes we will

53
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:24,459
do a couple of things first we will

54
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,050
humble ourselves we will remind

55
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,090
ourselves that we are human and we do

56
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,400
[ __ ] no matter how much you practice

57
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,229
no matter how good you think you are no

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,939
matter how prepared you are sometimes

59
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:36,848
[ __ ] goes wrong and we do make mistakes

60
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:38,590
I also feel like me coming on here and

61
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:39,068
talking about some of the major mistakes

62
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,379
I've made

63
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:43,119
as a beginner grower as an experienced

64
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:45,699
grower and I've even made mistakes in

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,319
giant commercial facilities I feel like

66
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:49,000
coming on here and talking about my

67
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,979
mistakes and admitting those mistakes

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,810
will build a better bond between you and

69
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:54,909
I it will give you a better trust with

70
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,098
me it will say hey that guy was a noob

71
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:58,359
Mac I made mistakes and it will show you

72
00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:00,459
that even though you were making

73
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,230
mistakes as a newer grower you still do

74
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,180
have the potential to become a great

75
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:06,729
grower you do have the potential to

76
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,379
become a commercial level grower so this

77
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:10,298
episode will build a better bond between

78
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,549
us this episode will help us build

79
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:14,769
confidence and this episode will also

80
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,680
humble many growers so let's talk about

81
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:20,170
some of the mistakes I have made in a

82
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,090
grow environment when I first started

83
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:23,828
growing I was really into using grow

84
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,629
tents it was a great setup for my

85
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,700
environment it was better than modifying

86
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:29,680
the house in which I lived so I started

87
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:31,869
with grow tents I started with one tent

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,790
then I expanded to two before you knew

89
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,009
it I had a tent with mother plants I had

90
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:38,919
a tent for vegging then I had two tents

91
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:40,899
for a perpetual flowering cycle most of

92
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,449
the time I did very well taking care of

93
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,299
my tents but those tents led to one of

94
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:48,879
my biggest mistakes I am not blaming the

95
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:51,099
grow tent in any way this was all my

96
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,469
fault let me tell you a little bit about

97
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,750
what happened all of my grow tents were

98
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:58,150
in one big room I liked starting the day

99
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,949
by opening all of the tents then I would

100
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,049
let the air from the fans blow around

101
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:03,818
the entire room and they would all get a

102
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:05,409
lot of airflow I felt like the plants

103
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:07,419
were really happy they were getting a

104
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:09,729
lot of fresh air there was no stagnant

105
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,138
air the humidity was just right the

106
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:13,840
temperature was just right in that

107
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:16,209
entire room my normal routine for that

108
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,250
room was to open all of the tents water

109
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,750
all of the plants leave the tents open

110
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,759
throughout the day so that they could

111
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,500
have a lot of nice airflow and

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,300
just before the plants went off for the

113
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,250
night I would go in the room and I would

114
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,810
seal up all of the tents that way my

115
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,670
flowering plants wouldn't get any light

116
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,930
in and by sealing the other tents I

117
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,730
would make sure that the light wouldn't

118
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,590
get out and do another preventive

119
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,090
measure to make sure my flowering plants

120
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,789
don't receive any light during their

121
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:40,959
night cycle most of the time that plan

122
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,120
worked perfectly

123
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,680
I had an alarm set if the plants were to

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,600
turn off at nine o'clock I would set an

125
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,949
alarm for 8:30 so that I could go to the

126
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,570
gross space I could make sure nothing's

127
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,189
wrong if anything needed water I could

128
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:52,959
water if anything needed adjustments I

129
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,250
could adjust it if any equipment was

130
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,930
failing I could see that it was messed

131
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,699
up and I could repair it then I could

132
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,259
close up those tents the plants would go

133
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,089
to sleep and I could continue with my

134
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,129
evening go to sleep wake up the next

135
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:05,919
morning open the tent and reset the

136
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:08,019
process one night I made a huge mistake

137
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm sure a lot of you can already tell

138
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:12,339
what I did I don't remember exactly what

139
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,639
happened because it was a long time ago

140
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:18,579
but I fell asleep with every tent in

141
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,979
that girl room open I woke up several

142
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:23,169
hours after my flowering lights had gone

143
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,780
off I woke up in a panic I knew

144
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,610
immediately that I had [ __ ] up I ran

145
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:29,979
to the grow room and just as I had

146
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,470
suspected my flowering lights were off

147
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,750
but the grow tents were all wide open

148
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,880
and all of my veg lights were still on

149
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,029
so my flowering plants were now

150
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,949
experiencing an interrupted dark cycle

151
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:44,079
now just in case we have some new

152
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:46,750
growers listening what I did is a

153
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,750
serious mistake interrupting the dark

154
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,420
cycle and all will create problems in

155
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,569
the grow I interrupted the dark cycle

156
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,939
for at least four to six hours so my

157
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,730
plants thought that it was daytime for

158
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:03,040
an extra six hours that day this is the

159
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,620
exact type of mistake that will cause

160
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,260
our plants to hermaphrodite this is the

161
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,620
exact type of mistake that will generate

162
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:13,149
unwanted seeds in our cannabis crop one

163
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,509
of the most important things to a

164
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:17,949
successful seedless cannabis crop is an

165
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,259
uninterrupted dark cycle and I

166
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:23,319
completely [ __ ] that up by falling

167
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:25,149
asleep with my grow tents open I was

168
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,219
still a fairly new and experienced

169
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:28,779
grower I wasn't exactly sure what to do

170
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,690
the only thing I could think of doing

171
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,729
was immediately closing up my flowering

172
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,139
rooms closing up those bedrooms and

173
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,270
making sure those plants

174
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:40,180
it back on their regularly scheduled

175
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:42,248
program I think that I got really lucky

176
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,759
that that mistake happened later in

177
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:45,340
Flour

178
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,189
because I got a few seeds but I did not

179
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:50,258
ruin the entire crop if that mistake had

180
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:52,960
happened earlier in Flour I would have

181
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:55,449
ruined an entire crop of cannabis that

182
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,489
entire grow tent that 5x5 grow tent

183
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,408
would have been filled with seeded

184
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,939
cannabis I would have wasted all of

185
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:03,098
those plants I would have wasted all of

186
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:04,689
that soil I would have wasted all of the

187
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:06,278
nutrients I would have wasted all of the

188
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:07,960
time that I had put into those plants

189
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:10,060
and I would have wasted all of the

190
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,799
electricity from the lights that I was

191
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,899
pumping into those plants I would have

192
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,340
had useless buds at the end and I would

193
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:18,158
have had a bunch of shitty seeds that

194
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:20,378
nobody wants so I got really lucky that

195
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:23,139
I made my mistake late enough in Flour

196
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:25,960
to not seed my entire crop but had I

197
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:27,968
made that mistake 10 or 14 days earlier

198
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,668
I could have potentially seeded that

199
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:32,588
entire crop so as a beginner that is one

200
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:34,990
of the first major mistakes I do

201
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:37,319
remember making I fell asleep with my

202
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:40,000
grow tents open and my veg lights

203
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,819
contaminated my flowering cycle and I

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,319
got a few seeds in my crop now a lot of

205
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,939
people may ask what happened to those

206
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,800
seeds what did you do with those seeds

207
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:49,960
those seeds in my opinion were

208
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,418
undesirable they were probably thrown

209
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:54,310
away I really don't like to give away or

210
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,438
share seeds that are made on accident

211
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,120
they come from a light contamination I

212
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,159
don't think that is good karma that is

213
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,228
not good practice don't give those seeds

214
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:03,759
out those are probably trash if you want

215
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:06,610
to do anything with them grow them

216
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,020
yourself don't spread those seeds and at

217
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,028
the time I was a medical marijuana

218
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:12,068
provider so I had a couple of people

219
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:13,240
that relied on me for quality products

220
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,158
we had a couple of friends that were a

221
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,899
little bit frustrated with me because

222
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:18,879
their medical marijuana supply for the

223
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,319
month had seeds in it they would put

224
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,520
their buds in a grinder they'd grind it

225
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,598
up and they're here ting ting ting ting

226
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,598
ting and they would just look at me like

227
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,759
you [ __ ] up but I learned I did make a

228
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,728
mistake and I know now to not fall

229
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,500
asleep with my grow room open so let's

230
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:35,439
talk about another mistake I have made

231
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,599
in the grow room one time I mixed up a

232
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,029
large batch of nutrients that were meant

233
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,158
for a flowering room this flowering room

234
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:44,948
had just been flipped to the flowering

235
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,289
phase in that nutrient mix I added a

236
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:47,849
product that is used to encourage and

237
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:51,809
promote

238
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,759
rapid onset of the flowering phase that

239
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:55,619
would have been perfect for my freshly

240
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,419
flowering plants it would have sped them

241
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,610
up we would have seen bud set a little

242
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:01,469
bit sooner that product also slows down

243
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,149
the stretch so I thought I was doing a

244
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,810
really good thing it worked out

245
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,730
beautifully

246
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,139
I fed those flowering plants that mix

247
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,269
went about my business

248
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,250
everything was I read when I was done

249
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:14,039
watering that flowering room I mixed up

250
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,049
nutrients to water my veg room I don't

251
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,929
know how it happened but I got mixed up

252
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:21,809
and I used the wrong bucket to water my

253
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:24,120
veg plants so I accidentally poured that

254
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:27,089
product that is used to initiate flour

255
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,210
onto my vegetative plants which

256
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,399
triggered them to flower so at that

257
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,860
point I had plants underneath a

258
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,559
vegetative light in a veg room on a veg

259
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,090
schedule that were showing full pre

260
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,399
flower these plants were starting to

261
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,980
show the little dandelion bud sets while

262
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,129
they were in veg and that was all caused

263
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,710
by one incorrect feed with one incorrect

264
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:51,659
product it doesn't sound like a big deal

265
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,480
that maybe some plants flowered 10 maybe

266
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,429
14 days maybe 21 days early but think

267
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,519
about this where are they gonna go

268
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:02,219
my flowering room is filled I can't turn

269
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,809
my bedroom into a flowering room to

270
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,940
accommodate these plants because that is

271
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:07,289
where I keep my mother plants so now

272
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,060
I've got plants that are going into

273
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:11,730
flower and I don't have room for them

274
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:13,589
for it at least 10 maybe 20 more days

275
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,539
depending on when that crop in front of

276
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,610
them finishes so I was in scramble mode

277
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:20,309
I had to figure out what to do with my

278
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,930
next crop was I going to sacrifice that

279
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:23,250
crop because I ruined it was I just

280
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:25,169
gonna scrap it and throw all those

281
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,700
plants away and cut fresh clones and

282
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:28,500
then wait the two weeks for the clones

283
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,030
to root and then wait two or three weeks

284
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,220
for them to veg to catch up to the size

285
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,289
they were at that rate I'll fall behind

286
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,060
on my perpetual schedule and I won't

287
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:38,039
have plants in the room and I'll have a

288
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,389
room empty for two weeks then the crop

289
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,039
that is supposed to come up right behind

290
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,899
that that is probably already in the

291
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,909
cloner is going to be behind it's going

292
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,919
to throw everything off rhythm so by

293
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:49,379
accidentally feeding my veg plants the

294
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:53,039
wrong nutrients I [ __ ] everything up

295
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:55,169
in my grow for at least two full cycles

296
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,269
I had to rethink everything had to

297
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:59,699
reschedule everything I had to regroup

298
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:01,769
and start fresh and get a whole new plan

299
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,230
for the rest of the year for my

300
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:06,779
and yes I do have my grow spaces planned

301
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,360
out for at least the next six to twelve

302
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,549
maybe 18 months if you are growing on a

303
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,470
production schedule you should know what

304
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:15,599
is happening for at least the next two

305
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,700
or three maybe four or five crops in

306
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,769
your grow when you think about it a

307
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,500
flowering cycle eats up two full months

308
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:25,110
so you can plan an entire years worth of

309
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,629
growing just by thinking about three to

310
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:30,240
six full cycles if you are going to run

311
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:33,389
a nine week flowering cycle in your

312
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,960
flowering room you can pull five point

313
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:38,909
seven harvests per year but that is only

314
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,670
going to work if you were on a very

315
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:43,829
tight schedule if you run a sixty day

316
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:46,949
cycle you will be able to pull off six

317
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:49,800
full crops but only if you do not miss

318
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,870
one single day in that flowering room so

319
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,399
in my world scheduling is very important

320
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,129
when it comes to commercial growing

321
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,019
scheduling is extremely important so

322
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:00,720
that was a huge mistake that I made I

323
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,610
fed my vegetative plants flowering

324
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,889
nutrients and it sent those little

325
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,289
[ __ ] into flower way too early which

326
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:09,960
caused chaos in my grow room for at

327
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:11,009
least two more full cycles so be very

328
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,810
careful when you're mixing your

329
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:15,210
nutrients for your plants and pay very

330
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:17,639
close attention to each product you pour

331
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,570
into your solution you guys this is

332
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,279
starting to feel kind of like a

333
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,680
confession or something like I am over

334
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,569
here admitting all of my grow room sins

335
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,039
or something let's keep going I do have

336
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,990
quite a few more mistakes that we can

337
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,909
talk about let's talk about a mistake

338
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,850
that I have made once or twice and I

339
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:34,829
will never make again I have made the

340
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,050
mistake of getting a clone from either a

341
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,820
friend or a dispensary and I brought

342
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:41,339
that clone into my grow room without

343
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,970
treating it for every pests and pathogen

344
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,160
imaginable that is a huge mistake if you

345
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,850
ever get a clone from a dispensary or a

346
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,299
friend

347
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,879
be sure to treat that clone for every

348
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:56,639
pests and pathogen that you can imagine

349
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,740
before introducing that clone to the

350
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,009
general population in your grow

351
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,379
environment I strongly recommend

352
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:06,899
treating any incoming plants for pests

353
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:09,689
and pathogens before they are introduced

354
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:12,659
to general population I suggest keeping

355
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:15,000
any new plants in quarantine for at

356
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,328
least a week until you can be sure they

357
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,730
are

358
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:20,578
problem-free so whenever you get a new

359
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,379
plant treat it for pests and pathogens I

360
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:23,729
don't know your integrated pest

361
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,039
management program

362
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,019
I don't know how organic you want to be

363
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,028
I don't know how nuclear you want to go

364
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,058
but when you bring in a new clone I

365
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:35,548
suggest blasting the [ __ ] out of it for

366
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:37,708
every problem you can imagine treat it

367
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,838
like it does have bugs and powdery

368
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:41,458
mildew keep that clone away from your

369
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,679
mother plants keep that clone away from

370
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,938
your veg plants try to wash your hands

371
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:46,470
and change your clothes before you

372
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:48,480
interact with the rest of your garden

373
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,730
until you are certain that that new

374
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,639
incoming clone is pests and pathogens

375
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:56,159
free I like to call that setting

376
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,198
yourself up for success the minute you

377
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,139
get that clone is when your success can

378
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,909
begin or when your failure can begin you

379
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,129
do have the option to get super excited

380
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:07,230
and race home with your new plant and

381
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:09,389
put it in a new pot so it matches all of

382
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,920
your other plants put a nice fancy label

383
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:12,720
on it so it's got a cute name on it and

384
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,068
then put it right in the grow room right

385
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,449
next to all of the other plants so that

386
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:17,458
it can look just like the rest of your

387
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:19,019
garden now you're super excited look I

388
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,308
just got a brand new cut of this plant

389
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,499
it looks gorgeous

390
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:24,118
then about three to five maybe seven

391
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:25,470
days later you start noticing that

392
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:27,629
there's some weird [ __ ] happening in the

393
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,459
grow why are these leaves yellow why is

394
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:31,409
this plant drooping what's going on over

395
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,088
here you know what's going on over here

396
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:34,649
you just brought in russet mites and

397
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:36,540
they came from that clone but you did

398
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,639
not quarantine that clone that you did

399
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:40,798
not spray that clone that you are not

400
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,499
responsible with so my advice my

401
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:45,629
guidance to you is to treat every single

402
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:48,058
plant coming into your grow as if it

403
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:51,869
were infested with every bug imaginable

404
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:54,328
and every sort of pathogen imaginable it

405
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:56,399
is really easy to treat one plant but it

406
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:58,948
is a pain in the ass to treat the entire

407
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,259
garden so get that one plant spray the

408
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:03,118
[ __ ] out of it quarantine it inspect it

409
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:04,829
for four or five maybe seven to ten days

410
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:06,778
and once you are absolutely sure that

411
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:08,758
that plan is clean put it in general

412
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:10,769
population let it be a part of the grow

413
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,318
all right those were some mistakes I

414
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:15,418
made as a rookie grower let's move into

415
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:18,269
some things that I have [ __ ] up in a

416
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:21,568
commercial facility yes I am responsible

417
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:23,339
for large commercial facilities a lot of

418
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:25,828
the facilities I work with have around

419
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,809
100 flowering lights some of the

420
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:28,829
facilities I work with have as many as 5

421
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:31,079
to 700

422
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,840
flowering lights that gives me a lot of

423
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,540
opportunity to make a lot of mistakes I

424
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,340
do my best to minimize mistakes I keep a

425
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,199
lot of notes and I try to pay a lot of

426
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,210
attention and I try to follow a lot of

427
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,240
standard operating procedures but

428
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,800
sometimes [ __ ] does go wrong so let's

429
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,950
talk about some of the things I have

430
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,659
[ __ ] up any commercial grow facility

431
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,910
it seems to be a tradition that when I

432
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,519
take over a new facility that the way I

433
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:58,919
Chris in that facility is by flooding

434
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,960
the [ __ ] out of that facility I like to

435
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,789
see how much water a building can hold I

436
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,070
like to test the floor drains in a

437
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:07,199
building as soon as I take over I don't

438
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,790
know why but it seems like as soon as I

439
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,550
take over a grow within the first two or

440
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:14,069
three weeks I always tend to flood the

441
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:16,469
damn facility we usually have something

442
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:19,350
like a usually at least a 100 gallon

443
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,550
reservoir maybe a 250 maybe a 500 gallon

444
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,730
sometimes when were working with a

445
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:25,979
thousand or a 2500 gallon reservoir and

446
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,170
it takes a really long time to fill

447
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,180
those reservoirs I've got this really

448
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:32,069
good habit of turning on the water and

449
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:34,649
deciding I'm gonna go do some other [ __ ]

450
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,900
while this fills up and then it feels

451
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:38,370
like it's usually two three minutes

452
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,590
right after that thing is filled I

453
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,899
realize hey I left water on and I've got

454
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:45,090
a thing filling up and I go running back

455
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,370
and guess what there is a [ __ ] flood

456
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:49,200
in the hallway that is like my gift that

457
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,820
is one of my super moves I don't mean to

458
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,620
do it it's usually not that big a deal

459
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,600
you just get a couple of squeegees and a

460
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,610
mop and you open the doors get some fans

461
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,860
just get everything dried it's just a

462
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,960
setback but it seems to be a tradition

463
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,090
and it's sort of like a way of me I

464
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,519
don't know maybe I'm making my mark

465
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,470
maybe I'm hazing the new facility but

466
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,000
whatever it is it feels like whenever I

467
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,640
get comfortable about that two-month

468
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,470
mark I really enjoy just overflowing the

469
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,600
reservoir and flooding the [ __ ] out of a

470
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,819
new facility now it may not sound like

471
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,799
overflowing or reservoir is a huge deal

472
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,779
to a lot of people but keep in mind when

473
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:23,639
I work in a commercial facility some of

474
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,490
my water supplies can put out

475
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,590
approximately 30 to 50 gallons of water

476
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,980
per minute so I've got the opportunity

477
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:34,649
to put 30 to 50 gallons of water on the

478
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,720
floor in as little as one minute so that

479
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,690
can cause a huge problem really quickly

480
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,240
also I'm Way too experienced and I've

481
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,400
been doing this way too long to make

482
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,710
mistakes like overflowing a reservoir

483
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,080
that is day one [ __ ] but for some reason

484
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,090
I am still doing it so that is a major

485
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,949
mistake that I have made and it seems

486
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:55,349
like I will continue to make any

487
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,240
commercial environment let's talk about

488
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:58,589
one more mistake that I made and then I

489
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,058
should wrap this up so that I don't get

490
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:01,589
myself banned from working in the

491
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:03,000
commercial facilities people are gonna

492
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:04,678
be afraid to hire me because they know

493
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,170
that I [ __ ] up but at least I'm not

494
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,850
afraid to admit my mistakes so let's

495
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,890
talk about a mistake that I have made on

496
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:12,389
multiple occasions in multiple grow

497
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,770
environments I have done this in home

498
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,360
grows I have done this in small-scale

499
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:17,460
commercial environments and I have done

500
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,109
this in a large commercial environment

501
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,720
let's talk about something we like to

502
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:23,759
mess up quite often in a commercial

503
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,339
environment I suggest using cloning

504
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,720
machines an aeroponic type of cloner the

505
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,308
kind that sprays water up from the

506
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,558
bottom onto the plants to where it

507
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,149
creates nice aerated bubbles the plants

508
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,160
grow nice roots that dangle down into

509
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,200
the water that is the type of cloner I

510
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,360
prefer something like an EZ cloner or

511
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,100
the botanic air power cloner those are

512
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,349
my favorites they're all basically the

513
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,869
same but that is what I recommend in a

514
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:48,178
commercial environment the mistake I

515
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:51,209
often make with those easy cloner

516
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:53,220
machines is every day at the beginning

517
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,410
and the end of the shift I like to turn

518
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,870
the cloner off by unplugging it then I

519
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,929
lift up the lid and I put a pH meter and

520
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:03,599
an EC meter inside the water I like to

521
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:05,759
see what my pH is if my pH is off I

522
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,039
adjust it I also check and see what the

523
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,529
EC of that solution is if the EC is

524
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:12,509
incorrect I adjust it I also check and

525
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:14,308
see that the water level is just to the

526
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:16,890
base of the halo and that the sprayers

527
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:19,049
are not clogged after I have done my

528
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,000
full cloner inspection I've checked my

529
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,399
pH I've checked my EC I've made the

530
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,679
proper adjustments at that point I put

531
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,570
the lid back on the cloner and I plug

532
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,570
the machine back in and I go about my

533
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:32,369
business one big mistake that I used to

534
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,558
make way too often when doing my cloner

535
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:36,659
inspection was I would check everything

536
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,369
I would do all of my adjustments I would

537
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,110
write everything down I would put the

538
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:42,329
lid back on the cloner and then I would

539
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:46,558
walk away without plugging the machine

540
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:49,139
back in that can be a huge costly

541
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,599
mistake if I catch that mistake in one

542
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,400
hour I should be okay if I catch it in

543
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,199
two hours we'll be all right

544
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,038
three hours you're kind of pushing your

545
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,450
luck

546
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,638
you don't check on that cloner for four

547
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,288
hours you're gonna cause problems if you

548
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:03,928
don't check on it in five and six hours

549
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:05,970
shits gonna go wrong if you don't check

550
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:07,139
on it before you leave the facility for

551
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,999
the end of the day and you wait until

552
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:12,959
tomorrow to come back to start the shift

553
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:14,579
all of your clones are [ __ ] dead in a

554
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,409
commercial environment we don't cut a

555
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:19,019
couple of clones in a commercial

556
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:21,119
environment we generally cut a hundred

557
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,618
and twenty-eight clones and a minimum my

558
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:24,689
small corner is a hundred and

559
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:26,548
twenty-eight sites I like to fill that

560
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,070
I'm not going to cut half of it I'm

561
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:30,960
gonna fill it up so if I killed clones I

562
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:33,538
am probably killing at least a hundred

563
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,759
clones at a time now what can make this

564
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:37,979
even worse is a lot of times I've had

565
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,319
all of my cloning machines plugged into

566
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:42,298
one power strip and I used the on/off

567
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,058
switch on that power strip to turn them

568
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:48,210
all off and on during my inspection yes

569
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:50,489
I have plugged in five easy cloners into

570
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,379
one power strip I have gone and done my

571
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:54,538
end of the shift cloner inspection

572
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:57,058
everything was legit I put the lid back

573
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:58,919
on I wrote down that the pH was correct

574
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:00,210
I wrote down that the EC was correct I

575
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,769
wrote down that I just added a little

576
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,840
bit of clear res because we do that

577
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:06,358
every three to five days to prevent any

578
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,038
sort of algae buildup then I walked away

579
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:09,598
from all of those cloning machines I

580
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:11,579
clocked out and I went home for the

581
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:14,460
evening when I showed up for work the

582
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:17,220
next day I had five cloning machines

583
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,348
full of dead clones every single one of

584
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,440
them died because I did not turn that

585
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:25,048
power strip back on after I did my clone

586
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,739
or inspection that is a huge and costly

587
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:30,479
mistake luckily those clones were new so

588
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:32,999
they hadn't started routing it only sent

589
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:34,950
me back two or three days it also set me

590
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:37,409
back the amount of time that it took me

591
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,629
to recut all of those cloners worth of

592
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:42,028
clones I basically paid my staff an

593
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:43,408
entire day to cut a bunch of clones so

594
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:45,839
that I could kill them three days later

595
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:48,570
and repay them to recut all of those

596
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,970
clones all over again I'm very lucky

597
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:53,489
that in a commercial environment I had a

598
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,589
lot of very large mother plants to pull

599
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:57,778
those clones from in a smaller grow

600
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:59,819
environment your mother plants may not

601
00:21:57,778 --> 00:22:01,190
be able to provide enough clones you may

602
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,230
have been [ __ ] out of luck in that

603
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,629
situation so be very careful with your

604
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,819
cloners if you were using an easy cloner

605
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:09,599
if you're using a turbo cloner an auto

606
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:12,178
clone or any

607
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,730
sort of arrow cloner be sure to turn

608
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,160
that thing back on after you make any

609
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,710
adjustments and if you were using the

610
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,860
old-fashioned trays and plugs and domes

611
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:25,259
make sure you put that dome back on

612
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:27,000
correctly if it's got a little gap at

613
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:28,950
the edge all of your water will escape

614
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,569
your clones will dry out so that's

615
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,179
another mistake we can talk about I have

616
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:35,369
made several times in my grow career

617
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,200
let's talk about leaving the dome off of

618
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:38,729
our clones for way too long

619
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,740
say you've got a clone dome and it is

620
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,750
time to start burping your clones they

621
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,150
are just now developing roots we want to

622
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:47,400
give them 15 to 30 minutes of fresh air

623
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,140
every day we take that dome off we let

624
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,400
the air blow around then at about 30

625
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,470
minutes you go and you put that dome

626
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,298
right back on and then hopefully your

627
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,970
plants start to develop stronger roots

628
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:58,679
you increase that open interval a little

629
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,169
bit over time then eventually those

630
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,940
plants can survive without the dome one

631
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:05,130
mistake that a lot of people like to

632
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,200
make is you take that dome off and you

633
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,360
go get stoned and you forget to put the

634
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,650
dome back on you come back like two

635
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,928
hours later and your plants are all

636
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,269
crispy dead and dry that is a very

637
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:17,280
simple mistake to make in a grow

638
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,740
environment if you are going to take the

639
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,658
dome off of your clones set a timer

640
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,359
everybody is addicted to their iPhone

641
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:26,309
set a timer on your iPhone your phone

642
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,259
will set a timer without you pressing

643
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:30,298
any buttons you can ask your phone to

644
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:33,269
remind you when 15 minutes have passed

645
00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:35,400
you can say hey Siri in 15 minutes

646
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:37,769
remind me to put the lid back on the

647
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,509
clones and she will say okay in 15

648
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:41,490
minutes I will remind you to put the lid

649
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:43,798
back on the clones and you won't forget

650
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:46,169
we're all addicted to our phones use it

651
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,179
to your advantage so those are a couple

652
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,549
of other common mistakes that I am

653
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:52,470
admitting to having done way too often I

654
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:54,450
have killed clones by not plugging in

655
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,730
the clone machine again and I have

656
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,980
killed plenty of clones by not putting

657
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,230
the dome back on after their burping

658
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,750
period so don't forget about your clones

659
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,819
set a timer learn from my mistakes and

660
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,980
hopefully you don't have to suffer the

661
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,298
same traumatic experiences that I have

662
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,279
suffered in my garden

663
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:14,158
all right podcast world I think that is

664
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,048
enough grow room mistake confessions for

665
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,840
one episode I look forward to hearing

666
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:20,970
about your biggest grow room mistakes

667
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,369

anonymous I'm not trying to embarrass

677
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:42,150
anybody by doing an episode about

678
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,210
people's mistakes my goal here is to

679
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,890
help other growers to not make these

680
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,720
same mistakes that other people have

681
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,980
made and maybe if we tell them the

682
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,870
mistakes that we've ran into the

683
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,460
problems we've experienced we can give

684
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:55,139
them a little bit of warning and they'll

685
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,450
look out and not make the same mistakes

686
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,130
that we are making my ultimate goal here

687
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,590
