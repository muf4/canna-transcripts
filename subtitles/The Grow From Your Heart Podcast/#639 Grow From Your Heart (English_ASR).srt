00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,118
the start of the show let's jump right

54
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,039
into the email portion of the show

55
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,840
this one came to us from a person named

56
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
sam and it says you can use my name that

57
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,920
makes things a lot easier for me

58
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,719
i know i can just say this came from sam

59
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,879
and it says

60
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,239
i'm a relatively new grower thanks to

61
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,078
your podcast

62
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,000
it says i am a disabled veteran with

63
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,839
ptsd and a few years ago

64
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,040
i began discovering that cannabis is an

65
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,520
amazing medicine

66
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,880
and is much healthier of an alternative

67
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,879
to alcohol

68
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,399
uh first of all sam thank you for your

69
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,199
service i do appreciate what you've done

70
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
for the country

71
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,118
uh you've got some ptsd i know what

72
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
that's like it's probably different ptsd

73
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,639
but it still sucks

74
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,480
so bro thank you for your service and

75
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,159
thank you for the support on the podcast

76
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,919
and i'm glad you're growing now

77
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,840
it goes on to say also i'm glad you're

78
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,318
using cannabis instead of alcohol

79
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,840
i too am a uh i'm an alcoholic i haven't

80
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,759
had alcohol in a long time i'm not

81
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,959
tempted by alcohol i don't desire crave

82
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,719
or need alcohol but

83
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,239
there was a time in my life when alcohol

84
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,400
was a serious crutch

85
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,680
and i was not the best person i could be

86
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
i was kind of an [ __ ] to people

87
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,680
around me i was very irresponsible

88
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,439
wasn't responsible with my uh my words

89
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
my actions my health

90
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,959
my physical or mental well-being were

91
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,560
not important to me i've come a long way

92
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,000
since then and life is much better

93
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,159
without that poison in me

94
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,598
i understand the struggle it was uh

95
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,199
wasn't the easiest thing to quit i had

96
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,318
to get rid of friends and lifestyle

97
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,159
changes and [ __ ]

98
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,759

community

136
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,920
that is a cool place over there check

137
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,079
out the discord server there is a link

138
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,958
in the video description i'm going to

139
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
keep going

140
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,438
it says cannabis as a medicine is a very

141
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,679
well-known topic but i also wanted to

142
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,799
mention the therapeutic aspects

143
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,159
of the cannabis growing process i

144
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,120
completely agree with this i want to

145
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,359
keep reading but

146
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,358
i already want to say i fully agree with

147
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
that it says my garden has become

148
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,680
a haven for me that i use to manage my

149
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,360
stress and anxiety

150
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,040
it gives me something to research and

151
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
learn about when i'm feeling lost in the

152
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
world

153
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,680
and it helps me to know that i'm part of

154
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,319
a whole community of other home growers

155
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,478
out there

156
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,918
that many of them are veterans as well

157
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,800
and i have come as

158
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,839
i have come to learn yes i love that

159
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
whole statement

160
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,439
uh the garden should be your haven your

161
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,478
safe space

162
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,800
your moment of zen um

163
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,159
i was deeply immersed in the commercial

164
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,240
cannabis industry

165
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
since covid happened i have basically

166
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,319
backed out of all

167
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,840
of my commercial cannabis uh contracts

168
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,639
i'm not working with any facilities

169
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,239
right now

170
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
i don't go to any big places and you

171
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,519
know what i've never been more in love

172
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,918
with growing cannabis

173
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,159
my personal garden has not looked this

174
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,719
good in a long time

175
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,560
i was focused on a cannabis business i

176
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,600
was focused on production

177
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,199
schedules numbers weights potency

178
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,560
reports i was forgetting the thing that

179
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,720
i preach all the time

180
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,399
grow from your heart i was still doing

181
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
that but that was like seventh or eighth

182
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,679
on the list

183
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,439
it should be number one our friend sam

184
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,400
here is growing from his heart

185
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,959
because this plant this grow room is his

186
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,719
zen

187
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,879
it's his new playground it's the place

188
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
to go it's the library

189
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,240
it is the place where he could just go

190
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,120
and be himself i feel like when i go in

191
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
my garden

192
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,800
i put ear buds in and whatever i'm

193
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
listening to that's what i got in my

194
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,439
ears

195
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
i turn off the phone i got the phone on

196
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,399
case the daughter but i don't look

197
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,599
like if my daughter calls i'll answer

198
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,799
her she's about the only one i'm going

199
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,160
to answer in the garden

200
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,680
kids are important everybody else they

201
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,000
can wait i'm in the grow that is my

202
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,400
moment

203
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,360
of zen that is my time those plants need

204
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,679
my attention

205
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,000
that garden is relying on me and it's

206
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,879
just it feels so good it's my quiet

207
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,918
space

208
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,839
it smells good uh it's beautiful in

209
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,599
there if it's a snowy day outside it's

210
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,638
[ __ ] nice in the garden if it's a hot

211
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
day outside

212
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,240
beautiful in the garden it's always

213
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,399
about 78

214
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,759
79 degrees in there it's always just the

215
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,038
right humidity in there just depending

216
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,479
on what phase we're in

217
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,000
depending on which room i'm in but it's

218
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,959
never too extreme in the garden it's

219
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,879
beautiful in there

220
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,478
and i've got my earbuds in i either got

221
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,319
joey diaz yelling at me or chris

222
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,758
distefano telling me a dirty joke or

223
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
fish blaring in my ear

224
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,120
sometimes it's just dead silent in there

225
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,720
and it is beautiful

226
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,600
nobody can mess with me nobody can give

227
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,960
me any problems and then

228
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,160
the other thing i talk about and think

229
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,918
about is don't think about bills

230
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,600
don't think about problems if you've

231
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,519
been arguing with somebody if you

232
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,039
[ __ ] had a fight in traffic if your

233
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,240
neighbor's been being a dick if there's

234
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,000
something on your mind

235
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
don't carry that into the grow room with

236
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,918
you because you're going to put that on

237
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,120
the plants and they're going to be

238
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:54,959
stressed out too

239
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,720
so when i go in there i make it a point

240
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,399
to just close the door behind me and all

241
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,160
the [ __ ] out there

242
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,079
all the stuff out here in reality in

243
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,960
babylon gets left out here

244
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,800
everything in my grow is good vibes jot

245
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,038
love we don't think about that stuff

246
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
i'm not growing from my wallet i'm not

247
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,159
growing from my ego

248
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,439
i'm not growing for instagram i'll share

249
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,039
it with instagram

250
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,120
i'll put some money in my wallet after i

251
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,240
grow but that wasn't the intention the

252
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,560
intention is to

253
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,918
see this beautiful plant this amazing

254
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
product go from

255
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,359
point zero to point harvested dried

256
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,280
cured

257
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
and then either i get to consume it or

258
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,399
one of my friends gets to consume it or

259
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,079
a medical cannabis

260
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,359
consumer gets to consume it which is all

261
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,159
of us we're all medical cannabis

262
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,840
patients

263
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,000
one of us gets to consume that and we're

264
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,159
going to feel better

265
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,598
most of the time i feel good but when i

266
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,199
smoke i feel even

267
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:44,719
better and then when i don't feel good

268
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,280
and i smoke then i can feel

269
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,199
good and then even better so this plan

270
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,799
is very therapeutic it should be

271
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,319
uh it shouldn't be thought of as a

272
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,038
commodity as a product it should be

273
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
working

274
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,399
all the way from the beginning to the

275
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,079
end it should be building you up and

276
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,519
making you feel good don't let it get

277
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,399
stressful that's part of why i walked

278
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,079
away from the

279
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,758
large-scale commercial industry i could

280
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,240
go back i could do that but

281
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,479
i'm at a point where it was getting more

282
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,160
stressful than it was feeling rewarding

283
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,598
and just having my personal grow my

284
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,919
personal business

285
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,839
it's really there's more passion in it i

286
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,240
enjoy it i'm back to growing from my

287
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,638
heart

288
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,319
every plant i touch is growing with full

289
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,800
love because i could touch every plant

290
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
now

291
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,160
i can address every plant i don't have

292
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,280
to tell somebody go water those i'll

293
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,479
water these we'll hope they all get

294
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,318
watered by the end of the day

295
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,159
there's no stress i'm back to growing

296
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,919
pure with love from my heart

297
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,599
it's all about the love and enjoyment

298
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,120
now which i think will make all the

299
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,919
products better as well

300
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,278
so i want to get back into this um don't

301
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,158
think about your money don't think about

302
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,838
your wallet

303
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,038
don't think about how chicks are gonna

304
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,720
like you because you got weed don't

305
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,240
think about the drum set or the guitar

306
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,879
or the sneakers or the car you're gonna

307
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,159
buy

308
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,838
the video games you're gonna buy when

309
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,278
you sell that product don't think about

310
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,680
that stuff think about

311
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,958
it's like a meditation you start off

312
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,639
with the seed that doesn't have

313
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,559
it's got life in this little ball and

314
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,240
you brought it all the way to fruition

315
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,079
you get to harvest it and smoke it

316
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
that's weeks and weeks of nurturing and

317
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,720
meditation and growing you get to spend

318
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,039
with that plant

319
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,720
then while you're doing that you're also

320
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,919
meeting this whole group of people that

321
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,639
we've talked about the cannabis

322
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,240
community

323
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,399
you think well i wonder if my plants are

324
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,320
doing okay so you go to the internet

325
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,278
just compare your plants to others or to

326
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
get advice

327
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,320
and then you find this guy rasta jeff

328
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,439
and then you realize he's approachable i

329
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
can make friends with him and then you

330
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,839
realize

331
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,278
he's got a whole group of people that

332
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,959
hang out with them and made him a

333
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,120
discord server and you can chat with

334
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,719
everybody in there and so then not only

335
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,600
do you have these plants that are

336
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,278
uh zen meditative therapeutic and then

337
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
rewarding but then you make friends in a

338
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,360
community that

339
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,120
are also therapeutic rewarding having

340
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,639
friends is very rewarding we're social

341
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,399
creatures at least i am i can't shut the

342
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,399
[ __ ] up and i love having friends

343
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,080
so it does build a great thing being in

344
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,679
the garden the cannabis plant the

345
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,120
cannabis community is amazing you guys

346
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,559
already knew that i'm rambling

347
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,240
but this message meant a lot to me we

348
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,000
kind of get far from the point here

349
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,839
uh sometimes we forget our roots forget

350
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,399
our goals i wanted to go back and remind

351
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
myself and you guys that um we're

352
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,278
growing medicine

353
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,879
to nourish ourselves our bodies our

354
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,720
minds our spirits however you're taking

355
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,399
it i get all three from it

356
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,399
my body feels better when i smoke my

357
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,240
mind feels better and of course i use it

358
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,519
at rastafari i use it for meditation use

359
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
it for enjoyment

360
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,120
mind body spirit everything is feeling

361
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,200
better from consuming cannabis

362
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,399
we've got to remember to grow from our

363
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,120
hearts and not let

364
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,919
this plant be a commodity be a profit be

365
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,200
a product

366
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,519
i understand we have commercial

367
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,360
facilities and it is but go back to your

368
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,360
roots fall in love with this plant again

369
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,159
like i have i never lost my love but i

370
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
mean

371
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,278
now that i've given up the commercial

372
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,720
thing i've got more time to really love

373
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,360
these plants again i'm not thinking

374
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,519
about

375
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,159
time clocks and employees and schedules

376
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,159
and [ __ ] deliveries and manifests and

377
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,159
[ __ ] metric numbers and i don't mean

378
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,838
like the metric system i mean metric the

379
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,958
marijuana enforcement tracking and

380
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,560
regulation

381
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,319
something that we use here in colorado

382
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,719
and many other states it's one of the

383
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,399
worst

384
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,600
damn programs ever designed and it makes

385
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,200
people want to punch themselves in the

386
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,240
face repeatedly over and over all day

387
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
and i don't have to mess with that

388
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,159
because i'm not in the commercial

389
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,879
environment

390
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,399
more time to love the plants sam you got

391
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,759

392
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,879

going to edit because i'm human

396
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,278
it goes on it says there are times when

397
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,958
my mental state is in the dumps

398
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,919
and the only thing i look forward to is

399
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:22,239
trimming or watering or making edibles

400
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,240
uh yeah that is a lot of why i quit

401
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,839
consuming alcohol i was trying to grow

402
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,159
and also drinking and i would go out and

403
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,640
get

404
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,078
shitty drunk and you forget that night

405
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,439
that you got [ __ ] to do in the morning

406
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:32,879
right and you get shitty drunk and you

407
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
wake up and you go throw up and you

408
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,799
think

409
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,560
i'm gonna poop some blood and go back to

410
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,919
sleep but then you realize [ __ ] i got a

411
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,399
garden to go take care of and you gotta

412
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,319
go play in the grow room hungover

413
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,159
no thank you bro i would much rather

414
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,320
grow cannabis sober

415
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,078
not hungover no let's get in there i

416
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,480
mean i said sober but trust me there are

417
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,319
dabs and blunts and joints and bone rips

418
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
all those things are happening that's

419
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
all acceptable but i'm not getting drunk

420
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,078
anymore

421
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
i can't be in a grow room drunk be under

422
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,879
grow lights hungover

423
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,200
no effing thank you so yeah that

424
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,200
contributed a lot to me being a

425
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,120
non-alcohol consumer

426
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,480
and you're right having those beautiful

427
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,360
plants in there to wake up to it's like

428
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,720
having pets

429
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,560
that aren't going to [ __ ] on the floor

430
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
and run away it really is

431
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,399
my plants have never [ __ ] on the floor

432
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,958
uh i've had plenty of dog [ __ ] right on

433
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,559
the floor

434
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,399
so yes when the mental state is in the

435
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,000
dumps sometimes knowing that those

436
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
plants relying on me

437
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,440
really does help me out and i seem like

438
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,879
an upbeat positive happy-go-lucky dude

439
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,000
i've got a traumatic brain injury that

440
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,159
sometimes

441
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,440
uh there are some dark dumpy days for me

442
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,639
and you're right being in the garden for

443
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,240
a couple of hours

444
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,278
i'll go in there thinking i [ __ ] hate

445
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,399
the world i don't want to talk to

446
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:37,439
anybody and then i'll come out being

447
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,958
like i'm going to call some friends and

448
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,800
hang out because life is good

449
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,799
the garden is very therapeutic spending

450
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,559
time with all that living stuff in there

451
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,399
it is very therapeutic but don't don't

452
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,518
forget to get some real nature sometimes

453
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,919
as well

454
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,120
um there's more to this i didn't realize

455
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,759
when i started growing that it would be

456
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,440
a tool for me in so many ways it is

457
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,720
such a tool in so many ways the thing

458
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,360
you didn't mention that i think you'll

459
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,079
discover

460
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,600
next uh and your growing adventure is

461
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,039
that now that you're taking good care of

462
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,240
these plants and feeding the plants

463
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,319
carefully the next thing

464
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,240
that will fall in line is you'll start

465
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
taking better care of yourself

466
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,600
physically health-wise what you consume

467
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,120
what you eat

468
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,879
you'll start thinking about the products

469
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,560
you eat better but not only

470
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,240
the things you eat but where they came

471
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,958
from how they were made how they were

472
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,200
sourced

473
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,719
you'll start it'll just be you'll get

474
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
more aware you're going to get woke

475
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,879
because you're growing weed

476
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,078
and it's going to help you out it's

477
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,278
going to be good for you you're already

478
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,359
getting a

479
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,078
mental boost from this which is giving

480
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,120
you a spiritual boost from this the next

481
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,039
thing you're going to get

482
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,200
is a physical learning lesson you're

483
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,278
going to realize why do i spend

484
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
so much time measuring precise

485
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,240
millimeters

486
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,519
milliliters for products to feed my

487
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,198
plants but when it comes time for my

488
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,278
dinner i slap [ __ ] butter

489
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,719
and [ __ ] cheese a bunch of [ __ ] in a

490
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,679
pan and eat it like i'm [ __ ] gonna

491
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,040
live through anything

492
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,359
you'll start thinking well maybe if i

493
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,958
give myself the appropriate [ __ ] maybe

494
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,079
i'll thrive like my plants do and it'll

495
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,518
all click in you one day and you'll go

496
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,799
huh that's why i felt like [ __ ]

497
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,399
because i was just eating [ __ ] all

498
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,000
the wrong [ __ ] so that's the next thing

499
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,000
you're gonna realize i think

500
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,360
when it comes to your cannabis adventure

501
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,039
i know this is a really

502
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,320
off topic kind of a message but you guys

503
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,919
i really feel this is the way it goes

504
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,360
you start learning about cannabis

505
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,799
you get that connection and then you say

506
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,480
i'm feeding my plants i should feed

507
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,240
myself i see it happen

508
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,920
especially in commercial growers because

509
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,120
they're in the grow all day bust and ass

510
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,479
they got to work harder

511
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,320
they got to eat more and they see it

512
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
they just see the thing also i'm in

513
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,879
there talking about how i eat well and

514
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
maybe that inspires them but

515
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,879
that's your next move dude uh it's been

516
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,838
great for your mental health

517
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,278
um my therapist and i have even

518
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,000
discovered that oftentimes when i'm

519
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:35,838
lacking

520
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,679
and caring for my mental health i'm

521
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,000
lacking and taking care of my grow

522
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,278
area as well isn't that how it's a

523
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,120
reflection

524
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,559
the way you do something is the way you

525
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,159
do everything and when that

526
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,319
mental state starts going [ __ ]

527
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,399
haywire the garden starts showing it

528
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,839
it really reflects the whole life starts

529
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,159
looking like it's unraveled and then you

530
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,440
go

531
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,278
ah everything's out of control i got to

532
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
get my [ __ ] together you go clean up the

533
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,078
garden start cleaning up your life and

534
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,160
then guess what you start having better

535
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,198
conversations your mind is more open

536
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,958
you're more free

537
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,159
i start actually wanting to go places

538
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,439
because your brain feels good you want

539
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,439
to be around people

540
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,720
it will spark that for you i agree

541
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,279
completely

542
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,079
so my grow area has become sort of a

543
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,078
metaphor

544
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,078
in my life that i can use for measuring

545
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,759
as a measuring stick for taking care of

546
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,278
myself yes my friend if that garden

547
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,799
starts getting out of control

548
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,399
you gotta reach out to a friend and say

549
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,000
hey why am i doing this or maybe just

550
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,320
reach inside of yourself and say what am

551
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
i lacking what am i [ __ ] up on why am

552
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,680
i hating the world why am i hiding why

553
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,399
am i being a recluse again

554
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,758
get it going maybe call a friend maybe

555
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,120
not i don't know maybe do your thing

556
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,079
maybe sometimes calling a friend isn't

557
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,839
the best thing to do when you're in the

558
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,039
dumps maybe just drag them down too but

559
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,160
you know how to get yourself out of it

560
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,759
go in that grow

561
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,519
take care of business and feel the pride

562
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,839
of the grow then smoke a fat one

563
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,600
he wraps it up with all of that to say

564
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,519
learning how to grow from your podcast

565
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000

566
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,240

thank you for the great message this one

607
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,399
goes i've got a great question for you

608
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,160
do you grow your competitor's seeds for

609
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,880
either quality control standards

610
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,400
calling [ __ ] or just plain fun

611
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,799
that's a great question

612
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,199
the short answer is yeah bro i love to

613
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,599
grow my competitors seeds but the thing

614
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,439
is

615
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,719
i'm not going to call them competitors

616
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,000
let's call them

617
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,318
colleagues my friends my breeding bros

618
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,078
i don't find them to be competition we

619
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,119
all have businesses we all want to sell

620
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,879
seeds we all want to

621
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,038
[ __ ] make sales and do business but

622
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,080
that's not what it's all about

623
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,798
if a client or a customer came to me and

624
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,879
they said

625
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,000
hey i want this strain they list off a

626
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,840
few details

627
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,200
and that strain is not in my menu which

628
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,639
it probably is because i have a vast

629
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,919
menu with a lot of things and i know it

630
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,720
pretty well but if you say i want

631
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,960
something

632
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,640
and i don't have it i'll recommend

633
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,120
something from another breeder because

634
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,759
that is my job as a responsible grower

635
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,678
as a responsible community leader just

636
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,279
as a [ __ ] polite person

637
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,400
um and people have seen me do it and

638
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,079
they've been like bro that person would

639
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
have bought seeds from you and i could

640
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,519
be like yeah they would have bought

641
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
seeds but

642
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,839
they would not have gotten what they

643
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,440
wanted they would have wasted their

644
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,879
money and at harvest time they would

645
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,080
have been like man [ __ ] that guy he sold

646
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,000
me the wrong [ __ ]

647
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,759
instead they went and got the seeds they

648
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,119
wanted from one of my friends who's not

649
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,240
a competitor they're a colleague we're

650
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,399
all in the same gang

651
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,319
we're all in team cannabis they went got

652
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,038
the seeds they wanted from somebody they

653
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,639
grew them

654
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,240
and now they made two friends they said

655
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,759
damn these seeds are [ __ ] cool

656
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,120
and i'm glad that guy rosta jeff

657
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,879
recommended me though he could have

658
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,038
taken my hundred bucks and [ __ ] me and

659
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,720
just gave me something but instead

660
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,038
he said go over there and visit duke

661
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,558
diamond or go visit ethos or miss jill

662
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,839
because they've got what you're asking

663
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,279
for and he doesn't

664
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,199
i find that to be the way to operate

665
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,798
they're not my competitors they are my

666
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,440
friends we message each other on social

667
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:43,200
media

668
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,880
we talk we see each other at all of the

669
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,038
events we travel

670
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,559
we're all doing the same thing we live

671
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,640
and learn with each other

672
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,480
there are weird rivalries and some

673
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,080
people don't talk to each other and

674
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,599
i'd rather just not be friends with some

675
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,480
people but i don't got no bickering no

676
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,678
hate or no

677
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,360
nothing like that i don't talk [ __ ]

678
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,720
about anybody i don't have hatred for

679
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,240
any other breeder out there

680
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,160
if they don't like me that's cool that's

681
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,759
on them i'm down to be cool all the beef

682
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,960
is over in my opinion i'm [ __ ] too

683
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,640
old for that dumpster it's not high

684
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,640
school is what i think i'm getting at

685
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,160
uh i'm done with all the breeders they

686
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960
got nothing but love and respect coming

687
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,038
from me

688
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,558
so uh i do grow out their stuff because

689
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,400
we're all what like that's where seeds

690
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,918
come from if i keep growing all of my

691
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
stuff i'm just going to be growing my

692
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,000
stuff

693
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,519
so i've got to introduce other things

694
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
into the garden or i bottleneck my

695
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,759
breeding so

696
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,160
where else is other stuff going to come

697
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,160
from other breeders so yeah i do breed

698
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,440
and grow and test run other breeders

699
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,360
stuff

700
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,640
sometimes i'm amazed sometimes i'm

701
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,079
[ __ ] amazed

702
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,759
sometimes i'm amazed i'm like i paid

703
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,119
money for this [ __ ] and other people are

704
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,319
paying money for this [ __ ] and there's

705
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,678
not a [ __ ]

706
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,279
whole threat of hate speech on the

707
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,960
[ __ ] internet about this person after

708
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,639
paying good money for these seeds

709
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,480
i don't go and bash anybody i don't talk

710
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,200
that [ __ ] that's not my place

711
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,798
if i were to say that [ __ ] anything i

712
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,558
say if i were to say that

713
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,000
seed company and i don't want to make up

714
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,678
numbers because there's probably a seed

715
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,759
company called that right now

716
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,880
if [ __ ] macbook seed company sold me

717
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,720
seeds and they sucked

718
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,559
it wouldn't do me any good to go online

719
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,360
and say macbook seed company sold me

720
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,279
herms

721
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,199
that just looks like i'm trying to big

722
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,839
up my company so there's no need to bash

723
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,759
it

724
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,599
uh i just don't talk about it when i do

725
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,759
get a keeper when i do get a champion

726
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,959

727
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,640

to the people keeping the name alive

733
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,159
um but i grew some subcool stuff because

734
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,639
subcool

735
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,000
was one of my heroes like uh it's weird

736
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,759
as a 40 year old guy to talk about your

737
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,679
heroes but without sub cool and tga

738
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,038
genetics i wouldn't be irie genetics

739
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,880
roster jeff would just be

740
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,319
some random [ __ ] basement grower who

741
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,440
knows i'd be a musician probably you

742
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,200
would have never heard of me

743
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,120
i'd be a struggling ass musician or a

744
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,480
fake comedian i'd be a stand-up comic

745
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,038
that's what i would do

746
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,839
but without sub cool and tga i wouldn't

747
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,000
be here

748
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,678
so when subcool passed away rest in

749
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
peace subby big respect nothing but love

750
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,679
but when sub passed away

751
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,000
it was my duty to make some crosses in

752
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,840
honor of subcool so i bought the uh

753
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,519
i didn't buy i was given honestly i was

754
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,279
gifted some jack the ripper seeds from a

755
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,558
member of tga shout out to the person

756
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,399
who gave those to me

757
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,359
uh they don't need any controversy so i

758
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,480
won't say their name we don't need to

759
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,240
start all the emails but

760
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,759
i got some tga seeds from a friend i

761
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,880
grew them i found my keepers and i bred

762
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,359
to them so

763
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,440
that's a prime example of growing uh

764
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,959
people would consider tga a competitor

765
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,759
but that was a friend a colleague a

766
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,798
partner

767
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,279
um a teammate we're all on team cannabis

768
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,119

770
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,479

777
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,599
asking if i grow out competitor seeds

778
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,640
and i'm focusing more on the word

779
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,558
competitors

780
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,759

their own certain type of people and

793
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,279
it's all about the vibe that they

794
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
present so

795
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,279

796
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,159
from other breeders

797
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,960
um not for calling [ __ ] or qc

798
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,480
standards just

799
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,400

805
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,558

i'll buy a pack and run it just for fun

807
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,759
just to see what it does

808
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,759
sometimes i'll buy a pack and give it to

809
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,119
a friend and let them run it just to see

810
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,599
what it does because i'm that kind of

811
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,279
guy

812
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,639
i'm very curious i'm passionately

813
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,240
curious especially when it comes to

814
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,919
cannabis but also

815
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,359
i don't have a bunch of room so if i've

816
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,799
got a friend with some open space

817
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,319
you know who you are bro shout out for

818
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:51,440
running seedlings for me and finding us

819
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,879
some keepers

820
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,320
i just throw seedlings to other people

821
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,679
and they run [ __ ] for me to find us

822
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,639
stuff and then i go visit and check out

823
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,320
what they've got

824
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,159
and i help them pick keepers and

825
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,678
sometimes we disagree which means i get

826
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,240
one keeper they get the other cut a

827
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,919

834
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,720
other seed breeders stuff that's how i

835
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,279
find stuff for breeding

836
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,759
i'm growing the chem daily chem right

837
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,639
now which is chem d to i-95

838
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,240
from uh [ __ ] geez uh that one's from

839
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,520
jj from top dog right yeah

840
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,960
geez i almost forgot who that [ __ ] was

841
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,240
from i apologize for that i got so many

842
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,840
seeds i [ __ ] get lost

843
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,599
but i'm growing that one right now it

844
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,199
came from seed and it is fire that's a

845
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,000
breeder that's a keeper it's been bred

846
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,679
to

847
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,279
so that's where that came from just

848
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,120
about everything i've got came from a

849
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,759
seed eventually all plants came from a

850
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,519
seed

851
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,079
so the platinum tangy that i grow that

852
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,839
was a seed from garden of weeden

853
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,199
they somebody else found that but i mean

854
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,798
that came from garden of weed and the

855
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,080
strawberry starburst star the strawberry

856
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:53,278
fields i used to make strawberry

857
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,119
starburst

858
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,798
was a seed that started off as a

859
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,759
crockett seed i acquired the clone at a

860
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:59,679
commercial grow

861
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,359
but in the long run they are all seeds

862
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,960
so they all started from a seed

863
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,558
i'm rambling like a [ __ ] on that

864
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,960
answer now the answer is

865
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,918
yes bro i do grow other people's seeds i

866
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,600
love doing it

867
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,440
i like to compare i like to start my

868
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,519
seeds and their seeds at the same time

869
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,798
compare germ rates compare growth rates

870
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,079
just see what's going on

871
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:17,599
there are a lot of reasons to do it but

872
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,278
mainly because it's fun and that's how i

873
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,719
get some new [ __ ] to breed with

874
