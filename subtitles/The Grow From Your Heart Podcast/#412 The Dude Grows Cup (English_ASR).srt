walk in and you're allowed to sample all

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,020

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,959
competition a friendly little grow

167
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,180
competition so let's talk about the day

168
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,609
the day was great to drive up there was

169
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,530
a little hectic I had to travel i-25

170
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,689
anybody that knows about i-25 knows how

171
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,459
unpredictable that can be it was a great

172
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:52,500
drive until approximately Monument and

173
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:54,448
then suddenly snowstorm from hell

174
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,800
it was white just white you couldn't see

175
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,658

176
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,579

177
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,589
minutes then we got to Castle Rock after

178
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,149
Castle Rock it was sunshiny again it was

179
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:05,129
like we're on two different planets for

180
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:07,288
that drive it was kind of strange but we

181
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:08,848
made it we got there we got to the dude

182

188
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:24,089

196
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:39,269

200
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,540
dude Kelvin brought some strawberry

201
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,730

202
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,980

203
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,140
wasn't quite dried and cured enough to

204
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,420
be an entry for that Cup but it was

205
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:57,029
amazing product it smelled like tangi

206
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,290
plus oranges plus strawberries plus funk

207
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:00,149
it was really great

208
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,580
Kelvin actually had some of that flour

209
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:04,379
pressed I into our in a rosin press by

210
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,669
our friend Pedro's grow if you know

211
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,529
about Pedro if you don't know about

212
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,910
Pedro make sure you follow Pedro's grow

213
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:11,519
room on YouTube give him a follow

214
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,320
he pressed some amazing rosin out of

215
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,939
that strawberry starburst let me say

216
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,339
this here on the show a lot of times I

217
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,410
talk a lot of [ __ ] about rosin I am NOT

218
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,049
a fan of rosin most of the time it

219
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,320
tastes like burnt popcorn I cannot stand

220
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,850
the flavor of a popsicle stick or when

221
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,339
the doctor uses a wooden tongue

222
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,170
depressor it drill it drives my body

223
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:32,939
crazy something about the feeling of

224
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,100
that wood on my tongue it's making me

225
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,269
like shake and act weird right now just

226
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,770
thinking about it it gives me the chills

227
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:40,529
I do not like it

228
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:42,329
something about rosin has that flavor it

229
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,789
tastes like a popsicle stick or burnt

230
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:46,469
popcorn to me most of the time when

231
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,120
you're just taking raw flour and

232
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,700
pressing it it usually doesn't taste

233
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,230
desirable in my opinion to my taste but

234
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,120
that's just me I'm not a hater on you

235
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,210
and your rosin but what I'm getting to

236
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,600
is this strawberry starburst rosin that

237
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:01,680
Kelvin grew and Pedro pressed was

238
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,830
delicious I would go back for another

239
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,870
dab of that one right now so I owe a big

240
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,789
shout-out to first of all to Kelvin for

241
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,620
growing that strawberry starburst

242
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,210
like a champion that [ __ ] was it was

243
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,550
perfect he grew that sample that he gave

244
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:16,409
me to perfection and also I want to

245
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,509
extend a huge shout out to Pedro for the

246
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,160
marvelous job at squishing that product

247
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,930
most of the time like I said I'm not

248
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,090
impressed with the squish and that was

249
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,579
delicious even German from 5-8 was

250
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:28,799

favorite gifts and I hate to highlight

269
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,529
anything because it makes somebody else

270
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,780
feel lesser but somebody gave me a

271
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:07,549
street sign and it is I read genetics

272
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,990
Boulevard or I read genetics Avenue I

273
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:10,849
don't have the sign here but it looks

274
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,379
just like the street signs on the corner

275
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,970
you got the stop sign then right above

276
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:16,549
it it says the street I've got one of

277
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,560

299
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:56,719
environment so he needs to keep his face

300
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,250
off of the internet he can't be out

301

me get anywhere near white-eyed if my

404
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:59,179
eyes started to get white if I looked

405
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:00,920
like I didn't have cottonmouth properly

406
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,778
somebody passed me a joint somebody lit

407
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,878
me up a dab it was a great time I had a

408
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:07,490
bunch of fun and if you can't tell by my

409
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,199
voice I smoked a ton of product

410
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,870
yesterday and I want to give a shout out

411
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,729
to everybody the product is improving

412
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,980
your guys's flowers are getting better

413
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,110
the concentrates are getting better when

414
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,188
I used to go to events people would pull

415
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,389
out their concentrates and they'd be

416
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:21,389
like hey dude look what I brought would

417
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:23,639
you like to take a DAB

418
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:25,049
this and I would be backpedaling trying

419
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,850
to figure out how am I gonna tell this

420
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:28,799
guy I don't want to dab his concentrate

421
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,320
because that looks like [ __ ] motor

422
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,669
oil or some kind of poop soup is well we

423
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,560
used to call it and I really don't want

424
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:35,849
to either put that in my banger cuz

425
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,319
that's gonna ruin my nail and make my

426
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,450
nail taste like [ __ ] for the rest of the

427
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,800
event also I don't want a dab bat it's

428
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,240
gonna burn my throat and it's gonna make

429
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,500
my lungs taste like [ __ ] and also the

430
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,090
high from that is just gonna give me a

431
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,110
headache so back in the day I would be

432
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,850
trying to figure out how to politely

433
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,590
tell my friends hey I don't really want

434
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,120
to smoke your concentrate and I found

435
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,470
out that the best way to do it is to

436
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,090
just gonna be like oh man that looks

437
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,560
delicious have you tried this and then I

438
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,180
pull out my concentrates and I give them

439
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,409
a dab of that and I take a dab and they

440
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,879
kind of forget that they offered me a

441
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:02,100
DAB and then that's usually my way to

442
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,230
shake that off however I did not have to

443
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,389
do that at this event every dab that was

444
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,269
offered to me was acceptable and I

445
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:11,610
smoked it also every flower that was

446
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:14,009
offered to me I smoked it and I enjoyed

447
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,450
it I did not smoke any blunts if you had

448
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:17,970
something rolled in a blunt wrap or a

449
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,620
blunt I did decline on that my voice and

450
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,450
my throat took enough of a beating at

451
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,370
that show I did not really need to add

452
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,980
the tobacco blunt wrap to that and I do

453
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,110
not enjoy a blunt wrap at all honestly I

454
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,450
feel like we put a lot of time and a lot

455
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,700
of work and a lot of energy into growing

456
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,500
the finest cannabis we can grow we do a

457
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,680
lot of selections we select for flavor

458
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,480
for aroma for production trichomes and

459
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,489
then we wrap it up and basically what

460
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,050
tastes to me kind of like a toilet paper

461
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,730
tube you're just wrapping it up in a

462
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,559
cardboard tube with that blunt wrap and

463
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,820
I do not approve I'm not hating on you

464
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,559
if that's what you're doing do it if

465
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,629
that's your thing but I'm just not gonna

466
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,639
hit it when you try to pass it to me but

467
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:55,590
I was quite impressed with most of the

468
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,360
product that I saw at the dude gross Cup

469
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,220
this year I saw some product from out of

470
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,529
state it was quite impressive also there

471
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,930
are people in illegal states that are

472
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:06,000
really killing it with their grows and I

473
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:08,159
feel like here in Colorado we're kind of

474
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,080
cheating I can drive to the gross store

475
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,339
I can tell the guy hey I want this and

476
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,780
this and he puts it on the counter and I

477
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,730
pay cash for and I put it in my car and

478
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,709
I drove home or I Drive home and then I

479
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,360
use that on my cannabis plants that I

480
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,250
can talk about having there are six

481
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,470
plants legally it's not a big deal

482
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,929
everybody's got [ __ ] six plants there

483
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,879
are people in Ohio there are people in

484
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:28,979
Kentucky there are people all there are

485
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,200
people in every single state that showed

486
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,080
up at the dude grows cup with quality

487
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,590
product and they make us look like we're

488
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,160
cheating

489
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,269
yeah you

490
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:38,039
go to the girls store and get all the

491
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,740
[ __ ] real easily here that guy in Ohio

492
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,750
he's got a drive to his friend's house

493
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,948
and parked his car in the garage then

494
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,659
they pulled a friend's car out of the

495
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:46,349
garage they drive to the gross store in

496
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,299
that car

497
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,220
they discreetly do their shopping they

498
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:51,750
don't talk to anybody in there somebody

499
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,069
approaches you in the grocery you leave

500
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,169
in those sort of states you don't want

501
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:57,179
to get noticed recognized you don't want

502
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:58,378
to be there you go in you get what you

503
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:00,899
need you put it on the counter you pay

504
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:02,699
cash get out you drive that car around

505
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,379
the block a bunch of times then you

506
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:06,359
drive around other blocks a bunch of

507
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:09,600
times just to throw off your trail yes

508
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,970
you need to be extra paranoid in a non

509
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,439
friendly state so they drive around they

510
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,329
go back to the friends house parked the

511
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:17,219
car in the garage transfer the newly

512
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:19,349
purchased girl equipment from friend's

513
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,360
car to your car then you drive your car

514
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,670
around the block a few times drive the

515
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,930
really long way home drive around your

516
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:26,250
block a couple of times to make sure

517
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:27,899
there are no strange cars in the

518
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,269
driveway or no strange cars on the block

519
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,370
pull into the garage unload your [ __ ]

520
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,929
really discreetly in the night build

521
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,399
your grow room when nobody can hear it

522
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:37,078
nobody can see it it's a really

523
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,659
different thing when you're in a non

524
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:41,578
friendly state you guys in your friendly

525
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:43,198
states in Colorado in California

526
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:45,208
Washington Oregon anywhere you've got

527
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,039
grow friendly laws we are basically

528
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:49,198
cheating when it comes to entering aggro

529
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,938
competition we're a step ahead we're

530
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,919
it's so much easier we're getting we're

531
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:54,568
handicapping everybody else because we

532
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:57,599
can do it we don't have to hide it

533
00:16:54,568 --> 00:16:59,729
having to do it under under stealth mode

534
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,500
is a whole extra challenge that we don't

535
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,209
have to think about so keep that in mind

536
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,369
you guys don't take it for granted if

537
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,538
you are in a legal state all right I

538
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,038
feel like I mentioned a bunch of names

539
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:09,328

540
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:11,578

586
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,079
time almost time to start looking for a

587
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,308
larger venue the place was just

588
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:38,428
perfectly full I think it sells out at

589
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:40,139
350 I think there were 349 people there

590
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:42,540
I didn't count I'm just saying it was

591
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,160
perfectly full it was beautifully setup

592
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,720
I really enjoyed the event this year

593
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,730
every year it gets a little bit better

594
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,140
this year in my opinion it was damn near

595
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,779
perfect there aren't many things I would

596
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,160
change I had a really great time so I

597
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,049

604

aquaponics Steve Jenks proof and Scottie

606

607
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:17,220

608
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:18,779
hangout right there at my booth so come

609

eat all the cool cannabis people oh and

610
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,000
gern was hanging out quite a bit that's

611
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,819
a funny story

612
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,160
during the award ceremony Jaron from 5-8

613
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:27,928
new millennium nutrients decided to stop

614
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,870
by my booth and hang out and he was

615
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:34,830
taking a dab of kelvins strawberry

616
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,909
starburst rosin it was pressed by Pedro

617
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:37,589
it was hard for me to say strawberry

618
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,540
starburst rosin my brain didn't want to

619
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:40,889
go down that path he was actually taking

620
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:43,259
a dab of it when it was announced that

621
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,690
he won an award for his girl I think he

622
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,039
took third place for his entry it was

623
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,240
funny that he was taking a dad right at

624
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,470
time I was like hey you got something to

625
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,670
do bro you're gonna have to set that

626
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,620
down it's just really funny really

627
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,539
casual but if you're into the cannabis

628
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:55,859
industry if you were into the people who

629
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,089
were on podcasts if you're into all of

630
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:59,519
that stuff I think you would have a

631
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:01,049
great time at the dude grows show and if

632
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,369

community so big thanks to everybody the

647
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,440
number one question that I was asked

648
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,299
well the number two and three question I

649
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,529
guess number one is how tall are you and

650
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:30,849
number two is how long are your dreads

651
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,410
which is really weird it's a cannabis

652
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:34,269
event come on let's ask about weed stuff

653
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,910
the number three question that I got

654
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:38,558
asked at this event was do you have any

655
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,720
feminized seeds

656
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,940
unfortunately my answer was repeatedly

657
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,350
no I do not have any FEM see the regular

658
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,710
season at this event

659
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:50,109
however in approximately 70 ish days

660
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,590
those are breeder terms approximately 70

661
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:53,409
days

662
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:54,730
I should have feminized seeds available

663
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,950
they will be available through Oregon

664
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,720

665

666

are approximately two weeks into flower

672
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,829
now they need quite a bit more time to

673
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:17,200
get going but check back and about 60

674
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:20,470
