basically let me explain what no Mount

81
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,719
Nebraska is let's start it off with that

82
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,640
well let's introduce you before you

83
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,799
explain ladies and gentlemen uh speaking

84
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,598
on the mic right now that is about to

85
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,400
give us a lesson in no melt Nebraska is

86
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,318
Jordan from turpex you don't know about

87
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,719
turpex you got to find out uh I have

88
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:50,079
been dabbing mad turpex for the past uh

89
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,598
two or three weeks and uh turpex has put

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,360
a smile on my face I just dabed some

91
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,318
chem dog nectar I'm lit up so all right

92
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,200
here I'm going to turn it back over to

93
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,359
Jordan no no melt Nebraska let's hear it

94
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,639
again okay so no melt Nebraska is

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,280
basically

96
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,759
any hash that doesn't melt essentially

97
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,719
you know what I mean because basically

98
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:12,318
if you were to imagine making hash in

99
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,039
Nebraska it would be melting most of it

100
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,759
would probably not be very good I think

101
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,000
it was just we were thinking where's the

102
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,439
state that has the least melty hash yeah

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,959
I think that that is exactly where it

104
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,519
came from it ended being Nebraska and it

105
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,040
it is true it's you know it's about the

106
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,120
hash that doesn't melt you just call it

107
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,960
Nebraska and then the song was derived

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,160
when uh my friend Jordan here came home

109
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:35,879
with a bunch of of uh no Nebraska yeah

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,039

111
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,839

Grammy Gatsby I wanted to be something

407
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,839
special so we would throw a party every

408
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,000
week called Gatsby's Garden shout out I

409
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,480
you know big up all the grow um but we

410
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,480
would do Gatsby's Garden every Tuesday

411
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,360
at a revolving bar and the people that

412
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,120
were like truly homies and people that

413
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,079
like were respected we would hook them

414
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,399
up with the skull key open your parment

415
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:28,679
right by the mic yeah dud right by the

416
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,559
bike um sorry but uh know we had the

417
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,559
skull key made that we got like 3,000

418
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,078
skull keys and so a lot of the guys in

419
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,638
the room all have one of the skull key

420
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,399
but the thought was is that you know the

421
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,879
skull key opens up every single door in

422
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,799
the Gatsby mansion allows you to go to

423
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,240
all the parties um so initially it was

424
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,278
started that the bouncers and Aspen if

425
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
you showed them the key wouldn't check

426
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,679
your ID or make you stand in line so our

427
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,600
parties were you know instantly a little

428
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,319
bit more Hoy toyy for the locals because

429
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,120
they could just walk right in and Shine

430
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,560
off in front of people since then it's

431
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,919
now evolved into you know people all

432
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,799

433

434
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,479

00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,000
when we have events there's a lot of

436
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,079
keys in the room and when the keys are

437
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,919

444
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000

575

run about 10 different accounts for

576
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,960

578
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,360

579
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:31,639
just like having a website or anything

580
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,199
else like you got to have you know

581
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,200
content is King as they say and it's

582
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,360
quality and consistency you want to have

583
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,919
the right branding you want to have your

584
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,798
[ __ ] together you're not trying to put

585
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,880
up pictures of brick walls or other

586
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:42,960
kinds of you know stuff like that or all

587
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,080
kinds of weird things like you really

588
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,240
want to have it together so that it

589
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,759
actually looks like what the brand needs

590
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,400
to be like and then that way you can

591
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:50,000
expose it and I you know I will tell you

592
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,880
the one thing that I've learned over the

593
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,839
years doing it often is that your

594
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,200
audience needs to be able to watch your

595
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,759

truly truly unique turpion profiles on a

819
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:22,359
lot of [ __ ] that we're looking for I

820
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,278
threw down something I think should be

821
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:27,639
high in CBD if it comes through for you

822
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:29,720
guys dope T across across should be high

823
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,720
in CBD the uglier plants will be higher

824
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,200
in CBD is what I think yeah that's a

825
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,480
great way to describe it more that like

826

859
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,720
1200 milligram challenge is is is much

860
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,038
like no melt Nebraska in a sense where

861
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,558
the name kind of gives it away but

862
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,599
there's a lot more in depth about your

863
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:55,038
passion for the actual event so you know

864
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,480
you want to start off probably with

865
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,278
maybe 400 to 800 milligram and slowly

866
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,839
work your way up to 12 and then at that

867
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,880
point you go outside and put your hands

868
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,240

870
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,679
basically like like any other mental or

871
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,559
physical challenge it's something that

872
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,440
you need to work yourself up to you know

873
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:16,200
you can't just jump in at 12200

874
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,480
milligrams I I did a couple days at 2500

875
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,600
M can I get a sponsor can I get a

876
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,079
sponsor for this yeah mean I need

877
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:26,678
somebody to throw down um I need 1,200

878
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:29,558
and then I need 800 so now we're at

879
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:31,519
2,000 and then I need 600 you want to

880
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:33,200
step yourself up yeah I want to do like

881
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,200
I want to do it like a 300 I think I can

882
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,240
do I've done 350 I've eaten a 350

883
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,798
milligram tell you that the way that I

884
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,679
have I have found best to to embibe the

885
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,519
1200 milligrams is straight capsules and

886
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:46,840
you open the capsules up and take them

887
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,038
while they're half half open okay and

888
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,038
then you just pretty much you know you

889
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:51,798
just jump right in like Aladdin's carpet

890
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,798
see the the the last time we were

891
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:56,000
preparing for the the milligram the

892
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:57,398
12200 milligram challenge it I was

893
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,079
actually pretty disappointed because I

894
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:00,719
was you know talking hell of [ __ ] on

895
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:02,398
everybody because I had been training

896
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,440
really hard like I was waking up every

897
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,439
day and just slamming a thou you know

898
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,120
putting a eating a th000 milligrams for

899
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,519
breakfast you know what I'm saying then

900
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,398
having another couple hundred for lunch

901
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,599
you know what I'm saying I was ready by

902
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:15,798
the time that happened everybody else

903
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,158
had been eating so many capsules too

904
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:18,798
training for the training for the

905
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,799
challenge that it was just like [ __ ]

906
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,798
wasn't going well business-wise for

907
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,599
anybody yeah you definitely have a very

908
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,079
relaxed State of Mind the one homie the

909
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:27,719
one homie in Washington who was going to

910
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,839
be doing it with us he broke like two

911
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,720
mother ship minis in a week or some [ __ ]

912
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,079
like that I believe the exact story was

913
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,200
that he knocked over his Mothership mini

914
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,558
bubbler while he was trying to go to

915
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,038
sleep and also had like a tornado of

916
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:43,319
money blowing around on on his patio or

917
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,558
some [ __ ] so yeah I mean that's what I'm

918
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,879
saying is it's not like you want to go

919
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,278
straight to the black diamonds at the

920
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,039
mountain and throw yourself down 1200 is

921
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:53,278
serious 1200 is no J we wanted to make

922
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,798
sure we were over a th000 um and if you

923
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,398
really want to get intense you try to

924
00:30:54,798 --> 00:31:00,839
hit 2500 yeah that just sounds room

925
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,678
again so that's like that's like the gr

926
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:04,119
dab of Edibles is what we're doing

927
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:05,519
pretty much yeah yeah and well also it's

928
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:06,719
like if you if you don't smoke those are

929
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,440
obviously good ways to do it if you're

930
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,278
really trying to get you know some sort

931
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,080
of sedation for me it was just the fact

932
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:14,359
that like I don't have anxiety and I'm

933
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:16,599
extremely focused and let's be real if

934
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:19,119
you're trying to like never get sick you

935
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:22,038
know what I'm saying as we know cannabis

936
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:24,239
canc can cure everything pretty much so

937
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:25,519
if you eat that [ __ ] you're going to be

938
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,720
[ __ ] awesome that was the other

939
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,599
thought right is that like we figured if

940
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,038
we could do like 1,00 Mig for a month

941
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,480
there was no way that we would ever have

942
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:33,720
any pathogens cancers [ __ ] like

943
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,200
there's no way anything even get into us

944
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,200
cuz we're just super saturating our

945
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,159
cannaboid system in our lift noes yeah

946
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,840
so I need a sponsor somebody throw down

947
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:44,240
like 2 200 pills or 2500 Mill pill got

948
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:46,119
figure out how that works but I mean at

949
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,960
some point we'll take care of you Jeff

950
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:50,879
between between all parties in the room

951
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,399
I'm sure we've got we got

952
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,880
some we are not liable for what happens

953
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:57,918
after you hit 12 bro I don't as long as

954

I I haven't smoked enough CBDs to really

981
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,918
perform that kind of research on myself

982
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:56,199
guess I went to a dispensary I had a a

983
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:57,480
chick friend who was actually on this

984
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,000
going to go you know smoke a bunch of

985
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,000
CBD and beat his dick yeah that's kind

986
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,839
of how it happened we went to the

987
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,599
dispensary and bought a bunch of CBD

988
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:06,359
medicine and we smoked out and we went

989
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,319
to the house and tried to [ __ ] shag

990
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,918
and there was no it was fun dude we're

991
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,278
both like yeah but like an hour of just

992
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,120
sweating on each other I looked at her I

993
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,880
was like I don't think like I don't

994
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,558
think just two WS walking around in the

995
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,960
room looking it out dude yeah nice

996
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:20,079
little W out for the day how do you

997
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,360
think that

998
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:25,038
smelled about as good as his story about

999
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:28,519
[ __ ] in his buddy's VW bus

1000
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:30,359
yeah that did happen

1001
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:32,120
we won't get into that there's another

1002
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:33,918
podcast for that one I I have never

1003
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,398
found that with CBDs but I I mean I

1004
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,038
don't know maybe I I think it's the same

1005
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:38,599
thing I don't I don't tend to to lean

1006
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:42,000
towards the CBDs as much as I'm looking

1007
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:45,319
for thcv tell I'm going to try it yeah

1008
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,720
right yeah bunch of sativa go jerk off

1009
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:49,960
see how long it takes wait 24 hours

1010
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,038
smoke a bunch of CBD orb go try to whack

1011
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,919
one out and see if it's just like 34s of

1012
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:55,440
the way there I mean I mean what ratio

1013
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,360
is this I mean this might be something

1014
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,000
patentable it was exactly it was

1015
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,398
actually the canonic it was like

1016
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,038
21 CD or something yeah it was one of

1017
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,278
those strains 21 to1 yeah something like

1018
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,079
that bringing the opp what Happ what

1019
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:13,398
happens if GW Pharma is patenting a 21

1020
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,720
21 caregivers in Colorado

1021
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:20,559
Springs yeah they G Pharma was like oh

1022
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:22,239
what bad that no one will ever come

1023
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,960
again I wonder what happens when you hit

1024
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,878
if you hit like an 80 to1 ratio I wonder

1025
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,519
if you just like turn into like titanium

1026
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:29,319
Superman cop what I was talking to a

1027
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,239
nerd nurse and she said I think she's a

1028
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,000
paramedic or something and she said that

1029
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,358
there is an electrical response in your

1030
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
brain that causes a seizure and that

1031
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:39,039
same electrical response in your brain

1032
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,960
is responsible for your orgasm it's like

1033
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,679
an electrical firing and when you smoke

1034
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,639
CBD it turns that off that's why you

1035
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,599
don't have a seizure well they coat that

1036
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,800
that receptor probably you're coating

1037
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,440
your your freaking [ __ ] receptor too it's

1038
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,960
the same thing shutting it down dude

1039
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,280
you're literally muting your [ __ ]

1040
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,918
receptor you're just putting like a

1041
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,240
cover over it so that it just can't oh

1042
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:58,319
it's like get in an elevator with no

1043
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,559
13th floor yeah

1044
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,519
the government's going to get a hold of

1045
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:04,519
that and use it for [ __ ]

1046
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:06,039
overpopulation something and yeah yep

1047
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,880
but that's just something I discovered

1048
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,159
thought we'd share well I will tell you

1049
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,880
if you do the I know they grow a lot of

1050
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,879
hemp in China and they use that [ __ ] and

1051
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,760

1054
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,519

1382
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,000
kinds of other [ __ ] and whatever

1383
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,480
else and talk about that blue dream [ __ ]

1384
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,280
let's talk about that for a second

1385
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:21,480
because since moving to [ __ ] Colorado

1386
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,720
I've seen more flow or [ __ ] that smells

1387
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,760
or tastes exactly like [ __ ] flow than

1388
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:27,439
I've seen ever in my [ __ ] life what

1389
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,359
is up with that is that the bomb [ __ ]

1390
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,679
out here they don't they don't like cush

1391
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,598
they don't like per yeah where's the

1392
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:35,199
cush it grows uh the dog's trying to go

1393
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,318
outside okay it's cool I think I mean I

1394
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,759
think a lot of it is the fact that like

1395
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:38,920
that blue dream just blows up like a

1396
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,240
balloon for people that don't know what

1397
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,639
they're doing as yeah you could gr the

1398
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:45,159
[ __ ] out blue dream uh the flow is super

1399
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:46,719
easy to grow here it grows outdoors

1400
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:48,078
really quickly dud trying to get laid

1401
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:49,959
with your chick buy them the blue Dre

1402
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,920

00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,480

1404
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,119

1407
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:02,090
if you've never grown weed if you've

1408
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,719
never grown weed before and you're about

1409
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:06,480
[Music]

1410
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:09,199
what I think the flow the flow that goes

1411
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,199
around here actually came from DJ Short

1412
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,480
gave that cut to Ed Rosenthal who passed

1413
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,000
it around to a few people out here and

1414
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,838
my friend Tom uh had a dispensary here

1415
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,119
and a dispensary in peblo and he spread

1416
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:20,318
that out through his dispensaries a lot

1417
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,838
and it also went through other sources

1418
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:23,440
I'm not saying he put it all over for

1419
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,000
sure but that cut I actually think is

1420
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,480
DJ's floa and not Flo I think back in

1421
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,559
the 1940s when they eradicated this back

1422
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,358
in the day they should have done that to

1423
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,440
Blue Dream definitely Blue Dream should

1424
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:35,759
never exist so I crossed the blue dream

1425
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,280
to the Greatful dog and I call it the

1426
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,319
blue healer and uh it fixed Blue Dream

1427
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,040
did it yeah well it made the uh made

1428
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:43,639
much larger Grateful Dog nuggets and it

1429
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:45,599
comes out a lot like Grateful Dog just

1430
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:48,199
better harvests okay so you can't polish

1431
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,318
a turd you can polish a turd yes now the

1432
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,318
part that sucks is I have to keep a

1433
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:53,318
mother PL of Blue Dream in the all the

1434
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:54,960
time so actually we should get off of

1435
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:56,519
Blue Dream and get onto some other

1436
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,440
strains that are probably better I mean

1437
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:00,039
I know that we all dislike certain stuff

1438
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,079
what what do you got that's coming down

1439
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:05,119
the pipeline I'm making a I've been

1440
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,599
working on this F2 of black cherry Kim

1441
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,720
um I think you see I'm gonna say a name

1442
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,920
that I've never said on the show but I

1443
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,118
think if I say it then nobody could

1444
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,559
steal it from me because it'll be out

1445
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,200
there I'm gonna hit a dead head OG plant

1446
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:17,359
with black cherry Kim pollen and I want

1447
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:20,480
to call it Cherry Garcia because I think

1448
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:22,960
that's cool as [ __ ] copyright Cherry

1449
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,240
Garcia I'll spell it different it'll be

1450
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,000
cool I would I would definitely be down

1451
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:29,279
to taste those turs yeah on those uh I'm

1452
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,719
trying to find a name for that lemon

1453
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,160
Jeffrey Grateful Dog I'm working on I

1462
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:50,679
so it's sweet cush I like the daybreaker

1463
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,239
the daybreaker is a great plant yeah and

1464
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:54,399
the anything you put to the Golden Goat

1465
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,479
makes resin like it just resin comes out

1466
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,639
of that [ __ ] so yeah that male will

1467
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,440

1468
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,239

an interview we're ahead of ourselves in

1475
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,400
recording but I've recorded an episode

1476
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,440
that I've left a blank spot to throw in

1477
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,079
an interview with soil grown so that I

1478
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,838
can learn a bit about it so hopefully in

1479
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:24,280
the last episode that got tossed in

1480
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:25,960
there but the interview is supposed to

1481
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,920

1482
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:31,159
is nice yeah this is awkward podast

1483
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,680
TR and [ __ ] with my head trying to do

1485
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,519
time yes yes so so hold on with the

1486
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:40,480
rosin Tech that shit's been around since

1487
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:42,480
like the [ __ ] 60s and the 70s just

1488
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,000
like a lot of the other stuff it's not

1489
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,599
necessarily going to you know they say

1490
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,920
go ahead sorry I'm out of the lube you

1491
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:49,200
want to know what it is what is it you

1492
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,838
take your weed you put it in a piece of

1493
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,798
parchment paper and Fold It Up you take

1494
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:55,239
weed you take [ __ ] and then you hit

1495
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:57,199
you either hair press it or people are

1496
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:58,679
using a t-shirt press like and in the

1497
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:59,639
60s and 70s that's what would happen

1498
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,118
back in the day is they would take that

1499
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:03,440
shitty weed and t-shirt press it and be

1500
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:04,798
able to extract something they wouldn't

1501
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,679
call bubble hash that would sell for

1502
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:11,719
more and I know that from my time being

1503
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:13,558
a cultivator in Tijuana so nice yeah uh

1504
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:15,239
but that's a story for a different day

1505
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,160
yeah we'll get on that note after the

1506
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:19,118
asthma completely solventless like

1507
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:21,000
there's no solvent in there not even

1508
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,119
water so that's kind of an Tech it's

1509
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,039
activating and expressing it as it's

1510
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,318
heating it so you are still losing some

1511
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:29,358
potency if it gets hot so

1512
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:31,798
I had a hairer I'd try it right now

1513
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:34,119
right yeah are you activating it though

1514
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:35,480
uh it is becoming decarbed and yeah when

1515
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:37,798
you're heating it cuz they're using like

1516
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,559
100 degrees or something and I think 106

1517
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:41,358
is where decarbing starts right around

1518
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:43,760
there I mean I I I have nothing against

1519
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,119
it but it doesn't really do much it I

1520
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,160
mean it does it melts and it gets high

1521
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,920
and all that stuff but it's not the same

1522
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,838
tpine profile marijuana R&amp;D specialist I

1523
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,200
think we should try it okay you should

1524
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:53,519
definitely I'd love to see some locals

1525
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:55,558
do it so that I could take a dab of it

1526
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,239
and talk about it on the show there you

1527
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,200
yeah well and there you have it

1528
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:00,798
obviously

1529
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:02,719
now somebody go to the beauty supply

1530
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:04,519

into a joke at the it actually kind of

1609
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:56,920
turned into a joke at the processing

1610
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,400
facility too whenever you know cuz we

1611

1612
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,680
and some you know sometimes we get some

1613
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:07,199

piece of equipment called a compressor

1628
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:33,119
yeah and I've never been happier that I

1629
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,759
bought that because you did not blow out

1630
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,400

1888
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,960
question I'm not I don't I'm not a

1889
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:42,480
dermatologist or a sunscreen producer so

1890
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,798
I don't know or a scientist yeah just

1891
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,798
guys AR scientist I just play one on the

1892
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:47,759
internet yeah it's um it's definitely

1893
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:48,719
something that's been talked about here

1894
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,119
there you know obviously it's the

1895
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:52,278
exposure rate that you're in you know if

1896
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:54,278
you're in a grow room for six to eight

1897
01:02:52,278 --> 01:02:56,239
hours a day um it's definitely great you

1898
01:02:54,278 --> 01:02:58,880
know it's great to cover I have tattoos

1899
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:01,598
so that's why I choose that's that's why

1900
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,200
I choose to use um I use long sleeves

1901
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,720
and hats and glasses and all that stuff

1902
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:05,919
because then my ink doesn't fade and I

but I probably got muted like 5 seconds

1979
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:36,920
into it so maybe that's why I quit using
