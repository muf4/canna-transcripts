50
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,359
impressed since my first rip out of any

time I hit a hit man rig I hit a hit man

54
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:03,299
sidecar with my homie Hank we may have

about that but big shout-out to my buddy

57
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:08,849
Hank for introducing me to the world of

58
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,189
hit man glass I have

59
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,960
looked back since then you guys I know

60
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:15,090
everybody likes a nice custom rig a nice

61
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,379
colorful rig made by some fancy artist

62
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,810
it's always great to have in your

63
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,519
collection but sometimes you pay a bunch

64
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,469
of money and you go to hit that rig and

65
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,640
when you put water in it the first time

66
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,439
you go to draw through it you get water

67
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,549
in your mouth every time you try to take

68
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,800
a DAB you get water in your mouth

69
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,300
because the water level has to be just

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,860
at this awkward level tour when you hit

71
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,150
it you get water in your mouth or you

72
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,190
can put a little less water and not get

73
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,780
any bubbles that never happens with the

74
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,280
hitman rig when you buy a hitman rig it

75
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,610

cough so please go support the new I

115
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,529
region etics Instagram page it looks

116
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:11,129
like they're out to get the entire

117
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,539
cannabis community what I read today was

118
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:15,359
as long as you don't post pictures of

119
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,099
yourself using cannabis you can post

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,689
pictures of your plants and of your rigs

121
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,549
and of your hash and of your buds

122
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:22,199
you just can't post pictures of yourself

123
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,029
smoking is what somebody tried to tell

124
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,259
me today

125
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,579
excuse my coughing I did just take a fat

126
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,050
dab and you know what it seems true

127
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:29,969
because the accounts that are getting

128
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,710
deleted are people smoking in the counts

129
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,690
the accounts that are still there they

130
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:35,279
don't have images of them smoking so I'm

131
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:37,769
gonna try to stick with that I'll just

132
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,448
be posting pictures of plants pictures

133
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:41,639

167
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,219
stitcher failed to grab the episode it

168

169
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,970

170
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:56,250

172
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,060

181
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,340

185
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:24,180
will learn that because that's part of

186
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,340
what 106 is about I no longer work at

187
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,348
the spot dispensary I am now part of the

188
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,029
green and healthy wellness team I am the

189
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:31,500

190

00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:40,029

194
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,649
large garden by myself and produce the

195
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:43,329
quality of cannabis that they expect on

196
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:44,859
their shelves so much respect to the

197
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:46,990
green and healthy team much respect to

198
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,180
hunt but let me get back to what I was

199
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,740
saying I quit the spot recently I just

200
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,490
wasn't working for me nothing personal

201
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,019
against the spot

202
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,449
it just wasn't they don't have any

203
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:57,039
plants yet and I'm a pot grower so I

204
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,420
needed to be growing and that wasn't

205
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,930
happening so I quit

206
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,730
but the spot held a contest or maybe a

207
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,699
raffle it wasn't really a contest what

208
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:09,069
they did was anybody who spent over $50

209
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:11,050
in purchases got their name entered into

210
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:13,180
a raffle to win two tickets to the

211
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,000
Grateful Dead concert at the First Bank

212
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,990
Center just a couple of nights ago it

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,850
wasn't actually the Grateful Dead they

214
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,230
called themselves dead end Co it's most

215
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,520
of the members of the Grateful Dead but

216
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,980
the bass player and the lead guitar

217
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,829
player and the keyboard player are new

218
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:29,110
guys because well the guitar player is

219
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:30,399
dead yeah Jerry's Jerry Garcia has been

220
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,740
dead for several years so they had John

221
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,479
Mayer of all people replace him they had

222
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,100
Oteil Burbridge replaced the bass player

223
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,840
because Phil Lesh is out with bladder

224
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,010
cancer and if you know anything about

225
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,839
the Grateful Dead you know that they

226
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,668
just have an issue with keyboard players

227
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,799
their keyboard players seem to die for

228
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:47,889
some reason so this time they had Jeff

229
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,110
Jim in T on keyboards but so while the

230
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:52,659
spot had this raffle to anybody that

231
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,400
spent fifty bucks could win these

232
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,530
tickets by being entered into a raffle

233
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,750
our good friend sloppy who has been here

234
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:02,049

235
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,459

236
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,800

Tuesday yeah I get to go see this

version of the Grateful Dead on Tuesday

252
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,210
and I think it's great because I quit

253
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,860
the spa a week ago and I'm still getting

254
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,000
perks and hookups from the spot so

255
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,500
shout-out to the spot for the free

256
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,149
Grateful Dead tickets I had a great time

257
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,440

258
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:48,699
boy sloppy when I told him I had

259
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,420
Grateful Dead tickets he didn't even

260
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,459
hesitate

261
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:53,379

262

263
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:58,120
to Dave I was good bumping into you over

264
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,769
at the Grateful Dead show that was kind

265
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,970
of a fun experience and also big

266
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:02,950
shout-out to Rachel is good seeing you

267
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,230
there it's fun watching you blow big ol

268
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,550
vape clouds through the whole show but

269
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,690
yeah I gotta go see the Grateful Dead

270
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:10,088
and I think it's kind of neat that the

271
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,709
job I quit a week ago kind of in a

272
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,300
roundabout way gave me free tickets to

273
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:16,179
go see the Grateful Dead that was ironic

274
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:18,399
in my mind but uh the Grateful Dead holy

275
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:21,250
crap that was such a good show um

276
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,980
they're at a whole new level of playing

277
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,879
the music is refreshed I said it a

278
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,560
minute ago and you guys probably

279
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,208
scratched your head and said what John

280
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,819
Mayer plays for the Grateful Dead now

281
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:32,948
yes that happened um a few years ago

282
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,360
John Mayer did something stupid and I

283
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,889
don't pay a lot of attention but he said

284
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,629
something stupid somewhere and it messed

285
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:39,698
up his musical career and people did not

286
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:41,559
like him so he kind of took a little

287
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:44,409
hiatus and went away for a while

288
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,399
and while he was finding himself he

289
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:47,078
discovered the Grateful Dead and

290
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,549
discovered the Grateful Dead music and

291
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,039
the way of the Dead and the community

292
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:52,870
and really got into it and somehow ended

293
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,120
up playing guitar for the Grateful Dead

294
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,209
now and you know what at first I was

295
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,669
skeptical because John Mayer is not my

296
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:02,889
style of music at all he's uh that's

297
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:04,448
like girl music it's like teenager music

298
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:05,708
in my mind and yeah I know I'm a I'm a

299
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:08,588
prick because I have I'm really

300
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:10,389
judgmental about music but I gotta say

301
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:13,360
when I saw John Mayer playing with the

302
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:15,250
Grateful Dead he nails it he gets it

303
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,050
perfect he does everything exactly the

304
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,328
way it should be done his tone is

305
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:22,000
perfect he does not overplay the dude

306
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:24,250
knows how to play a guitar he can seeing

307
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,879
you guys he's sing a few tunes and they

308
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,019
sounded perfect I loved it great show so

309
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,429
if you guys get a chance to go see any

310

cannabis for our friend danzel and we

337

343
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,290
damsels bringing a few of her friends

couple other dudes we'll be at the event

346
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:43,109
we've rented a house in Manitou Springs

347
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,639
it's a private party but winner we've

348
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,669
rented a house and we're going to have a

349
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,750
tasting party I've got ten jars in front

350
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:51,479
of me I'm gonna crack one open right now

351
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,179
just for fun I got ten dog jars of herb

352
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,170
that I grew for the lovely damsel oh it

353
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,549
smells so good

354
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:58,949
we're gonna have a little tasting party

355
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:01,588
and Miss damsel is going to decide which

356
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,360
of these phenotypes gets to be the

357
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:06,570
selection that will take the name of

358
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,580
damsels dank and then we will get a

359
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,650
clone into the shop and we will start

360
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,259
growing damsels dank at grain and

361
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,789
healthy wellness in Colorado Springs and

362
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,950
it will be available on the shelves

363
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:18,569
it'll be a little while but we'll get it

364
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,950
there and the whole world with the

365
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,140
medical card we'll be able to try it

366
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,310
hopefully eventually Colorado Springs

367
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,379
will wake up and start allowing

368
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,629
recreational cannabis sales and that way

369
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,639
we can make Daniels tank available to

370
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:31,889
the entire world that would be awesome

371
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,778
big shout out to hunt for putting me in

372
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:35,220
touch with damsel and also a huge shout

373
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,740
out to the lovely

374
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,600
dude it's danzel hey Britt thanks for

375
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,940
giving me the honor of being the breeder

376
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,470
chosen to create a strain for you I

377
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,660
understand how important this is to you

378
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,120
and I'm gonna get it right for you trust

379
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:50,278
me all right so the next thing I want to

380
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,009
do is a little grow lesson this will be

381
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:54,689
a very simple lesson um I was watching a

382
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:57,059
facebook argument the other day and

383
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,670
people were arguing over a plant being

384
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,708
male or female and I thought I just come

385
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:03,240
on here and just make it really clear

386
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:05,729
and simple and we'll talk about what a

387
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,528
male and a female plant look like okay

388
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,450
when it comes time to determine the sex

389
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:11,669
of your plants there are a few ways you

390
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,709
can go about doing it the main way that

391
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:16,169
you can do it is to just flower your

392
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,949
plant if you've got a plant and you put

393
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:19,199
it under 12

394
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,629
12 which is 12 hours on and 12 hours off

395
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,980
of light and you need full darkness in

396
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:25,679
your dark cycle you guys you need

397
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,509
complete darkness uninterrupted for 12

398
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,129
full hours if you can see anything in

399
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:31,289
that room in the dark cycle it is too

400
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:33,570
bright you need to make it darker

401
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:35,459
there's if there's any light it's not

402
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,960
dark enough that is not considered dark

403
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,780
if you can see your hand in front of

404
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,340
your face it is too light in there the

405
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,709
only lights that you can have in a grow

406
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,620
room during the dark cycle are green LED

407
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,850
lights or those green coiled florescent

408
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,159
lights those will work for you need

409
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,720
green light in your dark cycle green

410
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,669
lighting during the flowering cycle does

411
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,440
not interrupt the flowering photo period

412
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:57,870
because the plants are green and they do

413
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,510
not absorb green light so so by putting

414
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,419
any plant into the 1212 period you will

415
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:06,929
actually induce the flowering stage and

416
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:08,399
in about 10 10 to 14 days ish you'll be

417
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,159
able to tell if your plant is male or

418
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,449
female by signs that it shows and we'll

419
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,309
talk about those here in just a couple

420
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,560
of seconds and you guys you can flower a

421
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:18,779
plant at any size it doesn't matter how

422
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,879
big it is what's gonna happen is it's

423
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,740
gonna flower when you put it into 1212

424
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,419
that's what's gonna make it flower but

425
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,269
what I always recommend is that you take

426
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:29,729
a clone from every seed that you grow

427
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:32,189
when you start a plant from seed please

428
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,379
take a clone from it you never know you

429
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,180
might be growing the most amazing strain

430
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:38,159
anybody has ever smoked it may be the

431
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:39,419
perfect medicinal strain for the every

432
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,669
for everybody on the planet for the

433
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,829
entire population it could cure every

434
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:45,389
element you never know and if you didn't

435
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,300
take a clone oh you're gonna be so mad

436
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:50,009
at yourself about that hey guys there's

437
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:51,629
one strain that I grew that got away I

438
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:52,860
could not get it to clone and it was

439
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:54,120
some of the best cannabis I've ever

440
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,490
smoked and I'm a little mad at myself

441
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,960
that I couldn't get it to clone but I do

442
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,840
have more seeds of it so hopefully I can

443
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,550
find that phenotype again anyway when

444
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,560
you grow so grow a plant from seed right

445
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:06,689
and then put it under 1212 and it will

446
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,179
flower I always recommend taking a clone

447
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,560
so take a clone now you've got a plant

448
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,079
that has grown for a little while and

449
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,000
you've got a clone you can either flower

450
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,290
out that original plant that has been

451
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,240
growing and that way you've got a little

452
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:19,889
bit of product to show for yourself and

453
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,830
you've got something to smoke and make

454
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:25,169
it worth your time or you can flower out

455
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,850
that clone as soon as that clone that

456
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:28,799
you took starts showing roots you can

457
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,389
switch that light to 12 12 and that

458
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,699
clone will flower and

459
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:35,069
10 to 14 days you'll have a little tiny

460
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,900
plant with either male or female

461
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,070
flowers coming out of it and you'll be

462
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,809
able to tell if you've got a boy or a

463
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,240
girl and at that point you can either

464
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:44,879
throw away that male plant that you've

465
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,430
got that's in the bigger pot or you can

466
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,899
put that female plant into the flowering

467
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:50,669
room and start making buds out of it or

468
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,500
keep it as a mother plant keep taking

469
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:55,589
clones off of it and have that strain

470
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,210
around forever so take clones you guys

471
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,129
and then you can either clone that

472
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,139
original clone or a flower that original

473
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:01,799
clone as it roots out and then you can

474
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,740
see what you've got

475
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,939
or you can flower that original plant

476
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,190
either way it's gonna do the same thing

477
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,650
and you will know what you've got please

478
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,350
take a clone I can't stress that so also

479
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,840
you guys the plants will show sex if you

480
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,250
let them pre flower if you leave a plant

481
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,540
in a pot for long enough to where it

482
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,940
feels like it's starting to get root

483
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:23,189
bound and it's reached its space I had

484
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,230
space constraints in that pot it will

485
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,000
actually start to flower on its own some

486
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,860
genetics will just panic and start to

487
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,240
flower on their own that way and they

488
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,610
will show you what is called a pre

489
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,440
flower that's just the plant showing you

490
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,120
that it's reaching maturity that it is

491
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,560
ready to go that it's hormones are built

492
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,779
up that it wants you to switch the

493
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,399
flowering cycle so simply waiting for

494
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,809
the plant to pre flower is a good way to

495
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,029
determine if you've got a male or a

496
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:46,829
female but then you do waste a lot of

497
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,120
light and a lot of nutrients and a lot

498
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,950
of space and if you're a productive

499
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,389
gardener sometimes you just can't deal

500
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,980
with that that's why I recommend cutting

501
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:55,350
a clone and flowering out that little

502
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,659
clone and seeing what you've got it's a

503
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,129
lot easier to waste a little bit of time

504
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:00,899
under the fluorescent light than it is

505
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:02,399
to waste time under that big thousand

506
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,109
watt high pressure sodium lamp or you

507
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,359
could have been running a useful crop so

508
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,490
take some clones flower amount see what

509
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,069
you're working with and now it feels

510
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,720
like it's time to talk about what to

511
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,889
look for when your plants do start

512
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,789
flowering so that you can tell if you've

513
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:19,380
got boys or girls basically I'm gonna

514
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:20,819
call it an intersection but at a node

515
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,079
where the two nodes separate you've got

516
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,220
your main stock coming up and then

517
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,569
you've got the little intersection where

518
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,819
the branch comes off to the left and a

519
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,569
branch comes off to the right right

520
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,399
about there

521
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,679
your plants are either gonna grow balls

522
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,050
or hairs and I know that sounds really

523
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,390
general but that's the most simple way

524
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:38,369
to describe this you're gonna get a pair

525
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,860
of balls growing out right there at that

526
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:43,409
intersection or you are going to get

527
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,459
little hairs if you see two little hairs

528
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,230
sticking up

529
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,299
those are your female plant parts those

530
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,279
are actually the parts that if you were

531
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:52,379
to spread pollen in the room the pollen

532
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,180
would land on those little pistols those

533
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,310
are called pistols and those pistols

534
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,930
would slide the pollen up into the ovule

535
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:00,240
which would absorb the pollen which

536
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:04,080
would then pollinate your plant and then

537
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,029
it would produce seeds so if you've got

538
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,740
those little hairs you have got girls if

539
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:09,839
you've got those balls you've got male

540
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,269
plants and unless you plan on making

541
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,069
some seeds and doing some breeding it is

542
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:15,629
time to get those boy plants out of the

543
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:16,980
room and honestly if you're listening to

544
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,170
this lesson and you're learning about

545
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,819
how to determine sex please do not breed

546
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,769
cannabis yet please learn a lot more

547
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:23,909
about plants before you breed and I'll

548
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,410
touch on that in a minute I'll try to

549
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,779
remember to to mention why

550
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,790
so if you see balls get those plants out

551
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,710
of there also here's a good hint the

552
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,970
male plants I'm a breeder I've been

553
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,440
breeding plants for a long time I've

554
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,569
been growing plants for a really long

555
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,779
time one thing I really notice is the

556
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:41,339
male plants grow much much taller if

557
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:42,930
you've got a plant that's just taken off

558
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,149
it's just getting really really tall

559
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,670
it's got a real thick fibrous stalk

560
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,140
that's probably a boy I would just count

561
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,670
on that don't get so excited that you've

562
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,100
got this one plant that grows like a

563
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,570
son-of-a-bitch it is probably a son of

564
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,559
that [ __ ] it's probably a boy you're

565
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,509
gonna want to get rid of that in the

566
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,849
future as soon as you flower it you will

567
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:02,339
know pull the males as soon as you can

568
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:04,679
you guys if you've got male and female

569
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:08,159
plants flowering next to each other by

570
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,660
day 14 that male plant is getting ready

571
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,600
to drop pollen I've seen them drop

572
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,880
pollen around two weeks into flower the

573
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,619
second to third week that's that male

574
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,870
plant is really gonna start spitting out

575
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:20,759
as pollen your female plants are gonna

576
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,929
be just ready to take pollen at that

577
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,129
time so you're gonna end up with a

578
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,470
seeded crop if you don't pay attention

579
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,790
and get those boys out of there if you

580
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,759
leave those boys in too long they'll

581
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:32,759
seat up the entire room very quickly it

582
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,200
just takes one quick little passive the

583
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,609
fan to spread that pollen through the

584
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
whole room and then you've got a

585
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:39,659
pollinated crop you've got seeds

586
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,029
everywhere so pay attention check every

587
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,080
single day get the males out of there be

588
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,690
diligent about it

589
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,379
don't relax stay on top of that [ __ ] get

590
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,029
those out of there

591
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,590
all right so it feels like I've talked

592
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,899
enough about male plants and how to

593
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:53,549
identify them let's talk a little bit

594
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,280
about hermaphrodites because

595
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:57,509
hermaphrodites can really confuse a new

596
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,970
grower should hermit

597
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:02,099
it's can confuse an experienced grower a

598
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,390
hermaphrodite is and there are a lot of

599
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,069
words for it you'll hear people call it

600
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,960
a hermie or a herm

601
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:09,500
it's a hermaphrodite you guys it is a

602
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,569
plant that has both male and female

603
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,549
sexes and it will show them hopefully

604
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:16,740
very early in Flour unfortunately

605
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,569
sometimes you don't see it until like

606
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,980
week eight on a nine-week plant and then

607
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:21,389
it starts showing a little pollen sack

608
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,589
and then you're like gosh [ __ ] I got to

609
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,020
cut this plant are you gonna pick this

610
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:26,970
pollen sack up you start panicking but

611
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:30,839
let's talk about hermaphrodites when you

612
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,400
see a plant with male and female parts

613
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:35,240
coming out of it during flower you've

614
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,590
probably got yourself a hermaphrodite

615
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,569
oftentimes this happens in regular

616
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:41,789
breeding and it often happens in

617
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:44,369
feminized seeds this is something that

618
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:46,710
just happens I breed regular and

619
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:48,029
feminized seeds a lot of people try to

620
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,160
hate on feminized seeds for

621
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:51,569
hermaphrodite um if feminized seeds are

622
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,190
made correctly they will not be

623
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:56,279
hermaphrodites you guys they will they

624
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:59,039
will be good seeds um I've gotten more

625
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,379
hermaphrodites from regular seeds than I

626
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,230
have from feminized seeds and I am a

627
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,570
breeder and I run a lot of seeds so I

628
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,099
don't blame it on the feminized seeds at

629
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:10,980
all I think it is just something that

630
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:13,230
happens you get males you get females

631
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,210
and you get hermaphrodites there's a

632
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,069
whole goal of this plant its whole goal

633
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,240
is to reproduce itself that's what it

634
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:20,189
wants to do

635
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,990
it's a horny plant it's a horny male

636
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,880
it's a horny girl they just want to find

637
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,349
another plant they want to make seeds so

638
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,330
that the seeds can drop into the ground

639
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:27,719
and those seeds can happen again next

640
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,699
year

641
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,860
this whole plants goal is to just

642
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,500
reproduce sometimes it will do whatever

643
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:36,629
it's got to reproduce and one of its

644
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,609
failsafe backup plans is to become a

645
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,740
hermaphrodite so sometimes that happens

646
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:42,719
now I've said that that can be a trait

647
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,299
that is just in the plant that can be in

648
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,289
the DNA of that plant it can be that

649
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:51,119
plant can be born as a hermaphrodite but

650
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:55,230
sometimes hermaphrodites are caused by

651
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:58,079
environment or mistakes if you interrupt

652
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,370
the dark cycle during the flowering

653
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,409
period I talked earlier about how you

654
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:03,209
have to have that complete 1212 photo

655
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,360
period with 12 hours of complete

656
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:08,100
uninterrupted darkness if you own if you

657
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,439
interrupt that you will cause your

658
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:11,409
plants to hermaphrodite if you seriously

659
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,120
if you

660
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:16,420
open up that door and left that light on

661
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,459
for six hours during one dark cycle you

662
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,350
will start to see male flowers pop up in

663
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,410
your female flowers you'll see it happen

664
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:25,209
and you will have a seeded plant it

665
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,210
happens like that that that is the kind

666
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,740
of thing that can cause from Afrin ISM a

667
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,480
lot of the Kim dog and Kush strains if

668
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,400
you push them too hard with nutrients or

669
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,710
just give them a little bit of stress

670
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,780
somehow if they get bugs or powdery

671
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,730
mildew they'll hermaphrodite on you just

672
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:41,829
in a survival method that is something

673
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,870
that that plant wants to do just to make

674
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:45,759
sure that it gets to carry on with its

675
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:47,979
race it just wants to keep going on with

676
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,230
its life so hermaphrodites can be really

677
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,970
confusing [ __ ] does happen like that in

678
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,519
the grow room that's your job as a

679
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:57,700
grower to be aware of it and to learn

680
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:59,619
how to identify it so if you see pollen

681
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,330
sacks and pistols on the same plant

682
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:03,579
you've probably got a hermaphrodite

683
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:05,230
it is not worth keeping you need to get

684
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:07,329
rid of that plant no matter how good it

685
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,670
looks no matter how sweet it smells that

686
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:11,199
plant needs to go now if your plant is

687
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,580
well into the flowering cycle and you've

688
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,170
got big old chunky buds and you're

689
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:16,389
starting to see these pollen sacs come

690
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,620
up these little male flowers they look

691
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,140
like little bananas you guys it just

692
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:21,759
looks like maybe a piece of rice or just

693
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,320
it's a little tiny tiny micro sized

694
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,759
banana popping up out of your plants

695
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,200
that's a little male pollen sack this

696
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:28,539
little male flower coming out of your

697
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,789
female plants oftentimes that stuff will

698
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:33,639
happen late in flower somewhere between

699
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:36,339
week seven and nine if your past week

700
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,450
seven or past I'd say past week seven

701
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:39,159
and you see those you've got a decision

702
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,539
to make any time before week seven you

703
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,960
guys if I see that [ __ ] that plant is

704
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:43,569
dead

705
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,490
I just murder it I've got availability

706
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:47,109
two more plants I've got access to seeds

707
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,970
and clones like you wouldn't believe so

708
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:50,799
I'm a little picky I'm not afraid to

709
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,390
euthanize a plant sometimes [ __ ] just

710
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,629
has to go if it doesn't work from my

711
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:57,040
grow room sometimes a certain plant and

712
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,960
your environment that's it called a

713
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,909
phenotypic expression the plant will

714
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,410
express that it is not happy with your

715
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,400
environment and it won't work for you

716
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,680
and you just got to get rid of that

717
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,360
plant grow a different plant but if you

718
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,610
start seeing those bananas popping up

719
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,049
around week six or seven or eight you

720
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,609
have a decision to make if they're

721
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,899
popping up around week nine it's not

722
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:15,669
that bad because you've only got a few

723
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,830
days left most plants are gonna go about

724
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,080
nine maybe ten weeks if you've got a

725
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:21,220
plant that you're ending up week seven

726
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,740
and you start seeing little manners

727
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,329
popping up you want to figure out if you

728
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,160
want to keep that plant going is it

729
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:29,710
earth risking the rest of the garden

730
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,930
maybe sometimes those little bananas are

731
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,549
sterile they don't produce pollen

732
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:36,070
sometimes one of those can rupture and

733
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:38,799
it will pollinate the plant that that

734
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:40,829
banana is on and it will pollinate the

735
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,639
plants all around that plant as well

736
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:44,230
sometimes it can pollinate the whole

737
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,150
room you guys it doesn't take much

738
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:48,039
pollen to create seeds and so now you'll

739
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,150
have seeds in all of your plants so

740
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:52,450
you've got a decision to make do you

741
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:54,519
want to try to eliminate the planet do

742
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,799
you want to risk it or do you want to

743
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:59,319
try to get rid of those bananas well you

744
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,139
can do to those little male flowers you

745
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:04,329
can mist them with water because water

746
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,190
deactivates pollen so just miss to the

747
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:07,899
plant with water and then get some

748
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,150
tweezers and pluck out those little

749
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,490
manners if you're around week eight week

750
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,810
nine just pluck those out if you want to

751
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,039
if you're in week nine just leave it

752
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:16,839
there and don't touch it until you

753
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,940
harvest and you should be just fine

754
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:22,089
if it's popping up at week nine it's

755
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,259
probably sterile but sometimes it's

756
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,639
scary and you don't want to risk it

757
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:26,289
around week seven or week eight you

758
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,490
might want to pluck him out it's up to

759
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:29,470
you that's when you have a decision to

760
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,599
make but if you're a breeder

761
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:34,000
do not ever breed with the plant that'll

762
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,549
make a hermaphrodite little pop up a

763
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,319
little male plant around week seven

764
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:39,970
eight or nine don't do that because then

765
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,789
you're gonna breed that hermaphroditic

766
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,170
trait into something so make sure you

767
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:46,269
pull out they're hermaphrodites keep an

768
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,440
eye on that that's that's a decision

769
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:49,569
you're gonna have to make that's gonna

770
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,120
happen at some point in your grow career

771
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:54,099
you're gonna see a female plant popping

772
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,899
up a male flower at week eight and

773
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:57,009
you're gonna panic but don't worry it's

774
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,530
not the end of the world

775
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:01,359
you can either pluck out that male you

776
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:03,700
can let it grow or you can just destroy

777
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,109
the plan it's up to you you can always

778
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,450
turn those seated plants into really

779
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:10,179
good hash I think plants that are

780
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,370
allowed to seed make better hash than

781
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,529
plants without seeds you don't get as

782
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:17,199
much hash sometimes but I think that the

783
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:18,460
high is better once you allow the plants

784
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,410
to make seeds and I only know that

785
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,180
because I breed and sometimes when I

786
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,200
breathe there's material left over well

787
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,490
most of the time when I breathe there's

788
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,680
material left over you have to separate

789
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,750
the seeds from the actual bud and we

790
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:32,259
will run the bud material and turn it

791
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,569
into BHO and I like the seeded BHO

792
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:36,250
there's no seeds in the BHO but I mean

793
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:38,819
it comes from seeded materials seeds are

794
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:41,398
removed then we run the material the see

795
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:42,960
are packaged and grown and then the

796
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:45,778
material is turned into hash and that

797
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,519
hash seems to get me a little bit better

798
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:51,869
of a buzz that's my opinion

799
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:54,240
I talked earlier about new growers not

800
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:57,148
breeding and hermaphrodites are a little

801
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,700
bit of why let me touch you on why I

802
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:02,699
said please don't breed if you're a new

803
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,769
grower breeding takes a very selective

804
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,419
eye you need to understand what plants

805
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:07,798
you're putting together and if you're

806
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,409
putting a plant a plant needs to be

807
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,089
properly tested before it's bred I have

808
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:13,320
talked about how I stress test a plant

809
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,599
before I'll breed with it I'll take a

810
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,908
girl plant and I will try to piss that

811
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,769
plant off the best I can and see what it

812
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:23,610
takes to make that plant hermaphrodite

813
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:26,370
or die or stress or whatever and I make

814
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:28,138
sure it's not gonna hurt on me and more

815
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:30,119
importantly I make sure that the progeny

816
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:31,648
the offspring the seeds that come from

817
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,268
that female plant I make sure that

818
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:37,109
they're not going to hermaphrodite on

819
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:39,028
you so you have to have a plant you have

820
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:42,089
to stress the [ __ ] out of it you have to

821
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:44,369
have a properly selected male the I for

822
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:46,019
male selection is a skill I plan to have

823
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:47,788
a conversation with other breeders on

824
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:49,528
this show about male selection so we'll

825
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:51,839
give you a heads up on that but

826
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:54,329
selecting a male is definitely a special

827
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:57,028
skill selecting plants for breeding is a

828
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:58,678
it's a skill it's an art and if you're

829
00:27:57,028 --> 00:28:00,599
not experienced with the plants who

830
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,860
you're using you may breed some [ __ ]

831
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,538
and then you're gonna have a bunch of

832
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,038
seeds and you're gonna give those seeds

833
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:08,158
out you're gonna grow those [ __ ]

834
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:10,919
seeds and it's going to the whole idea

835
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,528
of breeding cannabis is to improve the

836
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,909
genetics to improve the race to make the

837
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:16,679
plant better and if you're breeding

838
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:19,259
[ __ ] into it you're just watering it

839
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,909
down and you're spreading genetics that

840
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:22,409
are a waste of time there are a waste of

841
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:25,169
people's garden space when they could

842
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:26,610
have been growing some usable medicine

843
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:28,470
that would have worked for them so I'm

844
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:29,788
not dissing any new growers I'm just

845
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,200
asking you please don't try to breed

846
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:33,210
until you're a little more familiar with

847
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,669
the plant if you have to listen to a

848

849
