friends welcome to the show everybody

41
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,478
let's start off with a couple of

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
uh internet questions i have received

43
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,438
from youtube

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,799
and from a couple of emails real quick

45
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,039
here people have been asking

46
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,479
why i don't smoke on the show that is a

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,720
very good question

48
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,759
it's a cannabis based show i talk about

49
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,200
smoking a lot

50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,200
a lot of times i tell you what i just

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,079
smoked but why don't i smoke on the show

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,118
that's a very good

53
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,359
question first of all i smoked plenty

54
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,280
right before the show i take a couple of

55
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,920
fat dabs i set up these lights i set up

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,599
the camera

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,719
then i take a couple more dabs and make

58
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,359
sure everything's all rocking and

59
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,679
rolling

60
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,680
do a quick little mic check then i start

61
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,600
recording once i get my voice recovered

62
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,118
so i get plenty dabbed out before i

63
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,839
start the show there's no need to stop

64
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:01,359
talking

65
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,280
and take a couple of dabs and that gets

66
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,239
me to my second reason uh there's no

67
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
reason to stop

68
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,280
talking and take dabs i'm plenty lit i'm

69
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,959
here to

70
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,800
teach you guys and give you a quality

71
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,239
podcast if i stop and take a dab or

72
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
smoke a bowl in the middle

73
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,840
uh that would probably uh take away from

74
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,399
the quality of the show it would

75
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,959
definitely

76
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,480
derail my focus so i just try to stay

77
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,080
focused and keep smoking you notice when

78
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,199
i do have a guest when mike is on or

79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,879
somebody else is here

80
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,399
when they're talking i do puff a little

81
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,120
bit but my intention for that is to keep

82
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,360
my uh

83
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,640
my hands busy i got atd and i don't know

84
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,160
what to do with my hands

85
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,919
so i'm just keeping my hands moving when

86
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,519
other people are here on the show also

87
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,079
it helps me to stay calm and not

88
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,560
interrupt

89
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,239
so much if i'm smoking a lot of times my

90
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,840
add tells me to chime in and say

91
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,680
something that's unnecessary

92
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,039
but i found that if i let a guest talk

93
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,480
they'll tell me what i want to know i

94
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,479
don't really need to interrupt so

95
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,159
i smoke while they're talking that's

96
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,919
when i do smoke

97
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,079
the main reason i don't smoke though

98
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,238
honestly is because youtube

99
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,239
sometimes will flag a video with

100
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,239
consumption i am more likely

101
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,560
to get my videos taken down my videos

102
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,800
flagged something disrupted by youtube

103
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
because of consumption in the video so

104
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
i'm doing my best

105
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,120
to keep these videos up on youtube keep

106
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,599
the channel clean

107
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
that is my main reason honestly for not

108
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,439
mass consumption here on the channel

109
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,959
you never know we may have a multiple

110
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,479
person show here in the future where we

111
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
just bust out and smoke a lot but for

112
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,679
the most part

113
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,439
i don't smoke because uh dabbing and

114
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
smoking gives me the

115
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,359
that in my throat and nobody wants that

116
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680
[ __ ] in a podcast also i'm here to teach

117
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,599
you

118
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,719
i'm here to stay focused i mean here to

119
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,158
just keep talking you don't want to

120
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,158
watch me maybe you do want to watch me

121
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,759
smoke but that'll be my next point

122
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,359
i'm trying to give you a quality podcast

123
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,518
without getting the channel deleted is

124
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,319
my main reason why i don't smoke on the

125
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,000
show

126
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,439
the next point if you do want to hang

127
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,919
out and watch me smoke

128
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,479

body you put your feet

202
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,079

214
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,400
not squinting and dying from it

215
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,319
and you're just maybe overlooking some

216

224
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080

225
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,439
that feeling right there when you're

226
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,800
just chilling maybe you got a white claw

227
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,319

228
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,120
drinking a kombucha you do what you want

229
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,759
but

230
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,478
that is feeling irie just when you feel

231
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,919
good

232
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,279
when the reggae music is playing at the

233
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,799
concert and you're just bobbing your

234
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,079
head and everybody's bobbing their head

235
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,840
and the smoke's in the air

236
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,399
and the sun is setting behind the stage

237
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,839
and the reggae stars are dancing

238
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,079
and the lights are popping up off the

239
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,799
stage and you're just like yeah

240
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,719
that feeling that is irie that's what

241
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,240
irie means

242
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,240
irie i'm sure you've heard it in reggae

243
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,759
music you've heard it in jamaican music

244
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,680
if you've gone to a reggae show the

245
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,120
reggae singer has said the word irie

246
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,560
because they are feeling irie they're

247
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
making you feel irie

248
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,680
so i've said it enough times it's not

249
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,079
eerie the word is irie

250
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,478
i read genetics cause i'm inspired by a

251
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,680
lot of rastafari jamaican culture you'll

252
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,598
also find a lot of grateful dead

253
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,759
references in my strained names anyway

254
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,719
i wanted to say i read genetics find me

255
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,240
on instagram

256
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,000
uh that was a long ramble about the word

257
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,759
irie but we gotta gotta teach the people

258
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,160
now another question i get often asked

259
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,240
is

260
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,759
why is the podcast age restricted

261
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,918
because i'm trying to keep the channel

262
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,598
uh i talk about cannabis i say the f

263
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,799
word i drop a lot of [ __ ] profane

264
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,399
language on here

265
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,560
i tried to edit myself back in the day

266
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,000
but i found that uh i say [ __ ] and

267
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,439
there's no reason to cut that out that's

268
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,439
just something that i say so it's gonna

269
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,120
be in the podcast therefore we must make

270
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,959
it um it's got to be

271
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
what's the word age restricted also i'm

272
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,120
talking about cannabis

273
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
uh people who are under the age of 18

274
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,680
probably

275
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,199
uh i don't know maybe they shouldn't be

276
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
learning about cannabis right away it's

277
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,759
not it's somebody's

278
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,360
it's their parents responsibility until

279
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,639
they're 18 to teach them about cannabis

280
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,160
the day after that i'll teach you

281
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,360
everything you want to know but

282
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
um until then it's your parents

283
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,479
responsibility to teach you that's the

284
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,159
technical legal [ __ ] right

285
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,598
so that's why it's age restricted on

286
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,879
youtube i want to keep the channel

287
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,240
i don't need little kids seeing the

288
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,919
channel and leaving comments and telling

289
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,960
their mom hey i want to take dabs and be

290
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,318
like rosta jeff

291
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,918
that would be [ __ ] weird so we keep

292
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,120
it age restricted for the adults all

293
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,198
you've got to do

294
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,959
is change on your google account change

295
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,478
your age to over 18.

296
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,079
you better be 18 if you do that wink

297
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,279
wink but all you've got to do is go put

298
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,000
in your birthday and change it and it

299
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,359

00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,439
doing something wrong

303
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,719
youtube does not want your credit card

304
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
you're probably not even seeing this

305
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,360
because you couldn't get that far

306
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,879
but uh youtube is age restricted because

307
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
i want to keep my channel you guys if it

308
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,200

309
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,480
this

310
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,759
might get me in trouble not in trouble

311
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,639
just get the channel taken down and i

312
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,080
want you

313
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,000
to be able to watch the show we tried to

314
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,278
post the videos other places and

315
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,039
it doesn't get any views and it just

316
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,320
sucks for loading it takes too long so

317
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,599

318
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,278
we got to keep the channel all right

319
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,959
i've been rambling for quite some time

320
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,958
we have not gotten to the main

321
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,479
cannabis portion of this podcast i've

322
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,239
got some great questions from me

323
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,759
this question came from the patreon

324
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,159
channel this question comes from our

325
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,519
friend

326
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,039
they want their name said they said it

327
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
right in the email so we're just gonna

328
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,199
start by reading it

329
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,480
it says actually i think i have two

330
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,240
similar

331
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,839
yeah we got two emails with the same

332
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
question that's why we're gonna do this

333
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,519
the first one comes from it says what's

334

00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,000
it says thank you for everything you do

338
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,080
for all of us who strive to be better

339
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,519

341
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,839
better grower

342
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,519
and i'm glad it is making you be a

343
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,080
better person in life big respect i

344
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,879
appreciate

345
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,240
that it says i won't ramble on as usual

346
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,480
thank you because i've done enough of

347
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
that it says here is my question

348
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,399
i just popped a pack of strawberry

349
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,359
starburst and i want to know in your

350
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,360
opinion

351
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
is it better to take a cutting as soon

352
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,600
as i am able from each seedling and then

353
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,079
plant that cutting after it roots

354
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,440
and flip that and find the males very

355
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,600
reasonable uh method

356
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,279
or should i just flip the seedling and

357
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,839
then switch it back to veg

358
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,439
after finding the male show their

359
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,040
finding them show their sex

360
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,720
and thanks for the videos they are

361
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,159
freaking epic so i did post some videos

362
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,680
on topping and cloning and people have

363
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,879
made a lot of comments on those

364
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,759
you're very welcome and thanks for

365
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,200
watching the videos uh my answer

366
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,439
the show oh he wraps it up with much

367
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,240
love and jaw guide from papa zee

368
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,920
my short answer is yes i'm going to read

369
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,480
another question that is very similar to

370
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,360
this

371
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,959
and then i think we are going to give

372
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,800
you some answers let me read this next

373
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,278
question and we'll delve deeper into

374
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,120
the answer to this this one says i have

375
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,720
a question being a michigan resident we

376
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,399
are now limited to 12 plants for

377
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,879
recreational growing

378
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,759
i like to maximize these uh gorilla

379
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,879
cookie seeds

380
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,480
i hope you guys didn't just hear my

381
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,559
stomach rumble i apologize if that came

382
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,800
through wow somebody feed the hippie

383
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,559
um where are we i've got these gorilla

384
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,639
cookie seeds i was given from a friend

385
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,719
in order to audition these plants before

386
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,799
going outside very wise move thank you

387
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,480
you've listened to my podcast previously

388
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,159
i hate it when people put plants outside

389
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,360
that they have not auditioned if you

390
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,958
don't know if that plant's a male or a

391
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,200
female please don't put it outside don't

392
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,679
pollinate all the other outdoor grows

393
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,040
this person has the right idea uh before

394
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,879
putting it outside i was thinking i

395
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,159
would start them inside my tent and veg

396
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,120
for eight weeks you're gonna have good

397
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,958
sized plants

398
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,399
flip it to flower and weed out the males

399
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,559
since i'm not breeding or looking to

400
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,078
[ __ ] up someone else's grove very good

401
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,599
forethought thank you

402
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,519
big respect for that i'm glad you're

403
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
thinking ahead and then revenge the

404
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,720
females to go outdoors is this going to

405
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,480
stress the girls too much or no

406
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,920
um then at the bottom of your question

407
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,639
bro i wrote the word

408
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,439
perfect um that's that's the best way to

409
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,958
do it

410
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,640
audition them before you put them

411
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,399
outside flip them into flower

412
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,679
wait to see what the males are then

413
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,679
re-veg the females

414
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,199
and put the females outside that is a

415
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,879
very beautiful

416
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,320
strategy this is very similar to the

417
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,639
question we were asked previously

418
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,240
previously so let's delve into this this

419
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,120
is kind of the same answer the same

420
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,200
question here

421
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,560
for both of these the main question is

422
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,879
i'm trying to determine

423
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,919
how to sex my plants they want to find

424
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,600
the quickest ways

425
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,039
of sexing their plants to determine if

426
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,040
they've got males or females

427
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,039
so that way we don't waste time putting

428
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,879
uh this guy's gonna put their plants

429
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,000
outdoors he's gonna veg for eight weeks

430
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,838
and then put them outside

431
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
that's a big plant if you put those

432
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,800
giant plants outside they're going to be

433
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,879
huge and when they start to turn

434
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,479
uh they show their sex on you that could

435
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,679
pollinate the whole [ __ ] neighborhood

436
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,399
so we don't want to put that male

437
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,599
outside

438
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
our other friend is going to be growing

439
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,480
in a tent and wants to make the best out

440
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,959
of their seeds

441
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,360
and they don't want to waste space very

442
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,799
reasonable reasonable expectations here

443
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,560
uh what i would recommend for my friend

444
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,039
who's going to go outdoors and

445
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,799
uh would also work for papa z i would

446
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,480
take a clone from those plants you're

447
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,439
going to veg for eight weeks

448
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,200
we could probably top around week three

449
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,959
and get a good clone

450
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,240
like the top it's gonna bush out and

451
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,838
it's gonna make a top i've showed you

452
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,680
this part on video before

453
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,079
take that top and make a clone out of

454
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,319
the top if you have another space

455
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,078
this is what i would do take the clone

456
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,000
out of the top of each of your plants

457
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,239
label your plants plant a plant b

458
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,679
plant c uh however many you have you

459
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,519
have 10 of them do numbers you have 12

460
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,199
do numbers it's going to be easier

461
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,799
do numbers 1 through 12 then take a

462
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,120
clone and label your clones

463
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,559
appropriately clone one clone two so

464
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,000
they match up with the planet came from

465
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,359
i hope that makes sense

466
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
uh then put those clones under 1212

467
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,919
lighting

468
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,360
the clones will begin to root and while

469
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,039
they are rooting they will show you if

470
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,759
they're male or female in about 10

471
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,799
12 maybe 14 days so then you don't have

472
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,720
to veg

473
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,399
giant plants you don't have to veg them

474
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,079
out for five extra weeks

475
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,440
should they be boys you can get rid of

476
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,039
them even sooner

477
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,880
than flipping the plants putting them

478
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,240
into veg and then finding out so the

479
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,720
sooner you can flip them

480
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,399
uh into flour or cut a clone would be

481
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,320
better don't let them get too big

482
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,000
then do it do it early you can do it

483
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,680
when they're tiny you can do it

484
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,198
as soon as you have a plant you know

485
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,039
what i mean by when it goes from a

486
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,639
seedling to looking like a plant once

487
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,399
you think it's an actual plant

488
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,079
then put that [ __ ] into flower they're

489
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,679
only going to be a foot tall

490
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,439
10 inches tall and they're going to be

491
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,958
14 inches tall by the time you find out

492
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,639
they're in the flour then put it back

493
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,399
into veg and then up pot it

494
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,680
and it will re-veg more quickly so

495
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,360
that'll save you time

496
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,879
uh save you some space if you've got

497
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,879
that second space

498
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,240
you can do the clones if not flour out

499
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,519
that original mom plant

500
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,759
and find out what you've got that way

501
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,560
you don't grow it so big i hate wasting

502
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,639
time space

503
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,078
energy i could have put different plants

504
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
in there and had a whole new project

505
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,479
underway

506
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,079
had i known that that one big pot was

507
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
wasting all my space that's the way i

508
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,799
think about it real estate's expensive

509
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
in a grow environment

510
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,000
now we're gonna lean back over here to

511
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,519
papa zee's question it's similar it's a

512
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,919
very similar thing my question

513
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,120
is uh is it better to take a cutting as

514
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,639
soon as i'm able

515
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,320
uh and then plant the cutting is it

516
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,320
roots and then flip that to find the

517
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,160
males or flip the seedlings

518
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
so about three weeks into veg take a

519
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,319
clone if you've got the opportunity

520
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,240
let's see

521
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
take cutting so take cuttings about

522
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
three weeks into veg take a cutting now

523
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,600
you've got this big mom plant

524
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,360
and you've got the cuttings you can at

525
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,920
that point put that cutting

526
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,360
into a flour immediately and it will

527
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,078
show you which ones are the males and

528
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,720
females

529
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,919
now you can toss the males immediately

530
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,560
if you want to and you can keep the

531
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,799
females

532
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,479
now you've already got backup clones of

533
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,958
those plants so you've got a mother

534
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,959
plant for the future

535
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,239
so if one of these plants turns out to

536
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,039
be stellar and you want to keep it

537
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,480
forever or

538
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,679
maybe you just don't have more plants to

539
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,800
grow maybe you want to keep something

540
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,159
around to grow in the future so you

541
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,679
don't have to keep popping seeds and

542
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,719
sexing stuff you can find one that's

543
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,319
reliable

544
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
uh then you've got a clone for it it's

545
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,760
already there in the clone dome

546
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,919
so that is one thing that is very

547
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,198
advantageous so if you've got a clone of

548
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,319
each of those plants and you put them

549
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,639
into flower

550
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,160
they will show you sex about the same

551
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,079
time frame that it would take

552
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,480
if you put the original plant into

553
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,679
flower and then let it show you sex it's

554
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,000
going to take about the same amount of

555
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,559
time

556
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
10 12 maybe 14 days they're both going

557
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,439
into flower

558
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,039
if you do it with the main plant then

559
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,560
you've got to re-veg it if you do it

560
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:47,599
with the clones there's no reveg

561
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,518
happening so

562
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,360
if you've got the option in this case i

563
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,000
would probably take the clones

564
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,720
and flower those out find the males pull

565
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
the males

566
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,879
and that way you don't have the main

567
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,720
mommy or the main plant

568
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,000
that you started with is not in flower

569
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,079
you don't have to revert it

570
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,159
it's going to take you a week or two to

571
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,519
get it back into the vegetative stage

572
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,799
then you've got to re-veg it then it's

573
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,480
going to regrow again

574
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,479
you could skip that two-week stress

575
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,360
period right there just by flowering out

576
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,079
that clone

577
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,240
then you've got a flowered clone that

578
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,919
will work as a mother you can re-veg

579
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,519
that clone and that will work as a

580
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,078
mother if you choose to keep it as a

581
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,240
mother

582
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,519
or just let that plant grow because you

583
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,879
already know that it's a female because

584
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,959
you've gotten a clone off of it

585
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,720
take more clones again if you choose to

586
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,159
keep it and then let that be your mother

587
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
plant for the future take clones later

588
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,759
on in the future

589
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,519
uh wouldn't be a bad idea i think that

590
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,278
makes sense of what i'm talking about

591
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,360
to be honest with you all of your

592
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,039
methods would work all of your ideas

593
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,919
would work it's just what is best for

594
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,480
you

595
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,078
you can cut clones then you can either

596
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,199
flip the clone you can either flip the

597
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,919
mom

598
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,278
or you can flip and return the mom

599
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,198
sometimes we just put the mom

600
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,399
into the flowering room and let them go

601
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:57,599
and then you just pull them out and

602
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,278
chop them down and throw them away at

603
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,560
that point if you find out that it's a

604
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:01,838
male or a female

605
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,119
or you keep the females is what i'm

606
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,480
saying you let the females keep going if

607
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,838
it's a boy you just chop it down

608
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,519
and then you just got that big plant in

609
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,958
there you're just running the risk an

610
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,160
experienced grower can spot the boys

611
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,798
pretty quickly we'll just go pull them

612
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
out

613
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:13,599
if you got a female and you didn't get

614
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,439
clones at that point you could pull it

615
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,438
out put it back in veg but

616
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,640
take a clone and flip it flip the mom

617
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,319
and let it go or

618
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,000
flip the mom until it shows you and then

619
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:23,759
re-veg it are the options both of you

620
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,519
guys have a great strategy

621
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,160
it's just all about deciding what works

622
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,918
best for you i think papa z

623
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,679
and i think both you guys are option

624
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,120
around week three take a clone and put

625
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,720
that tray of clones into flowery

626
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,599
immediately and in 14 days you'll know

627
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,400
what you've got

628
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,918
if you have the extra space to do so um

629
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,360
my friend that's going outdoors

630
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,038
i would recommend that you flower those

631
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,639
plants a little bit earlier than you

632
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,240
anticipated that way they got time to

633
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,520
re-veg and you don't waste so much time

634
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,000
and space with the plant that you don't

635
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,599
need

636
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,200
you don't have to water it feed it take

637
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,839
care of it waste space with it

638
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,360
if it is indeed a male plant all right

639
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,240
that was a long time for two emails i

640
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,159
hope i answered

641
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,839
a lot of questions for you guys there

642
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,640
let's see should i jump into this next

643
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,079
one

644
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,480
yes we've got plenty of time to jump

645
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,000
into this next email this next one comes

646
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,240
from my friend zachary

647
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and it came from patreon at patreon.com

648
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,519
forward slash grow from your heart

649
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,200
and it goes just like this it says sir

650
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,599
it doesn't slur like that i promise you

651
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,600
it says sir i just thought of another

652
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,159
question i've been using co2 mushroom

653
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,839
bags

654
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,919
for shits and giggles and i can honestly

655
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,959
say that i have no idea if it helped or

656
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,679
not

657
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,000
um if you can't quantify results in some

658
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,400
sort

659
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,400
of way it was not cost effective you

660
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,000
just donated money to that company is

661
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,559
basically what you did there

662
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,679
um did you use a meter or something

663
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:39,918
we're going to keep going

664
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,880
i have measured have i measured the co2

665
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,799
in the room

666
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,400
no but i keep close attention to my

667
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,480
ladies and i visit these hoes

668
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,160
every day they have a pretty steady

669
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,120
pattern about them my question

670
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,320
is do you use co2 supplementation and

671
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,079
what are the factors

672
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,798
that would make it worth it from a tent

673
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,480
grower to a building sized operation the

674
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,319
factors in mind

675
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,079
here are obvious temperature humidity

676
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,038
but also a room being sealed enough

677
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,038
air circulation etc uh there's a lot to

678
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,720
touch on already he does say side note

679
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,798
i've been growing three breeder seeds

680
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,720
including yours and from what i'm seeing

681
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,599
so far yours are killing it in my tent

682
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,360
conditions

683
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,719
and those extra seeds you gave me went

684
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,798
to some growers in need

685
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,400
thanks again that's a great way to wrap

686
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,240
up that message because it says that my

687
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,160
seeds are outperforming other breeders

688
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,359
and also shows that i gave you extra

689
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,720
seeds that's really cool thank you for

690
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,959
sharing that with us

691
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,000
uh let's focus on this question here

692
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,360
talking about

693
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,599
co2 in a room uh a sealed room is a big

694
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,678
factor where is that co2 going how are

695
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,439
you exhausting your tent

696
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,360
most of the time we put a blower at the

697
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,880
top of the tent or a carbon filter

698
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,479
somewhere near the top it's exhausting

699
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,440
the air out of the top blowing it out of

700
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,679
the tent

701
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,480
does that ducting go out of a window out

702
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,798
of the

703
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,400
domicile out of the building or does it

704
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,879
blow the air back into

705
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,559
the office space bedroom living room

706
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,679
basement attic wherever you might have

707
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,599
this grow tent

708
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,759
is that air being blown back into there

709
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,119
if it's going out the window your co2 is

710
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,000
now out the window it's part of the

711
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,759
atmosphere

712
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,359
uh you just co2 up the neighborhood with

713
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,720
the mushroom bag you honestly probably

714
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,119
didn't do [ __ ] but

715
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,720
uh you blew the co2 right out the window

716
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,759
if you had the ducting going out the

717
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,679
window if you're

718
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,038
blowing that air back into the room it

719
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,798
had the opportunity

720
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,400
to get sucked in through the passive

721
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:20,639
vents on the bottom or maybe you've got

722
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,720
an

723
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,159
active intake near the bottom of that

724
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,159
tent but possibly

725
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,440
some of it a portion of it got sucked

726
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,240
back in through the bottom and then

727
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,679
cycled back up through your tent again

728
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,279
also it mixed into the rest of the

729
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,519
atmosphere in the room

730
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,639
how big is that room how much airflow is

731
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,400
in that room

732
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,480
uh is there a door open is there a

733
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,840
window open is that door open to the

734
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,319
rest of the house

735
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,839
is that tent in a 9 000 square foot

736
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,359
warehouse by itself

737
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,879
is it in a 5x7 bedroom that is stifled

738
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,959
these are going to be huge factors that

739
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,799
depend that make that come into play

740
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,120
to decide it's all about airflow cubic

741
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,200
feet uh amount of [ __ ] co2 you've

742
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,719
introduced into the room where did it go

743
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
so it's all about the cycling and

744
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,600
recycling and the amount of sealed

745
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
environment you've got in there if

746
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,558
you're just blowing it out the window

747
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,159
you're literally just blowing it out the

748
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,440
window if it's sealed in there and

749
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,280
there's nowhere for it to go

750
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,600
it's circling back in there but also

751
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,918
that tells me that your room is probably

752
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,038
too hot and probably kind of humid also

753
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,240
unless you've got the appropriate

754
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,079
equipment in there to combat

755
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,440
that um let's see i like to aim for

756
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,158
fairly high ppms in a so in my personal

757
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,038
grows

758
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,400
i do not run co2 it's extra work it's a

759
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,359
couple of extra strip trips to the

760
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,440
growth store

761
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,038
i feel like my plants are the plants i'm

762
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,558
working with are high performance plants

763
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,480
people always tell me my plants

764
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,960
veg faster they flower with much more

765
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,798
vigor a little bit of co2 may make my

766
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,679
plants go too fast and mess up my whole

767
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,759
schedule

768
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,000
most of my stuff is in a small space my

769
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,079
personal stuff is in a very small space

770
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,599
i don't feel the need to augment the co2

771
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,279
there

772
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,199
also most of what i'm breeding for is

773
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,720
for seeds i don't need big fat buds i'd

774
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,640
get bigger plants with faster growth i'm

775
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,200
not worried on that big accelerated bud

776
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,280
growth

777
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,640
i want healthy seeds so that's mainly

778
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,519
what i focus on

779
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,559
in a commercial grow environment i co2

780
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,119
up those rooms

781
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:11,440
heavily somewhere between a thousand and

782
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,279
fourteen hundred ppms just depending on

783
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,840
what part of the flowering cycle we are

784
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,839
in uh in veg i stay around a thousand

785
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,158
and the flowering times will crank it up

786
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:23,199
to about 1400 ppms

787
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,640
it gets quite expensive to augment co2

788
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,600
in a large environment

789
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,440
if if if i notice that we can't keep it

790
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,599
up if we need uh more

791
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,519
co2 being dumped into the room then it's

792
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,519
cost effective i'll simply just keep the

793
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,440
ppms closer to a thousand if we can keep

794
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,240
it in the room if it's a smaller room

795
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,440
better sealed better airflow that's when

796
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,679
i'll crank it up

797
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,279
kind of in the later weeks of flower not

798
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,600
the final weeks but the later weeks of

799
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,158
flower i'll really crank up that co2

800
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,038
um so the factors are it's all about

801
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,520
sealed

802
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,960
can you how are you providing the co2 is

803
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,918
it coming from a burner if it's coming

804
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,679
from a burner

805
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,360
you were just limited by the performance

806
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,798
of that burner can you and the heat that

807
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,519
it puts off as well can you turn that

808
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,960
[ __ ] up

809
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,119
enough to saturate the room at the

810
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,759
desired level uh with the amount of

811
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,000
sealed

812
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,279
uh ceiling that you've done in that room

813
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,880
if you're using tanks

814
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,319
uh that gets expensive you've got to

815
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,720
refill the tanks

816
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,240
can you saturate the room with co2 at

817
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,240
the level you desire

818
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,240
and maintain those tanks can you get to

819
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
the store as often as you need to

820
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,599
can you carry in those tanks as often as

821
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,480
you need to without your neighbors

822
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,319
seeing you

823
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,679
uh co2 tanks being carried into the

824
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,839
house looks super

825
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,600
[ __ ] sketchy people don't realize you

826
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,879
may use co2 for a cannabis grow they

827
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,519
think you're doing something way

828
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,559
different

829
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,679
the kids in the neighborhood are going

830
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,440
to think you've got helium and they're

831
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,679
going to want [ __ ] helium balloons

832
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,480
so if you got that co2 tank uh you're

833
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,159
gonna have to move that

834
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,519
into the house a couple of times a week

835
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,960
or a couple of times a month or

836
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,918
something think about that do you want

837
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,960
to move that

838
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,320
also that gets expensive if your room is

839
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,000
not sealed properly

840
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,678
ah you're just ducting that [ __ ] right

841
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,919
out the window you just drove

842
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,798
picked it up snuck it into the house

843
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,240
paid for it

844
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:59,679
hooked it up and then vented it right

845
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,120
out the damn window so unless you're

846
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,880
sealing the room that is not cost

847
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,879
effective what are the other methods

848
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,520
of creating co2 we got the tanks we got

849
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,440
the burner oh we got these mushroom bags

850
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,038
i really don't know if those are

851
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,720
effective let's talk about that unless

852
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,558
you're getting out a meter you said you

853
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,640
do not use a meter

854
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,158
unless you're getting out a meter

855
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,640
there's no real way

856
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,840
to measure the amount of co2 in the room

857
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,038
i've got a lot of meters in the

858
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,720
commercial environment

859
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,879
that tell me what the the co2 is

860
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,798
throughout the room i've got it set up

861
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,480
to where if the co2 is too high here

862
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,400
too low here it'll actually turn on in

863
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,159
this region and not in this region

864
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,600
fans will kick on and move co2 it's a

865
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,400
pretty advanced room in some of these

866
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,158
places

867
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,519
uh you've got to have the meters we also

868
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,559
have these big meters that if it gets

869
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,158
dangerously high

870
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:43,359
the [ __ ] alarms go off and it tells

871
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,760
us to leave the building it's pretty

872
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,439
cool

873
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,038
i had that happen once almost [ __ ] my

874
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,720
pants scared the [ __ ] out of me

875
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:49,759
uh but we do have a lot of co2

876
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
monitoring in the commercial

877
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,158
environments you need a monitor if

878
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,158
you're going to pay

879
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,520
for the juice you got to monitor the

880
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,880
juice you got to get the equipment that

881
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,918
goes with it or you don't even know if

882
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,320
you're doing anything

883
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,600
you need some sort of quantifiable data

884
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,678
also quantifiable

885
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,278
results if you put that in there and you

886
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,960
didn't get any results out of it it was

887
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:07,440
not cost effective which means it didn't

888
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,880
do

889
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,038
it wasn't cost effective i wouldn't do

890
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,400
it again unless you got more out of

891
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,079
spending more money

892
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
don't do it again unless the quality is

893
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,720
better i need we're not looking i don't

894
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,158
think quality is going to be better

895
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,558
because of co2 you're just looking for

896
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,880
bigger fatter plants bigger fatter buds

897
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:23,759
so uh you need a meter uh i would

898
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,840
optimize

899
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,759
the room the tent is in a room in your

900
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,079
situation i would optimize

901
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,079
the room in which the tent is in because

902
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,599
that room is working as a lung room

903
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,278
you've got your main environment in the

904
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,480
tent and then outside that air gets to

905
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,880
mix around again

906
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,319
and kind of stabilize itself to the uh

907
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,840
room temperature which was gonna be

908
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,879
whatever ambient environment is if it's

909
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,839
a hot day it's going to be hot if it's

910
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,840
cool it's going to be cool

911
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,359
but it's getting to mix in there again

912
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,798
and kind of stabilize itself before it

913
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,158
gets sucked back into the room if you

914
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,720
can keep that room

915
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,000
closed and keep the co2 augmented in

916
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,919
that room as well

917
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,359
that will help you out a lot of people

918
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,278
uh adjust the

919
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,959
temperature and humidity of the room in

920
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,480
which the tent is in i wouldn't put my

921
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,679
air conditioner in the tent i would put

922
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,159
it in the bedroom

923
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,080
which the tent is in put my humidifier

924
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,679
and dehumidifier in that room

925
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,918
adjust that temperature and then blow

926
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,440
that perfect air into the tint and then

927
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,080
suck out the bad air out of the top of

928
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,640
the tent

929
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,240
so i'd be uh augmenting the co2 in that

930
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,960
big room as well i know that sounds

931
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,558
silly but

932
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,840
from a commercial growers standpoint

933
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:23,200
from a very experienced grower's

934
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,158
standpoint that's the way to do it now

935
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,720
what you're gonna have to do at that

936
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,640
point

937
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,038
is make sure that room is sealed are you

938
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,799
evacuating air out of that room somehow

939
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,319
are people opening the door or coming in

940
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,119
and out of that room if it's an active

941
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,639
house in the

942
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,558
or an active room in the house this may

943
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,960
not be the best way to do it you may

944
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,639
just want to rock it without co2 or just

945
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,440
be the guy that puts a little tank right

946
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,840
outside there

947
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,679
and runs the lines into right into the

948
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,240
tent and then just drops that co2 right

949
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,640
in there

950
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,319
it could get wasteful but it's going

951
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,960
right to the plants that way that works

952
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,879
too

953
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,558
um just try not to waste it it is

954
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,520
expensive is it cost effective i would

955
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,200
get meters

956
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,960
i would take a lot of notes we need

957
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,679
quantifiable data run two or three

958
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,519
harvests

959
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,880
of the same strain of the same plants

960
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,759
for the same amount of time with the

961
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,278
same feed

962
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,798
if you want it to be scientific you have

963
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,359
to do it scientifically

964
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,639
i know i said scientifically um if you

965
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,319
can't seal that room up

966
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,759
the way i said before put the tanks

967
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,759
right outside of the tent

968
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,679
run your lines right inside the tent and

969
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,720
run that perforated drip line right

970
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,080
above the plants

971
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,679
like six or eight inches above the

972
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,278
canopy make a loop all the way around

973
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,038
that tent maybe do a cross across the

974
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,119
middle if you can run the lines that way

975
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,558
so that co2 is dropping right into the

976
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,239
canopy of those plants and then your

977
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,678
extraction fan will suck it up

978
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,599
it's heavier than oxygen so it's going

979
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,880
to fall when that extraction fan comes

980
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,558
on it'll pull it back up

981
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,159
hopefully it sucks into the room and

982
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,839
then that extraction fan is pulling

983
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,960
passive air into the bottom hopefully

984
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,199
like i said before

985
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,440
it brings it right back into that tent

986
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,120
once it recycles with the air outside

987
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,880
um you're gonna need meters that's my

988
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,879
main advice bro find a meter

989
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,559
and see what the meter says you're

990
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,960
probably going to start off around 350

991
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,398
to 420 ppms of co2

992
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,640
in your room that's naturally what the

993
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,079
environment seems to be lately

994
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,919
see what you can do by augmenting it

995
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,519
with these cheap bags see if you want to

996
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,880
invest in more expensive equipment

997
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,240
pumping up the co2

998
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,679
if you get it high and you get a good

999
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,399
pattern and figure out what each strain

1000
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,159
likes

1001
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,398
it will increase your bulk it will make

1002
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,399
the plants beef up bulk up fatten up

1003
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,119
you will notice faster growth because of

1004
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:20,959
that co2 if you can get it dialed in

1005
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:23,278
um i wrote high ppm show results but

1006
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,600
is it cost effective that is uh the main

1007
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,440
thing to think about cost-effective

1008
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,959
if it's not cost-effective cut it out

1009
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,759
the only way to find out is to seal up

1010
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
that room

1011
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,960
let that [ __ ] rip and see what it does

1012
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,200
for your plants all right uh
