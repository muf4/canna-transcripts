32
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,469

00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,419
you may know that I've been out of town

lessons this episode is going to be a

37
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:03,998
repost but it is a good lesson on

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,459
harvesting our ripe cannabis plants I

39
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:08,258
cut out a long intro and I cut out all

40
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,539
of the advertising so let's jump right

41
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:12,548
into a lesson on harvesting our ripe

42
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,719
cannabis plants all right guys let's do

43
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,360
a podcast all

44
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:19,120
about harvesting your cannabis we've

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,010
done an episode about determining when

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,569
your plants are ripe we've done an

47
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:25,689
episode about flushing your plants

48
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:27,849
before harvest now it is harvest time in

49
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:30,009
the garden there are a couple of things

50
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,930
we need to think about before we go in

51
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,489
and cut down the plants first of all I

52
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,860
should mention if this is your first

53
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,870
time cutting down cannabis plants you

54
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,850
thought they smelled strongly when they

55
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,039
were growing as soon as you cut those

56
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,629
[ __ ] down it's gonna double and smell

57
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,609
I know that sounds like I may be making

58
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:49,090
it up it sounds like I'm joking

59
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:52,390
no it is going to stink it's going to be

60
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,300
ridiculous if I grow one plant in a

61
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:57,069
small house we'll see in the attic or

62
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,080
the basement and then I chopped that

63
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:02,319
plant down and hang it up in that

64
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,969
basement the stink of that plant so

65
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,560
normally you can smell it to the living

66
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:07,810
room right to the to the living room of

67
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,240
the house as soon as you harvest you can

68
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,680
smell that [ __ ] to the driveway I don't

69
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,689
know the science behind that I don't

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,980
know if it's paranoia I don't know if

71
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,599
it's because we're moving in and out of

72
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:18,159
the grow room or I don't know exactly

73
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,829
what it is but as soon as you cut down

74
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,689
that crop it's gonna stink more than you

75
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,400
were expecting so try to be prepared for

76
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:27,489
that some things you can do to be

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,950
prepared are maybe getting some ona gels

78
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:32,439
if you know what ona gels are ona gels

79
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,750
are jars filled with this gelatinous

80
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:36,669
substance that just eats up odor it

81
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,280
doesn't put out an odor but it eats up

82
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:41,469
the odors in the room so you open the

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,239
jar I used to just set a jar of it

84
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:44,319
behind a house plant or behind a picture

85
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,849
you know you got a picture your daughter

86
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,379
up on the coffee table or up on the end

87
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,419
table you just stick one of these ona

88
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:50,979
jars opened right behind it and that DES

89
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:52,869
starts sucking up all the odor out of

90
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:54,250
the room so put those by the doors in

91
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,379
the entryways of your house where people

92
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,810
may come in and that way there you're

93
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:01,569
sucking up that odor and then also if

94
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,090
you can't do the ona gels maybe do

95
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:05,680
something stronger to cover the smell

96
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,450
it's gonna be hard like if you're you're

97
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,340
spraying lilac air freshener you're

98
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:10,899
gonna smell while AK and weed the ona

99
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,819
gels are gonna be your best bet some

100
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,549
people neutralize the owner odor would

101
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,379
be your best bet another good idea if

102
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:19,660
you can afford it would be a carbon

103
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:22,538
scrubber most of us have a carbon filter

104
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,830
that blows air out of the grow room keep

105
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:25,478
that running because that's going to

106
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:26,759
keep filtering the air and make it smell

107
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:29,550
good but also

108
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,829
get a carbon filter with a blower on top

109
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,449
of it and just plug it in and let that

110
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:34,979
air run through the carbon filter and

111
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,409
now you're just sucking stink out of the

112
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,120
air cleaning up that environment so be

113
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,620
prepared it's gonna stink that is

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,500
something we need to start with it will

115
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,120
be stinky now before we even start

116
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,899
chopping down there's a few more things

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,180
to talk about

118
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,069
where are all of these plants going to

119
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,230
go once you cut them down let's plan

120
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:54,389
this before we even get to harvest time

121
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,160
are you going to use those circular

122
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,379
racks that they sell to grow store the

123
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,030
multi-tiered circle racks are you gonna

124
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:01,469
be able to make a line some more with

125
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,959
string and hang them that's what I

126
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,580
prefer do you have a space that you're

127
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,109
going to be able to control the

128
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:09,449
temperature and the humidity and

129
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,220
hopefully keep the aroma under control

130
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,589
and hopefully keep light out and also

131
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,130
keep people away start thinking about

132
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:18,929
that around week six or seven guys let's

133
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,279
not wait until week nine to start

134
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,500
figuring out where these plants are

135
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,419
going start thinking about that early so

136
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,160
you need a place for them to hang that

137
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,350
you can control the temperature a place

138
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,240
you can control the humidity in a place

139
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,400
you can keep people out of there and

140
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,879
also you're gonna have to control that

141
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,709
aroma so have a place prepared and keep

142
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,159
in mind that if you're gonna dry your

143
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:40,319
buds

144
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,320
if these buds hang and your dingy funky

145
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,209
basement they're going to taste like

146
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,500
funky dingy basement you've tasted that

147
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:48,479
smell on buds before and you probably

148
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,250
didn't realize why does this taste like

149
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,379
the damn basement you know why because

150
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,930
it was dried and cured and hung for

151
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,060
seven days and somebody's funky damp

152
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,910
dirty [ __ ] basement that's exactly

153
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,620
why so have some air exchange have some

154
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,240
temperature control and have a good

155
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,500
environment you guys create a good

156
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,230
environment for your plants you've

157
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,600
gotten them this far let's not ruin them

158
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,160
if you're growing in a grow Hut and you

159
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,680
don't have another crop coming up right

160
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,600
behind it why not just use that grow Hut

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,459
as you're drying space that would not be

162
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,379
a bad idea you're controlling that

163
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,599
environment already anyway so that is

164
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,100
always an option create a good

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,960
environment you guys will talk more

166
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,490
about the space in a minute you can just

167
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,930
use the grow room if you need to if you

168
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,490
don't have another crop coming up just

169
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,079
use your flower room or remove the

170
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,579
plants into flower use the bedroom

171
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:34,199
that's always an option but we'll get

172
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:35,699
back to that don't worry you guys let's

173
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,069
talk more about the things we need to

174
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,858
prepare for before harvest time comes

175
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:44,428
you're going to need a few to

176
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:46,738
I highly recommend gloves the black or

177
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:47,818
the blue fin nitrile gloves they don't

178
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:49,888
have to be super thick you're just

179
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,629
trying to not get sticky you guys when

180
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:53,668
you're trimming weed and when you're

181
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:55,619
harvesting and handling this amount of

182
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:57,298
weed you're gonna get sticky you might

183
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:58,859
want to wear long sleeves you might want

184
00:06:57,298 --> 00:07:00,118
to wear just a long sleeve over shirt

185
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:02,428
that you could take off when you're done

186
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:05,879
you're going to get sticky you are going

187
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:07,888
to stink some people have an allergy to

188
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,449
cannabis I've got a friend if she rubs

189
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,609
up against the blue dream plant she's

190
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,588
gonna break out into a giant rash so

191
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:17,788
maybe cover yourself up certainly wear

192
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:21,538
gloves also if your eye itches do never

193
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:23,399
rub your eye with a trichome Laden

194
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:25,139
finger if your eye itches and you're

195
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,319
trimming we'd take off your gloves and

196
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,639
then it's your eye with a clean hand or

197
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,439
if you've been trimming and not wearing

198
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,028
gloves go wash your hands before you hit

199
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,999
your eye or scratch your eye because if

200
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:38,459
you get resin in your eye it is one of

201
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:41,609
the most painful experiences you will

202
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:43,528
ever endure it hurts and it won't stop I

203
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:45,359
don't know what makes it stop it just

204
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:47,189
burns and burns and burns and it's

205
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,869
sticky and when you blink you expect it

206
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:51,299
to feel better but it's just stickier

207
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:55,529
it's so [ __ ] miserable

208
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:57,269
so gloves a long-sleeve shirt you're

209
00:07:55,528 --> 00:08:00,478
also gonna need some scissors

210
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,918
I recommend quality scissors you can buy

211
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,199
some cheap shitty scissors but they're

212
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,548
gonna break I also recommend using a

213
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,528
different pair of scissors for cutting

214
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:09,269
down the plants than you use for

215
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,259
trimming the plants when you're trimming

216
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:11,968
you're getting in there and getting the

217
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,528
fine details when you're cutting them

218
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:15,598
down you're using brute force and

219
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:18,808
cutting down tough plants you may need

220
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,088
some some thicker pruners you may need

221
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:23,129
some choppers to cut down a big plant I

222
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:24,178
don't know how big your stalk is but you

223
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,559
want to be able to get in there and cut

224
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:27,598
it down easily without hurting your

225
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:30,319
wrist without breaking your scissors so

226
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,428
I like something that has got a metal

227
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,379
solid piece to it for cutting them down

228
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:36,870
not the plastic scissors for cutting

229
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,819
them down metal to solid pieces of metal

230
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,860
from the handle to the blade then also

231
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:42,628
for trimming that's when I like the

232
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,269
little Fiskars the diamond tips or

233
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:47,360
something similar to that so something

234
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,589
to cut down the plants with scissors

235
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,990
shears whatever you're going to use be

236
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,370
prepared and if you're gonna have more

237
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,680
than one person doing the chopping down

238
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,210
get more than one [ __ ] pair of shears

239
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,769
there's nothing more frustrating than

240
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,389
watching people stand around and not

241
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:02,740
able to do work because you don't have

242
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:04,600
enough scissors or you don't have the

243
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,250
right tools if you're gonna have a group

244
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,259
of people doing it get a group of shears

245
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,940
I know most you guys probably have a

246
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:11,740
small garden it's probably one or two of

247
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,440
you and you don't need giant bolt cutter

248
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,730
style shears or giant Fisker shears or

249
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,710
anything but I've been in that situation

250
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,870
before where I'm watching five guys wait

251
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,879
for work because it's just me with a set

252
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,950
of shears chopping down every plant so

253
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,110
have enough shears have enough gloves

254
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,640
maybe get a few different sizes of

255
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,710
gloves if you're gonna go buy a box of

256
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,750
gloves buy two maybe three get small

257
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,280
medium and large --es or maybe small

258
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,509
large and extra-large it depends on

259
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,709
who's coming over to help you out but if

260
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:37,149
you're gonna have people helping if

261
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,580
they're gonna be harvesting and trimming

262
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:41,799
with you maybe you want a few different

263
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,420
size gloves and here's something I

264
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:45,309
should mention if you have applied any

265
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:46,629
pesticides to your cannabis plants and

266
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:48,339
you're gonna cut them down and have

267
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:50,019
other people work with them maybe you

268
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,460
should politely let those people know

269
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:53,199
what pesticides were applied to your

270
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,790
plants so that they can wear long

271
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,170
sleeves they can wear a mask they can

272
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:58,569
dress appropriately based on their

273
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:00,459
decisions based on what pesticides you

274
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,530
have applied some things don't bother me

275
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,120
some things I would want to put on some

276
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:07,000
long sleeves for I'd not get that on my

277
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,730
arms just personal preferences safety

278
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,590
it's always polite anyway so the next

279
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,080
thing we should talk about is how are we

280
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,430
gonna hang these plants because the next

281
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,560
thing you gotta buy is something to hang

282
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:19,089
them on are you going to use so the

283
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,579
gross store sells this really nice

284
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,440
hanger it's about three feet around and

285
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,000
it hangs in the middle and then it's got

286
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,550
four or five shelves on it that you can

287
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,809
just fill with buds that's acceptable if

288
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:30,370
you want to cut your buds into small

289
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:32,559
pieces or your branches into small

290
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,360
pieces and hang it on there that's just

291
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,849
fine but that's not the way I would

292
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,470
prefer to do it I prefer to hang the

293
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,940
branches so that the buds aren't

294
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,889
touching anything so that they don't get

295
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,110
a flat spot so that there's not a spot

296
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:46,539
where air can't flow around it I just

297
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,070
prefer to hang them so in Colorado were

298
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:50,019
allowed to grow six plants let's say

299
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,760
we've got a six plant harvest I would

300
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,740
get six coat hangers or clothes hangers

301
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,629
and then I would get some fishing line

302
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,940
or some thick hemp twine and I would

303
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:59,679
anchor that to two opposite ends of the

304
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,930
room so I've just got a nice piece of

305
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,759
string hanging across the room now you

306
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:05,649
can hang the plants on that string if

307
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,960
you want to but if you're using multiple

308
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:10,139
strains maybe you've got six to

309
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,310
plants maybe you've got giant plants

310
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,259
that's when you can cut the plant into

311
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:16,000
smaller pieces and put it on the coat

312
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:18,490
hanger and you can label the coat hanger

313
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,379
this is all sour tangi this one is all

314
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,720
black cherry now we even have one long

315
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:24,939
line of buds that get confused also it

316
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,430
makes more space another thing you're

317
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,870
gonna need is some sort of labels you

318
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:30,129
might want to get just some white duct

319
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,080
tape you can always just peel off a

320
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:33,610
piece of duct tape right on that stick

321
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,110
it wherever you want it or you can get

322
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,240
some real labels or you can improvise

323
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,190
however you need to but you're going to

324
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,750
want labels if you've got more than one

325
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,370
strain there's nothing worse than

326
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,509
getting [ __ ] confused right at the end

327
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,830
that's really frustrating so you've got

328
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:50,230
some way to control the odor

329
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,360
you've got a place thought of and

330
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,330
prepared where you can control the

331
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,669
temperature the humidity the lights the

332
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,470
air flow the aroma and the security

333
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:01,059
you've got that all prepared and you've

334
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,950
got the proper tools you've got gloves

335
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:05,500
you've got something to cut it down with

336
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,540
you've got something to hang it on now

337
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,759
let's talk about the room just a little

338
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:12,339
bit you're going to need I would

339
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,740
recommend a humidifier and a

340
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,840
dehumidifier and also some sort of

341
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,490
exhaust fan to get the stale air out of

342
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,410
the room if it's a small space you

343
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,549
probably just cracked the door open but

344
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:22,990
if you've got a lot of plants and then

345
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:25,299
you're gonna need to exchange some air

346
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,740
gonna need to get that humid air out of

347
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:29,349
there or the plants will never dry

348
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,379
they'll just get stagnant and funky also

349
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,300
I may recommend a small fan you don't

350
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:36,279
want air blowing directly on to the buds

351
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:37,929
but you want to move that air around you

352
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,429
just don't want it stagnant and funky in

353
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:41,409
there you really want to be able to

354
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:43,419
control the climate also you're gonna

355
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:45,929
need something to tell you what's going

356
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:49,839
on in there a thermometer a hydrometer

357
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:51,429
perhaps a pol grow unit you want

358
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,620
something in there so you know what the

359
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:56,289
temperature is what the humidity is so

360
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,789
you can adjust accordingly now it feels

361
00:12:56,289 --> 00:13:00,250
like we've talked a lot about what to

362
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:01,870
buy and how to prepare so let's talk a

363
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,190
little bit about the settings in the

364
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,590
room since we're talking about all this

365
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,540
equipment I like to put a humidifier and

366
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,450
a dehumidifier in the room and I set

367
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:13,240
them both at 50% that way I know that

368
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,400
that room is staying right around 50% if

369
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,799
you can set them up to something like a

370
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,389
PL Gro unit or if you can set them up to

371
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,629
something that'll trigger them to go off

372
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:24,269
and on based on certain parameters

373
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:27,028
put them both at 50% have the

374
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:29,250
dehumidifier work to 50% have that

375
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:32,730
humidifier worked to 50% and keep that

376
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:35,549
room at 50% humidity as consistently as

377
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,649
possible now it may be a good idea to

378
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,969
have some sort of exhaust fan in the

379
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,759
room nothing major just maybe a little

380
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,110
4-inch exhauster if you can do it if you

381
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,909
can just suck the air out of that room

382
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,769
occasionally that would help you out

383
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:48,568
that would get that old stagnant funky

384
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:49,198
air out of there if that is not an

385
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:51,990
option

386
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,309
open the door put a fan by the door just

387
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,259
make sure that air exchanges

388
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,859
occasionally so you don't get old air in

389
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,810
there

390
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,389
now inside this room where you've got

391
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:02,849
your dehumidifier your humidifier and

392
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:05,419
some air exhaust try to keep it

393
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,579
somewhere around 70 degrees in that room

394
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:10,289
65 to 75 degrees will be ideal any

395
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:11,939
hotter you're gonna speed up the drying

396
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:14,519
it's also gonna get funky it's gonna

397
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,170
increase humidity any cooler the room

398
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,350
will start getting too dry and your buds

399
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:20,610
will get crispy too quickly so you've

400
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,050
got your temperature you've got your

401
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,389
humidity under control you've got some

402
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:26,909
air exchange let's put a small fan in

403
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:29,100
the room perhaps on the floor just to

404
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:30,419
keep the air moving around or up high in

405
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,579
the room you don't want it right in the

406
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,559
middle blowing on the plants too much

407
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:36,208
that's gonna create a dry spot and just

408
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,338
dry out some of those buds too quickly

409
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,289
we just want to move the air around so

410
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,610
it doesn't get stale I usually get one

411
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:43,469
of those fans that would sit on your

412
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,930
computer desk just a desk fan it's a

413
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,189
little tiny like a 12 or 14 inch fan put

414
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,688
that in the corner on the floor if

415
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:51,120
you've got a small room that is plenty

416
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:52,708
just move the air around all right so

417
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,289
that sounds like we've got a pretty good

418
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:58,559
idea of a dry and cure space basically a

419
00:14:55,289 --> 00:15:00,299
small room or a grow tent that you can

420
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,669
control the environment in and you can

421
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,828
hang those plants in safely securely and

422
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:06,870
in the dark if you need to use a small

423
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:09,179
closet you can do that just make sure

424
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,370
that door gets opened and those buds

425
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:12,899
don't get stale in there also like I

426
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,759
mentioned earlier if you don't have

427
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,438
sufficient drying space go ahead and use

428
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,600
the flowering room that you flowered the

429
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:20,698
bugs in or maybe move your next round of

430
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,370
plants from the bedroom into that flower

431
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:25,620
and user bedroom grow tents always make

432
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,269
nice dry and cure areas if you're

433
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,129
growing in a 5 by 5 tent

434
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:32,429
you could easily dry your whole harvest

435
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:34,629
and maybe a 3 by 3 tent that wouldn't be

436
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:37,120
a problem at all you don't need that

437
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:38,620
much room to dry your harvest well

438
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,509
hopefully you do [ __ ] hopefully you need

439
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,310
a ten-by-ten but that's not gonna be

440
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:43,720
logical all right now we know what to

441
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:46,029
buy we know what supplies we're gonna

442
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,889
need we've got a safe space set up for

443
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,870
our plants hopefully you've been

444
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:52,029
flushing your plants for ten to fourteen

445
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,799
days there's one more thing we should do

446
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:55,779
before we get to chopping these plants

447
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,459
while they are still standing up we

448
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:59,350
should go and take off all of the big

449
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,269
leaves any leaf that you can break off

450
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,920
with your hand now just go ahead and

451
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:05,019
take it off the plants don't need leaves

452
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:07,360
you're about to harvest them you can do

453
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:08,829
this seven five three days before

454
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,600
harvest you can do it right up before

455
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,730
the moment you harvest just start taking

456
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,100
off all those big leaves those leaves

457
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,480
are unnecessary I like to just go in and

458
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,830
throw them right on the floor to start

459
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,909
turning leaves off throw em right on the

460
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,290
floor and sweep up when you're done

461
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:22,240
because there's gonna be a lot of them

462
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:24,219
there's tear off all of the leaves you

463
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,600
can get you don't need those this is

464
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,970
gonna save you time when it comes

465
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,250
harvest time we're gonna cut these

466
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,290
plants down and let them dry all those

467
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,450
long leaves are just gonna dry on there

468
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:35,949
and be in the way and smell funky and

469
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,140
there are sticky [ __ ] to work through

470
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,790
once they dry they're much easier to get

471
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:41,620
off now so just snap them right off of

472
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:43,870
there do you leave this [ __ ] out of the

473
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,049
entire room before you cut down any of

474
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,549
the plants once they are all Preedy

475
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:51,429
foliated that's what I call it the pre

476
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:54,669
harvest defoliation then it is time to

477
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:56,409
start chopping down these plants I don't

478
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:58,539
know how big your plants are but this is

479
00:16:56,409 --> 00:17:00,309
basically how I chop down a plant I

480
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:01,269
kneel down or if it's on a table

481
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:03,250
whatever I walk to it

482
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,779
I usually kneel down to one knee and I

483
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,730
grab the plant right above where I'm

484
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:08,588
gonna cut so I've got the stalk just a

485
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,000
couple inches above the dirt I get my

486
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:12,099
loppers or whatever you want to call

487
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,049
them your pruners your shears and get in

488
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,909
there and cut right above the dirt right

489
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,980
below my hand Chuck and that's gonna

490
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,959
fall over it's gonna timber on me if I

491
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,610
got a little plant no problem if I'm in

492
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,230
a three or five gallon pot I got this by

493
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,208
myself if I've got a bigger plant

494
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,680
I will ask somebody to help me Hey Dude

495
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,240
hold the top of this because when I cut

496
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,690
it it's gonna [ __ ] timber down on us

497
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,910
so I would get in there and cut it right

498
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,830
at the base if you have got maybe a

499
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,680
tomato cage or some trellising or

500
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:40,329
something like that maybe figure out how

501
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,130
to get the plant out of there by cutting

502
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:44,139
from the top down I like to cut the

503
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,150
whole plan out in one piece and hang the

504
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,759
whole thing upside down and let it all

505
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,100
dry in one piece

506
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,048
that's the way I like to do it if you've

507
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:54,418
put the plant in a screen of green or a

508
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:57,418
tomato cage you may have to start at the

509
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,940
top and cut out individual branches that

510
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:03,000
is just fine make sure that you keep

511
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,440
each branch of each strain together so

512
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,029
that you don't mix anything up I

513
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,269
mentioned earlier how frustrating that

514
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:10,619
[ __ ] is don't mix stuff up so separate

515
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:12,539
your plant free your plant from its

516
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:14,759
tomato cage free the plant from the

517
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:17,099
trellis however you need to then chop it

518
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,419
down now if you've got the whole plant

519
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:21,209
chopped down in one piece

520
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,259
just get a I get a fuzzy stick is what

521
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,110
they're called they saw them at Hobby

522
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:26,548
Lobby or you can use the twisty ties

523
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:27,899
that come with your trash bags because I

524
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:29,369
never use the twisty ties in the trash

525
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,919
bags anyway they always end up for this

526
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:33,449
purpose wrap the twisty tie around the

527
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,070
base of the plant do it kind of do it

528
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,960
securely put another put a branch in

529
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:39,389
there because it may slide off and then

530
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,798
tie that to either your coat hanger or

531
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,750
the line that you're gonna hang it from

532
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,730
if you've got the line hanging across

533
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,500
the room attach it to that securely

534
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,808
hanging it on there in a way that you

535
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,690
know it's not gonna fall if you've got

536
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:53,970
to cut it down into branches try to cut

537
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,440
to where you create little v-shape

538
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,089
intersections and if you hang the plant

539
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,830
upside down you'll see the little

540
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:01,168
wishbone shaped intersections that you

541
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:03,599
can use perfectly to hang your branches

542
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:05,730
on your coat hanger or on your line so

543
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,189
cut the plant flip it upside down and

544
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,289
just hang it in the size of sections

545
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,000
that you need to here's some advice if

546
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:14,159
you have to cut your plant down into

547
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,640
smaller sections to make it fit make the

548
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,220
sections similar sizes that way they dry

549
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,720
at similar speeds if you've got one big

550
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,069
piece and one little piece that big

551
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,360
piece is going to take longer to dry

552
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:26,069
then the little piece it's gonna cause

553
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:28,139
unevenness and you're gonna be confused

554
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:29,819
on what to do so chop everything if

555
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,990
you're gonna chop it let it all hang in

556
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:33,808
one big piece if you're gonna let it

557
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,339
hang in one big piece so cut the plant

558
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:37,589
at the base or pull out the branches

559
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:39,629
hang them on the coat hanger either by

560
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:41,699
using the twisty ties and securing it to

561
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,679
the coat hanger there or just by using

562
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,690
the v-shaped intersections and hanging

563
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,519
it like a little hook on the v-shaped

564
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,710
intersection and just get everything

565
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,289
hanging safely in your drain cure room

566
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,350
chop everything down and just go hang it

567
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:56,399
all up you're gonna be super excited now

568
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:58,139
you're gonna want to go post all your

569
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,540
social media about how you just took

570
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,290
down your first harvest but do not do

571
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,299
that

572
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:05,190
here is some old-school advice don't

573
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:08,399
post any pictures or talk about your

574
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,380
harvest until it's gone if it's going

575
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,810
out for retail if it's going into your

576
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,790
jar and you're safe that's when you talk

577
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:16,859
about it don't talk about it while that

578
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:18,629
[ __ ] is hanging in a room don't talk

579
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:21,959
about it while you're trimming it don't

580
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,150
talk about it yet just wait okay just

581
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,539
wait because right now it's hanging in a

582
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,700
room and when you go to Walmart and you

583
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,960
post it back to facebook also someone's

584
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,100
going on your back [ __ ] door and

585
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,690
getting all your weed and they're gonna

586
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:36,839
trim it for you and you're never gonna

587
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,240
see any of it so don't post yet hold off

588
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:42,209
just wait now if you're chopping down

589
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,620
multiple strains carefully carefully

590
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,019
carefully label these plants you're

591
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,369
gonna so I'll go back recap a little bit

592
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,379
cuz I feel like I went fast grab it

593
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:51,689
right above the dirt chop it down it's

594
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,030
gonna flip upside down and hold it

595
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,230
upside down either put one branch over

596
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:56,940
your line that you're gonna hang it on

597
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,700
and let it hang right there put a label

598
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,930
on it or put it on a coat hanger just

599
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,340
slide the one branch through the coat

600
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,750
hanger swear it's got one arm through

601
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:05,279
and then it's just hangin put it on the

602
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,619
co hanger or cut it into smaller pieces

603
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,740
and do it that way label the coat hanger

604
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:11,849
what strain you've got so cut it down

605
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,970
hang it up

606
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:17,429
label it it's gonna hang there for

607
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,230
somewhere between five and fourteen

608
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,240
maybe a couple more days I haven't seen

609
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,829
them gone go more than 14 days in

610
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,509
Colorado but if you're on the coast

611
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:26,250
where you've got humidity you may get

612
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:28,049
some more time so you've chopped them

613
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,329
down they're hanging upside down you've

614
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:32,369
got them labeled you've got the lights

615
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:34,319
temperature humidity and air flow all

616
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:36,269
controlled in your room now you're just

617
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,759
gonna have to wait somewhere between 5

618
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:40,769
and 14 days for those sticks to start

619
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:44,250
snapping when you bend them you just

620
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:45,960
want him to go crunch you don't want him

621
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,730
to explode you don't want to just

622
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,769
crumble up like an old bag of Doritos

623
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,450
you just want him to snap you don't want

624
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:53,670
a bunch of moisture in there and check a

625
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,590
few of them before you get excited but

626
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,830
when they start snapping consistently

627
00:21:55,589 --> 00:22:01,589
that is when the dry phases ended and it

628
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:04,349
is time to work yourself into the cure

629
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:05,879
phase all right now I did skip the part

630
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:07,109
about putting them on to dry racks that

631
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,150
I talked about you could get from the

632
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:11,309
gross store the gross store sells these

633
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,630
dry racks they look like a 22 inch kick

634
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:14,109
drum head I think they're about 24

635
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,090
inches around

636
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:17,859
they're messy and they're kind of cheap

637
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:21,250
but they work really well you just hang

638
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:23,288
it up and for this I would probably take

639
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,888
the buds off of the sticks and just put

640
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:28,480
just the buds into those racks

641
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:30,219
I wouldn't put the sticks in there I

642
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,808
feel like the sticks are gonna take up a

643
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,370
lot of space in there and they also get

644
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,480
stuck in the [ __ ] netting all a lot

645
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:37,089
they're a pain in the ass

646
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,250
I would cut every single bud off of the

647
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,720
stick if it were me and I would lay the

648
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,878
buds in there and I would spread them

649
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,288
out kind of far and then every morning

650
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:46,089
when I wake up I would go in there and

651
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:47,798
just move those buds around and kind of

652
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:49,689
shuffle them around a little bit that's

653
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:51,278
not the ideal way to do it but I

654
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,200
understand that some of us are limited

655
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:55,690
on space if that's what you've got to do

656
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,460
that's what you have got to do I would

657
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,440
rather see you hang them until they dry

658
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,450
and get a little drier and as soon as

659
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,750
the stick snaps then get it off the

660
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,610
stick but I understand that sometimes

661
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,319
you've got to improvise that's part of

662
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:10,569
being a good grower being able to adjust

663
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:13,450
adapt and improvise with what you've got

664
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:14,829
when you've got it people are so [ __ ]

665
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,509
spoiled now we've got these giant

666
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:19,808
facilities with parking lots and

667
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:22,000
security cameras and loading bays and

668
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,558
Friends when I first started doing this

669
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,940
you couldn't talk about it you couldn't

670
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:26,349
have your friends help you carry your

671
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,788
groceries into the house because now

672
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:29,048
they know you're growing and they're

673
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:31,240
gonna want something or they're gonna

674
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:32,918
[ __ ] steal it if you need more space

675
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,210
you just call a contractor and you get a

676
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:35,649
building permit and you just build out

677
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,480
another room and you've got a dry and

678
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:39,250
cure area back in the day we couldn't do

679
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,720
that you would catch people driving

680
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,128
their [ __ ] weed in the bathroom hey

681
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,899
man I got a piss well at your house no

682
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:45,849
bro you can't be here what man I just

683
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:47,288
got a PETA knob bro you can't pee then

684
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:48,490
you catch on later that he was drying

685
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:50,710
and curing his [ __ ] weed in the

686
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,359
bathroom anyway I got rambley there

687
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,190
those dry racks are cool if that's what

688
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:56,048
you got to do of course I would prefer

689
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,940
to hang it I'd prefer to hang it whole

690
00:23:56,048 --> 00:24:00,190
plant I prefer to hang it till it starts

691
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,980
snapping like I said that's when we

692
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,600
enter the Cure phase now if you didn't

693
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,220
have time or the forethought to start

694
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:08,138
defoliating your plants before you

695
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,028
harvested don't be afraid to go in there

696
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:11,589
and take off all the excess leaves while

697
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:13,898
they're hanging upside down it is never

698
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:15,579
too late to do that all right you guys I

699
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:17,648
feel like I can reek wrap reek wrap

700
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,148
let's reap wrap what I said probably a

701
00:24:17,648 --> 00:24:21,069
recap would be better for a podcast

702
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:22,209
let's recap a little bit you need the

703
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:23,648
appropriate tools you need the

704
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,808
appropriate equipment you need a good

705
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:27,129
room you need to be able to control the

706
00:24:25,808 --> 00:24:28,359
temperature and humidity

707
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,580
you don't want people getting in there

708
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:32,079
you need to control the aroma you're

709
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:33,639
gonna need some gloves you're gonna need

710
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,980
something to hang your plants on and

711
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,070
you're going to need some sort of labels

712
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,048
if you're drawing more than one strain

713
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:42,788
it's a good idea to start pre D foliated

714
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:44,918
get in there and take off the leaves

715
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:47,079
before the chopped down process is

716
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,580
fairly simple grab it chop it hanging

717
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:50,439
that [ __ ] upside down and let it

718
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:52,269
start drying we know what temperature

719
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,360
and humidity we need to keep the dry and

720
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:57,639
cure room we want about 50% about 70

721
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,109
degrees let those plants hang for four

722
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,990
or five days and start snapping the

723
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:03,969
stems and see if they pop it'll be 5 7

724
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,890
10 maybe 14 days before they're ready to

725
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,240
go into containers that's when we're

726
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,340
gonna jar em up that's where we're gonna

727
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,990
put them into containers that's when the

728
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:13,869
cure process is gonna start so I think

729
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:16,659
we've got a good grasp on how to harvest

730
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:18,308
our plants the next step in harvesting

731
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:21,130
you guys is to get in there and clean

732
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:23,109
and reset the grow room that's right it

733
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,490
may be time to buy new bulbs it may be

734
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:26,740
time to change your air conditioner

735
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,960
filters it is certainly time to clean

736
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,329
the cover on your carbon filter also

737
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,490
maybe get in there and scrub the lenses

738
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:35,319
if you've got glass lenses on your

739
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,390
ducted hoods it's a good time to get in

740
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,428
there and scrub that [ __ ] out make sure

741
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,320
that everything is nice and clean clean

742
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:43,509
the room with a cleaning product maybe

743
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:45,220
some bleach maybe some flies in whatever

744
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:47,349
you've got get in there and clean the

745
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,929
[ __ ] out of the grow room but get in the

746
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:52,240
corners get in all the spots you've been

747
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:53,798
missing if you plan on using your grow

748
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,019
room or your grow Hut as your drawing

749
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:57,490
space that's a good excuse but you're

750
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,288
gonna have to clean it as soon as you're

751
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,339
done with that as soon as those plants

752
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:02,500
come out of there and you're trimming

753
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:04,418
you should take a break and go clean the

754
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,548
[ __ ] out of your grow space before you

755
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:09,400
put more plants in there that is the

756
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:11,859
completion of your harvest that is also

757
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,360
the completion of your harvest lesson

758
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:15,668
ladies and gentlemen thanks for hanging

759
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,369
out with me I think the next episode I

760
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:20,259
have a guest scheduled so there will be

761
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:22,689
another episode before the dry and cure

762
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:25,298
episode but there is an in-depth dry and

763
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:27,070
cure episode coming up we'll also talk

764
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:28,509
about trimming a little bit and then I

765
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:30,490
think we're gonna continue with grow

766
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:32,798
lessons and we're gonna start over we're

767
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,690
gonna go right into germinating seeds

768
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,369
and cutting clones and getting a grouse

769
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,259
started all over again

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,990
the saucy mixture put together at a

975
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:43,620
beautiful ratio you guys the mixture

976
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:45,630
smells like cupcake frosting and cookie

977
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:47,429
dough and then we need to take a dab of

978
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,380
it it tastes like you just took a big

979
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:51,210
bite of cookie dough with cupcake

980
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,800
frosting on it and then when you blow it

981
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,600
out it smells like somebody's baking

982
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,269
fresh cookies in the room it smells like

983
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,519
warm chocolate chip and cinnamon cookies

984
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:02,460
filling the room this concentrate is

985
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,170
excellent it is super smooth I took a

986
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,009
couple of gigantic dabs there was no

987
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,539
throat tingle

988
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:09,360
there was no heaviness on the exhale

989
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:11,279
super smooth super clean super delicious

990
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,289
concentrates dude I know you don't want

991
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,990
me to say your name on the air but great

992
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:17,159
product great work you did a hell of a

993
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:19,379
job with this this stuff tastes amazing

994
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,480
the only problem is that it is almost

995
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:24,840
gone I've probably got one or two dabs

996
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,550
before this stuff is extinct so bro come

997
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,579
back with a bigger jar and let's uh

998
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:31,860
let's make a deal all right you guys I'm

999
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:33,690
obviously loving these cream dabs grown

1000
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,030
and extracted by a local farmer hey bro

1001
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,280
great work I truly do appreciate it in

1002
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,260
fact this episode is gonna be really

1003
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,730
long so I've got all the opening

1004
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,770
business covered I'm gonna press pause

1005
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,510
I'm gonna take a DAB probably the last

1006
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:48,719
two dabs of this cream and when I get

1007
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:50,100
back I will give a long lesson on drying

1008
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,219
and curing your freshly harvested

1009
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,500
cannabis plants

1010
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,719
all right podcast rolled I am back I am

1011
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,608
well medicated I am well hydrated and I

1012
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,629
am ready to talk about drying and curing

1013
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:03,799
your freshly harvested cannabis plants

1014
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,539
now let me do a quick update from the

1015
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,609
last episode in the last episode we

1016
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:09,019
talked about harvesting your plants we

1017
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:10,460
talked about cutting them down we talked

1018
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:13,009
about hanging them in a room upside down

1019
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,840
in a climate-controlled room one thing I

1020
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:18,099
failed to mention you should only hang

1021
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,460
one crop in a space at a time to prevent

1022
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:22,940
remoisturize

1023
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,530
the first crop don't cut down one crop

1024
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,108
and then let it hang for four or five

1025
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,730
days five or seven days and then bring

1026
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:30,440
in a fresh crop and lock that in the

1027
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,969
same room because what you're doing is

1028
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,858
just introducing a whole bunch of

1029
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:35,449
moisture into that room and it's just

1030
00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:37,130
gonna go into the other plants they're

1031
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:39,108
going to re moisten the other plants and

1032
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,849
make them take longer and now you've got

1033
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:44,059
to kind of restart your dry anchor

1034
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:46,130
process so one one crop at a time is

1035
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,269
ideal hanging in the room that's

1036
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,608
something I should have mentioned on the

1037
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:51,679
episode before and I didn't remember to

1038
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:54,199
mention that so now we are up to speed

1039
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,598
now let's actually get into drying and

1040
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:59,689
curing our freshly harvested cannabis

1041
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:03,410
plants now after spending four weeks and

1042
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:05,059
vege eight to ten weeks and flower you

1043
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:07,549
really don't want to mess these plants

1044
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:10,759
up at the very end here curing is a very

1045
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:13,160
critical process curing you can make the

1046
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,930
most delicious buds taste like total

1047
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:17,539
[ __ ] from drying and curing them

1048
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:18,799
improperly you can ruin the entire crop

1049
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:20,599
at this point don't get too scared

1050
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,700
because I'm gonna guide you through not

1051
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:25,250
ruining it but keep in mind that this is

1052
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:27,199
one of the most critical parts in the

1053
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,358
growing process this is a huge process

1054
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,939
and a lot of things can go wrong if you

1055
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,279
don't pay attention so take your time

1056
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,820
and pay attention and don't rush to

1057
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,710
smoke your new crop you've waited what

1058
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,630
what do we say about 14 weeks probably

1059
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,608
is what we did the math on 120 days

1060
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:46,130
you've grown these plants for 120 days

1061
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:48,348
is about how long it takes why not wait

1062
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:50,480
a couple of days longer until they are

1063
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:52,338
perfect before you start smoking it so

1064
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,039
let's get it actually drying and curing

1065
00:36:52,338 --> 00:36:56,690
these plants now the last grow episode

1066
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,460
was a harvest episode and it left us

1067
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,650
with our plants hanging upside down in a

1068
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,900
room with proper temps proper humidity

1069
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:05,430
and minimal light now we've been waiting

1070
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,110
for the sticks for our plants to snap

1071
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:08,819
we've got plants hanging upside down

1072
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:11,010
they've been deleted we're just waiting

1073
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:14,010
for the right humidity within the plants

1074
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,780
for the sticks to pop the sticks should

1075
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,610
snap we're waiting for him to snap but

1076
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,920
not explode when you grab a branch of

1077
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:22,320
the plant and you just bend it you want

1078
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,920
it to sound kind of like that you don't

1079
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,900
want it to go

1080
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,400
you don't want it to explode with

1081
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,349
dryness you don't want it to fall apart

1082
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,990
and you don't want it to be gummy or

1083
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:33,779
rubbery or bendy you don't want it to

1084
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:36,299
defend you want it to snap and pop so

1085
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,010
the stick should snap the bigger sticks

1086
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,500
and larger plants are going to take a

1087
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,060
little bit longer the skinnier sticks

1088
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,679
and smaller plants are obviously going

1089
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:46,110
to dry more quickly because they don't

1090
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,929
hold as much moisture also if you took

1091
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,760
off Leslie for more relief they're going

1092
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:51,899
to dry more quickly without the leaf and

1093
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,790
they're going to take a little longer

1094
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,990
with that extra leaf on there because

1095
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:56,969
it's going to hold more moisture

1096
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:59,159
there'll be more moisture in the room

1097
00:37:56,969 --> 00:38:02,009
just more moisture overall to deal with

1098
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:04,710
so but waiting for is those sticks to

1099
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:07,140
snap when the sticks snap that's when

1100
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,659
the container curing process begins I

1101
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:11,519
use two different methods for this based

1102
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:13,799
on crop size don't forget that I run

1103
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,090
commercial grows in a commercial setting

1104
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,920
we do things a little differently than

1105
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:19,200
we would do in a home setting I'm used

1106
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,880
to pulling down 50 or more pounds in a

1107
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,619
commercial environment you don't want a

1108
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,059
bunch of jars you don't really have the

1109
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,889
space for a bunch of jars you don't have

1110
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:27,779
the manpower to open a bunch of jars all

1111
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:30,000
day so we do things a little differently

1112
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:33,180
in a home grow it's not as many pounds

1113
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,280
it's less jars so I use jar technique in

1114
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:38,159
a home grow but let's talk about the way

1115
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,019
I would do it in a commercial grow in a

1116
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,179
commercial grow I'll chop the large

1117
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:44,639
stalk and naked stems out of the plants

1118
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:47,219
and place the buds still on sticks into

1119
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,119
large Rubbermaid containers so you've

1120
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:50,819
got a big plant

1121
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,109
you've lollipop tup probably 12 to 18

1122
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,550
inches of it so you've got some naked

1123
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,800
sticks right that's what I mean by naked

1124
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,990
sticks that the shaved legs and that

1125
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,970
main big stock I'll cut all of that out

1126
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:01,739
and that goes to waste and a commercial

1127
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:05,369
grow that's actually got to be weighed

1128
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:07,529
and documented as removed waste so now

1129
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:09,179
I've got two piles one pile is naked

1130
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,500
sticks that need to be documented as

1131
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:12,629
waste they'll be chipped up and thrown

1132
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,159
away then there's another pile that's

1133
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:16,440
the usable product of the steaks with

1134
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,839
buds up it they need to be trimmed those

1135
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,550
buds still on the sticks get

1136
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,070
put into the Rubbermaid containers

1137
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,580
untrimmed there's something to keep in

1138
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,380
mind

1139
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:27,569
carefully label your Rubbermaid

1140
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,660
containers do not label the lids never

1141
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:32,550
label lids in a facility and a home grow

1142
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:35,219
don't label the lids lids are

1143
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,740
interchangeable label the container so

1144
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:39,959
chop the sticks out put the good usable

1145
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:41,459
buds into the Rubbermaid container don't

1146
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,530
squish them in there too tight fill it

1147
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,849
up pretty well but don't cram anything

1148
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,840
in there you need some air space in

1149
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,279
there and you don't want to smash

1150
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,620
anything and if it's too tightly pressed

1151
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,370
together it'll get funky it'll start to

1152
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,170
smell bad

1153
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:53,909
Moisture get trapped in there and you'll

1154
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,500
start to get that stale ammonia smell

1155
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:57,960
and that's what we were trying to avoid

1156
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,670
with proper drying and curing so I would

1157
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,470
go through and remove all of the sticks

1158
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,730
get all the good buds into the

1159
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:04,679
containers and then once they are all

1160
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,750
completed I would go through and put the

1161
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:08,519
lids on every container at that point I

1162
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,960
would have everything labeled it all be

1163
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,269
sitting open and then when we're done

1164
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,159
with every plant that's gonna get been

1165
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:15,900
that day that's when I start putting the

1166
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,670
lids on and sealing up the containers

1167
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,170
now I feel like I haven't described

1168
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,030
these containers properly these

1169
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:24,690
Rubbermaid containers are like the size

1170
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:27,570
of maybe a laundry basket they're about

1171
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:32,070
three feet wide I guess and then maybe a

1172
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:33,510
foot or so wide I know I said wide but

1173
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:36,090
three feet long and a foot or so wide

1174
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,770
and then probably about eighteen maybe

1175
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:40,590
twenty inches deep they're the one that

1176
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:42,000
you are use for packing or you just put

1177
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,950
a bunch of clothes in there just a bunch

1178
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,119
of bullshit's the one when the kids come

1179
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:46,799
to the front door they're trying to sell

1180
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,000
candy for church like I got some candy

1181
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,830
for church sir would you like to reach

1182
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,969
the money I think at the big Rubbermaid

1183
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:53,340
container that's the container I'm

1184
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:54,750
talking about it's just like a moving

1185
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,360
box or something is what it looks like a

1186
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:59,849
storage container we can fit three or

1187
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,769
four large plants in those containers

1188
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:02,759
from the commercial grow so I guess I

1189
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:03,989
should have mentioned that a little

1190
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,850
earlier but it just dawned on me that I

1191
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:07,769
did not describe these containers in any

1192
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:10,170
way so now let's talk more about what

1193
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:12,599
happens to these plants once they are

1194
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:15,059
put into this container and the lid is

1195
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,429
put on them they need to be opened and

1196
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:19,170
rotated every day until they're dry

1197
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:20,879
enough to seal up without risking any

1198
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,710
mold development the first day is always

1199
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,630
scary when you seal them up and then

1200
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:26,780
leave overnight that is always a scary

1201
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:29,610
feeling until you get there the next day

1202
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,050
don't be afraid to leave them open if

1203
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,190
you feel like they're a little too moist

1204
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,318
if you cut them down and get

1205
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:36,300
in the bin and realize aw [ __ ] a couple

1206
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,429
of these are too wet don't be afraid to

1207
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,690
leave those open open overnight you

1208
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,639
would rather leave them open and get

1209
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,650
them a little too dry then close them up

1210
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:45,809
and get them a little funky a little

1211
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:48,568
funky doesn't go away a little too dry

1212
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:50,159
we can work with so you seal them up you

1213
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:51,179
put the lids on them and then you might

1214
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,769
want to check on them before you leave

1215
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:54,179
for the day make sure that nothing needs

1216
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:55,679
to be rotated nothing needs to be

1217
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:57,809
flipped around nothing needs to be left

1218
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,259
open like I said if it needs to be left

1219
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,420
open

1220
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,890
leave it open don't be afraid then

1221
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,358
you're gonna leave you're gonna come

1222
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:04,980
back the next day you're gonna have a

1223
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,529
bunch of sealed containers they need to

1224
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,260
be popped open immediately I would pop

1225
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:12,690
them open for four maybe six maybe seven

1226
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,520
hours and check on him while they were

1227
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,950
sealed a lot of the moisture that was

1228
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:18,809
inside those sticks reconstituted

1229
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:20,250
throughout those buds and a lot of

1230
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:21,809
moisture built up in that container

1231
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,338
you're gonna find a lot of spongy and

1232
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:26,159
wet buds when you come in in the morning

1233
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:27,690
that's expected don't worry it'll be

1234
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:28,920
okay you're gonna leave it open and get

1235
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:31,980
some of that [ __ ] out of there that's

1236
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,450
the idea you want to open it up every

1237
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,219
day and let that stuff out of there when

1238
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:36,929
they start getting dry again some of the

1239
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,489
sticks might not even snap again some of

1240
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,799
them may have remoisten tore they don't

1241
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:42,568
snap that that means you may have done

1242
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,339
just a little bit too early but it's not

1243
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:46,739
bad because we can get that moisture out

1244
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:48,299
you don't want it to get too dry so

1245
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:49,949
you're gonna pop them open you're gonna

1246
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,329
see how what they are leave them open

1247
00:42:49,949 --> 00:42:53,279
you may just want to leave them open for

1248
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:55,740
an hour if they're real dry an hour is

1249
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,440
fine four to six hours is not uncommon

1250
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:00,659
on the first day if you chop those

1251
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,639
plants down or if you bend those plants

1252
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:04,259
a little bit too early they may be

1253
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,000
really wet and you may have to leave

1254
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,650
them open for four to six maybe the

1255
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,480
whole shift of 8 to 10 hours they may

1256
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:11,490
have to stay open that's not uncommon

1257
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,679
try not to cut them down and put them

1258
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:15,000
into the bins so early next time but

1259
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:16,529
you'll be okay this is something you're

1260
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,079
gonna have to dial in with your facility

1261
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,880
and with your technique so the duration

1262
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,510
of burp time is going to decrease as

1263
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,300
slowly as the buds dry these bins are

1264
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:31,109
going to sit in a room ideally that is

1265
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:33,000
at 50% humidity and 70 degrees until you

1266
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:35,219
have time to trim them I run a

1267
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,289
humidifier and a dehumidifier at the

1268
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:39,750
same time and they're both set at 50%

1269
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:41,909
humidity so if that room gets to fifty

1270
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:44,670
five percent humidity that dehumidifier

1271
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:45,629
kicks on immediately if he gets to forty

1272
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,519
five percent

1273
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,230
the humidifier comes on immediately I

1274
00:43:47,518 --> 00:43:51,179
don't get out of that 10 degree range

1275
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,318
and it stays pretty close with both of

1276
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:54,088
those machines and they're fighting each

1277
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:57,329
other they pretty much just stay on all

1278
00:43:54,088 --> 00:43:58,980
the time so I've got these buds they are

1279
00:43:57,329 --> 00:44:01,109
in containers they have not been trimmed

1280
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,139
yet and they still need to be burped on

1281
00:44:01,108 --> 00:44:05,759
a daily basis the first thing the dry

1282
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:07,259
and cure manager or the trim team

1283
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:10,019
manager should do when they get to the

1284
00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:12,358
grow is pop open these bins and see what

1285
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:14,308
type of situation you've got they should

1286
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,568
be getting drier and more smokeable and

1287
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:18,240
they should start smelling more like

1288
00:44:15,568 --> 00:44:20,909
dank cannabis every day that fresh green

1289
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,318
wet smell should be going away but

1290
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:24,509
you're going to have to pop them

1291
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,818
everyday and pay attention to how long

1292
00:44:24,509 --> 00:44:28,710
they need to be open like I said that

1293
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:31,380
first day you're gonna get four to six

1294
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,358
hours maybe the second day four to six

1295
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,640
hours maybe the third day four hours

1296
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,838
maybe the fourth day three hours then

1297
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,608
maybe you're gonna have to pop them open

1298
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:41,130
for an hour every day and see what's

1299
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:43,440
going on and check it out eventually you

1300
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,450
won't have to open them anymore once

1301
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,059
you've gotten them to about 65% humidity

1302
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:49,919
inside the container consistently you

1303
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:52,048
don't have to burp it that is cured

1304
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,298
where you want it and it's also in that

1305
00:44:52,048 --> 00:44:56,849
room with 50% humidity so it's gonna

1306
00:44:54,298 --> 00:44:58,650
stay about 50% humidity and it won't get

1307
00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:00,809
less than that and they can the

1308
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:03,240
containers hold moisture in there so

1309
00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:04,650
it's gonna stay above 50% trust me so

1310
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:06,629
while you're drying and curing inside

1311
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:09,389
those bins be sure to burp the bins

1312
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,880
every day and rotate the buds to prevent

1313
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:13,858
mold and funky aromas until they get dry

1314
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,660
enough to leave alone don't be afraid to

1315
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:17,608
take the buds and pick them up right

1316
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:19,348
outside of the container and flip them

1317
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:21,028
over and set it back in so all the buds

1318
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,160
that were on the bottom are now on the

1319
00:45:21,028 --> 00:45:24,568
top and do that you can do that once or

1320
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:27,509
twice a day if you feel like you need to

1321
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:28,768
if they are really wet something I want

1322
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:31,019
to keep stressing is if they are too

1323
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:33,058
moist don't be afraid to leave the lid

1324
00:45:31,018 --> 00:45:34,919
off the containers and tell the buds are

1325
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:36,690
nice and dry and you feel comfortable

1326
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,068
closing them up and you're sure there's

1327
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:40,528
not going to get any mold in there

1328
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:42,630
because if you leave it closed for too

1329
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:45,630
long or you bend these buds too early

1330
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:48,329
you're going to create an ammonia type

1331
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:50,130
funky terrible smell inside your buds

1332
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:52,200
they're not going to burn well they're

1333
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:54,358
gonna taste terrible they're gonna smell

1334
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:55,588
funky and it's not going to be desirable

1335
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:57,268
and you're not going to be able to sell

1336
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:58,349
it at your dispensary or however you

1337
00:45:57,268 --> 00:46:00,839
plan on selling

1338
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:03,029
so one problem you may run into if you

1339
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,860
leave it close to long is funky aromas

1340
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,170
the only thing you can do to fix that is

1341
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:09,510
try to air it out just leave it open let

1342
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,369
it dry try to let that smell go away and

1343
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:14,070
it's probably not going to you've

1344
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:16,049
probably gone too long so make sure not

1345
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,780
to seal it up for too long and make sure

1346
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:19,680
not to seal it up when it's too moist

1347
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,420
another problem you could run into

1348
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:24,389
during the drying and curing process as

1349
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:26,730
the buds could get too dry if your buds

1350
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:29,009
get too dry in those containers a trick

1351
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:32,610
you can do is to go pull a few leaves

1352
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:34,530
from your growing plants if you've got a

1353
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:36,150
flower room you probably need to be

1354
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,530
foliate a little bit and pull some plant

1355
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:40,170
pull some leaves off those flowering

1356
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:42,960
plants anyway so go get I would say four

1357
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:45,119
to six large leaves per Rubbermaid

1358
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,789
container is more than enough to

1359
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,769
rehydrate some semi-dry buds in one of

1360
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:51,779
those containers we tried to put too

1361
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:54,989
much in there and it made it really wet

1362
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:57,210
really quickly so 4 to 6 leaves is more

1363
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:59,129
than enough to remoisten an entire

1364
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:01,440
Rubbermaid container if you left it open

1365
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:03,539
just a little bit too long if you got it

1366
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,829
down into that Colorado crunch zone then

1367
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:06,329
you've done [ __ ] up and you might not

1368
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:07,559
be able to fix it but we'll talk about

1369
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:09,869
that a little bit later in the episode

1370
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,509
but if you didn't go too far just grab

1371
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:14,759
four or five maybe six leaves throw them

1372
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:16,560
in in the container and seal it up for

1373
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,720
just a few hours then go check on it

1374
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:21,269
that moisture will reconstitute the buds

1375
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,949
and give you a second chance I would not

1376
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:25,349
recommend using anything other than

1377
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:27,149
cannabis leaves maybe Boveda packs

1378
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:30,179
Boveda packs however you like to say it

1379
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:32,130
the Boveda packs come in sixty two

1380
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:34,289
percent humidity you can use those if

1381
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:37,110
you'd like although I do not prefer them

1382
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:39,269
myself I think they make a weird flavor

1383
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:41,640
in my cannabis buds I think that using

1384
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:44,219
the leaves of the same plant is the best

1385
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:47,190
idea alright so that is basically the

1386
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:48,989
commercial grow version of drying and

1387
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:52,530
curing your cannabis plants on a large

1388
00:47:48,989 --> 00:47:54,539
scale now I'm going to take a giant dab

1389
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,310
and when we get back we will talk about

1390
00:47:54,539 --> 00:48:00,920
drying and curing your cannabis on a

1391
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:00,920
smaller scale for the home grower

1392
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:22,730
let's get back to this dry and cure

1393
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:24,679
episode the home row or the connoisseur

1394
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:26,719
version of drying and curing your final

1395
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:28,190
product is a little bit different than

1396
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:30,048
the commercial grow version but it's

1397
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,179
basically the same idea we want to slow

1398
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:34,369
down the drying process we want to get

1399
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:36,230
those buds to feel nice and sticky we

1400
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:38,510
want them to smell nice and sweet we

1401
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:41,420
wanted to burn nice and smooth so this

1402
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:44,630
is how I would dry and cure my product

1403
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:46,909
in a small connoisseur batch in a

1404
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:48,890
smaller grow a home grow or a boutique

1405
00:48:46,909 --> 00:48:51,230
grow or maybe something I was going to

1406
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:53,598
enter into a competition if this was

1407
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:56,269
going into a cup this is how I would

1408
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,369
cure my product the main difference is

1409
00:48:56,269 --> 00:49:01,369
that I would not be using the gigantic

1410
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:04,430
Rubbermaid containers I would use court

1411
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:07,068
size widemouth glass jars I don't want

1412
00:49:04,429 --> 00:49:08,778
to use bigger jars I feel like maybe too

1413
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:10,278
much moisture gets stuck in there you

1414
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:12,139
have the same conditions that you create

1415
00:49:10,278 --> 00:49:14,568
in those Rubbermaid containers I like

1416
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:16,730
the smaller more focused jars another

1417
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:18,769
note before we get too far make sure you

1418
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:21,318
label each jar if you're working with

1419
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:23,778
more than one strain label the jars not

1420
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:25,548
the lids lids are interchangeable be

1421
00:49:23,778 --> 00:49:27,500
careful with this please if you're

1422
00:49:25,548 --> 00:49:28,099
working with different phenotypes label

1423
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,159
the jar

1424
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:33,318
whatever arise phenotype to arise

1425
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:35,598
phenotype 3 if you're running a pack of

1426
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:37,298
seeds or whatever label the jars so that

1427
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,650
you know what you're working with

1428
00:49:37,298 --> 00:49:42,318
basically everything up to the point of

1429
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:44,180
the sticks snapping is the same we're

1430
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,608
waiting for the snakes to snap once the

1431
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:50,509
sticks snap that's when we can start the

1432
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:52,608
jar curing process four jar tech I would

1433
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:54,619
take the snappy sticks and chop off

1434
00:49:52,608 --> 00:49:56,449
every bud into a bucket just get all

1435
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:58,519
those buds off the sticks into the

1436
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:59,538
bucket throw those sticks away get rid

1437
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:01,489
of them do whatever you do with them

1438
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:04,069
compost and shred them up toss them

1439
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:06,019
those are done then I hand trim the buds

1440
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:07,608
I'll do another episode all about hand

1441
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:10,219
trimming the buds I don't like trim

1442
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:11,568
machines and I don't like wet trim but

1443
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:13,429
I'll talk about that in the trimming

1444
00:50:11,568 --> 00:50:15,288
episode that is coming up so I trim the

1445
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:17,598
buds they should be dry enough by now to

1446
00:50:15,289 --> 00:50:19,640
knock off most of the leaves with your

1447
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,619
thumbs and thumb nails so trim them up

1448
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:24,318
pretty closely with your thumb then put

1449
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:25,550
the trimmed buds into the glass jars

1450
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,579
that we talked about the why

1451
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:32,660
mouths quart-size mason jars fill those

1452
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:35,719
jars about 75 to 90% fool if your buds

1453
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:38,299
are fluffier if your buds are bigger

1454
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:40,429
you're only gonna be able to get 75% in

1455
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,289
there because of all the air space I get

1456
00:50:40,429 --> 00:50:44,929
it it makes sense if you've got smaller

1457
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:46,969
buds you can put up to 90% in there but

1458
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:48,980
do not press them down into the jar and

1459
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:50,629
don't overpack them and don't squish

1460
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,360
them in you just want them lightly

1461
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:55,940
sitting in there now once the jar is

1462
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:58,430
full I add the lid and I set a timer I

1463
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:01,010
like to check my buds about 4 hours

1464
00:50:58,429 --> 00:51:03,469
after being sealed up for the first time

1465
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:05,420
this first check lets me see how much

1466
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:07,339
moisture is trapped in my butts if the

1467
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,800
inside of the jar is extremely humid

1468
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,630
I'll just leave that lid off for an hour

1469
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,670
or more and the commercial grow we were

1470
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:16,309
talking about four to six maybe eight

1471
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:19,400
hours maybe even 10 hours those are much

1472
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:21,380
larger plants much larger batches and

1473
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,240
much larger containers there is much

1474
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,789
more moisture in there so for these

1475
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:28,699
smaller jars I only want to leave it off

1476
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:30,590
for a little bit at a time these smaller

1477
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:32,989
batches can get away from you quite

1478
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:35,030
quickly so pay more attention so open it

1479
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:36,859
up see how humid it is if it's really

1480
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:38,720
humid and really squishy you're gonna

1481
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,490
want to leave it open for an hour maybe

1482
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,169
a little bit more just keep checking on

1483
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:44,569
it and do not forget about it set

1484
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:47,090
another timer if the humidity has not

1485
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:48,860
made the buds squishy again I'll leave

1486
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:51,019
the jar open for only like 15 to 30

1487
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,390
minutes to let the moisture out and that

1488
00:51:51,019 --> 00:51:55,039
old funky air out of the jar and then

1489
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:56,869
it'll kind of refresh with fresh air in

1490
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:00,110
there then I'll reseal the jar and let

1491
00:51:56,869 --> 00:52:02,809
it sit for another 4 to 6 hours I set a

1492
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:05,420
timer for this then in 4 to 6 hours I

1493
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:07,519
pop that jar and I gently stir the buds

1494
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,889
around and check the aroma that comes

1495
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:15,170
out of there what I'm looking for when I

1496
00:52:09,889 --> 00:52:17,420
smell is an aroma of ammonia or funk or

1497
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:18,769
just you'll notice it your nose will

1498
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,659
crinkle up in your eyes will make a

1499
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:23,329
weird splint you'll go [ __ ] I [ __ ] up

1500
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:26,059
looking for that aroma I'm hoping that's

1501
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:28,460
not present it shouldn't be also I'm

1502
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:31,489
looking to see if it smells less wet

1503
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:34,070
does it gone from that wet juicy hey

1504
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:35,509
smell two more of that cured chronic

1505
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,010
smell that I'm looking for because it'll

1506
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,660
start doing it quickly and then it will

1507
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:40,609
improve over time

1508
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:42,858
so I'm cracking the jar open I'm looking

1509
00:52:40,608 --> 00:52:45,949
to see how much humidity is in there

1510
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:49,009
I stir him around if the buds seem damp

1511
00:52:45,949 --> 00:52:51,018
or extra spongy at this point I'll dump

1512
00:52:49,009 --> 00:52:52,940
him out of the jar and let him sit for a

1513
00:52:51,018 --> 00:52:55,639
few minutes until that excess moisture

1514
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,528
evaporates you don't want the buds super

1515
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:59,568
soggy and sealed in a jar you don't want

1516
00:52:57,528 --> 00:53:02,150
the buds super wet and press together in

1517
00:52:59,568 --> 00:53:04,038
a jar if they still feel wet and spongy

1518
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,358
on the outside I'll dump them out and

1519
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:07,789
let them sit out for a few minutes until

1520
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:09,619
they feel dry on the outside but when

1521
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:11,599
you squeeze them they're mushy still a

1522
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:13,278
little bit you just want them dry on the

1523
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,318
outside wet on the inside is what you're

1524
00:53:13,278 --> 00:53:17,509
going for at this point if the buds are

1525
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:19,548
sticking together then I dump them out

1526
00:53:17,509 --> 00:53:21,650
completely and let them dry more before

1527
00:53:19,548 --> 00:53:24,259
putting them back in now we want a

1528
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:26,210
little bit of moisture in these buds the

1529
00:53:24,259 --> 00:53:28,400
little bit of moisture is going to make

1530
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:30,440
the drying and curing process happen but

1531
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,730
we don't want enough moisture to cause

1532
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,769
mold and funk

1533
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:35,719
so we burped the jar about every four

1534
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:38,389
hours to make sure we don't seal too

1535
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:40,098
much water in the jar for too long we

1536
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:42,500
let some of the curing process happen by

1537
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:43,700
opening the jar letting that old gas out

1538
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,099
that contains the chlorophyll that

1539
00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:47,480
contains the sugars that gas evaporates

1540
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:50,000
out of the jar we replace it with fresh

1541
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,679
air we seal it back up then when we seal

1542
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,230
it it's allowed to restart the curing

1543
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,879
process it'll start deteriorating and

1544
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:58,068
eating up more of that chlorophyll more

1545
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,240
of those excess minerals and sugars

1546
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,639
inside of there and they will start

1547
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:04,038
evaporating out of your buds you'll get

1548
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:06,469
them out so let's get back on track here

1549
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:08,599
after the first couple of days you can

1550
00:54:06,469 --> 00:54:11,179
slowly increase your burp intervals as

1551
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:13,579
the buds get drier you may only need to

1552
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:15,500
open these jars up every 6 to 8 hours

1553
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:17,960
after a little bit and the time that you

1554
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,909
leave them open will also decrease so

1555
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,769
maybe after a few days you pop it open

1556
00:54:19,909 --> 00:54:23,268
every eight hours maybe you pop it open

1557
00:54:21,768 --> 00:54:24,169
right before you go to work you leave it

1558
00:54:23,268 --> 00:54:25,429
open while you're brushing your teeth

1559
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,048
and getting your shoes on and then you

1560
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,489
close it up and you leave you come back

1561
00:54:27,048 --> 00:54:30,409
from work and then you pop it open it's

1562
00:54:28,489 --> 00:54:32,209
probably been 10 hours by now pop it

1563
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:33,558
open again stir the buds around make

1564
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,509
sure nothing's gone funky if nothing's

1565
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:37,609
gone funky just leave it open for five

1566
00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:40,039
minutes let that air exchange in there

1567
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:41,449
seal it right back up then you can go 10

1568
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:43,640
hours and you know you're safe at 10

1569
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:45,018
hours see what happens at 11 hours see

1570
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:47,328
what happens at 12 hours just start

1571
00:54:45,018 --> 00:54:49,068
stretching it every day by the end of

1572
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:51,559
two weeks you'll just be popping these

1573
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:52,369
jars open once a day you'll check it out

1574
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:54,349
you'll give it a good

1575
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:56,599
you'll say that is so close and then you

1576
00:54:54,349 --> 00:54:59,420
can close it back up by the end of two

1577
00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:01,999
weeks these buds will be beautifully

1578
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:05,960
beautifully cured so the bud should be

1579
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:07,998
sticky on the outside and spongy but not

1580
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,380
dry and crumbly they should almost have

1581
00:55:07,998 --> 00:55:10,759
a little bit of squeeze a little bit of

1582
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:13,099
give to them and then stick to your

1583
00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:15,199
fingers they shouldn't fall apart and

1584
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:17,059
just crumble up like a lot of the

1585
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,558
Colorado dispensary bud does

1586
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:20,210
unfortunately and the reason for that

1587
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,130
you guys is because it's sitting on the

1588
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:23,869
shelf out there all day they're opening

1589
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:26,298
up those jars and showing it to you all

1590
00:55:23,869 --> 00:55:27,470
day this stuff is just getting dry so

1591
00:55:26,298 --> 00:55:29,659
that's the problem with the Colorado

1592
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:31,909
crunch I apologize for that the Grover's

1593
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:33,348
work hard to get it proper and then it's

1594
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:35,598
sent to the dispensary and left in those

1595
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:38,210
jars and the bud tenders don't do us

1596
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,650
justice so I apologize so on day one I

1597
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,449
chopped the buds off the sticks and I

1598
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:44,180
trim them up then I filled the jars

1599
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:46,248
about 90% full then I seal the jar I

1600
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:48,139
checked the jar in about four hours I

1601
00:55:46,248 --> 00:55:49,848
opened it long enough for the excess

1602
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:51,828
moisture to come out of the jar that

1603
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:54,170
could be a little while that could be a

1604
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:55,970
short amount of time it kind of depends

1605
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:57,920
on how wet the buds were when you jarred

1606
00:55:55,969 --> 00:56:00,259
them up then I check it again in about

1607
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,950
four hours I shuffled the buds if I feel

1608
00:56:00,259 --> 00:56:05,449
that's necessary it's likely necessary

1609
00:56:02,949 --> 00:56:07,730
then I check again in four to six hours

1610
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:09,409
and leave open as necessary if they're

1611
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:11,298
getting too sticky again I'll dump them

1612
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:13,639
out you'll want to check as soon as you

1613
00:56:11,298 --> 00:56:15,199
wake up the next day the burp process

1614
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:17,358
will slow down over the next few days

1615
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:20,179
you want it to take as long as possible

1616
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:21,858
without allowing mildew to develop you

1617
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:23,929
want to slow it down the longer it takes

1618
00:56:21,858 --> 00:56:25,759
the better the more time that it takes

1619
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:27,649
for that moisture to come out the more

1620
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:30,019
opportunity you have for chlorophyll to

1621
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:32,150
be removed the only thing to worry about

1622
00:56:30,018 --> 00:56:34,278
very similarly to the rubbermaid

1623
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:36,710
technique is trapping too much moisture

1624
00:56:34,278 --> 00:56:39,259
in your containers for too long and

1625
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:42,139
causing yourself mildew or funky flavors

1626
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:43,699
if you walked your buds up in these jars

1627
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:45,798
long enough to where you got like white

1628
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:46,998
MOLLE webbing growing on there and it

1629
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:48,548
looks like some cotton coming out you

1630
00:56:46,998 --> 00:56:51,409
[ __ ] up and didn't pay any attention

1631
00:56:48,548 --> 00:56:53,268
throw that away if your jar is starting

1632
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:55,129
to get an ammonia smell you've sealed it

1633
00:56:53,268 --> 00:56:57,679
up too long you've got to open it more

1634
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:59,450
frequently and longer next time you may

1635
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:00,858
be able to save it but it's unlikely the

1636
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,568
only thing you can do is leave it open

1637
00:57:00,858 --> 00:57:03,798
and let it dry out and hopefully that

1638
00:57:02,568 --> 00:57:06,269
smell will go away

1639
00:57:03,798 --> 00:57:08,710
so don't leave it close to

1640
00:57:06,269 --> 00:57:10,539
don't let mildew happen don't let that

1641
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:12,730
funky smell happen once you're past the

1642
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:14,650
first few days you'll kind of be out of

1643
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:17,170
the mildew danger zone but still be

1644
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:19,900
careful also keep your jars in a cool

1645
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:21,820
dark place while you're curing your buds

1646
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:23,769
but also don't leave them somewhere

1647
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:27,340
where you're going to forget about them

1648
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:29,619
also here in Colorado I'm running a swap

1649
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:32,440
cooler in the main portion the living

1650
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:34,420
area of my house don't go dump your buds

1651
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,159
on the table near the swamp cooler this

1652
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,079
is not going to do you any good this is

1653
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,629
going to reconstitute them and make them

1654
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:43,000
wetter think about wetter is that a word

1655
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,920
anyway think about the environment where

1656
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,389
you were drying and curing your products

1657
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,250
if you're gonna dump them out on the

1658
00:57:46,389 --> 00:57:50,949
table and an attempt to get them more

1659
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:53,409
dry make sure that the room is drier

1660
00:57:50,949 --> 00:57:55,000
than the butt or it's not going to work

1661
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:56,440
just keep that kind of stuff in mind you

1662
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,840
guys think about your environment think

1663
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,970
about your products so I feel like we've

1664
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,700
got a basic understanding of how to cure

1665
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:06,309
our buds now let's get into the

1666
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:09,069
technical talk about why we do it and

1667
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:10,989
what's technically happening so curing

1668
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:13,090
your buds properly makes your buds burn

1669
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:15,939
and smoke smoothly and it also brings

1670
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:17,500
out the best flavors and aromas proper

1671
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,710
drying and curing will also increase

1672
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,150
your potency now why why does that

1673
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:24,789
happen because your buds contain

1674
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:27,550
chlorophyll chlorophyll is what gives

1675
00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:29,259
your buds that harsh smoke and hay like

1676
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:31,030
flavor that burn your throat kind of

1677
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:33,010
funky flavor that's from too much

1678
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:34,930
chlorophyll that's from excess minerals

1679
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:37,300
in the plant that could also be from an

1680
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:40,059
improper flush but it's usually from an

1681
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,710
improper cure so curing the buds will

1682
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:44,500
remove chlorophyll and increase your

1683
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:46,480
potency at the same time the only way to

1684
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:50,050
remove chlorophyll is by turning it into

1685
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,820
a gas sealing our moist buds in a jar

1686
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:53,440
creates an environment that will break

1687
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:57,070
down the chlorophyll and turn it into a

1688
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,250
gas darkness moisture and oxygen will

1689
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:02,140
create a bacteria within the jar that

1690
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,789
bacteria will break down the sugars and

1691
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:06,129
leftover minerals created by the

1692
00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:08,259
decomposition of the chlorophyll and it

1693
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:10,360
will turn into a vapor that can escape

1694
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,740
the jar when you pop it open that was

1695
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,570
what I was talking about earlier when I

1696
00:59:11,739 --> 00:59:15,250
said we pop open the jar and let the

1697
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:17,019
chemical reaction happen now this

1698
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,829
process is going to make your bud burn

1699
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:19,239
smoother

1700
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:22,119
it's going to take make it taste better

1701
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:24,130
it's gonna bring out the proper aromas

1702
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:25,930
the proper terpene profile that you're

1703
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:28,568
looking for and it's also going to

1704
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:31,328
increase the overall potency of your

1705
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:33,338
finished product now if you really want

1706
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:35,950
to nerd out and dial this in and create

1707
00:59:33,338 --> 00:59:38,288
a connoisseur product find yourself a

1708
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:39,939
hygrometer that fits inside of your

1709
00:59:38,289 --> 00:59:41,920
mason jar there are a couple available

1710
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:43,239
that fit right inside the mason jar you

1711
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,559
can press it up to the front of the jar

1712
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:47,019
where you can read the display without

1713
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,589
opening the jar find yourself

1714
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:51,909
hygrometers that will fit in the jar and

1715
00:59:49,588 --> 00:59:54,190
here are some suggestions on when to

1716
00:59:51,909 --> 00:59:57,338
open and close your jars and how to dial

1717
00:59:54,190 --> 01:00:00,940
them in perfectly if your buds feel wet

1718
00:59:57,338 --> 01:00:03,219
or if they are above 70% humidity if the

1719
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:04,509
little display on that hydrometer inside

1720
01:00:03,219 --> 01:00:07,179
of your jar reads

1721
01:00:04,509 --> 01:00:10,599
above 70% humidity you need to dump

1722
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:14,558
those buds out of the jar and let them

1723
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:16,450
dry until they get to 65 to 70% humidity

1724
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,920
now when you dump them out and you leave

1725
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:19,419
them somewhere that's not by the fan

1726
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,338
that's not by the swamp cooler that's

1727
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,630
not by the air-conditioner that's not by

1728
01:00:21,338 --> 01:00:24,578
something that's going to drastically

1729
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:27,009
affect the rate of their drying

1730
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:28,900
don't forget about them set a timer and

1731
01:00:27,009 --> 01:00:30,880
go find them some of you are a little

1732
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,259
obsessive you're definitely not gonna

1733
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,059
forget some of you are gonna take a

1734
01:00:32,259 --> 01:00:36,190
couple of dabs and go play fortnight and

1735
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:38,229
your buds are gonna dry up to [ __ ] don't

1736
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:40,599
let that happen to you guys so if they

1737
01:00:38,228 --> 01:00:42,818
are too humid dump them out let them dry

1738
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:45,640
out a little bit get them down to 65 to

1739
01:00:42,818 --> 01:00:47,949
70% humidity now if your buds feel moist

1740
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:49,838
to the touch if they're sticky and wet

1741
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:53,259
to the outside of the buds and the

1742
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:55,268
display reads 65 to 70% humidity pop the

1743
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:57,099
lid off of that jar for fifteen to

1744
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:59,558
thirty minutes and let a little moisture

1745
01:00:57,099 --> 01:01:01,479
evaporate out if you think they need

1746
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:04,269
longer than fifteen to thirty minutes

1747
01:01:01,478 --> 01:01:05,708
let them go longer but like I said don't

1748
01:01:04,268 --> 01:01:07,298
start playing for tonight and start

1749
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:08,889
building [ __ ] and shooting people and

1750
01:01:07,298 --> 01:01:11,440
forget about them because you don't want

1751
01:01:08,889 --> 01:01:13,509
them to get too crunchy so fifteen to

1752
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,358
thirty maybe 45 minutes maybe an hour

1753
01:01:13,509 --> 01:01:17,769
seal them back up set yourself a timer

1754
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:19,449
to remember to check on them in a little

1755
01:01:17,768 --> 01:01:23,379
bit and now you can go play fort night

1756
01:01:19,449 --> 01:01:25,659
and relax now your goal is 60 to 65%

1757
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:29,260
humidity you want that hydrometer to

1758
01:01:25,659 --> 01:01:31,690
read between 60 and 65 percent humidity

1759
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:34,210
and you want them dry but not crunchy

1760
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:36,760
they're gonna feel squishy and sticky

1761
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:39,579
hopefully but they're not wet you just

1762
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,230
want them dry but not crunchy you might

1763
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:42,940
need to let your buds sit out for a

1764
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:45,039
little bit before you roll a joint if

1765
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:47,829
it's cured perfectly the display will

1766
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:49,719
say 60 to 65% you may need to take a

1767
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,920
couple of buds out of there and set them

1768
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:52,119
I just sent them right here on the front

1769
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,500
of my computer if I'm gonna roll when

1770
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:55,269
it's a little warmer right there to sort

1771
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,860
of chill they're not like in the path of

1772
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:57,880
the fan or anything just let them chill

1773
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,050
right here that's what I'm gonna roll

1774
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,640
the joint within a few minutes and just

1775
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,260
let them sit there you know just just

1776
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:03,549
for a little bit just maybe if I'm gonna

1777
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,900
go to lunch and come back and smoke a

1778
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:06,700
joint I'll set them out right before I

1779
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,780
go to lunch and then you go to lunch and

1780
01:02:06,699 --> 01:02:08,980
then you come back and then they grind

1781
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:11,800
up nice and fine and they're still

1782
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:14,260
sticky they're still juicy and then your

1783
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:16,630
joint burns super smoothly and if your

1784
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:18,370
joints not burning super smooth then you

1785
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:20,440
probably have too much moisture in there

1786
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:22,599
and you got to let it dry and cure just

1787
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,909
a little bit longer now if you hit that

1788
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:27,039
55 percent or lower mark you're entering

1789
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:28,839
what I call the Colorado crunch area and

1790
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,699
your buds are gonna burn too fast and

1791
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,350
you're also losing weight if you're

1792
01:02:30,699 --> 01:02:33,909
working with more than a quarter pound

1793
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:35,559
there and you're drying it up do you

1794
01:02:33,909 --> 01:02:36,940
risk losing you know a quarter of an

1795
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:39,489
ounce or whatever depends on how much

1796
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:42,280
you let it dry so if your buds get too

1797
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:44,289
dry don't add anything funky to

1798
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:47,170
rehydrate them the only thing I would

1799
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:49,480
use are fresh cannabis leaves and a

1800
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:50,889
little bit goes a long way so take them

1801
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,199
out when the moisture comes back and

1802
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:54,969
don't let those leaves mold up in there

1803
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:58,299
and [ __ ] up your crop check on them

1804
01:02:54,969 --> 01:03:00,519
frequently if you put wet leaves inside

1805
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:02,920
of either your curing jars or your packs

1806
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:05,139
or your [ __ ] turkey bags however you

1807
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,420
do it make sure you take them out and

1808
01:03:05,139 --> 01:03:10,389
don't leave them for too long check on

1809
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:12,820
them after an hour one hour is more than

1810
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:14,500
enough go check on it set yourself a

1811
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:16,150
timer don't get stuck doing an Instagram

1812
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:19,449
live video and forget to check on your

1813
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:20,740
buds all right so it's gonna take a

1814
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:23,109
little bit for your hydrometer to

1815
01:03:20,739 --> 01:03:25,209
measure the humidity in the jar but it's

1816
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:27,130
gonna get you a pretty good idea of when

1817
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:29,889
to open and close those jars and it's

1818
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:31,780
gonna give you some actual data to go by

1819
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:33,219
you'll be able to squeeze those buds and

1820
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:35,380
feel how wet they are and you'll be able

1821
01:03:33,219 --> 01:03:36,789
to compare that number or that moisture

1822
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:39,070
to the number on the hydrometer and

1823
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:40,420
you'll go oh that's what 65% feels like

1824
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:43,000
that's what's Jeffs trying to get me to

1825
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:45,039
so that gives you something to work with

1826
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,110
it's a little bit of a cheater but if

1827
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,730
you're using one hydrometer you're gonna

1828
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:50,800
have to seal it into the jar for a few

1829
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:52,389
minutes and wait for it to get to where

1830
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,190
it needs to be enough it's jumping real

1831
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:56,289
fast go ahead and pull it out leave that

1832
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:57,250
jar open that means it's really humid in

1833
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:59,349
there and that you're just gonna seal it

1834
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:01,329
up and cause problems all right so we've

1835
01:03:59,349 --> 01:04:03,279
got a little tiny hydrometer in our jars

1836
01:04:01,329 --> 01:04:06,429
we're watching the numbers we're trying

1837
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:09,010
to get ourselves to 60 to 65% humidity

1838
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:10,539
inside of those jars make sure you don't

1839
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:12,250
forget about your buds make sure you

1840
01:04:10,539 --> 01:04:13,690
don't get that funky aroma in there make

1841
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:15,670
sure it doesn't smell like ammonia and

1842
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:17,619
mildew make sure you don't ruin it you

1843
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:19,210
should be paying attention to the number

1844
01:04:17,619 --> 01:04:20,589
on the hygrometer and then pulling some

1845
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:23,650
buds out and seeing what they feel like

1846
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:25,390
so that you know what 50 what 60 what 70

1847
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:27,250
what 80% humidity if you get to 80 you

1848
01:04:25,389 --> 01:04:28,929
[ __ ] up but so that you know what the

1849
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,849
percentage of humidity feels like inside

1850
01:04:28,929 --> 01:04:32,230
these jars what the bud feels like this

1851
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:34,210
will give you a really good idea start

1852
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:36,159
paying attention to that stuff and you

1853
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:38,769
will get ahead of the drying and curing

1854
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:41,079
game now once you've gotten your buds

1855
01:04:38,769 --> 01:04:42,579
dried and cured to 55 to 65 percent

1856
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:44,799
humidity and you don't see any

1857
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:45,400
fluctuation inside that jar on the

1858
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,500
hydrometer

1859
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,150
you only need to crack them open to

1860
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,590
check on them or pull out some buds to

1861
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:52,240
smoke you don't need to keep popping

1862
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:53,680
those jars open they're gonna get too

1863
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:55,329
dry if you do that so you can trap the

1864
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,460
moisture in there leave it right at that

1865
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:59,409
point and your bud will be perfectly

1866
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:00,699
cured for whenever you need it now

1867
01:04:59,409 --> 01:05:02,829
I've said before that I don't like the

1868
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:04,960
Boveda packs but they work if you do

1869
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:06,940
[ __ ] up the Boveda packs I would buy are

1870
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,769
the sixty-two percent and you could just

1871
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:11,019
drop them right inside your jar it'll

1872
01:05:08,769 --> 01:05:14,079
help reconstitute that package or that

1873
01:05:11,019 --> 01:05:15,579
jar and then sometimes I feel like they

1874
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:16,809
leave kind of a watery flavor on the

1875
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:19,539
buds but I guess I'd rather have a

1876
01:05:16,809 --> 01:05:21,639
properly cured but it has that aroma

1877
01:05:19,539 --> 01:05:23,409
than some Colorado crunch it's just

1878
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:26,049
gonna burn up when I light my joint at

1879
01:05:23,409 --> 01:05:28,239
the show so ladies and gentlemen that is

1880
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,530
my dry and cure episode I want to thank

1906
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,880
to contribute there are people that feel

1907
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:29,470
like they can help out I would

1908

appreciate that help what I do with that

1909
01:06:29,469 --> 01:06:34,539
funding is I pay for my website I

1910
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:36,190
actually bought a MacBook so I need to

1911
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:37,750
pay for the MacBook I actually buy these

1912
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:39,099
little microphone covers so that when

1913
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,510
granny and giddy are on they don't have

1914
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:42,789
to spit into these same microphone

1915
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:44,020
covers over and over again so there are

1916
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:45,849
things like that that do need to be

1917
01:06:44,019 --> 01:06:47,590
covered and I do appreciate the support

1918
01:06:45,849 --> 01:06:49,329
you guys are not begging if you don't

1919
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:50,769
know that it's an option you don't know

1920
01:06:49,329 --> 01:06:52,929
how you can help out so I do appreciate

1921
01:06:50,769 --> 01:06:55,059
everybody that has helped out with the

1922
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:57,909
patreon campaign it blows my mind every

1923
01:06:55,059 --> 01:06:59,440

01:11:57,010 --> 01:12:00,639
letting you know what I'm smoking on

2053
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:03,250
today I'm taking dad's of this New York

2054
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:05,889
City diesel ambrosia batter from

2055
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:07,328
apothecary farms I'm giving it a nice

2056
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:09,789
smell right now this stuff smells like

2057
01:12:07,328 --> 01:12:12,069
like diesel fuel with a little bit of

2058
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:13,479
lemons maybe a hint of oranges and then

2059
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:15,429
there's kind of a sweet tart sort of

2060
01:12:13,479 --> 01:12:17,589
smell on top of it that I really enjoy a

2061
01:12:15,429 --> 01:12:19,359
one thing about the New York City diesel

2062
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:21,880
and broza batter here that I'm smoking

2063
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:23,799
on my eyes really don't get red when I

2064
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,719
smoke I can smoke and I don't get red

2065
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,940
eyed but when I take one dab of this New

2066
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:29,679
York City diesel my eyes go fully

2067
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:31,960
bloodshot red I'm not sure what does it

2068
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,789
but I get super red I get super head

2069
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,710
height from it and I really enjoy it and

2070
01:12:33,789 --> 01:12:38,559
if that weren't enough I've been adding

2071
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:40,599
this sour amnesia high cannabinoid

2072
01:12:38,559 --> 01:12:42,670
full-spectrum extract into the mix and

2073
01:12:40,599 --> 01:12:44,710
it just adds a really nice it's like

2074
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:46,449
turbo charging my dad it is really nice

2075
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:48,550
I like the lung expansion and the flavor

2076
01:12:46,448 --> 01:12:50,529
from the New York City diesel then you

2077
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:52,360
put the high cannabinoid full-spectrum

2078
01:12:50,529 --> 01:12:55,000
extract on top and it really makes it

2079
01:12:52,359 --> 01:12:56,618
like a turbocharged dad so I am in the

2080

01:13:02,349 --> 01:13:05,739
trimming your cannabis plants that's

2085
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,150
right we've learned how to tell when the

2086
01:13:05,738 --> 01:13:08,919
plants are ripe we've learned how to cut

2087
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:10,118
them down we've learned how to harvest

2088
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,250
them we learned how to hang them until

2089
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:12,839
they're ready to snap

2090
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:15,800
we know pretty well how to dry and cure

2091
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:17,760
now let's talk about trimming our plants

2092
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,739
now there are two different ways you can

2093
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:23,190
trim there's wet trim and there is dry

2094
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:24,929
trim I definitely prefer dry trim I'm

2095
01:13:23,189 --> 01:13:27,719
gonna say why is dry trim better

2096
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:30,180
I think dry trim is better because it's

2097
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:33,720
less sticky and it's much easier to work

2098
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:35,789
with it's also less work the leaves are

2099
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,869
dry those leaves are gonna fall off all

2100
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:38,369
you have to do is just brush them with

2101
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:39,840
your thumb maybe touch them with the

2102
01:13:38,369 --> 01:13:41,970
scissors and those brittle leaves will

2103
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,380
come right off of there the buds have

2104
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:44,880
dried and tightened up and then it's a

2105
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:46,470
little more obvious for a new trimmer

2106
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,510
what to take off you just want to take

2107
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:50,340
off that fluffy outside [ __ ]

2108
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:52,890
so it's a little less work it's less

2109
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:55,409
sticky and there's also less chance to

2110
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:56,760
ruin your buds by improperly storing

2111
01:13:55,409 --> 01:13:58,529
them a lot of people once the buds are

2112
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,970
trimmed if they wet trim they like to

2113
01:13:58,529 --> 01:14:02,039
just shove them into a container or a

2114
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:03,510
package and then those wet buds go into

2115
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:05,670
the container and that's when they get

2116
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:07,710
ruined so we're not even gonna let that

2117
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:09,090
happen we're gonna let the buds dry then

2118
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:11,100
we're gonna trim them then we'll put

2119
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:12,449
them in a container now a lot of people

2120
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,420
have listened to the dry and curing

2121
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:17,069
episode you may be trimming these buds

2122
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:18,510
before they go into the jar for cure you

2123
01:14:17,069 --> 01:14:19,769
may be trimming these buds after they've

2124
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:21,360
been in the cure jar for a little while

2125
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:23,580
it's all the same process the leaves

2126
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:25,170
should be similar in dryness they should

2127
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:26,809
just be popping right off of there you

2128
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:29,130
might not even need scissors for this

2129
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:30,750
sometimes when I'm dry trimming the only

2130
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:32,039
thing I use my scissors for is for

2131
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:34,020
cutting the plant into smaller pieces

2132
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:36,840
and cutting the sticks out and cutting

2133
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,550
the bigger buds down to smaller buds now

2134
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,500
let's talk about a few preparations we

2135
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:42,810
can make in a few items we can have to

2136
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,220
create a comfortable and successful trim

2137
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:46,110
environment for ourselves

2138
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:48,449
trimming sucks it's going to take a long

2139
01:14:46,109 --> 01:14:50,909
time you're sitting in a chair with your

2140
01:14:48,449 --> 01:14:52,559
elbows up high staring straight into

2141
01:14:50,909 --> 01:14:55,050
something for a long time your neck your

2142
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,900
elbows your eyes your back that stuff

2143
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:59,550
all gets sore and tired so let's try to

2144
01:14:57,899 --> 01:15:01,920
make it as comfortable as possible I

2145
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:03,539
like to have a nice clean space I've got

2146
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,920
this table where I like to do my work I

2147
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:06,750
clean the whole table off there's

2148
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,789
nothing on the table except my dr.

2149
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:10,619
pepper and some trim supplies maybe my

2150
01:15:08,789 --> 01:15:11,939
phone for some entertainment but it's

2151
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:13,470
just there for music I'm not gonna be

2152
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:14,460
touching it don't have your phone out if

2153
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:15,840
you're trimming here guys it's so

2154
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:17,550
[ __ ] distracting and it'll slow you

2155
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,750
down it'll take twice as long put on a

2156
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:20,640
podcast hit play

2157
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,779
start [ __ ] trimming anyway I like to

2158
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,970
have the table nice and clean I don't

2159
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:24,719
need [ __ ] in my way I need maybe my

2160
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:26,369
scissors

2161
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,869
my buds into smaller pieces and then

2162
01:15:26,369 --> 01:15:30,090
just a few basic essentials and we'll

2163
01:15:27,869 --> 01:15:31,649
talk about those a nice clean space I

2164
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:33,239
also like a nice comfortable chair

2165
01:15:31,649 --> 01:15:36,149
you're gonna be sitting there for a

2166
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:38,189
while get a cozy chair so a nice clean

2167
01:15:36,149 --> 01:15:39,689
workspace in a cozy chair are super

2168
01:15:38,189 --> 01:15:41,309
important for me for trimming but then

2169
01:15:39,689 --> 01:15:42,899
you need some sort of entertainment

2170
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,500
hopefully you've got somebody there to

2171
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:45,059
talk to

2172
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,649
usually I got Mike or somebody around to

2173
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:49,530
[ __ ] with some sort of conversation

2174
01:15:46,649 --> 01:15:51,449
makes trimming go much more smoothly but

2175
01:15:49,529 --> 01:15:52,920
if you don't have that option put on a

2176
01:15:51,449 --> 01:15:54,599
podcast you guys I like to put on a

2177
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,800
podcast of course I recommend old

2178
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,380
episodes of the growth from your heart

2179
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,640
podcast put on some Joe Rogan something

2180
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:01,529
like that maybe a YouTube video

2181
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:03,960
something to entertain yourself to

2182
01:16:01,529 --> 01:16:05,429
listen to but nothing to look at back in

2183
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,050
the day we used to trim all around the

2184
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:08,970
TV and we would watch youtube videos and

2185
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:11,369
trim I found that that is super

2186
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:12,810
distracting don't watch videos people

2187
01:16:11,369 --> 01:16:14,130
will put their [ __ ] scissors down and

2188
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:15,780
you'll catch them just watching TV if

2189
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:18,210
you're paying people to trim don't have

2190
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:20,099
a TV in the room podcasts maybe some

2191
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:21,300
stand-up comedy it's hard to get

2192
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,890
everybody on the same page when it comes

2193
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,690
to music but maybe play some good music

2194
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:26,010
just some sort of stuff to make it

2195
01:16:24,689 --> 01:16:28,079
comfortable and help the time pass

2196
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:29,400
without your brain going crazy is what

2197
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:30,720
I'm getting at you guys so you got a

2198
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:32,339
clean space you got a chair to sit in

2199
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:34,289
you got a good YouTube video on you got

2200
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:35,880
a podcast going to know your cozy your

2201
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:38,489
mind is entertained now you need some

2202
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,810
gloves put some rubber gloves on you

2203
01:16:38,489 --> 01:16:42,599
want to wear gloves and you're trimming

2204
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:43,950
you're going to get extremely sticky you

2205
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,300
don't want to have to itch your face

2206
01:16:43,949 --> 01:16:47,340
and have to go wash your hands just to

2207
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,869
scratch your face you're gonna be your

2208
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:51,900
hands are gonna be covered in trichomes

2209
01:16:48,869 --> 01:16:53,309
and resin you guys wear gloves also you

2210
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:55,679
need some good scissors I like the

2211
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:57,660
little tiny Fiskars diamond tip scissors

2212
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,920
that you get you can they're expensive

2213
01:16:57,659 --> 01:17:00,420
at the gross store they're cheaper at

2214
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,159
Hobby Lobby they saw them in the craft

2215
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:03,899
section right the craft section of Hobby

2216
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,369
Lobby that's all of Hobby Lobby there's

2217
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:07,889
some in the fabric section over the buy

2218
01:17:05,369 --> 01:17:10,229
the fabric there are Fiskars diamond tip

2219
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:11,880
titanium scissors I really like those

2220
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:13,229
they work really well for trimming

2221
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,760
they're super light get something with

2222
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:15,899
the spring in it that opens on its own

2223
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,760
because you don't want to have to be

2224
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:18,779
opening and closing scissors you don't

2225
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,920
want the kind of scissors that have

2226
01:17:18,779 --> 01:17:20,909
loops that go around your fingers

2227
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,350
because you're gonna be cutting for so

2228
01:17:20,909 --> 01:17:24,269
long those little loops around your

2229
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:26,940
fingers are gonna dig into you you just

2230
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:28,530
want lightweight super fast trimming

2231
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:30,659
shears they're easy to find and they're

2232
01:17:28,529 --> 01:17:32,429
affordable maybe get yourselves two pair

2233
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:34,260
so that you can set one in the rubbing

2234
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:35,909
alcohol to clean off you can dirty up

2235
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:37,909
another pair swap them out real quick

2236
01:17:35,909 --> 01:17:39,920
not have to spend a lot of time cleaning

2237
01:17:37,909 --> 01:17:42,079
so you need some good gloves some good

2238
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,239
scissors then you need some containers

2239
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,460
you need a container for untrimmed buds

2240
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:48,380
I recommend a five-gallon bucket for the

2241
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:50,149
untrimmed buds maybe you don't have that

2242
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:52,340
much herb maybe some smaller will work

2243
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:54,019
then you need another container for

2244
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:57,050
trimmed buds then you need another

2245
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:59,300
container for savable trim and then we

2246
01:17:57,050 --> 01:18:01,940
need another container for waste so you

2247
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:04,550
need trimmed buds untrimmed buds usable

2248
01:18:01,939 --> 01:18:05,839
trim and waste a couple other things I'm

2249
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:07,279
gonna recommend you're gonna say why the

2250
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,350
hell would he recommend this for a grow

2251
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:11,329
i would recommend either some coconut

2252
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:13,070
oil or some baby oil for your trim

2253
01:18:11,329 --> 01:18:15,769
session you're gonna say why do we need

2254
01:18:13,069 --> 01:18:18,049
that here is why when your fingers and

2255
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:20,030
hands and arms get all sticky you can

2256
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:21,560
use the coconut oil or the baby oil to

2257
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:23,389
remove the trichomes that's right if

2258
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,800
your hands are all covered in resin my

2259
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:25,940
thing is that my arms get covered in

2260
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,079
resin because I'm the one cutting down

2261
01:18:25,939 --> 01:18:28,009
the plants I'm reaching in there and

2262
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:29,930
playing with them and carrying them

2263
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:32,030
around my arm hair and [ __ ] gets all

2264
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:34,340
coated in trichomes and and plant resin

2265
01:18:32,029 --> 01:18:36,500
so I use a coconut oil or baby oil to

2266
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:37,970
just rub up on my arms and rub that [ __ ]

2267
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:39,430
right off and all the resin comes right

2268
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:41,630
off and then you're not all sticky

2269
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:43,460
alright so that's the basic breakdown of

2270
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:45,260
things that you're going to need for

2271
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,730
your trim session you need a nice clean

2272
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:49,100
space in which to work you need a nice

2273
01:18:46,729 --> 01:18:50,929
cozy chair in which to sit need a good

2274
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,370
podcast to listen to probably the girl

2275
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:54,200
from Earhart podcast then you need some

2276
01:18:52,369 --> 01:18:55,640
gloves you need scissors then you need

2277
01:18:54,199 --> 01:18:57,139
your containers then you've got your

2278
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,720
cleanup supplies now let's talk about

2279
01:18:57,140 --> 01:19:01,670
doing the manual work hopefully a few

2280
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:03,800
days before harvest you went in and did

2281
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:05,239
a pre harvest defoliation now what I

2282
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,010
mean by that is while the plants are

2283
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:09,559
still alive while you're flushing

2284
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:11,150
anywhere between I don't know seven days

2285
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,560
before harvest up to the day of harvest

2286
01:19:11,149 --> 01:19:15,170
you can go in there and just start

2287
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:16,460
pulling off all of the big leaves the

2288
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:17,810
plants are done growing they're just

2289
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,250
flushing out they're just finishing up

2290
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:21,080
the trichomes are ripening up you don't

2291
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:22,489
need all that excess leaf in there so

2292
01:19:21,079 --> 01:19:25,309
just go ahead and tear all that leaf out

2293
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:27,079
of the room having a pre harvest

2294
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:28,580
defoliation session will save you a lot

2295
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:31,699
of time when it comes time to trim

2296
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:33,500
because all of that long straggly leaf

2297
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:35,300
is already gone it's not even there to

2298
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:37,010
deal with it's already been removed and

2299
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:39,470
it will also help your drying and curing

2300
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:41,390
time so go in and pull off all the big

2301
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:43,130
leaves before you harvest then it's

2302
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:45,140
harvest time I've done a highly detailed

2303
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:46,970
harvest episode if you haven't listened

2304
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:49,220
to that go listen to that then come

2305
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:51,019
catch up at the end of the harvest

2306
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:52,730
episode we're left with our plants

2307
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:54,949
upside down in a controlled environment

2308
01:19:52,729 --> 01:19:57,138
now we want those plants to get to where

2309
01:19:54,948 --> 01:19:59,748
the sticks snap once the sticks get

2310
01:19:57,139 --> 01:20:01,219
snappy you can start trimming you can

2311
01:19:59,748 --> 01:20:03,019
also start trimming them after they've

2312
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:05,118
been in their cure containers for a

2313
01:20:03,019 --> 01:20:06,980
little while I like dry trim I'm just

2314
01:20:05,118 --> 01:20:08,748
waiting for the buds to be dry enough

2315
01:20:06,979 --> 01:20:09,828
toward the leaves kind of just flake

2316
01:20:08,748 --> 01:20:11,359
right off there's still gonna be

2317
01:20:09,828 --> 01:20:12,710
moisture inside those buds there's

2318
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,149
moisture in the middle but the outside

2319
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:15,948
is dry enough to where you can just kind

2320
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:17,868
of knock the the buds off the leaves off

2321
01:20:15,948 --> 01:20:19,339
the buds with your thumb I'm making a

2322
01:20:17,868 --> 01:20:20,748
little motion with my hands that sort of

2323
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:22,279
looks like I'm playing a video game like

2324
01:20:20,748 --> 01:20:23,479
I've got a game controller in my hand

2325
01:20:22,279 --> 01:20:25,788
but my hands are really close together

2326
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:27,948
in my mind I'm just holding that little

2327
01:20:25,788 --> 01:20:30,559
bud with my four fingers or maybe with

2328
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:32,779
my left hand and I'm just knocking the

2329
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:34,369
leaves off with my right hand just like

2330
01:20:32,779 --> 01:20:35,719
I'm just it looks like i'm playing a

2331
01:20:34,368 --> 01:20:37,549
video game i'm just holding the bud and

2332
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:39,139
just rubbing the leaves right off if you

2333
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:40,699
hold it with the bud facing up if you

2334
01:20:39,139 --> 01:20:42,109
rub down those leaves will just rub

2335
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:43,518
right off you'll see what i'm talking

2336
01:20:42,109 --> 01:20:45,738
about when you figure out the technique

2337
01:20:43,519 --> 01:20:46,998
you go oh man that is so easy so my

2338
01:20:45,738 --> 01:20:48,859
point is that I want it to where the

2339
01:20:46,998 --> 01:20:50,269
buds are dry I want to be able to just

2340
01:20:48,859 --> 01:20:53,598
knock those leaves right off so here's

2341
01:20:50,269 --> 01:20:54,889
how I actually do my trimming whenever

2342
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:57,139
I'm working with the plants I like to

2343
01:20:54,889 --> 01:20:59,150
wear gloves so step one of trimming is

2344
01:20:57,139 --> 01:21:00,859
put on some rubber gloves I like the six

2345
01:20:59,149 --> 01:21:02,058
millimeter nitrile gloves I don't care

2346
01:21:00,859 --> 01:21:04,219
if they're black I don't care if they're

2347
01:21:02,059 --> 01:21:06,110
blue I just care that they fit that

2348
01:21:04,219 --> 01:21:07,760
they're comfortable so glove up I don't

2349
01:21:06,109 --> 01:21:10,308
want to get all sticky and also I don't

2350
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:12,349
want to get my skin all over the bud so

2351
01:21:10,309 --> 01:21:15,050
step one is glove up step two of

2352
01:21:12,349 --> 01:21:17,029
trimming is to knock all of the buds off

2353
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:19,400
of the sticks into a five-gallon bucket

2354
01:21:17,029 --> 01:21:21,590
this makes it so much easier just go and

2355
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:23,629
get everybody off the sticks into a

2356
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:25,730
bucket and then discard all the sticks

2357
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:27,920
now you've compressed your work into a

2358
01:21:25,729 --> 01:21:29,748
much smaller space it looks way less

2359
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,340
overwhelming and you can see what you've

2360
01:21:29,748 --> 01:21:33,050
got ahead of you you've got a five

2361
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:34,670
gallon bucket filled with buds that you

2362
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:36,980
need to trim it doesn't look like this

2363
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:38,989
big sprawl of branches and leaves and

2364
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:40,428
[ __ ] everywhere just a bucket it's way

2365
01:21:38,988 --> 01:21:42,709
less intimidating and you can get

2366
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:45,199
through it so knock all the buds into a

2367
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:46,730
bucket maybe you can use just a small

2368
01:21:45,198 --> 01:21:48,649
bowl maybe you can use something smaller

2369
01:21:46,729 --> 01:21:50,538
I'm not sure how much you grew maybe you

2370
01:21:48,649 --> 01:21:52,308
need five buckets I hope you need ten or

2371
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:53,630
twenty five gallon buckets but find the

2372
01:21:52,309 --> 01:21:55,940
container that's the right size for what

2373
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:57,889
you need a five gallon bucket from Home

2374
01:21:55,939 --> 01:22:00,198
Depot or Lowe's is really affordable and

2375
01:21:57,889 --> 01:22:02,510
they're disposable so I like to use the

2376
01:22:00,198 --> 01:22:04,819
buckets so I knock every bud into a

2377
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:06,980
bucket now I've got a five gallon

2378
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:08,929
bucket full of buds my next step is just

2379
01:22:06,979 --> 01:22:11,328
to reach in grab the butt off the top

2380
01:22:08,929 --> 01:22:12,920
and start trimming now I'll actually

2381
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:14,779
start talking about trimming a little

2382
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:18,109
bit and the actual trimming of the bud

2383
01:22:14,779 --> 01:22:19,789
process the idea is to knock or cut off

2384
01:22:18,109 --> 01:22:22,219
all of the excessive leaves and stems

2385
01:22:19,789 --> 01:22:24,948
and give yourself a nice pretty

2386
01:22:22,219 --> 01:22:26,569
presentable but you guys know what a

2387
01:22:24,948 --> 01:22:28,519
good trimmed bud looks like when they

2388
01:22:26,569 --> 01:22:30,979
start off they're covered in leaves it's

2389
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:32,210
our job to knock those leaves off we

2390
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:34,218
don't want to smoke leaves leaves

2391
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:36,590
contain chlorophyll leaves don't taste

2392
01:22:34,219 --> 01:22:40,399
good leaves don't get you high what we

2393
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:42,020
want is a nice frosty green nugget so

2394
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:43,819
once you guys get started trim and

2395
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:45,619
you'll see what's leaf material and what

2396
01:22:43,819 --> 01:22:46,819
is a usable but once you start digging

2397
01:22:45,618 --> 01:22:48,259
in there and just start knocking off

2398
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:49,609
some of the leaf you'll find that bud in

2399
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:52,190
the middle and it will start to become

2400
01:22:49,609 --> 01:22:54,139
very obvious what you do and do not trim

2401
01:22:52,189 --> 01:22:56,988
if your buds are kind of airy and fluffy

2402
01:22:54,139 --> 01:22:58,969
don't trim too deeply just knock off the

2403
01:22:56,988 --> 01:23:00,468
leaves I like to grab the bud by the

2404
01:22:58,969 --> 01:23:02,840
base by that little stick at the bottom

2405
01:23:00,469 --> 01:23:04,849
of the bud and just use my thumb to push

2406
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:06,860
the leaves off I just kind of spin the

2407
01:23:04,849 --> 01:23:07,819
bud in a circle with my left hand I will

2408
01:23:06,859 --> 01:23:09,408
turn it I'm looking that's

2409
01:23:07,819 --> 01:23:11,539
counterclockwise no that is clockwise

2410
01:23:09,408 --> 01:23:13,609
I'll turn the bud clockwise and as it

2411
01:23:11,539 --> 01:23:15,198
comes toward me I'll use my right thumb

2412
01:23:13,609 --> 01:23:16,969
I'm using my left hand to spin the bud

2413
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:18,589
toward me and is that one side come

2414
01:23:16,969 --> 01:23:20,480
towards me comes toward me my thumb just

2415
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:22,369
knocks the leaves off right there I'm

2416
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:24,109
just wiping them off like I'm just just

2417
01:23:22,368 --> 01:23:25,639
scraping the leaves off they're so dry

2418
01:23:24,109 --> 01:23:27,439
that they knock off on their own and

2419
01:23:25,639 --> 01:23:28,969
don't press so hard that you're [ __ ]

2420
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:30,710
up the shape of the bud and knocking off

2421
01:23:28,969 --> 01:23:32,658
trichomes you can do this really gently

2422
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:34,250
you'll find the technique after you do

2423
01:23:32,658 --> 01:23:35,750
it a few times it'll be really

2424
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:37,399
comfortable and you'll get really fast

2425
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:38,599
at it a lot of people like to do this

2426
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:40,219
with scissors they'll hold it in the

2427
01:23:38,599 --> 01:23:42,230
left hand and it'll take their scissors

2428
01:23:40,219 --> 01:23:44,359
and just turn it and trim it the leaves

2429
01:23:42,229 --> 01:23:46,218
are sticking off horizontally just keep

2430
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:47,839
your scissors horizontal you can get

2431
01:23:46,219 --> 01:23:49,250
adjust your angle as you need and just

2432
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,510
spin that button and keep cutting just

2433
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:51,889
like you're giving it a haircut you just

2434
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:53,900
want to take off those leaves and leave

2435
01:23:51,889 --> 01:23:56,449
that bud there so just knock off the

2436
01:23:53,899 --> 01:23:58,219
leaves don't carve too deeply into the

2437
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:59,299
buds and don't squish the buds while

2438
01:23:58,219 --> 01:24:00,980
you're trimming them don't squeeze them

2439
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:03,380
super hard and try not to handle them

2440
01:24:00,979 --> 01:24:05,059
too much a little tiny bud doesn't need

2441
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:06,590
a lot of handling you don't want to get

2442
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:08,929
all those trichomes on your gloves you

2443
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:10,520
want to leave the trichomes on the bud

2444
01:24:08,929 --> 01:24:11,899
so you can use scissors if you want I

2445
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,790
like my thumbs for most trimming you

2446
01:24:11,899 --> 01:24:15,198
guys the little edge of my thumb and my

2447
01:24:13,789 --> 01:24:17,059
thumbnail is a perfect little trimmer

2448
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:18,679
for me I've mastered that technique I

2449
01:24:17,059 --> 01:24:20,630
knock off the little leave

2450
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:22,550
and cut the big buds into smaller sizes

2451
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:24,199
if you guys can see a stick in there and

2452
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:26,000
it's like one bud and then a little

2453
01:24:24,199 --> 01:24:28,519
stick in another bud take that [ __ ] out

2454
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,979
nobody wants to buy a stick connoisseur

2455
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:32,990
quality bud is taken down to the small

2456
01:24:30,979 --> 01:24:35,389
part if you want to leave your buds in

2457
01:24:32,989 --> 01:24:38,059
big buds that's fine it's up to you I

2458
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:39,470
like them smaller a lot of people don't

2459
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:40,760
want to buy a big stick you'll see

2460
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:42,289
people I don't know you'll have some

2461
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,789
customers that want big buds I used to

2462
01:24:42,289 --> 01:24:45,409
have people that just wanted big buds

2463
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:46,460
and then some people know better they're

2464
01:24:45,409 --> 01:24:48,920
like man I don't want to buy that

2465
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:50,119
quarter that one one bud that weighs a

2466
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,710
quarter because I know right up the

2467
01:24:50,119 --> 01:24:53,000
middle of it as a gram of stick and I'm

2468
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:53,960
getting ripped off so some people want

2469
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,199
it some people don't

2470
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:58,670
that's up to you so once you've got it

2471
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:02,119
trimmed up to the size you want it and

2472
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:03,920
the the amount of trim you want I cut

2473
01:25:02,119 --> 01:25:05,630
off all the little leaves at the bottom

2474
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,920
also there's like a lot of people leave

2475
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:08,270
little cabbagey looking leaves at the

2476
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:10,220
bottom I cut that [ __ ] off

2477
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:12,140
I call it cabbage and I also take out

2478
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:13,400
the handlebar sticks on the bottom

2479
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,619
you're gonna have the branch that the

2480
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:16,879
bud was actually stuck to the branch to

2481
01:25:15,619 --> 01:25:18,260
and then there's two little sticks that

2482
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,520
come out that those first leaves were

2483
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:21,020
attached to and they're all dry and

2484
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,270
shitty look and cut those off of there

2485
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:24,710
if you've got a pound of weed and you've

2486
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:26,780
got all those little tiny sticks in

2487
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:28,189
there those little sticks make your

2488
01:25:26,779 --> 01:25:29,449
pound look like [ __ ] just take it out

2489
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:30,679
and your pound is gonna look so much

2490
01:25:29,449 --> 01:25:32,630
better it's gonna be so much more

2491
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:34,280
desirable it's gonna get you more money

2492
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:36,529
all right so that's the bottom line here

2493
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:38,389
trim it and it's worth more money so

2494
01:25:36,529 --> 01:25:40,159
take off all the leaves take off that

2495
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:41,570
little stick at the bottom knock off all

2496
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:43,460
the crow's feet if you've got a little

2497
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:45,199
tiny pointy leaf sticking out of

2498
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:45,890
somewhere cut that out or knock it off

2499
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,569
with your thumb

2500
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:49,670
those little triangle leaves make you

2501
01:25:47,569 --> 01:25:51,079
look lazy if you did a whole good job on

2502
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:53,000
most of the button you just left one or

2503
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:55,729
two little triangles at the tip you look

2504
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,560
lazy take that stuff out of there so

2505
01:25:55,729 --> 01:25:59,569
while I'm doing this all the trimming

2506
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:01,970
work I trim over a tray or a container

2507
01:25:59,569 --> 01:26:04,009
to catch what I trim off all that little

2508
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:06,079
stuff that gets clipped off is going to

2509
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,449
be used to make concentrates or edibles

2510
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:10,729
in the future so gather all that stuff

2511
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:12,109
up take care of it don't just don't trim

2512
01:26:10,729 --> 01:26:13,759
into the floor and then sweep it up

2513
01:26:12,109 --> 01:26:15,289
don't trim onto the table and then scoop

2514
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,270
it up trim onto a tray trim into a

2515
01:26:15,289 --> 01:26:18,800
container so that it is kept clean so

2516
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:20,660
it's treated with respect because it may

2517
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,520
go into edibles and things that you're

2518
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:24,500
gonna eat need to be treated with

2519
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,060
respect things you're gonna smoke need

2520
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:28,130
to be treated with respect this is our

2521
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:30,350
medicine so gather this stuff up and

2522
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:32,060
vacuum seal it I like to keep the trim

2523
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:33,950
in a vacuum sealed bag

2524
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:35,930
in the dark until I'm able to use it get

2525
01:26:33,949 --> 01:26:36,500
that to your extractor as soon as you

2526
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:39,079
can

2527
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:40,970
now the sticks those are thrown away I

2528
01:26:39,079 --> 01:26:42,800
throw all the sticks away in a

2529
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:44,360
commercial grow they're thrown away in a

2530
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,800
home grow those should go to the compost

2531
01:26:44,359 --> 01:26:47,899
pile or they could be burned or

2532
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,940
something but the sticks are trash

2533
01:26:47,899 --> 01:26:51,649
don't try to extract sticks you guys

2534
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:53,210
that's a waste of time it's a waste of

2535
01:26:51,649 --> 01:26:55,250
energy they're not gonna get anything

2536
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:57,439
out of it and also if you're adding the

2537
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:59,390
sticks to the trim you're just making

2538
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:02,629
the hash worse you're not making it

2539
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:04,430
better what goes in comes out and if you

2540
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:06,970
just put [ __ ] in to make more you're

2541
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:10,220
gonna get more but it's gonna be [ __ ] so

2542
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:12,710
gather up all your trim vacuum seal the

2543
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:14,630
trim keep the trim in a dark place and

2544
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:17,149
get that to somebody that can turn that

2545
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:20,210
into concentrates for you also if you've

2546
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:21,920
got like yellow or brown or funky leaves

2547
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:23,810
that are falling off as you're trimming

2548
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,760
separate those pull those out of the

2549
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:27,380
trim don't send that to the extractor

2550
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,789
that's gonna make your hash and dark

2551
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,739
it's gonna make your hash taste like

2552
01:27:28,789 --> 01:27:32,899
[ __ ] it's gonna make it less potent and

2553
01:27:30,739 --> 01:27:34,909
it's gonna make it less desirable so do

2554
01:27:32,899 --> 01:27:36,519
a little work clean it up get it out of

2555
01:27:34,909 --> 01:27:38,899
there and you will have a better product

2556
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:40,820
so use your thumbs or some scissors to

2557
01:27:38,899 --> 01:27:42,109
gently remove the excess leaves and the

2558
01:27:40,819 --> 01:27:43,399
little stems from the buds get rid of

2559
01:27:42,109 --> 01:27:43,939
the handlebars get rid of the crow's

2560
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:45,710
feet

2561
01:27:43,939 --> 01:27:47,899
now once the buds are trimmed to your

2562
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:50,270
satisfaction you can place them into a

2563
01:27:47,899 --> 01:27:52,489
container for finished products now when

2564
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:53,780
I say to your satisfaction how you want

2565
01:27:52,489 --> 01:27:55,699
to trim your buds is up to you if you

2566
01:27:53,779 --> 01:27:56,960
want to leave it a little fluffy go for

2567
01:27:55,699 --> 01:28:00,439
it if you want to trim it nice and tight

2568
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:02,359
go for it that is up to you if your

2569
01:28:00,439 --> 01:28:04,099
product is for you personally then you

2570
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:05,389
can leave it as leafy as you want you

2571
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:06,980
can knock those leaves off right before

2572
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:08,750
you smoke it you can clean it up

2573
01:28:06,979 --> 01:28:10,579
yourself if you plan on getting top

2574
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:13,880
dollar for your product you'll need to

2575
01:28:10,579 --> 01:28:15,170
have a tight clean trim job one thing I

2576
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,270
should mention that will help us speed

2577
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:19,159
up the process of trimming is the rule

2578
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:20,630
of thumb if the bud you were trimming is

2579
01:28:19,159 --> 01:28:23,059
not bigger than the tip of your thumb

2580
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:25,039
it's probably better to let that bud go

2581
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:26,810
to your hash pile and trim something

2582
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:28,970
more substantial put those little

2583
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:30,590
popcorn buds in the hash pile put it in

2584
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:32,390
your trim pile and you can make better

2585
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:34,069
hash that will improve the quality of

2586
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,900
your concentrates so if it's a little

2587
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:38,090
tiny bud don't waste time trimming it

2588
01:28:35,899 --> 01:28:39,439
just throw it in the hash pile and don't

2589
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:41,000
waste your time trimming little tiny

2590
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:43,879
buds if you feel like that little tiny

2591
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,350
bud is worth less money than the time it

2592
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:47,180
is taking you to trim it

2593
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:49,250
set it aside and put it in the hash pile

2594
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:53,210
you don't have to trim that if herb

2595
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:54,529
costs ten dollars a gram and it takes

2596
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:56,930
you like a minute to trim that little

2597
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:58,729
nug it's not cost-effective so toss that

2598
01:28:56,930 --> 01:29:00,260
little nugge to the trim bin we'll add

2599
01:28:58,729 --> 01:29:01,639
that to the concentrates grab something

2600
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:04,520
that we can trim and get on the Shelf

2601
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:07,130
and make it purchasable for the consumer

2602
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:08,480
so if it's real tiny if it's ugly

2603
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:10,699
don't bother trimming it you can put

2604
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:13,189
that in your hash pile you can add that

2605
01:29:10,699 --> 01:29:15,109
to the to be extracted pile and that

2606
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:17,059
will just improve your concentrates it

2607
01:29:15,109 --> 01:29:19,969
will also speed you up of course if you

2608
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:21,530
need every little half gram every piece

2609
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:23,390
of gravel out of that crop to make your

2610
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:25,069
goal to make your wait go ahead and trim

2611
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:27,410
that up add that that'll be weight in

2612
01:29:25,069 --> 01:29:28,909
the bottom of the bag but if it's not

2613
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:30,380
necessary if it's just for you

2614
01:29:28,909 --> 01:29:32,720
put that in the concentrate pile and

2615
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:35,300
speed yourself up in the commercial grow

2616
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:37,970
the growers are expected to kick out a

2617
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:40,010
pound minimum per person per shift some

2618
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:41,630
people turn in two pounds every day and

2619
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:43,190
if they spend time trimming that little

2620
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:45,380
gravel [ __ ] they would never get there

2621
01:29:43,189 --> 01:29:46,699
we have a way of separating all those

2622
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,560
little tiny buds all that little stuff

2623
01:29:46,699 --> 01:29:50,929
gets filtered out it gets pushed to the

2624
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,880
side and then all of that those little

2625
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:55,250
buds and the trim they're combined and

2626
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,779
it gets turned in to concentrates so do

2627
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:59,180
a nice tight trim if you want to sell it

2628
01:29:56,779 --> 01:30:00,979
but don't go overboard don't trim it too

2629
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:02,390
tight and also don't try to ram it all

2630
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:03,889
those little buds or you're gonna put

2631
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:06,200
yourself in debt you've got to pay your

2632
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:07,579
trimmers you're spending your time make

2633
01:30:06,199 --> 01:30:09,260
it cost-effective

2634
01:30:07,579 --> 01:30:11,149
now something I want to mention trimming

2635
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:15,050
will be very strain dependent some buds

2636
01:30:11,149 --> 01:30:16,759
are tight some buds are real fluffy some

2637
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:18,199
buds are a little compacted little rocks

2638
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:20,300
you can just kind of rub your fingers

2639
01:30:18,199 --> 01:30:22,010
over those and those are gonna trim some

2640
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:24,079
buds are airy and have a lot of texture

2641
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,369
to them those are gonna be a little

2642
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:27,079
harder to trim because you don't want to

2643
01:30:25,369 --> 01:30:29,420
knock off all those calyxes you're going

2644
01:30:27,079 --> 01:30:31,309
to have to adjust also if you're working

2645
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:32,989
for somebody else you're going to have

2646
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:34,850
to adjust to how they want it trimmed

2647
01:30:32,989 --> 01:30:36,949
when you go to a grow and you're working

2648
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:39,620
for someone else they get to dictate how

2649
01:30:36,949 --> 01:30:41,840
tight your trim is don't over trim don't

2650
01:30:39,619 --> 01:30:43,010
under trim you trim to their expectation

2651
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,569
if you're not sure what they want

2652
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:46,489
have them trim up a bud and show you

2653
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:47,869
have them trim up two or three buds and

2654
01:30:46,489 --> 01:30:49,460
set those at your workstations so you

2655
01:30:47,869 --> 01:30:51,380
have something to refer to as the day

2656
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:52,880
goes on so that you don't forget and

2657
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:54,260
also if they come by and say hey why you

2658
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,640
doing it like that you've got a couple

2659
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:57,289
little buds to show them you could say

2660
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:58,850
these are what you showed me this is

2661
01:30:57,289 --> 01:30:59,118
what I did show me the difference show

2662
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:00,860
me

2663
01:30:59,118 --> 01:31:01,939
gone wrong then they can say [ __ ] you're

2664
01:31:00,859 --> 01:31:03,710
doing it just like I showed you I'm

2665
01:31:01,939 --> 01:31:05,569
sorry so we've got a nice tight trim

2666
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:07,039
we're setting the trim in one pile we're

2667
01:31:05,569 --> 01:31:08,750
setting our little tiny buds in another

2668
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:10,010
pile we're mixing that up so we can make

2669
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,618
good concentrates out of it

2670
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:14,360
we're getting rid of all the sticks you

2671
01:31:12,618 --> 01:31:16,039
guys I think we have covered most of

2672
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:18,618
trimming one great thing about trimming

2673
01:31:16,039 --> 01:31:19,969
is scissor and glove hatch all that

2674
01:31:18,618 --> 01:31:22,250
sticky [ __ ] that builds up on your

2675
01:31:19,969 --> 01:31:24,710
gloves and scissors is smokeable you can

2676
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:26,810
smoke that right away Mike loved scissor

2677
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:28,250
hatch Oh what I like to do if I've got

2678
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:30,199
if I've been trimming to see even trim

2679
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:32,630
and you've got this weird layer of like

2680
01:31:30,198 --> 01:31:34,158
sticky gooey looking [ __ ] all over your

2681
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:36,618
gloves that's resin that's trichomes

2682
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:38,299
that is potency rub your hands together

2683
01:31:36,618 --> 01:31:39,559
and you'll start figuring out how to rub

2684
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:41,300
your hands in a circle to make that

2685
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,830
stuff stick together a little bit of

2686
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,840
heat goes a long way so if your hands

2687
01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:46,670
get warm it'll start taking that resin

2688
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:48,860
right off of your hands I don't want to

2689
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:50,690
smoke it off your skin back in the day

2690
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:52,789
we used to call it finger hatch but

2691
01:31:50,689 --> 01:31:54,948
please wear gloves now and we're gonna

2692
01:31:52,789 --> 01:31:56,329
call it glove hatch you can scrape it

2693
01:31:54,948 --> 01:31:58,339
off your scissors you can smoke it off

2694
01:31:56,329 --> 01:31:59,779
your gloves then put it in a bowl you

2695
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:01,579
can put it on top of some pot or just

2696
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:04,009
put it in an empty bowl and just put a

2697
01:32:01,579 --> 01:32:05,448
flame to it and melt it just slowly melt

2698
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:06,889
that [ __ ] until it starts smoking and

2699
01:32:05,448 --> 01:32:09,198
you can smoke that sizzurp hash that

2700
01:32:06,889 --> 01:32:11,868
glove hash you can smoke it right away

2701
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:13,848
but please don't pass that [ __ ] to me if

2702
01:32:11,868 --> 01:32:15,649
you did that off your skin and weren't

2703
01:32:13,849 --> 01:32:18,289
wearing gloves I don't want to smoke

2704
01:32:15,649 --> 01:32:20,388
your skin so that's one good thing about

2705
01:32:18,289 --> 01:32:22,460
trimming is you get scissor hash right

2706
01:32:20,389 --> 01:32:23,150
away I think that anything that sticks

2707
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:24,469
to your gloves

2708
01:32:23,149 --> 01:32:26,089
that's yours you get to smoke that if

2709
01:32:24,469 --> 01:32:27,469
you come trim for me and that should

2710
01:32:26,090 --> 01:32:28,610
stick to your gloves I have no problem

2711
01:32:27,469 --> 01:32:30,050
with you rolling that right off your

2712
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:31,189
glove put that in a pipe and smoke it

2713
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:32,599
right in front of me you earned that

2714
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:34,819
that is your scissor hatch that means

2715
01:32:32,599 --> 01:32:36,469
you're trimming your ass off if it's on

2716
01:32:34,819 --> 01:32:38,868
your scissors scrape your scissors off

2717
01:32:36,469 --> 01:32:40,550
smoke that [ __ ] what a lot of people

2718
01:32:38,868 --> 01:32:41,809
will do all the trimmers in the room

2719
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:43,400
will just gather all their scissor hash

2720
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:44,360
into one pile and put it into a big ball

2721
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:45,888
and then at the end of the day you guys

2722
01:32:44,359 --> 01:32:48,529
all smoke that together it's like a

2723
01:32:45,889 --> 01:32:49,250
little celebration but it's smokeable

2724
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:50,719
that's my point

2725
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:53,000
you can make edibles out of it if you

2726
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:55,039
want to but I would recommend smoking it

2727
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,569
Mike loves smoking it's not my favorite

2728
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:58,819
to smoke it's a little lots heavy on the

2729
01:32:56,569 --> 01:33:01,250
lungs and it tastes kind of wet but it

2730
01:32:58,819 --> 01:33:03,710
is potent and it will give you a big fat

2731
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:05,090
hit another great thing about dry

2732
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:06,710
trimming that I didn't mention is that

2733
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:07,760
when you are done trimming you can now

2734
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:09,079
weigh your product

2735
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,369
you've been cutting off the extra crap

2736
01:33:09,079 --> 01:33:11,378
and throwing that one pile that you've

2737
01:33:10,368 --> 01:33:13,358
been throwing those finished

2738
01:33:11,378 --> 01:33:14,708
into one pile all you got to do is set

2739
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:16,419
that container on the scale and weigh it

2740
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:18,219
now one thing I would recommend it's a

2741
01:33:16,418 --> 01:33:19,628
good idea whatever container you're

2742
01:33:18,219 --> 01:33:21,760
going to throw your buds into your

2743
01:33:19,628 --> 01:33:22,948
finished buds if it's gonna be a bucket

2744
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,359
if it's gonna be a Tupperware container

2745
01:33:22,948 --> 01:33:27,308
waive that and write the weight of that

2746
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:29,229
on your container so that when you're

2747
01:33:27,309 --> 01:33:30,369
done trimming into that container you

2748
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:32,050
know how much that weighs

2749
01:33:30,368 --> 01:33:33,518
so just subtract the weight of your

2750
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:35,288
container and now you know how much

2751
01:33:33,519 --> 01:33:37,149
product is on the scale so it's always

2752
01:33:35,288 --> 01:33:38,679
rewarding knowing how much product

2753
01:33:37,149 --> 01:33:40,449
you've got right at the end of the trim

2754
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:42,069
process when you wet trim you don't know

2755
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,719
is you've got a way for it to dry still

2756
01:33:42,069 --> 01:33:44,889
so when people say how much did you trim

2757
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:46,448
today and they said I trimmed a black

2758
01:33:44,889 --> 01:33:47,769
pound how do you know bro it was wet

2759
01:33:46,448 --> 01:33:50,049
it's got a dry we'll find out in a few

2760
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:52,030
days so if you're paying people to trim

2761
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:54,189
by the pound dry trim is the way to go

2762
01:33:52,029 --> 01:33:55,509
because now you've got dry pounds to

2763
01:33:54,189 --> 01:33:57,639
weigh you don't have a wet pound to

2764
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:59,498
guess on the weight so here's one more

2765
01:33:57,639 --> 01:34:00,760
thing I should definitely mention to all

2766
01:33:59,498 --> 01:34:02,349
of my friends who have never trimmed

2767
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,719
before everybody who is new with

2768
01:34:02,349 --> 01:34:06,969
cannabis here's something that I have to

2769
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:09,489
tell you when you were trimming or

2770
01:34:06,969 --> 01:34:12,208
working with plants in general do not

2771
01:34:09,488 --> 01:34:14,589
touch your eyes with sticky trim fingers

2772
01:34:12,208 --> 01:34:16,748
don't rub your eye with the back of your

2773
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:19,359
hand go wash your hands before you touch

2774
01:34:16,748 --> 01:34:21,458
your eyes if you rub your eyes with

2775
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:23,769
trichomes or plant resin on your finger

2776
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:26,229
it is going to burn for the next hour

2777
01:34:23,769 --> 01:34:27,939
and it is sticky every time you blink

2778
01:34:26,229 --> 01:34:29,469
most of the time you think you can blink

2779
01:34:27,939 --> 01:34:30,999
and it will fix your sticky eye or

2780
01:34:29,469 --> 01:34:32,378
whatever is in your eye not when you

2781
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:33,998
have resin in your hai every time you

2782
01:34:32,378 --> 01:34:35,198
blink it gets [ __ ] stickier and it

2783
01:34:33,998 --> 01:34:38,139
feels like your eyelid is sticking to

2784
01:34:35,198 --> 01:34:39,998
your eyeball and it just burns so wear

2785
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:42,368
gloves and if you need to itch your eye

2786
01:34:39,998 --> 01:34:44,948
take your [ __ ] glove off your hand

2787
01:34:42,368 --> 01:34:47,018
VIN it your eye I would almost consider

2788
01:34:44,948 --> 01:34:48,759
washing my hands before the itch take

2789
01:34:47,019 --> 01:34:50,019
the glove off go wash the hand VIN

2790
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:51,039
scratch the eye but I understand

2791
01:34:50,019 --> 01:34:52,449
sometimes you just got to stick your

2792
01:34:51,038 --> 01:34:54,518
finger in your eye cuz shits going weird

2793
01:34:52,448 --> 01:34:57,608
take that glove off you guys don't put

2794
01:34:54,519 --> 01:35:00,099
plant resin or trichomes in your eye it

2795
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:02,050
will [ __ ] suck that's the technical

2796
01:35:00,099 --> 01:35:03,489
term for it it [ __ ] sucks there's no

2797
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:05,409
other way to describe it it [ __ ]

2798
01:35:03,488 --> 01:35:06,698
sucks you guys alright so I feel like

2799
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:08,858
I've given you a pretty good lesson on

2800
01:35:06,698 --> 01:35:11,799
trimming I know I didn't teach you

2801
01:35:08,859 --> 01:35:13,329
exactly how to trim the act of holding

2802
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,769
the bud and putting the scissors to it

2803
01:35:13,328 --> 01:35:16,118
is something you're going to have to

2804
01:35:14,769 --> 01:35:18,099
experience you will develop your

2805
01:35:16,118 --> 01:35:19,509
technique in your style I feel like I've

2806
01:35:18,099 --> 01:35:20,889
given you a pretty good outline you know

2807
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:21,489
what to do with the product you know how

2808
01:35:20,889 --> 01:35:23,769
to get it there

2809
01:35:21,488 --> 01:35:24,939
you just need some practice doing it get

2810
01:35:23,769 --> 01:35:26,350
some buds and

2811
01:35:24,939 --> 01:35:27,939
put some scissors to him it's the only

2812
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:29,500
way you're gonna get good at it it's the

2813
01:35:27,939 --> 01:35:31,389
only way you're gonna get faster at it

2814
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:34,000
when we hire new trimmers if they grow

2815
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:35,710
we don't always hire the people that

2816
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,359
claim to be the fastest trimmers we hire

2817
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:38,619
the people that interview well and seem

2818
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:40,750
like they're gonna fit in with the crew

2819
01:35:38,619 --> 01:35:42,579
if they say they can only trim a half a

2820
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:44,319
pound of weed when they start that is

2821
01:35:42,579 --> 01:35:46,210
fine if that is real if they say they

2822
01:35:44,319 --> 01:35:47,738
can trim a half a pound and they only do

2823
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:49,630
a quarter pound then I've got issues but

2824
01:35:47,738 --> 01:35:51,639
they say I can trim a half a pound in a

2825
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:53,590
day I'm fine with that we will train

2826
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,969
them we will teach them our system we'll

2827
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:56,319
teach them some tricks they'll get in

2828
01:35:54,969 --> 01:35:58,210
they'll get a rhythm they'll get a

2829
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,159
routine and eventually they'll be

2830
01:35:58,210 --> 01:36:01,420
trimming a pound and a half a day so

2831
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:03,219
it's all about just finding the rhythm

2832
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:04,449
it's all about finding the groove and it

2833
01:36:03,219 --> 01:36:05,770
takes you a little bit of time and

2834
01:36:04,448 --> 01:36:08,649
experience to get in there and do it

2835
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:11,410
also these are buds these are precious

2836
01:36:08,649 --> 01:36:13,479
to people I've been in this industry for

2837
01:36:11,409 --> 01:36:15,279
a long time I can grab a flowering plant

2838
01:36:13,479 --> 01:36:16,929
that's a few days in and just cut that

2839
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:18,130
[ __ ] down and feel no remorse or

2840
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:20,500
anything if that's what needed to happen

2841
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:22,300
in a commercial grow I kill the plant a

2842
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,680
lot of people treat little buds like

2843
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:25,600
they're the most precious thing they've

2844
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:26,829
ever seen which I respect you don't get

2845
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,260
to grow a bunch of plants I have

2846
01:36:26,829 --> 01:36:31,329
produced over a ton of cannabis in my

2847
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:33,489
life I am responsible for a ton of

2848
01:36:31,329 --> 01:36:35,140
cannabis but having been produced a lot

2849
01:36:33,488 --> 01:36:37,179
of people don't have that under their

2850
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:38,800
belt so every bud is precious to them

2851
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:41,170
they don't want to [ __ ] up one single

2852
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,390
but I get that so when they're new at it

2853
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:45,100
they go really slow especially a hired

2854
01:36:43,390 --> 01:36:46,539
trimmer that is not their product that

2855
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:48,489
is your bud that they're playing with

2856
01:36:46,539 --> 01:36:49,390
respect them for taking their time and

2857
01:36:48,488 --> 01:36:52,059
going slow with it

2858
01:36:49,390 --> 01:36:54,520
but also encourage them to go faster you

2859
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:56,050
have to learn and go faster but people

2860
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:57,730
like to go slow in the beginning because

2861
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:59,500
they're playing with gold they don't

2862
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:01,059
they're playing with little pieces of

2863
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:02,770
gold they got little babies in their

2864
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:04,870
hand and they're new so they're kind of

2865
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:06,340
intimidated so keep that in mind you'll

2866
01:37:04,869 --> 01:37:07,329
get faster as time goes on is what I'm

2867
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:08,500
trying to say you guys you just need

2868
01:37:07,329 --> 01:37:09,909
some practice you'll become a good

2869
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,859
trimmer if you want to become a good

2870
01:37:09,909 --> 01:37:13,840
trimmer and if you want to get your foot

2871
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:14,409
in the door in the commercial marijuana

2872
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:17,140
industry

2873
01:37:14,409 --> 01:37:18,939
being a trimmer is probably the number

2874
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:20,800
one way to get in the door trimmers and

2875
01:37:18,939 --> 01:37:22,149
bud tenders are how you get started so

2876
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,880
trimming can be really time-consuming

2877
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:27,250
and tedious but it is the last step

2878
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:29,469
before you claim victory in your garden

2879
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:31,420
if your garden is for sale you're one

2880
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:33,789
step away from money if your garden is

2881
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:35,550
for medicinal uses you're one step away

2882
01:37:33,789 --> 01:37:38,409
from feeling better

2883
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:40,570
so trimming sucks but you're almost

2884
01:37:38,409 --> 01:37:42,159
there it's it's the hardest most

2885
01:37:40,569 --> 01:37:44,319
time-consuming tedious part in my

2886
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:46,809
opinion it is my least favorite part but

2887
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:48,819
it is one step away from sweet success

2888
01:37:46,810 --> 01:37:50,710
all right podcast ruled I hope this

2889
01:37:48,819 --> 01:37:52,539
trimming lesson made sense again the

2890
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:54,640
only way to get good at trimming is to

2891
01:37:52,539 --> 01:37:55,869
get sticky and get some practice get in

2892
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:57,550
there get your gloves dirty get your

2893
01:37:55,869 --> 01:37:59,289
scissors all sticky and start trimming

2894
01:37:57,550 --> 01:38:00,880
up some weed if you want to learn and

2895
01:37:59,289 --> 01:38:03,159
you've got friends that are harvesting

2896
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:04,750

2897
01:38:03,159 --> 01:38:05,889
could use a free trimmer and we know

2898
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:07,630

2899
01:38:05,890 --> 01:38:08,770
fine but we hope that in a few harvests

2900

01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:28,600
as long as I am able to put this podcast

2939
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:31,210
out for free it will be free for you as

2940
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:32,950
well I may in the future release some

2941
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:35,350
paid content which will be bonus content

2942
01:39:32,949 --> 01:39:38,019
but this version of the podcast in this

2943
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:40,030
format always will be free iTunes

2944
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:42,040
stitcher and the YouTube channel as it

2945
01:39:40,029 --> 01:39:44,139
is will always be free I do this because

2946
01:39:42,039 --> 01:39:45,640
I love cannabis and I love you and I

2947
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:48,770
want you to be able to medicate and

2948
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:50,510
wreck create the best ways possible

2949
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:52,340
the highest quality cleanest safest

2950
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:54,140
products available and I think the only

2951
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:55,699
way you can do that is by growing it

2952
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:57,230
yourself so I've got to teach you how to

2953
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:58,729
do that so that you don't have to rely

2954
01:39:57,229 --> 01:40:00,979
on anybody else

2955
01:39:58,729 --> 01:40:02,659
so my point is that the podcast will be

2956
01:40:00,979 --> 01:40:03,679
free but I know there are people out

2957
01:40:02,659 --> 01:40:05,239
there who would like to contribute

2958
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,890

2959
01:40:05,239 --> 01:40:08,929

2960
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:11,980

clean up the grow room and get restarted

3073
01:44:00,559 --> 01:44:05,900
for the next cycle let's talk a little

3074
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:08,239
bit about after harvest cleaning it

3075
01:44:05,899 --> 01:44:11,268
sounds pretty basic but there are a few

3076
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:13,339
things you may overlook now if you had

3077
01:44:11,269 --> 01:44:14,899
bugs or powdery mildew you may want to

3078
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:16,578
step up your cleaning product you may

3079
01:44:14,899 --> 01:44:18,800
want to step up your cleaning regimen

3080
01:44:16,578 --> 01:44:20,808
but if you didn't have any bugs or any

3081
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:23,029
issues I think a light bleach and water

3082
01:44:20,809 --> 01:44:24,739
solution should work or maybe you might

3083
01:44:23,029 --> 01:44:27,679
want to get yourself some flies in and

3084
01:44:24,738 --> 01:44:29,479
use 15 to 20 mils of 5n per gallon of

3085
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:31,880
water use that to clean up your whole

3086
01:44:29,479 --> 01:44:34,519
grow either way whatever product you use

3087
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:37,730
let's clean everything let's clean the

3088
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:39,889
walls wipe down every inch of every wall

3089
01:44:37,729 --> 01:44:41,448
start at one section at the top and just

3090
01:44:39,889 --> 01:44:42,800
work your way down and to the right and

3091
01:44:41,448 --> 01:44:44,988
then just keep going until you've

3092
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:47,690
covered every inch of that grow room

3093
01:44:44,988 --> 01:44:49,399
also if you can reach scrub the ceiling

3094
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:52,399
if you can't reach find me I can

3095
01:44:49,399 --> 01:44:54,259
probably reach if not get a ladder scrub

3096
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:56,960
the ceiling let's clean it with either

3097
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:58,849
bleach and hot water or flies in and hot

3098
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,649
water and just get anything off of there

3099
01:44:58,849 --> 01:45:02,059
that may be hiding that we don't want in

3100
01:45:00,649 --> 01:45:03,738
that grow room maybe you've got a spider

3101
01:45:02,059 --> 01:45:05,360
light up there chilling out maybe you've

3102
01:45:03,738 --> 01:45:07,069
got a little bit of powdery mildew Spore

3103
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:08,269
that you don't know about maybe there's

3104
01:45:07,069 --> 01:45:10,609

3105

bunch of water and a bunch of air and

3133

01:48:11,779 --> 01:48:15,769
[ __ ] down with some Windex let it dry

3195
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:18,170
and put it back clean the reflector

3196
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:20,000
glass also clean all of your air

3197
01:48:18,170 --> 01:48:22,399
conditioner filters check them make sure

3198
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,199
they are clean if you've got ducting

3199
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:25,849
anywhere check your ducting make sure

3200
01:48:24,199 --> 01:48:27,738
the ducting isn't bent in any weird

3201
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:29,930
places make sure there are no clogs make

3202
01:48:27,738 --> 01:48:31,339
sure all of your duct is secured

3203
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:32,810
make sure it's duct tape four clamps

3204
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:34,250
somewhere so that the air you're trying

3205
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:36,230
to move away from the grow doesn't

3206
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:38,300
accidentally end up being blown right

3207
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:40,309
where you don't need it if you've got a

3208
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:42,020
leak that air is just gonna come flying

3209
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:43,850
out of there you may just be moving the

3210
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:44,900
heat from the light right

3211
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:46,910
into the grill room then your

3212
01:48:44,899 --> 01:48:48,409
air-conditioner has to work harder and

3213
01:48:46,909 --> 01:48:50,449
you can't figure out why the room isn't

3214
01:48:48,409 --> 01:48:52,369
cooling down and it gets frustrating so

3215
01:48:50,449 --> 01:48:54,109
check all of your ducting check your

3216
01:48:52,369 --> 01:48:56,750
carbon filter is that carbon filters

3217
01:48:54,109 --> 01:48:58,460
still filtering can you smell the herb

3218
01:48:56,750 --> 01:49:00,979
outside when you grow did anybody

3219
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:02,930
mention that your harvest stunk really

3220
01:49:00,979 --> 01:49:05,029
badly how long have you had that carbon

3221
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:07,010
filter did you write it down you should

3222
01:49:05,029 --> 01:49:09,019
know when that carbon filter needs to be

3223
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:11,360
replaced a lot of the brands say they

3224
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:13,430
will last two years I never believe in

3225
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:16,489
that I've never had a carbon filter last

3226
01:49:13,430 --> 01:49:18,230
two years also that carbon filter cover

3227
01:49:16,489 --> 01:49:19,880
maybe you're gonna leave that filter

3228
01:49:18,229 --> 01:49:22,039
there for two years and it's got that

3229
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:24,199
little dust cover on it take that ugly

3230
01:49:22,039 --> 01:49:26,380
thing off throw it in the washer with

3231
01:49:24,199 --> 01:49:28,609
some oxy clean and clean that thing

3232
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:31,670
nobody wants to see your pictures of

3233
01:49:28,609 --> 01:49:34,849
your black and gray carbon filter dust

3234
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:36,260
cover that is gross also you guys get in

3235
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:37,880
there and clean out the reservoir if

3236
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:40,010
you've got a reservoir that you mix your

3237
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:41,480
nutrients in or that you use as part of

3238
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:43,100
your hydro system that you're pumping

3239
01:49:41,479 --> 01:49:45,859
your nutrients from right to your plants

3240
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:47,360
clean that reservoir why wouldn't you

3241
01:49:45,859 --> 01:49:49,279
want a clean fresh start you don't want

3242
01:49:47,359 --> 01:49:51,829
biofilm and funk in there because that's

3243
01:49:49,279 --> 01:49:53,329
going directly to your plants also clean

3244
01:49:51,829 --> 01:49:55,550
all of the tubing I've already said that

3245
01:49:53,329 --> 01:49:58,809
once but clean it all because all that

3246
01:49:55,550 --> 01:50:00,770
gunk will end up into your plants

3247
01:49:58,810 --> 01:50:02,420
another thing we should remember to

3248
01:50:00,770 --> 01:50:04,340
clean is the emitters if you've got a

3249
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:06,050
hydro system with some sprayers or

3250
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:08,329
emitters or sprinklers at the end of a

3251
01:50:06,050 --> 01:50:09,949
line make sure you pop those emitters

3252
01:50:08,329 --> 01:50:12,710
off and clean them they like to get

3253
01:50:09,949 --> 01:50:14,539
filled with some gunky funk now is the

3254
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:17,420
perfect opportunity to take all those

3255
01:50:14,539 --> 01:50:19,159
off and clean them up real well another

3256
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:20,989
really important thing we can do while

3257
01:50:19,159 --> 01:50:23,000
we've got the room taken down we can

3258
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:25,399
decide if we need to replace any bulbs

3259
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,800
how long have your bulbs been in the

3260
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:29,809
grow depending on what type of lighting

3261
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:32,690
you're using it may be time to swap out

3262
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:34,670
some bulbs when bulbs get old they still

3263
01:50:32,689 --> 01:50:36,889
draw the same amount of electricity but

3264
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:38,539
they do not put out the same amount of

3265
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:40,520
light so you're paying for that

3266
01:50:38,539 --> 01:50:42,920
electricity and it is not making it to

3267
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:44,300
your plants so check your bulbs and see

3268
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:45,920
if they need to be replaced

3269
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:48,470
a good way to find out if they need to

3270
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:50,779
be replaced is to get a lumen meter a

3271
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:53,270
lumen meter will measure how much light

3272
01:50:50,779 --> 01:50:55,880
is coming from your bulb if your bulb is

3273
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:56,270
putting out less than 75 or 80 percent

3274
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:58,159
of it

3275
01:50:56,270 --> 01:51:00,140
maximum output it is time to replace it

3276
01:50:58,159 --> 01:51:02,329
now how do you know what the maximum

3277
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:04,579
output of that bulb is the way to find

3278
01:51:02,329 --> 01:51:06,739
that out is to buy a brand new bulb put

3279
01:51:04,579 --> 01:51:08,420
the bulb in your reflector and turn it

3280
01:51:06,739 --> 01:51:10,159
on then you've got to wait a few minutes

3281
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:11,690
and let that bulb get to its maximum

3282
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:13,579
brightness it takes a little while for

3283
01:51:11,689 --> 01:51:14,869
the bulbs to heat up and get to the

3284
01:51:13,579 --> 01:51:16,579
right spectrum and get all the way

3285
01:51:14,869 --> 01:51:19,579
bright once it's bright and all the way

3286
01:51:16,579 --> 01:51:21,470
heated up go about 12 to 18 inches from

3287
01:51:19,579 --> 01:51:23,300
that bulb and measure what the lumens

3288
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:25,270
are right there and write it down write

3289
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:27,380
down the date and the amount of lumens

3290
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:30,020
then check it now when you're cleaning

3291
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:31,940
the room go the same distance away with

3292
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:34,070
that lumen meter and see how many lumens

3293
01:51:31,939 --> 01:51:35,960
are popping up if you're not satisfied

3294
01:51:34,069 --> 01:51:37,789
with the amount of power you're getting

3295
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:39,920
out of that bulb it is time to replace

3296
01:51:37,789 --> 01:51:41,510
it if you feel like you're paying for

3297
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:43,340
electricity that it's not making it to

3298
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:47,390
your plants it is time to replace your

3299
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:49,520
bowl lumen meters may be expensive but a

3300
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:51,740
lot of times the grow shop will let you

3301
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:53,840
borrow one because they know that if

3302
01:51:51,739 --> 01:51:55,489
your bulbs are bad you're probably just

3303
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:57,920
gonna come buy more bulbs when you

3304
01:51:55,489 --> 01:51:59,149
return the lumen meter so ask them at

3305
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:01,250
the gross start they may have one

3306
01:51:59,149 --> 01:52:03,229
available that you can borrow all right

3307
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:05,149
guys most of the cleaning stuff should

3308
01:52:03,229 --> 01:52:07,219
be fairly obvious clean the [ __ ] out of

3309
01:52:05,149 --> 01:52:08,809
everything scrub everything if you're

3310
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:10,280
gonna put plants in anything that had a

3311
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:12,620
cleaner in it make sure you get that

3312
01:52:10,279 --> 01:52:14,869
cleaner out replace the bulbs replace

3313
01:52:12,619 --> 01:52:17,119
the filters some other things we may not

3314
01:52:14,869 --> 01:52:19,099
remember to think about our check and

3315
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:21,079
reset your timers and all of your

3316
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:23,270
programs if you've got your lights on a

3317
01:52:21,079 --> 01:52:25,039
certain schedule fix that schedule if

3318
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:27,080
you've got your co2 or your auto

3319
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:28,850
watering on a schedule make sure you

3320
01:52:27,079 --> 01:52:31,010
correct that schedule before you put new

3321
01:52:28,850 --> 01:52:33,829
plants in here did daylight savings time

3322
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:36,079
happen check that is the timer on the

3323
01:52:33,829 --> 01:52:38,750
right time is your timer on the right

3324
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:40,939
day a lot of the controllers have a day

3325
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:42,409
that you can set is it Monday Tuesday or

3326
01:52:40,939 --> 01:52:45,019
Wednesday is that the proper day do you

3327
01:52:42,409 --> 01:52:46,729
have AM and PM set properly make sure

3328
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:48,950
you check out all of your controllers

3329
01:52:46,729 --> 01:52:51,529
before you put plants in there and you

3330
01:52:48,949 --> 01:52:54,529
accidentally flower them way too early

3331
01:52:51,529 --> 01:52:56,599
also check out all of your co2 controls

3332
01:52:54,529 --> 01:52:59,389
another thing I like to do at this point

3333
01:52:56,600 --> 01:53:01,970
in time is calibrate all of my pins and

3334
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:03,619
meters I like to calibrate my pH pin I

3335
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:05,329
like to make sure that my EC meter is

3336
01:53:03,619 --> 01:53:06,680
working properly these are all things

3337
01:53:05,329 --> 01:53:08,689
that you should check on between

3338
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:10,190
harvests I like to calibrate my meters

3339
01:53:08,689 --> 01:53:11,599
about once every

3340
01:53:10,189 --> 01:53:13,460
two weeks to tell you the truth probably

3341
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:15,500
every ten days I just like to check on

3342
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:19,159
them and make sure that those things are

3343
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:22,250
accurate another thing you should have a

3344
01:53:19,159 --> 01:53:23,899
fire extinguisher near your grow check

3345
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:25,819
on that look at the little gauge on

3346
01:53:23,899 --> 01:53:28,159
there make sure it's in the green if

3347
01:53:25,819 --> 01:53:31,069
your fire extinguisher gauge is not in

3348
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:32,779
the green either buy a new one or take

3349
01:53:31,069 --> 01:53:35,479
it to the fire department and have it

3350
01:53:32,779 --> 01:53:36,829
refilled correctly I really hope you

3351
01:53:35,479 --> 01:53:39,439
don't have to use that fire extinguisher

3352
01:53:36,829 --> 01:53:42,229
but if you need it I really want it to

3353
01:53:39,439 --> 01:53:44,929
work for you also check the batteries in

3354
01:53:42,229 --> 01:53:47,899
your smoke alarm yes I said smoke alarm

3355
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:48,980
your grow should have a smoke alarm you

3356
01:53:47,899 --> 01:53:51,019
don't want to burn down the house

3357
01:53:48,979 --> 01:53:52,789
because something went wrong in the grow

3358
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:55,250
room and you did not have a smoke

3359
01:53:52,789 --> 01:53:57,260
detector and a fire extinguisher so be a

3360
01:53:55,250 --> 01:54:00,229
responsible grower make sure that the

3361
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:01,250
safety precautions are in place now

3362
01:54:00,229 --> 01:54:03,139
since we're checking on the fire

3363
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:05,448
extinguisher and the smoke alarm it is a

3364
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:07,340
good time to check on your respirator

3365
01:54:05,448 --> 01:54:08,299
are you using a respirator to apply

3366
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:10,279
pesticides

3367
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:11,960
I really hope you're using something to

3368
01:54:10,279 --> 01:54:13,670
keep yourself safe if you're using a

3369
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:15,409
respirator now is the time to check

3370
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:17,600
those cartridges how long have they been

3371
01:54:15,409 --> 01:54:20,840
on there is it time to replace them is

3372
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:22,400
that respirator clean maybe it's time to

3373
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:24,469
watch a google video and learn how to

3374
01:54:22,399 --> 01:54:26,179
properly clean and take care of your

3375
01:54:24,469 --> 01:54:28,550
respirator that thing is going to save

3376
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:31,039
your life over time take care of that

3377
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:32,960
also it's a good time to replace your

3378
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:35,448
gloves do you need more nitrile gloves

3379
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:37,760
do you need more time exits now is a

3380
01:54:35,448 --> 01:54:40,009
really good time to make a list and go

3381
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:42,619
to the gross store and stock up on those

3382
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:44,239

3383
01:54:42,619 --> 01:54:45,859

3385
01:54:45,859 --> 01:54:49,789
we've refilled all the necessary

3386
01:54:47,539 --> 01:54:51,979
supplies now is a good time to do a

3387
01:54:49,789 --> 01:54:54,289
quick inventory of your pesticides and

3388
01:54:51,979 --> 01:54:55,459
nutrients and any accessories you think

3389
01:54:54,289 --> 01:54:57,859
you may need if you're gonna need

3390
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:59,329
pesticides or nutrients start ordering

3391
01:54:57,859 --> 01:55:01,099

3392
01:54:59,329 --> 01:55:02,569

3393
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:04,520

3394
01:55:02,569 --> 01:55:06,889
supplies you need so that you don't miss

3395
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:08,390
a day of the grow cycle so we've got

3396
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:09,770
everything cleaned up we've checked out

3397
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:11,539
all of our safety equipment we've

3398
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:13,310
restocked of our personal protective

3399
01:55:11,539 --> 01:55:15,319
equipment we have reordered all of our

3400
01:55:13,310 --> 01:55:17,270
nutrients now if we didn't have any

3401
01:55:15,319 --> 01:55:20,269
problems with pests or powdery mildew it

3402
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:22,880
is time to start running that room and

3403
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:23,930
get it prepared for the next cycle now

3404
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,270
if you did

3405
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:27,650
have pests or problems there are a

3406
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:28,960
couple of more steps that we need to

3407
01:55:27,649 --> 01:55:31,549
take we need to clean this room

3408
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:33,980
thoroughly we need to spray it with some

3409
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:35,960
products we might want to go a little

3410
01:55:33,979 --> 01:55:37,279
harder with the bleach water we might

3411
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:39,439
want to go a little harder with some

3412
01:55:37,279 --> 01:55:42,739
Faiz an you might want to get a product

3413
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:44,419
called procure if you had powdery mildew

3414
01:55:42,739 --> 01:55:46,750
you're gonna want to spray something to

3415
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:49,670
get rid of the spores in that room if

3416
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:51,439
you had bugs I would recommend spraying

3417
01:55:49,670 --> 01:55:54,050
some sort of pesticide through the

3418
01:55:51,439 --> 01:55:56,149
entire room just mix up your pesticide

3419
01:55:54,050 --> 01:55:58,340
sprayer your pump sprayer if you don't

3420
01:55:56,149 --> 01:55:58,939
have one go get one from Lowe's get a

3421
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:00,350
good one

3422
01:55:58,939 --> 01:56:01,549
get a deck sprayer that can handle

3423
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:03,320
bleach because you're gonna be putting

3424
01:56:01,550 --> 01:56:04,850
some chemicals in here they're not that

3425
01:56:03,319 --> 01:56:06,349
expensive you just need one that holds

3426
01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:10,070
about a gallon maybe two gallons of

3427
01:56:06,350 --> 01:56:11,660
water fill it up with water put your

3428
01:56:10,069 --> 01:56:14,029
cleaning product in there whether it's

3429
01:56:11,659 --> 01:56:15,829
five in whether it's procure whether

3430
01:56:14,029 --> 01:56:17,689
it's a bunch of bleach maybe you want to

3431
01:56:15,829 --> 01:56:20,420
use granulated sulfur if you had a PM

3432
01:56:17,689 --> 01:56:22,519
issue mix that up spray the [ __ ] out of

3433
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:24,920
the entire room this is your best

3434
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:26,270
opportunity to spray everything and

3435
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:28,159
eliminate your problem there are no

3436
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:29,480
plants in there so you can use products

3437
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:31,099
that you wouldn't spray when you've got

3438
01:56:29,479 --> 01:56:33,349
plants in there so get in there and

3439
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:34,789
clean the [ __ ] out of the room I would

3440
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:37,039
start with the normal cleaning I

3441
01:56:34,789 --> 01:56:39,109
recommended take everything down and

3442
01:56:37,039 --> 01:56:41,090
clean it then put it back up then setup

3443
01:56:39,109 --> 01:56:42,679
the room and before you put the plants

3444
01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:45,529
in there go in there with this

3445
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:47,900
extra-hard commando cleaning spray and

3446
01:56:45,529 --> 01:56:49,759
go really hard you guys you got to get

3447
01:56:47,899 --> 01:56:51,500
all of the bugs out of there or you're

3448
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,850
just gonna bring plants in there and

3449
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:54,470
they're gonna get bugs or they're gonna

3450
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:56,780
get PM and you're gonna have another

3451
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:59,659
struggling harvest and nobody likes to

3452
01:56:56,779 --> 01:57:01,279
struggle through a harvest so now we've

3453
01:56:59,659 --> 01:57:02,750
taken everything apart we've cleaned the

3454
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:04,550
[ __ ] out of the room we've replaced the

3455
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:07,159
bulbs we've replaced all of our filters

3456
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:09,260
we have calibrated all of our equipment

3457
01:57:07,159 --> 01:57:11,029
we've got new protective equipment we

3458
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:13,039
have tested our safety equipment we've

3459
01:57:11,029 --> 01:57:15,170
put the room back together we've gone in

3460
01:57:13,039 --> 01:57:17,600
there and done another final spray maybe

3461
01:57:15,170 --> 01:57:19,609
we hit it with fyz in maybe we sprayed

3462
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:20,570
procure on everything to try to get rid

3463
01:57:19,609 --> 01:57:22,729
of our problems

3464
01:57:20,569 --> 01:57:25,279
maybe we just spray bleach water real

3465
01:57:22,729 --> 01:57:26,899
hot bleach water in there maybe we went

3466
01:57:25,279 --> 01:57:28,699
in there with some h2o too that would

3467
01:57:26,899 --> 01:57:30,199
work really well also but if you use any

3468
01:57:28,699 --> 01:57:31,609
type of products like that you guys make

3469
01:57:30,199 --> 01:57:34,220
sure you wear personal protective

3470
01:57:31,609 --> 01:57:36,349
equipment some goggles and a respirator

3471
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:37,739
you don't want to spray bleach you don't

3472
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:39,690
want to spray h2o to

3473
01:57:37,738 --> 01:57:41,459
you don't want to spray Faiz in without

3474
01:57:39,689 --> 01:57:42,629
some sort of protective equipment that

3475
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:45,389
[ __ ] will be terrible for your eyes

3476
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:46,650
terrible for your skin please take care

3477
01:57:45,389 --> 01:57:49,529
of yourself and if you're using a

3478
01:57:46,649 --> 01:57:51,738
sprayer to spray anything please use

3479
01:57:49,529 --> 01:57:53,038
some sort of respiratory protection

3480
01:57:51,738 --> 01:57:54,689
please

3481
01:57:53,038 --> 01:57:57,748
now once the room is put back together

3482
01:57:54,689 --> 01:57:59,279
here is something I suggest I would turn

3483
01:57:57,748 --> 01:58:01,590
on the lights I would turn on your

3484
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:03,238
blowers I would turn on the fans I would

3485
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:04,949
turn on the air-conditioner and I would

3486
01:58:03,238 --> 01:58:06,388
let everything run for a few minutes and

3487
01:58:04,948 --> 01:58:08,488
I would stand in the room and pay

3488
01:58:06,389 --> 01:58:09,989
attention is there anything wrong is

3489
01:58:08,488 --> 01:58:12,328
there anything you could dial in is

3490
01:58:09,988 --> 01:58:15,149
there anything you could adjust do it

3491
01:58:12,328 --> 01:58:18,118
while you're in there then go outside

3492
01:58:15,149 --> 01:58:19,920
and walk around your grow space if your

3493
01:58:18,118 --> 01:58:21,420
grow is at your house just go walk

3494
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:23,248
around the house just go pick up trash

3495
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:25,739
around the house or whatever and see if

3496
01:58:23,248 --> 01:58:27,179
you can identify any light leaks do you

3497
01:58:25,738 --> 01:58:29,759
see light coming out of your grow room

3498
01:58:27,179 --> 01:58:33,179
if you see light coming out there is

3499
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:35,340
light going in we do not want and cannot

3500
01:58:33,179 --> 01:58:37,170
have light leaks in our grow room so

3501
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:39,538
walk around the house walk around the

3502
01:58:37,170 --> 01:58:42,480
perimeter identify any possible light

3503
01:58:39,538 --> 01:58:45,029
leaks also listen do you hear the

3504
01:58:42,479 --> 01:58:47,279
blowers do you hear the fans do you hear

3505
01:58:45,029 --> 01:58:48,929
your air conditioner is anything outside

3506
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:52,139
making it obvious that you're running

3507
01:58:48,929 --> 01:58:54,029
aggro in that house this is a good time

3508
01:58:52,139 --> 01:58:55,980
to discover that we've got light leaks

3509
01:58:54,029 --> 01:58:57,149
or that we've got noisy equipment so

3510
01:58:55,979 --> 01:58:59,069
that we don't get ourselves in trouble

3511
01:58:57,149 --> 01:59:01,198
you do not want to attract law

3512
01:58:59,069 --> 01:59:03,779
enforcement it may be legal where you

3513
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:05,428
grow it is legal where I grow I am still

3514
01:59:03,779 --> 01:59:08,279
stealth because you know who's worse

3515
01:59:05,429 --> 01:59:10,319
than law enforcement [ __ ] thieves you

3516
01:59:08,279 --> 01:59:13,170
don't want people to know you've got to

3517
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:17,368
grow in your house because somebody may

3518
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:19,859
come and take your crop from you that is

3519
01:59:17,368 --> 01:59:23,189
a real thing keep that in mind you have

3520
01:59:19,859 --> 01:59:26,698
to be careful even in a legal state keep

3521
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:31,138
your grow stealth so walk around outside

3522
01:59:26,698 --> 01:59:34,288
look listen smell pay attention see if

3523
01:59:31,139 --> 01:59:35,400
anything is going wrong outside once

3524
01:59:34,288 --> 01:59:38,038
you're sure that everything is fine

3525
01:59:35,399 --> 01:59:40,408
outside that's when you can go back in

3526
01:59:38,038 --> 01:59:42,238
the grow room turn off the lights in the

3527
01:59:40,408 --> 01:59:45,089
grow room and stand in there for about

3528
01:59:42,238 --> 01:59:46,589
ten minutes let your eyes adjust now is

3529
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:49,288
the time to find out if any light is

3530
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:51,779
leaking into the grow now is it time to

3531
01:59:49,288 --> 01:59:54,479
find out if the sunshine from outside

3532
01:59:51,779 --> 01:59:56,219
is coming through your ducts for your

3533
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:58,019
vented hoods right into your light

3534
01:59:56,220 --> 02:00:00,150
reflectors into your grow room and

3535
01:59:58,020 --> 02:00:01,980
shining light on your plant during a

3536
02:00:00,149 --> 02:00:03,750
dark period now is the time to find that

3537
02:00:01,979 --> 02:00:05,849
out now the catch to these last two

3538
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:07,680
things you're only gonna be able to tell

3539
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:09,150
if you have a light leak outside if you

3540
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:11,369
go walk around the house and it's dark

3541
02:00:09,149 --> 02:00:13,439
outside the only way you can tell if you

3542
02:00:11,369 --> 02:00:15,510
have a light leak inside is if it's

3543
02:00:13,439 --> 02:00:18,029
light outside and you go in the grow

3544
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:19,739
room and you turn off the lights on the

3545
02:00:18,029 --> 02:00:21,539
inside of the grow room so you're gonna

3546
02:00:19,739 --> 02:00:22,619
have to find the time of day to do that

3547
02:00:21,539 --> 02:00:24,359
you're gonna have to do some

3548
02:00:22,619 --> 02:00:27,090
investigating and some inspecting but

3549
02:00:24,359 --> 02:00:29,159
these are very important details to not

3550
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:31,050
overlook make sure your grow room is

3551
02:00:29,159 --> 02:00:33,050
light proof make sure there's not a lot

3552
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:36,329
of noise coming out of there and also

3553
02:00:33,050 --> 02:00:38,670
find out if you've got too much aroma

3554
02:00:36,329 --> 02:00:40,670
and correct it if you do you don't want

3555
02:00:38,670 --> 02:00:43,020
to attract attention that you don't need

3556
02:00:40,670 --> 02:00:44,699
once you've been growing for a while or

3557
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:46,620
if you're somebody who is looking for

3558
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:48,539
grows so say myself I've been growing

3559
02:00:46,619 --> 02:00:50,849
for a long time when I used to go walk

3560
02:00:48,539 --> 02:00:52,380
my dog in my neighborhood I would always

3561
02:00:50,850 --> 02:00:53,820
discover a new grow I would go a

3562
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:55,350
different route I'd go two blocks that

3563
02:00:53,819 --> 02:00:56,639
way three blocks that way a block that

3564
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:57,930
way and then I'd come back and then the

3565
02:00:56,640 --> 02:01:00,480
next day I'd just do a different pattern

3566
02:00:57,930 --> 02:01:02,400
I would always find a new grow about

3567
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:04,109
once a week because I know what I'm

3568
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:06,569
looking for listening for and smelling

3569
02:01:04,109 --> 02:01:08,670
for I know the details I know the clues

3570
02:01:06,569 --> 02:01:11,519
if I hear you're weird blower at 3:00 in

3571
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:13,109
the morning going from your basement

3572
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:15,180
window chances are you got to grow in

3573
02:01:13,109 --> 02:01:17,099
there if you've got an air conditioner

3574
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:19,079
in your basement window in the middle of

3575
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:20,820
winter chances are there's a grow in

3576
02:01:19,079 --> 02:01:23,309
there if you've got one window by the

3577
02:01:20,819 --> 02:01:25,319
basement it has no snow and the rest of

3578
02:01:23,310 --> 02:01:27,270
the backyard is snowy there's a grow in

3579
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:29,489
there if there's one spot on your roof

3580
02:01:27,270 --> 02:01:31,560
above one bedroom that there's no snow

3581
02:01:29,489 --> 02:01:34,349
on it there's a grow in there there are

3582
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:36,330
really easy signs that give it away so

3583
02:01:34,350 --> 02:01:38,850
pay attention you guys because if I can

3584
02:01:36,329 --> 02:01:40,920
see it law enforcement can see it and so

3585
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:43,590
can the thieves so be careful with your

3586
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:46,170
grow try to stay stealth even in legal

3587
02:01:43,590 --> 02:01:48,480
states there's no reason to brag there's

3588
02:01:46,170 --> 02:01:51,239
no reason to set bait all right podcast

3589
02:01:48,479 --> 02:01:53,609
world I feel like that is a pretty good

3590
02:01:51,239 --> 02:01:55,380
clean and reset episode hopefully I

3591
02:01:53,609 --> 02:01:57,000
mentioned some details that you would

3592
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:58,920
have overlooked hopefully I rescued you

3593
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,829
through a couple of pitfalls now you

3594
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:03,600
don't have to make those mistakes

3595
02:02:00,829 --> 02:02:05,130
hopefully everything was well in your

3596
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,670
grow and you don't have any problems

3597
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:07,800
hopefully you

3598
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:09,690
have anything funky to deal with also

3599
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:12,000
now that the grow is nice and clean

3600
02:02:09,689 --> 02:02:14,069
let's [ __ ] keep it clean let's get in

3601
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,079
there with a mop and a broom every day

3602
02:02:14,069 --> 02:02:17,519
if we need to and mop and sweep that

3603
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:19,350
[ __ ] let's get in there with a shop vac

3604
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:20,940
and suck out you know that [ __ ] in the

3605
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:22,590
corner you've been looking at get the

3606
02:02:20,939 --> 02:02:24,629
[ __ ] shot back and back that out it's

3607
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:26,670
not gonna shot back itself that's a

3608
02:02:24,630 --> 02:02:28,380
great place for a spider mite to hang

3609
02:02:26,670 --> 02:02:30,480
out that's a great place for some aphids

3610
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:32,609
to hang out and breed it's a great place

3611
02:02:30,479 --> 02:02:35,309
for some powdery mildew to start that is

3612
02:02:32,609 --> 02:02:36,929
just a vector for problems so now that

3613
02:02:35,310 --> 02:02:38,730
you've got it nice and clean don't be

3614
02:02:36,929 --> 02:02:39,779
lazy get in there and clean it as often

3615
02:02:38,729 --> 02:02:42,209
as you can

3616
02:02:39,779 --> 02:02:44,849
they say that cleanliness is godliness

3617
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:46,920
and I think that most applies in

3618
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:48,719
kitchens and grow rooms you guys so

3619
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:50,909
clean up a grow room give yourself a

3620
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:52,980
nice clean environment give your plants

3621
02:02:50,909 --> 02:02:54,479
a nice healthy start I think your plants

3622
02:02:52,979 --> 02:02:56,488
will be more comfortable and I think you

3623
02:02:54,479 --> 02:02:58,829
will also notice working in a cleaner

3624
02:02:56,488 --> 02:02:59,369
more organized environment will make you

3625
02:02:58,829 --> 02:03:01,050
happier

3626
02:02:59,369 --> 02:03:03,599
it'll make you faster and more

3627
02:03:01,050 --> 02:03:05,190
productive [ __ ] now that you're done

3628
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:06,719
cleaning up the grow room why don't you

3629
02:03:05,189 --> 02:03:08,939
clean up all your supplies go organize

3630
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:11,010
your nutrients go organize the

3631
02:03:08,939 --> 02:03:12,988
pesticides the measuring devices your

3632
02:03:11,010 --> 02:03:14,670
cleaning supplies go write down a list

3633
02:03:12,988 --> 02:03:16,379
of anything that you can need anything

3634
02:03:14,670 --> 02:03:19,380
that you're low on go get yourself

3635
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:22,560
organized also get a notebook and start

3636
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:24,420
making detailed notes start documenting

3637
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:26,250
when you changed your bulb start

3638
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:28,949
documenting when you change your carbon

3639
02:03:26,250 --> 02:03:30,630
filter start documenting the last time

3640
02:03:28,948 --> 02:03:32,789
you change your air conditioner filters

3641
02:03:30,630 --> 02:03:34,140
had calibrated your meters start writing

3642
02:03:32,789 --> 02:03:35,519
that stuff down so that when something

3643
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:37,770
comes up you can look in there and go oh

3644
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:39,120
that's why my pH meter isn't work and I

3645
02:03:37,770 --> 02:03:41,460
haven't calibrated the [ __ ] thing in

3646
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:43,079
two months you may find some things you

3647
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:44,279
were slipping on if you start taking

3648
02:03:43,079 --> 02:03:46,350
more notes

3649
02:03:44,279 --> 02:03:48,359

funky aroma I can't find the right words

3762

to describe it it is gross it is funky

3763
02:07:43,158 --> 02:07:48,109
and it is sweet spicy and sour and

3764
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:49,880
delicious all at the same time I really

3765

gelato cake batter all right podcast

3775
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:13,489
world if you've been following along you

3776
02:08:11,689 --> 02:08:16,099
know that I've been doing a long series

3777
02:08:13,488 --> 02:08:17,988
of grow lessons in a previous episode I

3778
02:08:16,099 --> 02:08:20,809
mentioned that those lessons were over

3779
02:08:17,988 --> 02:08:23,388
well I was wrong since that time I

3780
02:08:20,809 --> 02:08:25,998
realized I left out a very crucial part

3781
02:08:23,389 --> 02:08:28,729
of our grow experience we started off by

3782
02:08:25,998 --> 02:08:30,469
making a solid plan for our grow we

3783
02:08:28,729 --> 02:08:32,479
thought out our equipment we thought out

3784
02:08:30,469 --> 02:08:35,269
our space very well we thought out our

3785
02:08:32,479 --> 02:08:37,789
genetics hopefully we successfully ran a

3786
02:08:35,269 --> 02:08:40,010
full garden cycle we have harvested we

3787
02:08:37,788 --> 02:08:42,259
have dried and cured that product we've

3788
02:08:40,010 --> 02:08:44,269
got some beautifully trimmed up buds you

3789
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:45,530
know the one thing I left out we never

3790
02:08:44,269 --> 02:08:47,960
smoked this

3791
02:08:45,529 --> 02:08:50,029
so this episode is going to be the smoke

3792
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:52,189
that [ __ ] episode we've ran a full

3793
02:08:50,029 --> 02:08:54,439
garden let's reward ourselves and enjoy

3794
02:08:52,189 --> 02:08:56,389
our finished product there's really

3795
02:08:54,439 --> 02:08:57,829
nothing like smoking your own product

3796
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:59,210
any flowers that you've grown harvested

3797
02:08:57,829 --> 02:09:00,679
trimmed you spent a bunch of time with

3798
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:02,600
it you've really got some attachment to

3799
02:09:00,679 --> 02:09:04,880
it there's really a rewarding feeling

3800
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:07,100
that comes with smoking a crop that you

3801
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:09,319
grew I've been growing for quite a while

3802
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:11,750
I've grown many many small personal

3803
02:09:09,319 --> 02:09:14,269
crops I have grown many large commercial

3804
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:16,250
crops I've done a lot of Fino hunts of

3805
02:09:14,270 --> 02:09:18,679
plants that I have bred I have grown a

3806
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:21,229
lot of plants and it is still very

3807
02:09:18,679 --> 02:09:23,060
exciting to me to get to try the first

3808
02:09:21,229 --> 02:09:24,649
little batch of smoke from each crop

3809
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:27,260
that I grow there's something very

3810
02:09:24,649 --> 02:09:29,329
rewarding and very satisfying and very

3811
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:31,070
funny I feels like a kid inside like a

3812
02:09:29,329 --> 02:09:32,448
kid on Christmas morning I get to try my

3813
02:09:31,069 --> 02:09:34,309
new thing you know let's see what it's

3814
02:09:32,448 --> 02:09:36,409
like I spent all this time with it and I

3815
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:38,539
finally get to enjoy it every time I do

3816
02:09:36,409 --> 02:09:40,609
it especially something that I've just

3817
02:09:38,539 --> 02:09:42,500
bred and it's his first run with it

3818
02:09:40,609 --> 02:09:44,238
so I bred something I made some seeds I

3819
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:46,189
grew those seeds out I Fino hunted those

3820
02:09:44,238 --> 02:09:48,829
seeds I know I finally have a finished

3821
02:09:46,189 --> 02:09:51,198
product that is real satisfaction to me

3822
02:09:48,829 --> 02:09:52,939
there's nothing like that feeling so

3823
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:55,159
this may be your first time getting to

3824
02:09:52,939 --> 02:09:57,589
enjoy this experience I want this to be

3825
02:09:55,159 --> 02:09:59,840
a great experience for you I want every

3826
02:09:57,590 --> 02:10:02,510
harvest to be a wonderful experience for

3827
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:04,640
you there's one thing they can really

3828
02:10:02,510 --> 02:10:06,350
ruin your experience when it comes to

3829
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:08,480
testing your cannabis for the first time

3830
02:10:06,350 --> 02:10:11,030
the one thing that can really [ __ ] it up

3831
02:10:08,479 --> 02:10:12,829
is by being impatient if you cut down

3832
02:10:11,029 --> 02:10:15,198
your plants too early they aren't going

3833
02:10:12,829 --> 02:10:17,510
to be the quality you deserve if you

3834
02:10:15,198 --> 02:10:19,219
dried and cured your plants in a rushing

3835
02:10:17,510 --> 02:10:21,860
manner you are not going to get the

3836
02:10:19,219 --> 02:10:23,899
quality that you deserve so make sure

3837
02:10:21,859 --> 02:10:26,238
those plants got to finish

3838
02:10:23,899 --> 02:10:28,670
make sure your plants were flushed make

3839
02:10:26,238 --> 02:10:31,399
sure they were harvested dried and cured

3840
02:10:28,670 --> 02:10:33,859
and trimmed correctly let's not try to

3841
02:10:31,399 --> 02:10:36,139
smoke our first crop too early and put a

3842
02:10:33,859 --> 02:10:38,000
bad taste in our mouth literally about

3843
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:39,679
our new crop you're gonna take a bud

3844
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,060
you're gonna dry it fast you're gonna

3845
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:42,350
try to smoke it it's gonna taste like

3846
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:43,880
[ __ ] and you're gonna feel like [ __ ]

3847
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:45,140
about your whole crop you're gonna have

3848
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:47,929
just a bad feeling about it

3849
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:50,179
you spent all this time be patient let

3850
02:10:47,929 --> 02:10:51,980
each bud be ready before you smoke them

3851
02:10:50,179 --> 02:10:53,569
so the first thing we need to test

3852
02:10:51,979 --> 02:10:56,419
before we get down to smoking this

3853
02:10:53,569 --> 02:10:57,929
product is is it ready is it dry enough

3854
02:10:56,420 --> 02:11:00,119
have you dried and cured

3855
02:10:57,929 --> 02:11:01,859
this product properly before we go

3856
02:11:00,119 --> 02:11:03,988
putting it in a grinder and try to roll

3857
02:11:01,859 --> 02:11:07,109
it up or put it in a pipe it is

3858
02:11:03,988 --> 02:11:09,569
acceptable for a cured herb to be kind

3859
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:11,698
of sticky and a little bit moist that is

3860
02:11:09,569 --> 02:11:13,380
the way a lot of people like it you

3861
02:11:11,698 --> 02:11:15,059
don't get a lot of that in the Colorado

3862
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:16,980
area because we have what is known as

3863
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:19,170
the Colorado crunch here and I do plan

3864
02:11:16,979 --> 02:11:21,149
to do a podcast all about the Colorado

3865
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:22,949
crunch in the future but let's stay

3866
02:11:21,149 --> 02:11:24,929
focused let's talk about your dried and

3867
02:11:22,948 --> 02:11:26,369
cured herb before we smoked it it may be

3868
02:11:24,929 --> 02:11:28,408
a little spongy it may be a little

3869
02:11:26,369 --> 02:11:29,819
sticky if you have cured it properly

3870
02:11:28,408 --> 02:11:31,469
that is okay

3871
02:11:29,819 --> 02:11:33,658
you may need to take a couple of nugs

3872
02:11:31,469 --> 02:11:36,119
out of the jar and set them on the table

3873
02:11:33,658 --> 02:11:39,089
for three four maybe five or six hours

3874
02:11:36,119 --> 02:11:41,579
before you decide to smoke it is not

3875
02:11:39,090 --> 02:11:44,550
uncommon to see a connoisseur smoker

3876
02:11:41,579 --> 02:11:46,979
pull out his jar of nugs crack the lid

3877
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:47,550
take out three or four nuggets set him

3878
02:11:46,979 --> 02:11:49,619
on the table

3879
02:11:47,550 --> 02:11:51,510
seal the jar up put it back in his

3880
02:11:49,619 --> 02:11:53,399
little stash spot and then leave those

3881
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:55,409
nuggets on the table throughout the day

3882
02:11:53,399 --> 02:11:58,079
and that's what we smoked on as the day

3883
02:11:55,408 --> 02:11:59,879
goes by they may be a little bit damp as

3884
02:11:58,079 --> 02:12:01,890
soon as we pull them out of the jar but

3885
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:04,409
as the day goes on they're gonna dry out

3886
02:12:01,890 --> 02:12:07,710
perfectly to roll a fat joint and pack a

3887
02:12:04,408 --> 02:12:10,710
couple of bowls so make sure your herb

3888
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:12,929
is cured and dry enough to burn properly

3889
02:12:10,710 --> 02:12:15,359
so you don't disappoint yourself with

3890
02:12:12,929 --> 02:12:16,980
your first experience now if you're

3891
02:12:15,359 --> 02:12:19,319
confident that your buds are dried and

3892
02:12:16,979 --> 02:12:21,539
cured and ready for consumption let's

3893
02:12:19,319 --> 02:12:24,869
talk about taking that first taste test

3894
02:12:21,539 --> 02:12:26,789
of our new crop for me testing a new

3895
02:12:24,869 --> 02:12:29,819
product is sort of a combination between

3896
02:12:26,789 --> 02:12:32,158
a science experiment and a ritual I like

3897
02:12:29,819 --> 02:12:34,439
to be in my environment I like to use my

3898
02:12:32,158 --> 02:12:37,139
equipment I like to know what to expect

3899
02:12:34,439 --> 02:12:39,389
I like to take away variables that way I

3900
02:12:37,140 --> 02:12:41,369
can see what the actual product is

3901
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:43,020
telling me now I know that may sound

3902
02:12:41,369 --> 02:12:45,479
weird to some people but a lot of

3903
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:47,190
stoners are very ritualistic and by

3904
02:12:45,479 --> 02:12:49,709
ritualistic I don't mean some fancy

3905
02:12:47,189 --> 02:12:51,299
ceremony I just mean I like to be in a

3906
02:12:49,710 --> 02:12:53,609
certain place I like to be right here

3907
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:55,289
this is my comfortable smoking place if

3908
02:12:53,609 --> 02:12:57,359
you gave me a new concentrate if you

3909
02:12:55,289 --> 02:12:59,340
gave me some flour and you said I want

3910
02:12:57,359 --> 02:13:01,380
you to judge this or rate this this

3911
02:12:59,340 --> 02:13:03,869
would be the best place for me to

3912
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:06,029
conduct that experiment so that I could

3913
02:13:03,869 --> 02:13:07,679
give you a proper review this is where

3914
02:13:06,029 --> 02:13:09,750
I'm comfortable I know that the door is

3915
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:11,579
locked i know i can consume safely here

3916
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:13,560
I know that nobody can bother me here

3917
02:13:11,579 --> 02:13:15,449
I can control the environment here I can

3918
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:17,910
control the music here this is a great

3919
02:13:15,449 --> 02:13:19,590
place for myself to consume any type of

3920
02:13:17,909 --> 02:13:20,849
cannabis product I'm comfortable here

3957
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:29,579
together for the first time it's always

3958
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:31,829
fun to have your friends around also

3959
02:14:29,579 --> 02:14:33,269
that puts you on the spot maybe you

3960
02:14:31,829 --> 02:14:35,039
smoked it and it tastes like you just

3961
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:36,660
stuck your tongue in a light socket and

3962
02:14:35,039 --> 02:14:38,489
everyone's gonna get to smoke that with

3963
02:14:36,659 --> 02:14:40,229
you and experience it that's a learning

3964
02:14:38,489 --> 02:14:41,789
experience just be honest

3965
02:14:40,229 --> 02:14:43,049
go ahead and share with your friends see

3966
02:14:41,789 --> 02:14:44,939
what everybody thinks we're gonna talk

3967
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:47,010
more about that reaction in just a

3968
02:14:44,939 --> 02:14:48,899
minute another thing that is really fun

3969
02:14:47,010 --> 02:14:51,420
to involve your friends in is if you do

3970
02:14:48,899 --> 02:14:52,889
a Fino hunt so if you grew five seeds

3971
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:54,600
you've probably got five different

3972
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:56,579
phenotypes or maybe two or three

3973
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:59,250
different phenotypes to select from out

3974
02:14:56,579 --> 02:15:01,470
of those five it's always fun to load up

3975
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:02,640
five balls or roll five joints and label

3976
02:15:01,470 --> 02:15:04,110
them somehow right on the end of the

3977
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:06,300
filter right number one number two or

3978
02:15:04,109 --> 02:15:07,710
just remember and then smoke them with

3979
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:09,810
your friends and see if you guys like

3980
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:11,579
plant number one plant number two plant

3981
02:15:09,810 --> 02:15:13,680
number three better see if different

3982
02:15:11,579 --> 02:15:15,329
people in the room like number one or

3983
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:16,770
number three better maybe everybody in

3984
02:15:15,329 --> 02:15:19,289
the room says bro number five was

3985
02:15:16,770 --> 02:15:21,210
amazing that's always fun to bring your

3986
02:15:19,289 --> 02:15:23,340
friends around to consume with you to

3987
02:15:21,210 --> 02:15:25,510
see what you have just done so do you

3988
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:27,130
want your first try your ritual

3989
02:15:25,510 --> 02:15:28,360
do you want that to happen with friends

3990
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:30,699

3991
02:15:28,359 --> 02:15:32,559
little isolated situation I could go

3992
02:15:30,699 --> 02:15:34,510
both ways in my little comfort zone

3993
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:36,460
right here there are two chairs right in

3994
02:15:34,510 --> 02:15:38,170
front of me where Mike is always invited

3995
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:39,489
Kevin likes to take this spot right here

3996
02:15:38,170 --> 02:15:41,020
there are several other folks that come

3997
02:15:39,488 --> 02:15:42,488
over and smoke they're always invited

3998
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:43,780
that's always fun to me I've got a

3999
02:15:42,488 --> 02:15:45,669
couple other chairs we can pull out if

4000
02:15:43,779 --> 02:15:47,079
it gets crowded I like to smoke with

4001
02:15:45,670 --> 02:15:48,609
friends I don't know if you want to

4002
02:15:47,079 --> 02:15:50,680

4004
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:55,090
be your thing but think about that do

4005
02:15:52,899 --> 02:15:56,589

4006
02:15:55,090 --> 02:15:58,869

sampling your new product is make it

4008

02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:06,640
anything before that don't eat any

4010
02:16:04,149 --> 02:16:09,250
edibles before that go in totally sober

4011
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:12,579

4012

what your product has done to you so let

4013
02:16:12,579 --> 02:16:15,689
me back up a couple of steps I've gotten

4014
02:16:13,988 --> 02:16:18,069
ahead of myself let's start off by

4015
02:16:15,689 --> 02:16:20,049
grinding up our product once you were in

4016
02:16:18,069 --> 02:16:22,179

hand you're ready to rock the first

4019
02:16:24,369 --> 02:16:28,750
couple of things to consuming your new

4020
02:16:26,289 --> 02:16:30,279
flowers are a visual inspection let's

4021
02:16:28,750 --> 02:16:32,079
take a look at it let's look and see

4022
02:16:30,279 --> 02:16:34,119
what we've done let's enjoy the beauty

4023
02:16:32,079 --> 02:16:36,370
of this product what colors do you see

4024
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:38,050
did you trim it well could you trim it

4025
02:16:36,370 --> 02:16:40,360
better next time by looking at it

4026
02:16:38,049 --> 02:16:42,218
how did the trichomes look is that plant

4027
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:44,980
real frosty is it just kind of frosty

4028
02:16:42,218 --> 02:16:46,539
give it a nice look enjoy it smell it

4029
02:16:44,979 --> 02:16:49,000
hold it up to your face give it a nice

4030
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:51,070
smell enjoy that it is yours you put a

4031
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,450
lot of work into it I think the next

4032
02:16:51,069 --> 02:16:54,279
step is to give it a little bit of a

4033
02:16:52,450 --> 02:16:55,599
squeeze yeah you may break it up a

4034
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:57,280
little bit that's fine we're about to

4035
02:16:55,599 --> 02:16:59,440
put this in a grinder and smoke it we

4036
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:02,320
can destroy this but it is yours enjoy

4037
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:04,030
it so I'd give it a little squeeze how

4038
02:17:02,319 --> 02:17:05,739
moist is it do you think it's ready to

4039
02:17:04,030 --> 02:17:07,269
smoke is that ready are you gonna

4040
02:17:05,739 --> 02:17:08,709
embarrass yourself by trying to put that

4041
02:17:07,269 --> 02:17:10,300
in the pipe do you really need just

4042
02:17:08,709 --> 02:17:11,589
another day or two of curing that or

4043
02:17:10,299 --> 02:17:12,308
does it need to sit on the table for a

4044
02:17:11,590 --> 02:17:13,960
couple hours

4045
02:17:12,308 --> 02:17:15,518
is it ready this is your last chance

4046
02:17:13,959 --> 02:17:17,829
before you grind it up in front of your

4047
02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:19,899

4059
02:17:39,159 --> 02:17:43,059
let's enjoy this stuff let's not think

4060
02:17:41,350 --> 02:17:45,250
too much about how much did we harvest

4061
02:17:43,059 --> 02:17:47,709

4063
02:17:47,709 --> 02:17:51,729
grown let's enjoy the effort we made

4064
02:17:49,659 --> 02:17:53,829
that turned into a consumable product

4065
02:17:51,729 --> 02:17:57,250
that is beautiful that has a great aroma

4066
02:17:53,829 --> 02:17:59,319

4067
02:17:57,250 --> 02:18:02,139
and science all put together that you

4068
02:17:59,319 --> 02:18:03,129
did take a moment enjoy that [ __ ] so

4069
02:18:02,139 --> 02:18:05,889
smell it

4070
02:18:03,129 --> 02:18:08,589
break it up smell your fingers now it is

4071
02:18:05,889 --> 02:18:09,879
time to put it in a grinder when you put

4072
02:18:08,590 --> 02:18:12,520
it in the grinder and give it a couple

4073
02:18:09,879 --> 02:18:15,369
of turns if that grinder is really hard

4074
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:17,110
to spin your buds may be too wet when

4075
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:18,670
you open up that grinder if it's a

4076
02:18:17,110 --> 02:18:20,920
little moist in there you'll be able to

4077
02:18:18,670 --> 02:18:21,969
tell at this point if that one bud is a

4078
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:23,500
little bit too wet

4079
02:18:21,968 --> 02:18:25,359
you still need to let the rest of the

4080
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:27,579
buds dry and cure just a little bit

4081
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:29,350
longer don't worry you can dry them a

4082
02:18:27,579 --> 02:18:31,569
little bit more and you will be just

4083
02:18:29,350 --> 02:18:33,429
fine now if you feel like the bud that

4084
02:18:31,569 --> 02:18:35,619
you have ground up is ready to consume

go to smoke a bong load and the water

4118
02:19:33,968 --> 02:19:38,049
looks like muck and I will not smoke a

4119
02:19:35,829 --> 02:19:40,120
bowl so just change the bong water clean

4120

4126
02:19:49,209 --> 02:19:52,569

4127
02:19:50,739 --> 02:19:53,289
joint rolled you've got a bong load

4128
02:19:52,569 --> 02:19:55,449
packed

4129
02:19:53,290 --> 02:19:57,130
you've got a pipe loaded maybe you

4130
02:19:55,450 --> 02:19:59,021
filled up the vaporizer maybe you've got

4131
02:19:57,129 --> 02:20:01,599
a volcano bag going on however you

4132
02:19:59,021 --> 02:20:05,021
decided to do it now it is time to take

4133
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:07,780
our first puff of our freshly dried and

4134
02:20:05,021 --> 02:20:09,640
cured cannabis crop like I said earlier

4135
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:10,960
I recommend this being your first puff

4136
02:20:09,639 --> 02:20:14,319
of the day that way you know exactly

4137
02:20:10,959 --> 02:20:16,299
what your herb does to you we have now

4138
02:20:14,319 --> 02:20:19,659
come to my favorite part of the entire

4139
02:20:16,299 --> 02:20:22,770
process it is now time to smoke the

4140
02:20:19,659 --> 02:20:25,271
first sample of our newly harvested crop

4141
02:20:22,771 --> 02:20:27,100
so if you rolled up a joint now is the

4142
02:20:25,271 --> 02:20:28,780
time to spark it up if you packed up a

4143
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:30,309
bowl now is the time to start taking a

4144
02:20:28,780 --> 02:20:32,230
couple of puffs if you've got the

4145
02:20:30,309 --> 02:20:34,359
vaporizer going now's the time to start

4146
02:20:32,229 --> 02:20:35,920
taking a couple of pools take a couple

4147
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:37,870
of pools a couple of draws a couple of

4148
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:39,639
totes off your new product and sit back

4149
02:20:37,870 --> 02:20:42,160
for a couple of seconds and let it sit

4150
02:20:39,639 --> 02:20:43,779
in and see what it does to you I don't

4151
02:20:42,159 --> 02:20:45,190
know how much you consume but depending

4152
02:20:43,780 --> 02:20:47,560
on your consumption level you should

4153
02:20:45,190 --> 02:20:48,970
probably be able to take two three maybe

4154
02:20:47,559 --> 02:20:50,229
four good draws or whatever you're

4155
02:20:48,969 --> 02:20:51,789
smoking on if you're smoking a joint

4156
02:20:50,229 --> 02:20:53,739
maybe two or three good draws if you're

4157
02:20:51,790 --> 02:20:55,300
smoking a bowl maybe two or three maybe

4158
02:20:53,739 --> 02:20:56,409
three or four good puffs off of that if

4159
02:20:55,299 --> 02:20:57,909
you're hitting the ball hopefully you

4160
02:20:56,409 --> 02:20:59,920
only need one or two good bong rips

4161
02:20:57,909 --> 02:21:01,719
before you start feeling it I find

4162
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:03,610
vaporizers to be unpredictable I never

4163
02:21:01,719 --> 02:21:05,799
know if I'm gonna need 1 or 6 pools off

4164
02:21:03,610 --> 02:21:07,510
the vaporizer but take as many as you're

4165
02:21:05,799 --> 02:21:09,309
comfortable with get a little buzz on

4166
02:21:07,510 --> 02:21:12,309
and sit back for a couple of seconds and

4167
02:21:09,309 --> 02:21:14,109
just see what happens are you stoned did

4168
02:21:12,309 --> 02:21:16,569
you get mallow did you get low are you

4169
02:21:14,110 --> 02:21:19,090
high did you get giggly and goofy are

4170
02:21:16,569 --> 02:21:21,129
you paranoid you have the munchies how

4171
02:21:19,090 --> 02:21:22,630
do you feel give it a couple of seconds

4172
02:21:21,129 --> 02:21:24,489
if you've got other friends in the room

4173
02:21:22,629 --> 02:21:25,599
start conversation you guys will start

4174
02:21:24,489 --> 02:21:27,399
talking about the product you start

4175
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:28,271
talking about the herb somebody will

4176
02:21:27,399 --> 02:21:29,819
mention the taste

4177
02:21:28,271 --> 02:21:32,500
somebody will mention the aroma

4178
02:21:29,819 --> 02:21:35,079
conversation will start pay attention to

4179
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:36,850
how your friends react to your herb make

4180
02:21:35,079 --> 02:21:39,010
a mental note of what you think of the

4181
02:21:36,850 --> 02:21:40,600
herb do you like it do you like the

4182
02:21:39,010 --> 02:21:42,399
aroma do you like the flavor

4183
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:44,890
do you like the buzz that you've gotten

4184
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:46,510
from the way you've consumed it now it

4185
02:21:44,889 --> 02:21:48,849
may be time to take a couple of more

4186
02:21:46,510 --> 02:21:50,319
puffs and go to the next level now what

4187
02:21:48,850 --> 02:21:52,390
do you think now that you've pushed it a

4188
02:21:50,319 --> 02:21:54,129
little bit how do you feel now are you

4189
02:21:52,389 --> 02:21:55,689
super stoned or you stuck to the couch

4190
02:21:54,129 --> 02:21:57,609
or Eve flying off the couch and just

4191
02:21:55,690 --> 02:21:59,649
hanging on for dear life how does it

4192
02:21:57,610 --> 02:22:02,319
making you feel how's it acting to your

4193
02:21:59,649 --> 02:22:03,940
friends are they lit are they bored see

4194
02:22:02,319 --> 02:22:05,689
how they're enjoying it pay attention to

4195
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:07,248
the words that they're saying and try to

4196
02:22:05,689 --> 02:22:09,949
make a mental note of their review of

4197
02:22:07,248 --> 02:22:12,170
your product now let's talk about a few

4198
02:22:09,949 --> 02:22:13,609
things to look for while you are smoking

4199
02:22:12,170 --> 02:22:15,590
your first sample let's look for some

4200
02:22:13,609 --> 02:22:17,959
things about the product to pay

4201
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:20,478
attention to how does your product burn

4202
02:22:17,959 --> 02:22:22,459
does it burn smoothly did it burn like a

4203
02:22:20,478 --> 02:22:24,828
charcoal briquette or did it burn a nice

4204
02:22:22,459 --> 02:22:26,539
white ash if the ash that you knocked

4205
02:22:24,828 --> 02:22:27,828
off the end of your joint or that chunk

4206
02:22:26,539 --> 02:22:29,810
that you dumped out of your bowl at the

4207
02:22:27,828 --> 02:22:31,309
end if that was chunky in black you may

4208
02:22:29,809 --> 02:22:33,109
not have flushed your product long

4209
02:22:31,309 --> 02:22:35,930
enough you may want a longer flush time

4210
02:22:33,109 --> 02:22:38,238
also you may not have dried it properly

4211
02:22:35,930 --> 02:22:40,068
it may still be a little bit wet if it's

4212
02:22:38,238 --> 02:22:42,109
not burning properly it could still be a

4213
02:22:40,068 --> 02:22:44,828
little moist and it needs more dry time

4214
02:22:42,109 --> 02:22:48,199
so pay attention to how it burns also

4215
02:22:44,828 --> 02:22:50,299
how does it smoke is the smoke nice and

4216
02:22:48,199 --> 02:22:52,699
smooth is that smoke thick and harsh

4217
02:22:50,299 --> 02:22:54,978
does it hurt your throat does it make

4218
02:22:52,699 --> 02:22:56,720
you cough or can you just toke on it all

4219
02:22:54,978 --> 02:22:58,670
day and blow clouds and it doesn't

4220
02:22:56,719 --> 02:23:00,078
bother your lungs and throat at all pay

4221
02:22:58,670 --> 02:23:02,600
attention to that you can make

4222
02:23:00,078 --> 02:23:05,538
improvements in your next grow based on

4223
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:07,908
the quality of this product how is the

4224
02:23:05,539 --> 02:23:10,100
flavor how is the aroma are those things

4225
02:23:07,908 --> 02:23:13,100
on point because if the flavor and aroma

4226
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:15,498
and burn factor are not on point you can

4227
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:17,899
absolutely correct those in your next

4228
02:23:15,498 --> 02:23:19,189
grow I was talking about paying

4229
02:23:17,898 --> 02:23:21,408
attention to what your friends say

4230
02:23:19,189 --> 02:23:23,270
because they are going to be honest with

4231
02:23:21,408 --> 02:23:24,978
you you're going to be very proud of

4232
02:23:23,270 --> 02:23:26,328
your crop you spent a lot of time on

4233
02:23:24,978 --> 02:23:28,309
this you're going to think it is the

4234
02:23:26,328 --> 02:23:30,260
best herb you've ever smoked that is a

4235
02:23:28,309 --> 02:23:33,139
very natural thing for new growers

4236
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:35,328
to experience listen to your friends

4237
02:23:33,139 --> 02:23:38,028
they smoke a lot of herb also they're

4238
02:23:35,328 --> 02:23:40,309
going to have very influential feedback

4239
02:23:38,029 --> 02:23:42,050
don't let their criticism hurt your

4240
02:23:40,309 --> 02:23:43,309
feelings you're going to take their

4241
02:23:42,049 --> 02:23:45,498
compliments when one of your friends

4242
02:23:43,309 --> 02:23:47,448
says brother this [ __ ] smells so good I

4243
02:23:45,498 --> 02:23:49,879
can't believe you grew this you're gonna

4244
02:23:47,449 --> 02:23:51,920
glow when the other guy says bro this

4245
02:23:49,879 --> 02:23:54,318
kind of burns my throat you have to take

4246
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:57,049
that compliment just as strongly as you

4247
02:23:54,318 --> 02:23:58,879
did or that criticism as strongly as you

4248
02:23:57,049 --> 02:24:01,879
did that compliment they both matter

4249
02:23:58,879 --> 02:24:03,828
equally so use the compliment as a

4250
02:24:01,879 --> 02:24:06,259
driving force to move you forward use

4251
02:24:03,828 --> 02:24:08,449
the criticism as a way to improve your

4252
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:09,889
crop next time don't be hurt when one of

4253
02:24:08,449 --> 02:24:11,420
your friend says bro that weed burns my

4254
02:24:09,889 --> 02:24:13,189
throat that's cuz you did something

4255
02:24:11,420 --> 02:24:14,689
wrong and you need to improve and he was

4256
02:24:13,189 --> 02:24:15,700
honest with you because he's a good

4257
02:24:14,689 --> 02:24:17,139
friend

4258
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:18,640
I mentioned earlier that some of the

4259
02:24:17,139 --> 02:24:20,559
things that you may need to improve that

4260
02:24:18,639 --> 02:24:22,930
you'll notice right away are your flush

4261
02:24:20,559 --> 02:24:25,180
how is that product burning again is it

4262
02:24:22,930 --> 02:24:27,489
a dark chunk or is it a nice white clean

4263
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:29,319
ash does it burn all the way through the

4264
02:24:27,489 --> 02:24:31,449
joint or do you need to keep relighting

4265
02:24:29,319 --> 02:24:33,100
it if it's burning real black and chunky

4266
02:24:31,450 --> 02:24:35,439
and you need to keep relighting it you

4267
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:36,880
probably needed to flush longer if it

4268
02:24:35,439 --> 02:24:38,680
just keeps going out but it's not

4269
02:24:36,879 --> 02:24:40,599
burning real black it may just be too

4270
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:43,300
wet and you need to dry and cure it a

4271
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:45,760
little bit longer how is your cure

4272
02:24:43,299 --> 02:24:47,590
process does the herb taste good does it

4273
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:50,260
smell good is it crunchy

4274
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:52,540
is it dry is it moist did you dry and

4275
02:24:50,260 --> 02:24:53,950
cure it to your liking do your friends

4276
02:24:52,540 --> 02:24:55,840
think you dried and cured it properly

4277
02:24:53,950 --> 02:24:57,670
what do you think as long as you're

4278
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:59,079
happy that's what matters as long as you

4279
02:24:57,670 --> 02:25:01,600
were consuming it if it's going to

4280
02:24:59,079 --> 02:25:03,659
market it's got to satisfy the market so

4281
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:06,340
pay attention to what the market says

4282
02:25:03,659 --> 02:25:08,619
also how did you trim it are you

4283
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:11,170
satisfied with the trim are your clients

4284
02:25:08,620 --> 02:25:13,420
satisfied with the trim maybe you can

4285
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:16,360
improve on the trim a lot of new growers

4286
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:17,799
don't trim enough in my opinion you

4287
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:20,200
could go a little bit harder on your

4288
02:25:17,799 --> 02:25:21,849
trim job now that you were consuming the

4289
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:23,800
product and you can actually tell what

4290
02:25:21,850 --> 02:25:25,120
type of buzz it gives you do you think

4291
02:25:23,799 --> 02:25:26,889
you should have flowered a little bit

4292
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:29,650
longer or do you think you should have

4293
02:25:26,889 --> 02:25:31,299
flowered a little bit shorter if you pay

4294
02:25:29,649 --> 02:25:33,489
attention to the finished product and

4295
02:25:31,299 --> 02:25:35,199
how things came out this time if you

4296
02:25:33,489 --> 02:25:37,119
took plenty of notes throughout the grow

4297
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:38,740
you can look at your notes you can look

4298
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:40,390
at your finished product and you can see

4299
02:25:38,739 --> 02:25:42,430
things that you can improve for the next

4300
02:25:40,389 --> 02:25:44,619
run which will make you a better grower

4301
02:25:42,430 --> 02:25:46,540
so take all of those compliments and

4302
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:48,670
take all of that criticism and ball it

4303
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:51,250
all up into one big learning lesson and

4304
02:25:48,670 --> 02:25:53,799
think of ways to improve your crop next

4305
02:25:51,250 --> 02:25:55,450
time now the overall deciding factor on

4306
02:25:53,799 --> 02:25:57,879
the quality of this product is how do

4307
02:25:55,450 --> 02:26:00,159
you feel do you like it were you going

4308
02:25:57,879 --> 02:26:01,899
for a low couch lock kind of a buzz or

4309
02:26:00,159 --> 02:26:03,909
were you going for a big psychedelic

4310
02:26:01,899 --> 02:26:04,659
head spinning high and did you get what

4311
02:26:03,909 --> 02:26:06,579
you were after

4312
02:26:04,659 --> 02:26:08,590
do you think if you would have let that

4313
02:26:06,579 --> 02:26:10,270
plant flower a little bit longer that

4314
02:26:08,590 --> 02:26:11,469
you would have gotten better quality do

4315
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:13,420
you think maybe you would have gotten a

4316
02:26:11,469 --> 02:26:14,949
fatter yield do you think maybe if you

4317
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:16,510
have chopped it a little later that it

4318
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:18,220
may have started to diminish the flavor

4319
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:20,020
do you think if you were to cut it a

4320
02:26:18,219 --> 02:26:21,728
little bit earlier that it would have

4321
02:26:20,020 --> 02:26:23,560
been a little more head buzzy and a

4322
02:26:21,728 --> 02:26:25,000
little bit racier there are things to

4323
02:26:23,559 --> 02:26:26,889
think about as you were testing the

4324
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:29,200
final product are you satisfied with

4325
02:26:26,889 --> 02:26:31,029
your finished product is the bottom line

4326
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:32,680
if you're satisfied don't change a thing

4327
02:26:31,030 --> 02:26:35,050
if there are things that you're not

4328
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:37,180
satisfied with look at your notes and

4329
02:26:35,049 --> 02:26:40,209
think of ways that you can improve those

4330
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:41,979
things for your next run now I started

4331
02:26:40,209 --> 02:26:44,169
off our little science experiment slash

4332
02:26:41,978 --> 02:26:45,609
ritual of testing our first crop by

4333
02:26:44,170 --> 02:26:48,760
sitting in our little comfortable

4334
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:50,770
environment cannabis consumers stoners

4335
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:53,110
pot heads whatever you want to call us

4336
02:26:50,770 --> 02:26:55,300
I'm okay with all of the above we have

4337
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:57,189
this tendency to smoke and get trapped

4338
02:26:55,299 --> 02:26:58,599
in our little spot we don't want to go

4339
02:26:57,189 --> 02:27:00,430
anywhere we're nice and comfortable here

4340
02:26:58,600 --> 02:27:02,110
like I said earlier the music is just

4341
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:04,780
right the air-conditioner is just right

4342
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:06,460
the fridge is full of snacks my bros are

4343
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:08,860
right here at the table why would I want

4344
02:27:06,459 --> 02:27:10,869
to go anywhere why because when you step

4345
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:12,819
out of this little comfort zone you may

4346
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:15,490
be twice as stoned as you even noticed

4347
02:27:12,819 --> 02:27:18,010
it's really easy to smoke a whole bunch

4348
02:27:15,489 --> 02:27:19,239
of product and sit here and be blazed

4349
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:21,460
out of your mind to be comfortable

4350
02:27:19,239 --> 02:27:22,689
because this is the zone you know where

4351
02:27:21,459 --> 02:27:24,009
everything is I know there's a drink

4352
02:27:22,689 --> 02:27:25,239
right here I know the dad rig is right

4353
02:27:24,010 --> 02:27:27,460
here I know the pen is right here I know

4354
02:27:25,239 --> 02:27:30,369
where everything is there's no chaos

4355
02:27:27,459 --> 02:27:32,469
right here maybe go somewhere go for a

4356
02:27:30,370 --> 02:27:34,600
walk maybe call an uber and have them

4357
02:27:32,469 --> 02:27:36,129
take you to the mall or to the park just

4358
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:37,840
go somewhere just get out of the house

4359
02:27:36,129 --> 02:27:39,759
maybe just go get some food some more

4360
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:41,620
with your bros and just get out of the

4361
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:43,478
house while your freshly buzzed on that

4362
02:27:41,620 --> 02:27:45,220
fresh new product and see what kind of

4363
02:27:43,478 --> 02:27:47,170
brand new experiences the world brings

4364
02:27:45,219 --> 02:27:49,329
to you out there there's this thing

4365
02:27:47,170 --> 02:27:51,100
about stoners that once you smoke you've

4366
02:27:49,329 --> 02:27:52,600
got about 10 minutes if you don't get up

4367
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:54,909
and leave in ten minutes you're [ __ ]

4368
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:56,439
stuck wherever you just smoke so smoke a

4369
02:27:54,909 --> 02:27:58,239
little bit if you're comfortable just

4370
02:27:56,439 --> 02:28:00,460
hanging out at the house do that see

4371
02:27:58,239 --> 02:28:02,350
what you experience but next time take a

4372
02:28:00,459 --> 02:28:04,359
few puffs of that new product call an

4373
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:06,069
uber and go some more exciting and see

4374
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:07,390
what life brings you you may get into

4375
02:28:06,069 --> 02:28:09,309

4376

all right podcast world that is my talk

4377
02:28:09,309 --> 02:28:13,779
about sampling and trying our freshly

4378
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:15,399
harvested cannabis crop I hope you had

4379
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:17,130
as much fun as I did I hope you learned

4380
02:28:15,399 --> 02:28:19,539
something if you found this episode

need to become a patron will be right

4388
02:28:31,239 --> 02:28:35,350
there on the screen just so you know I

4389
02:28:33,189 --> 02:28:37,239
use the funding from patreon for things

4390
02:28:35,350 --> 02:28:39,610
like keeping the website alive I do host

4391
02:28:37,239 --> 02:28:41,559
a website I read genetics Colorado comm

4392
02:28:39,610 --> 02:28:42,790
is my website that is where the podcast

4393
02:28:41,559 --> 02:28:44,439
is hosted that's how

4394
02:28:42,790 --> 02:28:46,570
able to keep the podcast coming to you

4395
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:48,640
for free it does cost me a little bit of

4396
02:28:46,569 --> 02:28:50,350
money to host the website every year so

4397
02:28:48,639 --> 02:28:52,989
I do pay for that out of the patreon

4398
02:28:50,350 --> 02:28:55,239
contributions I also use last year's

4399
02:28:52,989 --> 02:28:57,069
patreon contributions to fund the

4400
02:28:55,239 --> 02:28:59,350
MacBook that I am using to record the

4401
02:28:57,069 --> 02:29:00,850
show on right now I also use some of the

4402
02:28:59,350 --> 02:29:02,530
patreon funding for a little microphone

4403
02:29:00,850 --> 02:29:04,120
covers and for equipment that breaks

4404
02:29:02,530 --> 02:29:06,190
occasionally I've had to replace this

4405
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:08,140
headphone amp a couple of times I buy

4406
02:29:06,190 --> 02:29:09,850
memory cards and things like that with

4407
02:29:08,139 --> 02:29:12,189
the funding from patreon so it mainly

4408
02:29:09,850 --> 02:29:14,079
pays for the podcast and the equipment

4409
02:29:12,190 --> 02:29:15,760
and the little microphone covers so I

4410
02:29:14,079 --> 02:29:17,590
want to thank you guys for contributing

4411
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:19,840
