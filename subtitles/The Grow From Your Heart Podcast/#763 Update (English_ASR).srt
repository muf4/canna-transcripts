180
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,240
years when the uh the plague happened

181
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,639
the pandemic happened everybody kind of

182
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,280
took a break and slowed down i doubled

183
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,199
my speed i went from an audio podcast to

184
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,038
a video podcast i really stepped up to

185
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,639
see business because i was stuck at home

186
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,038
i couldn't go do my other jobs that i

187
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,319
had so i really focused in on this stuff

188
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,000
and i didn't take a break a lot of

189
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,280
people did get to slow down take a break

190
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
a lot of people were forced to take a

191
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,000
break this uh this sickness this virus

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,079
that i caught was kind of uh

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,680
it was a sort of a force for me to slow

194
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,199
down and take a break to see what really

195
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,519
needs to be done what doesn't need to be

196
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,038
done what order of priority [ __ ] matter

197
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,038
so it did kind of show me some things

198
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,879
the priorities are still the podcast

199
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,879
don't worry it's not going away

200
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,000
but a good quality show is very
