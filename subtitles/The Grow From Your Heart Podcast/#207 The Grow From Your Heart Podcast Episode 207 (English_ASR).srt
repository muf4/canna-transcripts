ambrosia is there live resin line they

26
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,519
they call it ambrosia to differentiate

27
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,070
themselves to separate themselves from

28
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:18,099
the market their ambrosia line is always

29
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:20,769

it's fairly priced it gets me well

32
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,799
medicated this lemon Jeffrey tastes so

33
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:28,299
good you guys it saw and almost smells

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,709
like a scented candle in the room sorry

35
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,939
for the abrupt drop in music they're all

36
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:33,159
explaining that here in just a second

37
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:35,019
kind of smells like a lemon candle in

38
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,429
the room are like some lemon heads in a

39
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:38,439
package this the aroma is so

40
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,630
overwhelming and then now when you take

41
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,640
a DAB it just coats your mouth that

42
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:44,739
lemon candy flavor just coats your mouth

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,439
and then you get this amazing like a

44
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:49,060
freakin just a head high that you could

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,170
not believe it makes it hard to think it

46
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,469
makes it hard to focus it makes

47
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,609

Colorado Springs while you're there

63
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:28,840
they're not too far apart all right so I

64
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:31,030
turn down the music really quickly let

65
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,849
me explain something about that holy

66
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:37,060
[ __ ] I came home from work and my little

67
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:39,219
recording area my recording table had a

68
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,709
nice puddle of water all over it luckily

69
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:43,329
this oil slick pad has saved so much

70
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,400
[ __ ] one time the email came on

71
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,689
while the coil was sitting on the table

72
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,599
and it heated up the oil slick pad it

73
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:52,090
did not burn the table this time I had a

74
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,400
roof leak oh so there's a chandelier

75
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,640
just above my table where I record and

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,680
there was it there have been [ __ ]

77
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,509
thunderstorms you guys rain storms hail

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,650
storms thunderstorms for the past month

79
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:04,870
I'm sure you've heard me talk about it

80
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,209
on the podcast we've had random power

81
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,069
outages the Wi-Fi and cable have been

82
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,748
out a lot lately it's been

83
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:13,208
kinda sketchy trying to rely on

84
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:14,650
electricity and Wi-Fi but the rain has

85
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,180
been here and it knocked some [ __ ] off

86
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,468
my roof it [ __ ] up my roof a little

87
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,170
bit and I had a little bit of water

88
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:21,699
getting in my house so I planned on

89
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:23,888
recording yesterday I could not do it

90
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:27,188
because my table my recording area was

91
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:29,829
all wet dude I am a completely lucky man

92
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:31,688
thank you ja I am blessed

93
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:33,189
usually this computer that I'm recording

94
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:34,780
with right now is sitting directly in

95
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:37,418
front of me which is directly under the

96
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,459
chandelier I leave it here sometimes if

97
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:41,079
I'm doing something for some reason I

98
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:42,819
took it in the grow room because I was

99
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,889
looking up some aggro chart from

100
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:46,298
something I wanted to see some stuff and

101
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:50,319
I had it in the grow room and I left it

102
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:52,718
on the shelf and the grow uh and it did

103
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,208
not get wet you guys I got so [ __ ]

104
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:57,698
lucky my computer did not get wet there

105
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,919
was a puddle of water about I don't I

106
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,719
can reach I can put one hand where the

107
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,310
water was and I can completely reach my

108
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:06,759
mixing board I've got a 14 channel

109
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,199
Mackie 1402 Veals III mixer here this is

110
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,268
an expensive [ __ ] piece of equipment

111
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,150
and underneath that is a livewire power

112
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:14,590
Furman it's a power conditioner it keeps

113
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,209
all my power smooth so that I don't get

114
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,259
power fluctuations in my equipment that

115
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,649
will burn out my recording gear

116
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:21,848
underneath that is a dbx compressor kind

117
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,079
of expensive piece of gear that's what

118
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:24,668
keeps all the background noise out of

119
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,560
the show it's what makes me sound crispy

120
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:28,240
and clean so what limits me so that if I

121
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,800
yell into the microphone real bad it

122
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,418
doesn't blow up your ears it did get

123
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,680
louder but it didn't blow out because I

124
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:34,779
was actually really much louder than

125
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,280
what you heard also I'm snapping my

126
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,418
fingers to the right and left of the

127
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:39,219
microphone you don't hear that [ __ ]

128
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:42,250
because of the compressor then

129
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,349
underneath that is a task him us 1200

130
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,060
which is a USB it makes all of my audio

131
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:48,250
signal become a digital signal which

132
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,000
runs into my MacBook none of that [ __ ]

133
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,310
got wet you guys oh my god I'm so lucky

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,589
I'm blessed to think ja whatever you

135
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,699
believe in think that for me because all

136
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:58,689
my [ __ ] could have been destroyed us

137
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,669
thousands of dollars worth of equipment

138
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:03,158
they could have been [ __ ] ruined also

139
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:04,629
I had a bunch of hash on the table you

140
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:06,879
heard me talk about going to apothecary

141
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:08,949
and buying a bunch of concentrates for

142
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,560
some reason all of the water went the

143
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,060
other way my email and a hitman rig and

144
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,250
a bunch of concentrates were sitting on

145
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,680
the table and the water went to the left

146
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,120
and my shoot was to the right something

147
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,870
was looking out for me it's [ __ ] up I

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,449
got water in my house but

149
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:26,449
something was [ __ ] looking out for me

150
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:28,219
so uh with all of that talk about the

151
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:29,449
water in the house in my recording area

152
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,100
this means that I'm going to have

153
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,659
contractors here I'm gonna have roofers

154
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,160

155
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,730

00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,829
will still bring you my Monday episodes

166
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:59,719
but the Thursday episodes may disappear

167
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:02,659
just until I get this recording area

168
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,490
fixed it's stressful trying to get this

169
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,780
all set up so keep putting I don't know

170
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,980
that it's gonna rain again if it rains

171
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,119
again the waters gonna come pouring

172
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,280
through there because the roof is not

173
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,560
fixed so when I get done recording I

174
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:14,329
move all of my [ __ ] off this area and I

175
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,860
cover up what I can't carry cuz some of

176
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:18,289
the stuff's heavy and some of its bulky

177
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,480
so I cover it with trash bags and I'm

178
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,120
dealing with [ __ ] roof leak so I

179
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,620
apologize for maybe not putting out

180
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,060
Thursday episodes I may do it it just

181
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,459
depends on how it goes I may have

182
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,170
contractors here my house may be a

183
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:32,269
[ __ ] mess and maybe go in somewhere

184
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,120
else to record I don't want to promise

185
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:37,609
anything I cannot deliver so I apologize

186
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,560
in advance if I skip a Thursday episode

187
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,480
or two I will put out a Monday episode

188
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,550

189
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,950
up [ __ ] I apologize I will come and

190
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,300

191
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:48,680

194
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:55,189

195
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:57,050
undetermined amount of time it's nothing

196
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,490

216
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,680
things I work hard for things I imagine

217
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:32,120
everybody out there there are a few

218
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,740
thieves and [ __ ] scumbags [ __ ] a

219

thief but there are people out there

220
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,400
that work hard for their [ __ ] and then

221
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,870
you get a nice home to put your [ __ ] in

222
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,789
and you feel like your home is a secure

223
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,819
place for your belongings and to come

224

home and find your [ __ ] wet oh that's a

225
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:46,490
heartbreaking feeling they made my chest

226
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,150
sink I walked in the house and I could

227
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,009
hear water

228
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:50,269
and I was like there's not water that

229
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:52,159
should be your putting in that where

230
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,349

234
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,099
better this is not just going to be a

235
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:02,569
therapeutic podcast I do have some

236
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,669
emails and stuff I would like to read

237
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,529
but before I get there let me do a

238
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:08,599
couple of quick things I would like to

239
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:10,159
tell you guys about patreon or I guess

240
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,530
I'd like to remind you about patreon

241
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,850
because I talk about it all the time for

242
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:14,929
those of you who haven't heard and if

243
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,260
you're not already tired of hearing

244
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,728
about it

245
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:19,038
patreon is a service that would allow

246
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:20,629
you as a listener to financially

247
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,009
contribute to the podcast that's right

248
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,870
if you feel like this podcast was worth

249
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:35,360
a dollar or two of your time you can go

250
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:37,070
to patreon.com/scishow and contribute it

251
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,899
is up to you you can contribute as

252
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,190
little as one dollar and I honestly

253
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:42,139
don't think there's a minimum or a

254
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,300
maximum on how many nines or zeros you

255
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:46,069
can put in there so test it out put in a

256
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,719
whole bunch of nines see what goes on

257
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,980
and I'm not trying to get rich on

258
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,209
podcasting you guys don't think I'm

259
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,370
trying to become a millionaire off of

260
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:54,379
podcasting what I'm trying to do is

261
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,909
offset the cost of my web hosting it

262
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:58,309
cost me a little bit of money to have a

263
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:00,049
website where I host the podcast and I

264
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:01,609
pay for that out of my pocket I'm not

265
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:03,109
trying to get rich I just want help

266
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,490
covering that cost if you guys don't

267
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,879
want to cover it any feel if you can't

268
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,879
help me

269
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,620
I don't mind covering it myself but I'd

270
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,149
rather not I put in a little bit of work

271
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,350
I put in some time if you guys want to

272
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,769
throw down a buck or two to help me pay

273
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,000
for that

274
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,559
I would appreciate it I'm gonna quit

275
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,879
begging but I want you to know that it

276
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,019
is there several people were like him

277
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,750
and I'd love to send you a buck or two

278
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:23,828
PayPal will not accept donations because

279
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:26,690
I have the word cannabis in my podcast I

280
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:26,959
say the word cannabis all the time we

281
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,150
talk

282
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,000
about ganja my website has the word

283
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:33,439
cannabis in it so they do not want

284
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,970
anything to do with me so I had to find

285
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,630
another service patreon is the best way

286
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,210
to do it

287
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:40,129
patreon you contribute to patreon

288
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,840
patreon sends money to my paypal it's

289
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:44,279
just a little buffer zone helps me out

290
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,139
and I want to say two huge thank you to

291
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,000

lot of dollars every dollar matters and

294

295
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,680

all right podcast world I am back I just

395
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,930
took a gigantic dab of some strawberry

396
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:40,740
banana high cannabinoid full-spectrum

397
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:43,979
extract from apothecary extracts and I

398
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,690
am lit I was a little bit cold a few

399
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,720
minutes ago it's a cold rainy night and

400
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,910
I am currently sweating and I want to

401
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,889
open the window that was a great nap so

402
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:54,629
if it sounds like I'm lost for the next

403
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:56,220
couple of seconds it's because I am I'm

404
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:57,689
like a small child wandering around the

405
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,509
mall wondering where my [ __ ] mom went

406
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,580
right now holy [ __ ]

407
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:05,039
alright before I took a break and took a

408
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,780
dab that nearly erased my memory I kinda

409
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,159
remember I was teasing about an email I

410
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,230
wanted to read and I think it's the

411
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,600
email that is here on my iPad screen so

412
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,860
I'm gonna read this email I'm not sure

413
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,690
if this person wants me to say their

414
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,320
name shout out to the person that sent

415
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,360
this to me

416
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,430
I appreciate the email it goes like this

417
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,539
what's happening Rasta Jeff I'm about to

418
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:23,909
drop in Auto flower

419
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,009
Northern Lights outdoors we will be at

420
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:27,929
19 to 22 hours of Sun for the next

421
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:30,299
several months I just listened to your

422
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:33,239
outdoor growing podcast should I expect

423
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:35,429
the same sized plant in an auto versus a

424
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,930
fem thank you and then they sign their

425
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:38,939
name but I'm not gonna say it because I

426
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:42,709
respect your privacy so let's talk about

427
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,750
your Auto flower Northern Lights

428
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,940
unfortunately no your outdoor Auto

429
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,759
flower plant is not going to do as well

430
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,230
as your outdoor regular photo period

431
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,639
plan that's what it's called as a photo

432
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,159
period plan is what I would call it a

433
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,069
regular or a photo period ah there are

434
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,169
several reasons for that kind of mainly

435
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,360
the reason the way that the auto flower

436
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:05,819
plant was bred and designed it's not

437
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,220
meant to get large it's meant to grow to

438
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,050
a certain size and then flower most of

439
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,899
them and let me give it a quick

440
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:15,359
disclaimer ah I don't grow auto flower

441
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,909
plants that's not my thing I really like

442
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,009
regular plants I've gotten away from

443
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:23,399
feminized seeds I just like regular old

444
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:24,840
school regular seeds male-female pollen

445
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,509
makes you to grow that that's what I

446
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,639
like to do but so the little that I do

447
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,990
know about Auto flowers they're bred to

448
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,759
grow to a certain height usually they

449
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,500
get about 3 feet 2 to 3 feet depending

450
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,029
on what strain you're [ __ ] with

451
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,519
and I could be completely wrong but from

452
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,990
what I have seen and tried and done the

453
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,460
little experience I've got the plant got

454
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,759
to about three feet and then it started

455
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,290
flowering it took it about eight weeks

456
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,970
to get to that height and then it just

457
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:49,289
started flowering all by itself I didn't

458
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,029
change the lights I didn't change the

459
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:52,740
nutrients I didn't do anything and then

460
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,750
it took in about 55 days to finish

461
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,279
flowering and it was done and I wasn't

462
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,110
satisfied with it and I'll never [ __ ]

463
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,120
with an auto flower again but the way

464
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,800
that they're bred there's something in

465
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,490
it that triggers it to flower either

466
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,599
based on its age or its height or

467
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,909
whatever it decides it will start

468
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,090
flowering by itself they are not meant

469
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:15,809
to stay alive for a long time a regular

470
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,490
plant a photoperiod plant you can grow

471
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,319
it as long as you want the reason a lot

472
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,970
of these plants get real big outdoors is

473
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,440
because we start vegging them indoors

474
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,600
I'm sure you heard Jesse and I talk

475
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,520
about setting up lights in January and

476
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,259
starting your clones in January and

477
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,689
getting them big so that when May comes

478
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,039
you've got a big four-foot tall plant

479
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,660
that's been topped a couple of times

480
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,370
already so that when he put it outside

481
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,019
it's already four feet tall that's

482
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,139
bigger than your auto flower plant is

483
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,389
even going to get so the quick straight

484
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:44,490
answer is no your Auto flower plant is

485
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:47,309
not going to get anywhere near the size

486
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,690
of a regular outdoor plant if that's

487
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:50,369
what you've got that's what you've got

488
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,080
but next year I would recommend working

489
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,419
with regular plants if you can get some

490
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,040
seeds grow them indoors take some clones

491
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:58,049
off of it find the keeper and then put

492
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,149
that keeper outdoors next year is really

493
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:01,859
what you should do they kind of got

494
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:04,470
sidetracked but the reason that the

495
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,240
non-auto flower the regular flowering

496
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,370
photoperiod plant is able to get bigger

497
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,680
is because you control when it flowers

498
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:12,239
you can veg that thing until it's 22

499
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,529
feet tall if you really want it to and

500
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,630
you had the light in the space to do it

501
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:17,549
those auto flower plants if you're gonna

502
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,050
run those I recommend planting a whole

503
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:21,000
bunch of those because they're gonna

504
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:22,619
grow really quickly they aren't gonna

505
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,210
have time to get real big and take up a

506
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,559
lot of space but if you plant a whole

507
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,539
bunch of them and fill up your square

508
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,609
footage you'll still produce the amount

509
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:31,889
of cannabis you could produce from a

510
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:33,659
small personal outdoor grow I'm not

511
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,790
talking like a commercial grow or a big

512
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,950
Humboldt County or outdoor but if you've

513
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:39,269
got a small personal outdoor and you

514
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,519
just pack in that space with Auto

515
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:43,379
flowers you could produce as much as you

516
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,960
could produce with one or two big plants

517
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,220
however I have never been impressed or

518
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,590
satisfied with the quality of it

519
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,450
a flower plant I'm going to assume that

520
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:54,548
your location there in Alaska you're not

521
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,470
gonna get enough dark time to get a

522
00:17:54,548 --> 00:17:58,779
photo period plant so the OTO flowers

523
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,519
are what you've got to do so man good

524
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:02,798
luck I hope it comes out well for you I

525
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,839
would love an email update maybe some

526
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,009
pictures on the progress so that I can

527
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,480
see how it goes and we'll talk more

528
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:09,640
about it on the show hey I appreciate

529
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,099
the email thanks a lot I hope to hear

530
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,110
from you again in the future good luck

531
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:16,359
with your auto flower out there I hope

532
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:17,829
that goes well all right I've got

533
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:19,959
another email from a listener and it

534
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:21,759
goes like this hey Jeff I just picked up

535
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,090
some of your Firefly from the dank team

536
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,769
super pumped on getting a few freebies

537
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:28,178
and then he goes on to list the names of

538
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:30,009
those freebies that he got from the dang

539
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:31,900
team and the best part is I did not name

540
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:34,119
those that those names are not anything

541
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,090
I ever made up I did not send that to

542
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:38,319
the dank team that they created those

543
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:40,509
names I would not have named him what

544
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,089
you said I'm pretty sure what you've got

545
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:44,798
is a lemon Jeffrey cross to arise and

546
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:47,439
the other seed pack that you've probably

547
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,750
got is a cookies-and-cream cross to

548
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,970
arise those were some of the freebies

549
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,589
that I sent to the dank team for their

550
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,179
orders I'm pretty sure that's what

551
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:57,490
you've got if you'd like to know the

552
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,240
names that I decided on or do decide on

553
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,500
send me an email

554
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,599
I'll let you know what those strains are

555
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,519
really called if that's what you've got

556
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,899
I will also contact the dank team and

557
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,179
let them know to quit naming my [ __ ]

558
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,909
because that is not cool that is not

559
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:11,650
Ross - Jeff approved Yankee don't do

560
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:12,760
that [ __ ] message me I'll tell you what

561
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,190
the name of you don't get to make up

562
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:16,690
names I do I bread that [ __ ] my product

563
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,130
all right enough ranting about that the

564
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,630
email goes on like this it says here's a

565
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,549
question that you may have covered in a

566
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,260
previous podcast but I'm a fairly new

567
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:25,869
listener working my way back through old

568
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:26,980
episodes ah dude you're gonna love it

569
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:29,649
because I've been putting out old

570
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,150
episodes iTunes and stitcher only hold

571
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,798
about a hundred episodes in the feed so

572
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,220
I've been putting up the old episodes in

573
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,450
chunks most Thursday's I release long

574
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,190
episodes they're like three or four

575
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,830
hours long and they're usually three or

576
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,808
four episodes from the history the

577
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:45,399
archives I'm putting them out in order

578
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,649
so hopefully you get to hear a bunch of

579
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,030
those I hope they help you out other

580
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,740
listeners let me know what you think of

581
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:53,230
those long podcast is that a waste of my

582
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,700
time is it good for you is it doing

583
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,440
anything can I quit doing that should I

584
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,850
keep doing that what do you think well

585
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,950
how do you feel let me know also

586
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:01,538
I'm putting the all the episodes up on

587
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,840
YouTube so there will be an archive on

588
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,879
you

589
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,099
before too long I've got about 42 of

590
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,660
them made I will not release them until

591
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:09,579
I've got 50 up there and then you guys

592
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,920
be able to check them out anyway I'm

593
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:13,299
gonna keep going with this email it says

594
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,830
I'm a fairly new listener working my way

595
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,750
back through all the episodes how often

596
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:19,389
do you water with nutrients every time

597
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,190
every other time then he goes on to say

598
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,500
the guys that taught me have me water in

599
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,390
nutrients every time I water I'll flush

600
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,339
one day every other week and flush at

601
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,740
the very end and then he explains his

602
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:32,589
setup so let me talk a little bit about

603
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,859
how much nutrients and how often to use

604
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:37,779
nutrients most of this is gonna be based

605
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:40,119
on your medium this guy here who sent me

606
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:43,599
the email he says he's using botanic air

607
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:45,729
moisture cocoa I would put some a little

608
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,079
bit of perlite or personal light in that

609
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,880
cocoa to give it a little bit of air

610
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,529
it's a little bit aeration would be nice

611
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,540
there may be some in the botanic air

612
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:54,129
moisture cocoa I'm not sure but I always

613
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,529
like to add a little bit of perlite to

614
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,850
my cocoa I think it makes it fluffier it

615
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:59,649
makes it drain a little better the

616
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:03,759
plants like oxygen it's always helpful

617
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:05,860
uh if you're using cocoa it is okay to

618
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,619
why it is recommended to water with

619
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:10,689
nutrients every time the nutrients do

620
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:12,849
not hang out in the cocoa they basically

621
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,440
fall right out of the bottom of the pot

622
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:17,409
with the water they don't catch anything

623
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,360
they don't bind there's nothing to stop

624
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,310
it so you need to add nutrients every

625
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,409
time when you're watering with cocoa uh

626
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:25,599
you're saying you you said use the mills

627
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,670
line with reverse osmosis water your

628
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,369
hand watering and you've got 12 to

629
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:31,450
gallon plastic pots per 4x4 tray sounds

630
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:33,579
like you're off to a good start

631
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,980
you got adjust doing double Enders and

632
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:37,480
co2 enrichment you're pulling one and a

633
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,000
half to two pounds of light depending on

634
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,920
the strain which is good ah you say they

635
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
look a little fried toward the end you

636
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,350
might be pushing a little too much

637
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,869
nutrient if they look a little fried

638
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:48,099
toward the end or you are probably since

639
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:50,319
you're using cocoa you're probably

640
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:53,109
flushing a little extra-long it's gonna

641
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,460
be my assumption so let me go back on a

642
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:56,259
couple of things you said here in the

643
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,329
email how often should I be using

644
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:00,819
nutrients every other every time every

645
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:03,369
other time if you're using cocoa I

646
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:06,129
recommend using nutrients every single

647
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:07,569
time like I said before the nutrients

648
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,760
don't hang out in the cocoa so you're

649
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:11,859
gonna need to replenish that every time

650
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,559
if you're growing in soil or a soilless

651
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:15,459
mix maybe like a peat based mix or

652
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,679
something

653
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,019
I would only I would reduce the

654
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,690
frequency of feedings and water with

655
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:24,549
just water maybe every other time but

656
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,250
that's for guys they're using soilless

657
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:28,839
mix or soil or living soil if you're

658
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,980
using living soil you've already got

659
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,779
your [ __ ] in there you don't need to add

660
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,049
nutrients if you're using bottled

661
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:36,670
nutrients I would say I feed botanic air

662
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:38,710
bottled nutrients when I feed if I'm

663
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,750
using with tannic air I feed once a week

664
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,670
with the Botanica I mix the fool line up

665
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,700
whatever I'm using it'll probably be

666
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:48,970
base nutrients cal-mag what else is in

667
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,440
there liquid karma the hydro Plex then I

668
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,960
had a little bit of mammoth PETA that

669
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,400
give you a little OHS of 28 but I will

670
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,039
feed them all of that [ __ ] whatever

671
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,450
they're getting for the week cal-mag

672
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,579
whatever they're getting whatever root

673
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,890
supplement they're getting they'll get

674
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,449
all of that probably Monday then the

675
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,460
next time they get fed they're just

676
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,350
gonna get plain water and then if they

677
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,299
need water again that week I may give

678
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:12,490
them a tea if it's the middle of flower

679
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:14,139
but if they get thirsty again they'll

680
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,849
probably just get water to hold them

681
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,860
over till Monday usually my plants get

682
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:19,719
watered twice a week either in seven

683
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:22,899
gallon pots most of the time they only

684
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,880
need water twice um also in your email

685
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,470
you said oh let me light up the iPad

686
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,580
screen here again it just black down on

687
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,799
me cuz I haven't touched it in a minute

688
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:31,179
you said something about flushing that I

689
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:33,849
want to touch on you said the guys had

690
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,289
taught you have you water in every have

691
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:36,969
you water nutrients every time you water

692
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,339
that is correct do that since you're in

693
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,740
Cocoa then you say you flush one day

694
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:44,500
every other week and flush at the end I

695
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,319
would skip the flushing one day every

696
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,849
other week that's not necessary your

697
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:51,369
plant they are not getting to eat you're

698
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:53,500
cleaning out the soil and until you feed

699
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:55,179
with nutrients again they are not eating

700
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,430
you could probably increase your weight

701
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,720
if you did not do that that's my opinion

702
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,750
because that's one more chance they'll

703
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,299
get to eat then you say you flush at the

704
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,130
end how long do you flush at the end

705
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:08,950
with Coco you can get away with ten days

706
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:10,780
I would recommend 12 to 14 but with Coco

707
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,330
you can totally get away with ten days

708
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:15,160
especially if you're watering lightly so

709
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:17,500
for your situation I would stop that

710
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,170
flush and I would just feed nutrients

711
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:23,019
every time you water now here are a

712
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,940
couple of things to think about um you

713
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:28,329
can water with nutrients every time I

714
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,140
would do a base nutrient every time then

715
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:32,579
your

716
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,090
natives here's something to consider I

717
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:35,980
until recently

718
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:38,199
I would add all of my additives like I

719
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,140
talked about on Monday and just pummel

720
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,170
the plant with everything on Monday

721
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:45,940
somebody has encouraged me to do

722
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:47,920
different nutrient we call it boosts so

723
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,320
I'll add my base nutrients every time I

724
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,080
water the cocoa but on Monday I'll do my

725
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,629
cal-mag on Tuesday I'll do epsom salts

726
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:59,529
on Wednesday I'll do plus life on

727
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,520
Thursday I'll add push on Friday I add

728
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:02,740
something I'm not gonna tell you

729
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,990
everything I had in there but on Friday

730
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,990
I actually had the apatite apatite

731
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,509
apatite from new millennium is what's

732
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,829
been going in there lately so I just add

733
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,390
something different every day of the

734
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:14,949
week so that that way I feel like I'm

735
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,090
not overloading the plants and that's

736
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,650
something that's been taught to me by

737
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:19,179
somebody else and I'm just trying it to

738
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,280
see how it works because I'm open to new

739
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,190
stuff and honestly I see great results

740
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,769
with it we do mix several things into

741
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:29,019
the nutrient mix will do veg bloom base

742
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:30,819
I will do plus life in there and then

743
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:32,589
we'll put some fulvic acid and we'll put

744
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:34,269
some just a couple other things in there

745
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:36,099
but if we're gonna boost it up like the

746
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:38,230
cow mag and the epsom salts that stuff

747
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:39,579
only happens once a week and not all in

748
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,370
the same day so you can think about that

749
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:44,199
kind of stuff but if you're using cocoa

750
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:46,509
I would certainly at least add a base

751
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,850
nutrient every single time you're gonna

752
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:50,349
get a Cal mag deficiency with cocoa but

753
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:53,079
also in your message you said at the end

754
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:54,789
they look a little bit fried you might

755
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,740
be flushing too long if they're starting

756
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:58,450
to yellow up let's just say you're

757
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,400
growing on a nine week cycle you didn't

758
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,130
tell me about your cycle unless just say

759
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,960
you got a nine week flowering cycle

760
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,520
you're probably flushing at the end of

761
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,130
week seven the start of week eight to

762
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:11,980
give yourself 14 days I'm assuming

763
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,660
around five to six days maybe seven

764
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,400
eight days into that they really started

765
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,080
getting yellow they start to turn kind

766
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,790
of a goldish color maybe a little bit of

767
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,929
red in there and the leaves get a little

768
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:22,210
grey on the tips and they start

769
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,890
crinkling up you have just cleaned out

770
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,380
all the nutrients that cocoa doesn't

771
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,480
hold anything nothing sticks to the

772
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,400
cocoa like it does in a soilless mix it

773
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,230
just falls right out so that's what's

774
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,390
going on you've probably just flushed

775
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,009
and they're ready what you can do is

776
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,450
give a little more nutrients for a

777
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:39,640
little bit longer and that way they

778
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,799
won't burn out so quickly and also you

779
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,860
may get a little more weight but there's

780
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:44,240
nothing wrong with too long

781
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:46,548
of a flush that's gonna make them taste

782
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,660
really good all right

783
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:51,980
so I think I covered your question if

784
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,870
you're using cocoa you should use

785
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,000
nutrients every time you water if you're

786
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:58,849
using soil or a soilless mix I would

787
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,339
recommend nutrients and then water and

788
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:03,649
then maybe a tea occasionally just

789
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:05,269
because that will build up and if you're

790
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,429
using bottled nutrients in a soilless

791
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:09,410
mix the salts will build up quickly and

792
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:11,690
then that'll start causing lockouts and

793
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,400
problems and everything will go to [ __ ]

794
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,110
so all right I hope I answered your

795
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,419
question he ends the email by saying

796
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:19,939
killer podcast and then they signed

797
