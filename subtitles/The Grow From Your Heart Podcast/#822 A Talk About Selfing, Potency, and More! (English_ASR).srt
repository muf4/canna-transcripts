episodes I've definitely noticed it

36
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,799
while I've been editing and a few people

37
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,000
have nosed it enough to send in a

38
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,840
message and say hey rosta Jeff what has

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,399
happened to the bridge of your nose

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,799
that's right uh you may notice I've got

41
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,079
a little Dinger here on the bridge of my

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,560
nose it's been there for a couple of

43
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:01,879
shows uh nothing exciting nothing crazy

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,200
happen happened to my nose I was invited

45
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:07,039
to a virtual starw walk a non-vr

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,959
interactive experience and I went to

47
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:10,479
that experience and they promised us

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,920
through all the advertising through the

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,720
ticket purchase that it was not VR when

50
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,439
we got there the first thing they did

51
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,639
was put the VR helmet on me and told me

52
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,199
it's not VR they say it wasn't VR cuz it

53
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,119
was a screen and I could see the rest of

54
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:24,199
the room but it was basically putting on

55
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,480
VR anyway I'm bitching about the wrong

56
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,238
thing uh the person that placed the VR

57
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,280
helmet on my head was an average sized

58
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,640
person and I

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,479
6'5 and she reached up and tried to

60
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,559
gently place this VR helmet on my head

61
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,560
but when she let go of it it smacked me

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,318
right Square in the [ __ ] nose made my

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,239
eyes water a little bit gave me a little

64
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,119
bit of a Dinger so wasn't anything real

65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
exciting that happened to my nose I went

66
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,200
to a non-vr interactive starw walk and

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,039
when they put on the VR goggles or the

68
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,359
VR helmet they busted me right in the

69
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,639
bridge of the nose that's really what

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,319
happened to my nose so thank you to all

71
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,399

says yes my pet peeve is pictures of

120
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,520
dirty grow room floors yes if you're

121
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,160
going to grow clean up the floor if

122
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,879
you're going to take a picture clean up

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,000
the floor if you're going to post that

124
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,759
picture clean up the floor or at least

125
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,759
edit out that dirty floor what are you

126
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,800
doing bro one of the main things to

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,919
think about in growing is cleanliness

128
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,038
cleanliness is how you prevent probably

129
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,038
70% of most of your major problems in

130
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,360
the grow so clean that [ __ ] sh up off

131
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:04,599
the floor my dude newbie does have more

132
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,240
though he says uh pots on the floor with

133
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,120
no drain pans and runoff stains and

134
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,319
build up yes that is so gross bro if

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,759
you're going to put pots on the floor

136
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,360
and water them have something to catch

137
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,720
that run off unless you got a floor

138
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,360
drain and you're doing a bunch and you

139
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,880
got the commercial thing going then

140
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,479
that's a different story hose that down

141
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,478
when you're done but if you're growing

142
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,359
in a hom grow and you're pouring water

143
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,038
into a pot have something to catch that

144
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,199
water after it goes through the pot not

145
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:31,038
just the floor then don't let those big

146
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,560
new nutrient those big salt Rings build

147
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,879
up on the floor that's just ugly you can

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,839
do that if you want but I understand

149
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,360
that that is a pet peeve I'd recommend

150
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,359
not doing that clean that up let's just

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,560
be a little more uh have a little more

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Pride for the grow room my buddy does

153
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,399
have more to say though he says add a

154
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,360
little soil and leaf for garnish I love

155
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,638
that bro that is why I read your message

156
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,600
cuz I like that tone we're just going to

157
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,199
read it all it says my pet peeve is uh

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,560
pictures of dirty floors pots on the

159
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,560
floor no drain pans runoff stains and

160
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,199
buildup and add a little soil and leaf

161
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,160
for garnish it sounds like You' just

162
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,240
made a a recipe for disaster there my

163
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,360
bro uh those are all pet peeves yes

164
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,560
clean that [ __ ] up especially if you're

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
going to post a photo then it does go on

166
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,959
it says just lighting up the neon sign

167
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,240
for pests and pathogens and problems

168
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:18,079
even worse is carpet in closet grows oh

169
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,519
man uh yeah carpet in a grow room does I

170
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,680
didn't even know but that's like nails

171
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,839
on a chalkboard just reading that carpet

172
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,519
in the grow room I wouldn't recommend it

173
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,038
I understand some of you guys have to do

174
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,079
what you got to do you got to grow where

175
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,918
you can grow but carpet uh that's such a

176
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,439
great place for so many bugs to hide and

177
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,758
then you're going to spill [ __ ] on that

178
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,279
carpet and ruin it and it's going to get

179
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,160
moldy and funky it's going to get gross

180
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,198
I'm feeling you newbie nugs my dude

all right podcast world let's segue into

184
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,360
the question and answer part of this

185
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:54,240
podcast I do have a website that website

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,000
is iry genetics.com on the top of that

187
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,439
website there is a list of tabs one of

188
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,959
those tabs does say grow help or grow

189
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,160
questions I forgot what it says I didn't

190
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,038
go there today and remember myself but

191

192
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:07,959
question go to the grow help tab we'll

193
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,000

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
direct.com I've got a great question

200
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,199
here in front of me this one came from

201
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,000
my friend who wants to be called all

202
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,280
mixed up what's up bro it's good to hear

203
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,038
from you it's good to answer your

204
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,878
question on the podcast did not look at

205
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,478
the name before I pulled this uh

206
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,560
question out of the pile I simply read

207
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:36,478
the question and thought this is

208
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,038
something I could answer now I do see

209
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,758
the name on there my friend I will be

210
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,199
sending you a coupon code for a free

211
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,280
pack of iy genetics premium seeds the

212
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,840
grow question goes just like this it

213
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,959
says yo rosted Jeff what's up all mixed

214
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,758
up good to see you bro it says I was

215
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:54,279
wondering if potency would go up if I

216
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,240
let my cultivars go longer that's a very

217
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,878
good question it says I pulled lemon

218
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,478
Jeffrey at day 65 and had my flower

219
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:06,039
tested it tested at

220
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:08,240
20.1% THC and 2% CBG so that is a sign

221
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:10,639
that it could have gone longer that CBG

222
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,478
uh may have converted into more THC if

223
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,519
you let that go longer you may be on to

224
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,800
something it goes on though it says I

225
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,719
was wondering if potency would go up

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,158
with more days in flour or is it that if

227
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,840
I'm in organic soil and not using pgrs

228
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:27,360
to push the cultivars to their full

229
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:30,439
potential thanks as always rosta Jeff

230
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,158
from your friend all mixed up so this is

231
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,599
a great question now a couple of things

232
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,000
come to mind to answer this question but

233
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,120
the first thing I want to talk about is

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,320
the Tricom ripeness the main thing that

235
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,278
matters is the ripeness of the tricomes

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,879
of these plants did you use

237
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,919
magnification to see how many Amber

238
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,159
tricomes you had on this plant before

239
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,719
harvest my next question would be what

240
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:55,879
percentage of those tricomes were Amber

241
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,839
did you have 10% 20% 30% amber tricomes

242
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,519
how many of those tricomes were Amber at

243
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,920
Harvest time then we could experiment

244
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,600
from there we could cut some down

245
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,078
earlier we could cut some at the same

246
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,800
time cut some a little bit later dry and

247
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,439
cure them exactly the same then have

248
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,799
them lab tested again it may be cultivar

249
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,480
specific it may be uh it may be

250
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:18,319
phenotype specific but it all depends on

251
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,159
the ripeness of that plant so going

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,160
longer it may have been more potent in

253
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,319
different cannabinoids the THC in there

254
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,000
may have converted to something

255
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,680
different the CBG Also may have had the

256
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,440
opportunity the potential to

257
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,439
convert into THC there are many things

258
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,640
that can happen in just a few more days

259
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,880
of growing that plant so it's all about

260
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,879
those troms were the tricomes ripe at

261
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,240
Harvest Time were they at their Peak

262
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,278
ripeness could they have gone a little

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,560
bit longer were they a little bit early

264
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:47,278
that's what's going to make the main

265
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,759
difference the second thing I would

266
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,679
think about is the dry and cure process

267
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,519
all of your photography on social media

268
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,399
is impressive so I know you're a skilled

269
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,560
grower I know you're a qualified

270
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,159
photographer but after the grow I don't

271
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,958
know what happens after you take those

272
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,480
photos I don't know if you're able to

273
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,479
dry and cure properly and I'm not

274
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,839
doubting you I'm just saying that also

275
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,920
could be a factor in increasing potency

276
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,680
of those plants so keep in mind that the

277
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:14,078
dry and cure process can uh dramatically

278
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,319
increase or decrease the potency of the

279
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,399
overall finished product uh if you dry

280
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,440
it too quickly it may lose a lot of the

281
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,320
potency it may lose a lot of the turps

282
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,600
if you dry it nice and slowly you should

283
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,959
retain most of the turps and most of the

284
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,120
potency but many variables can mess that

285
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,000
up very quickly so the two things to

286
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,519
think about our harvesting at Peak

287
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,399
ripeness and the only way to really

288
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,639
master that is by cutting down at

289
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,399
different times really and then testing

290
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,799
but are you really concerned what the

291
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,919
lab report says I'm more curious what

292
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,599
does it do when you smoke it did you cut

293
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,479
it down at the right time according to

294
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,800
your Buzz to your desires uh if you want

295
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,000
more of a racy buzz cut it down a little

296
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,159
bit earlier if you want that middle buzz

297
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,399
cut it down when you got about 20% Amber

298
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,679
tricomes if you want more of a sedative

299
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,360
couch lock relaxed sort of a buzz then

300
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,319
wait till so you got 30% amber tricomes

301
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,159
that's where you need to dial in your

302
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,120
desires so what I would do is I would

303
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,240
grow three or four plants and then I

304
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,959
would cut one down at where did you cut

305
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,639
yours down 65 so I would cut one down at

306
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,679
day 60 then one at day 65 and one at Day

307
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,200
70 and then I would dry and cure them

308
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:21,278
all the same oid the best that you can

309
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,680
then I would send them to a lab then

310
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,958
while you're waiting for the lab to run

311
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,759
their test and send you results do your

312
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:30,078
own independent testing uh take the

313
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,958
plant that you cut down at day 60 and

314
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,519
make it your first smoke of the day if

315
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,078
you normally smoke a joint if you

316
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,039
normally smoke a bong load if you

317
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,759
normally smoke out of the hookah however

318
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,000
you normally do it take your first smoke

319
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,399
of the day of that plant that you cut

320
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,039
down at day 60 and then take notes of

321
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,799
what happened did you get caught in

322
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,039
mouth did you get a nice Buzz did you

323
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,639
enjoy it is it what you're looking for

324
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,120
then the next day then you could smoke

325
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,320
whatever weed you want after that

326
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,959
throughout the day then the next day uh

327
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,079
take that plant you cut down at day 65

328
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,359
and smoke that one the same exact way as

329
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,559
you did yesterday for your first smoke

330
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,278
of the day then let's take notes did you

331
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,759
get cotton mouth did you like the flavor

332
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,720
like the aroma did you get the buzz

333
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,000
you're looking for then compare it to

334
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,360
the one you smoked yesterday then you

335
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,159
can smoke whatever weed you want for the

336
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,560
rest of the day I give you permission

337
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,838
then the third day guess what we're

338
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,039
going to do we're going to smoke the

339
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,839
sample that went for 70 days and we're

340
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,679
going to compare it on the same criteria

341
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,279
as the first two then we're going to

342
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,919
think about which one did you really

343
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,278
enjoy the most write it down pick one

344
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,879
write the things that you notice the

345
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:34,639
pros the cons the pluses the minuses the

346
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,559
similarities and the differences Mark

347
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,519
all that [ __ ] down then uh when the

348
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,359
tests come compare the lab tests to your

349
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,879
personal paper notes uh did you agree is

350
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,839
that your favorite the one of that is

351
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,399
the most potent is that the one that you

352
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,160
chose the one that's the trippiest is

353
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,039
that the one that you chose and then see

354
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,879
if those test results line up is your

355
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,958
favorite plant the one that got you the

356
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,120
highest the one that gave you the

357
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,239
favorite Buzz is that the one that had

358
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,039
the highest lab test was the one that

359
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,240
you said tasted the best the one that

360
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,759
tested with the highest TPS just play a

361
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,480
game and see if you can get the lab test

362
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,360
if you can predict the lab test or if

363
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,759
the lab tests agree with you I just

364
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,440
think that that would be fun what

365
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,399
matters the most is which finished

366
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,760
product do you prefer do you like the

367
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,480
early cut the middle cut that late cut

368
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,958
that is the most important part or maybe

369
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
you're growing for a medical need for

370
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,359
somebody else uh maybe you're growing

371
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,839
for a for a profit uh does your medical

372
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,839
client or does your uh your clientele do

373
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,040
they prefer a certain one that's what's

374
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,480
going to matter the most uh use that lab

375
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,360
test for funsies it sounds like you're

376
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,600
testing anyway and I'm always curious to

377
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,360
see lab results please do send me those

378
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,278
but the most important part is which one

379
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,440
do you like the most now he does wrap it

380
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:47,278
up with or is it that I'm growing in

381
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,959
organic soil and not using pgrs no I

382
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,519
don't think that that is a factor here I

383
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,239
think you're a great grower I think

384
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,120
you're going to get similar results in

385
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,560
pgrs or in your organic soil or whatever

386
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,919
you chose to grow in I'm sure that you

387
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,559
would kill it and get similar results uh

388
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:03,159
don't feel bad that 20% THC was your

389
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,359
test result that's not a low number

390
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:07,480
that's not a bad number uh that's very

391
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,519
common that's very uh that's acceptable

392
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,519
in the Cannabis industry and you got

393
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,039
that 2.0% CBG which tells me there could

394
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,560
have been possibly more THC if you did

395
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,679
let it go longer so uh the only way to

396
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,799
answer that is honestly to let one go a

397
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,719
little bit longer and then test it again

398
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,639
and see what type of results you do get

399
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,079
but to make that official you have to do

400
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,039
everything the exact same all over again

401
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,359
or it's not official uh science so I

402
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,360
would run like I said before run a few

403
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,440
plants and then cut some down at some

404
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,320
time some at another some at another and

405
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,040
then run those maybe you could cut uh

406
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,399
one branch off one branch one branch

407
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,838
that sounds kind of silly I don't like

408
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,039
that idea but it it would be good

409
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,480
science it would work but uh I would do

410
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,879
three more tests if you can uh from a 60

411
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,360
a 65 and a 70 and if you want to go

412
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,439
crazy go for a day 75 test just for fun

413
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,639
most importantly though smoke them see

414
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,680
what you like my dude 311 I do thank

415
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,278
thank you once again for the great

416
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,120
question that one got me rambling quite

417
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,879
well I'm going to send you a coupon code

418
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,560
for a free pack of iy genetics premium

419
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,120
seeds and I can't wait to see what you

420
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,479
do with them my friend all right we do

421
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,839
have another great message here in front

422
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,720
of me this one came from our friend who

423
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,040
wants to be called stacks and the

424
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,278
question from Stacks goes a little bit

425
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:23,439
like this it says yo this podcast rocks

426
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,360
a lot of good info and has helped me in

427
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,720
my breeding Journey well you're are very

428
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,839
welcome I'm glad to help you out in the

429
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,199
breeding Journey uh it says I'm I'm sure

430
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:33,920
you've spoke on this before but thoughts

431
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,078
on selfing so selfing that is when you

432
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,439
take a female plant and you treat it

433
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,039
with a solution and that female plant

434
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,519
will make pollen that pollen is

435
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:45,240
feminized pollen I will take that pollen

436
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:48,159
and put it on a clone of the exact same

437
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,240
plant that will make feminized seeds

438
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,360
that are we'll just say Golden Goat is a

439
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,000
Golden Goat to Golden Goat since that is

440
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,240
the same plant it pollinated itself that

441
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,240
is now selfing that is an S1 that is a

442
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,240
selfed feminized plant that is what

443
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,839
selfing means just to catch you guys up

444
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,560
then he goes on and he says what about

445
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,240
the next Generations the S2 the S3 and

446
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,359
so on that is a very good question it

447
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
says I read on the internet that it's

448
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,079
the quickest way to

449
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,919
uniformity um sometimes those S2s and

450
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:20,039
S3s well let's talk about how we do that

451
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:22,078
and what that is uh the S1 is when you

452
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,799
take that original plant and pollinate

453
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,679
itself right that first seed that comes

454
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:29,198
off that is S1 if I were to grow out

455
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,439
those seeds and find a plant that look

456
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,958
just like the mommy that I'm looking for

457
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,680
just like the original plant that I

458
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,838
reversed that I'm working with if I find

459
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,719
that one again then I cut two clones of

460
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,000
that and reverse one and pollinate the

461
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,519
other one again and do the process again

462
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,759
now I'm making S2s if I repeat that I

463
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,919
making S3 every time I do it I make

464
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,680
another generation with another

465
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:54,159
number sometimes in those further s

466
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,919
Generations things can be great or they

467
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,439
can be really really wonky sometimes

468
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,240
you'll bre just weak slow growing

469
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,360
growing plants sometimes you'll grow

470
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,279
some mutated plants sometimes you'll

471
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,880
bring out some weird recessive traits

472
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:07,759
but sometimes you do have really good

473
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,160
luck and you're able to lock in the

474
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,599
exact traits that you were looking for I

475
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,079
have played with S2 and S3 generations

476
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,918
and a couple of back crosses and

477
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,279
different variations of that and from my

478
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,959
experience it's less risky to just leave

479
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,838
that S1 alone and be happy with the

480
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,360
phenotypes that are coming from that

481
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,119
than it is to go S2 and risk the

482
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:30,798
mutation and the weird uh of vigor and

483
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,119
the weirdness that does come from that

484
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,879
now there is more to this question let

485
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:37,279
me jump to it it says uh my thought is

486
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,679
if I find the perfect cross in an F1

487
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,359
generation could I self that to get

488
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,798
uniformity or are there problems this

489
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,038
way now the F1 generation is not

490
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,038
feminized I'm not sure if you meant F1

491
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,679
generation in there but we'll talk about

492
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,839
a couple of different things here let's

493
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,919
start with Golden Goat uh you said find

494
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:57,519
the perfect cross Golden Goat is a

495
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,120
nearly perfect cross I love that plant

496
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,519
it's fun to grow it's fun to smoke and

497
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,959
it breeds beautifully so I'm going to

498
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,679
use Golden Goat here uh you said my

499
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,279
thought is if I find the perfect cross

500
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,400
which will say Golden Goat um Golden

501
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,119
Goat is an F1 so that fits perfectly

502
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,240
into your criteria it says could I self

503
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,199
that to get uniformity or are there

504
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,480
problems this way no there are

505
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,720
absolutely no problems in selfing that

506
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,839
F1 that is a great idea that is exactly

507
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,759
what I do I do that with the Golden Goat

508
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:27,439
I do that with a couple of other things

509
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,400
when you self an F1 a lot of the times

510
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,038
what I do find is that I find

511
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,440
approximately 50 to 70% of the progyny

512
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:38,599
look just like the original mother plant

513
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,440
so if I take that Golden Goat I selfit I

514
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:44,038
make Golden Goat S1 seeds at least 50%

515
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,240
of those seeds are going to look just

516
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,720
like the Golden Goat that I started with

517
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,519
now here's a way that I like to break it

518
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,120
down when I'm talking about fem seeds

519
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,400
and phenotypes to expect most of the

520
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,279
time in my experience and believe me

521
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,720
there are many variables this is just

522
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,558
from my experience and what I have seen

523
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,480
most of the time I'm going to find 50%

524
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,639
of the phenotypes look just like the

525
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,400
plant that I reversed so if I'm working

526
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,360
with Golden Goat 50 to 70% we're going

527
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,480
to sa 50 for this just to give myself a

528
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:15,038
buffer zone and just for mathematical

529
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,240
purposes uh usually 50 to 70 but we're

530
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,440
going to say 50% of those seeds are

531
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,640
going to look just like the Golden Goat

532
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,519
now what we're also going to find is 20%

533
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,038
of those seeds are going to look like

534
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,879
the mother of Golden Goat and 20% of

535
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,599
those seeds will look like the dad of

536
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,000
the gold Golden Goat now we're also

537
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,359
going to find about 10% of those seeds

538
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,960
just to be complete weirdos who knows

539
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:37,719
what those are going to look like that

540
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,240
is just what the genetics do they could

541
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,079
look like Grandma they could look like

542
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,759
Grandpa they could be all over the place

543
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,519
but usually about 50 to 70% of them are

544
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,319
going to look just like the mom that we

545
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,440
started with we're going to see some of

546
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,678
the dad and some of the mom on The the

547
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,919
parents the mom and the dad and then

548
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,480
sometimes we're going to see some weird

549
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,440
phenotypes in there so that is generally

550
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,558
the ratio that I find when I'm working

551
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,919
with the uh the s1's which is a

552
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,200
feminized version of the F1 now I

553
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,120
understand that the question was asking

554
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,279
about going further generations to lock

555
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,719
in that uniformity or the word stability

556
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,960
that's when stable comes in here but I

557
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,798
think by doing the S1 that you're going

558
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,400
to lock in as much as you need to you're

559
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:22,240
going to find enough phenotypes that

560
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,000
look just like the original mother plant

561
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,640
if you're doing this for yourself for

562
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,319
preservation uh that S1 is perfectly

563
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,919
fine you will find a lot of great phen

564
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,599
types in there they look just like the

565
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,320
mom if you want to do this for

566
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,240
commercial production if you want to put

567
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,399
these seeds out then you may want to

568
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,519
work it further but honestly the Golden

569
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,720
Goat s1's that I put out people are

570
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,240
finding phenotypes that look just like

571
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,279
the original Golden Goat they get a

572
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,480
six-pack of seeds and they'll find one

573
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,678
that looks just like the original Golden

574
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Goat in that pack so my dude I hope that

575
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,640
was a sufficient answer to your question

576
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,159
I always do love talking about breeding

577
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,799
