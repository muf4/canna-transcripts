that I had left on my desk when we left

127
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:54,790
for the trip so we are way off topic but

128
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,379
I like that how much at this point in

129
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,949
time how much do you normally consume

130
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:01,240
and I'm gonna ask a follow-up question

131
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:03,759
but I'm gonna ask it before I forget is

132
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,439
that based on budget or does that

133
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:13,149
satisfy your need I'm lucky I found a

134
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:15,430
way to do both okay I stockpile one I'm

135
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:17,620
able isn't there you go have some

136
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,389
longtime listeners or regular listeners

137
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,259
are familiar with my vintage vintage

138
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:26,199
hash collection now yeah Mike's kind of

139
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,550
a hash hoarder I stock up and now I've

140
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,659
got hash that's like a year and a half

141
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,449
old [ __ ] this wonderful gets me crazy

142
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,030
high and some of the stuff that breaks

143
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:39,340
down is it ages is really effective

144
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:40,629
medically okay I'm sure it changes it

145
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:48,009
the cannabinoids change as they break

146
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:50,709
down and get stony but I don't know

147
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:53,199
daily consumption or yeah how much you

148
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:55,388
smoke on all day unless I'm hurting from

149
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,909
something specific like I did something

150
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:01,000
and really hurt my back or something to

151
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,939
just manage the my normal pain usually

152
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,680
around a gram a flower a day with

153
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:09,750
anywhere between like one and five or

154
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,370
seven dabs thrown in throughout the

155
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,680
course I'd be tiny little me dad's

156
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,410
little tiny micro Mike dabs yep

157
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,689
throughout the day if I'm doing nothing

158
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,450
all day like if it's just a me day and I

159
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:24,209
can kind of go with the flow and I'm not

160
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,459
trying to to do nothing all day just

161
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:30,629
medicate cuz I can go through a lot more

162
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:34,469
than that alright so one gram of flour

163
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:36,389
and seven dabs throughout the day like

164
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,820
seven dabs would be like I was dabbing a

165
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,949
lot that day okay so probably today the

166
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,529
one I'm coughing on is my third dab of

167
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:46,050
the day okay and you took two of those

168
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,369
here yep all right okay so you got

169
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,500
through and it's almost nine o'clock in

170
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,910
reason I took another one today is

171
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,879
because a friend came by the house real

172
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:58,920
quick whoever dabbed out Mike but yeah

173
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,939
it's it's typically mostly flour and so

174
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:05,009
I mean nine or ten okay until the kid

175
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,529
goes to bed and things get calm the kid

176
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,480
gets the bed and then I get like this

177
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:11,669
stuff around the house done that like I

178
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,680
can't do all I'm also caring for him

179
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,080
yeah so there's usually some scrambles

180
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,699
of the things yeah right dishes laundry

181
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:23,099
anything that requires more than three

182
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:24,779
fingers yeah anything you gotta pay too

183
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,210
much attention to yep anything they

184
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,679
can't handle itself you gotta wait till

185
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:31,439
he goes down to take care of the most

186
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,019
part and as soon as I get that stuff

187
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,209
wrapped up like I can chill and dab and

188
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:38,519
relax and enjoy my day so you're smoking

189
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:41,039
a gram of flour and probably on average

190
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,490
sounds closer to five dabs a day yeah

191
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,640
maybe

192
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,670
and your dabs a gram can last you two

193
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,800
weeks at the rate you dead well I that's

194
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,840
the other trick with trying to convert

195
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,810
the number of dabs I take in a given

196
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:58,049
time period to a weight is I've got like

197
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:01,500
50 or 60 different grams that I'm

198
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,449
actively dabbing from and so one dab

199
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,470
from here went that from there one dad

200
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,199
from over here

201
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,390
I've never taken the time to weigh out

202
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,709
one of my dabs at home so I really care

203
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:15,689
tiny like point zero nine like not even

204
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:18,810
point one's yeah they're pretty small

205
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:23,300
point zero five maybe they're little dad

206
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:26,009
they've been getting bigger but I

207
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,689
usually go pretty small just my lungs

208
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,370
don't like the big ones and you guys

209
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,529
some listeners are gonna wait did he

210
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,750
just say he had 50 grams yeah he's got

211
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:35,579
50 containers that have all been being

212
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,158
smoked from through the past six months

213
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,229
through a year and a half and so most of

214
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,120
them have like a quarter gram or a half

215
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,919
gram left in oh but the size dad's you

216
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,620
take I mean that's plenty of dad's left

217
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,779
in there right I I haven't had to buy I

218
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:53,340
mean I can't even remember the last time

219
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:54,899
I bought hash it's just I haven't had

220
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,009
extra money to spend on hash I've been

221
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,590
saving up for a handful of different

222
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:59,970
things including this trip and so like

223
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,180
I've got hash I don't need to spend

224
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:08,160
money on it I've been actively trying to

225
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:11,099
get rid of the different containers that

226
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:15,299
I've got so much lower than the others

227
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,680
I'll focus on right out of the pile you

228
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,589
know if you need help bro I know a guy

229
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,759
that takes dabs I was chuckling I meant

230
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,320
to bring two or three of the different

231
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,799
containers over tonight that I left them

232
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,200
all sitting on your side track sometimes

233
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,879
but uh I mean I've actively been going

234
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,720
through it and I've still got 40 or 50

235
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,549
containers yeah

236
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,139
that's impressive yeah I've probably got

237
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:35,519
10 or 12 different flavours on deck

238
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:37,889
right now you know you burns

239
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,220
you've probably got more hash on the

240
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:45,449
table then I've got at home oh you've

241
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,339
got about seven ten grams of one kind

242
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,780
right here and similar on this one and

243
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,280
then I've got six stacks of this

244
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,779
apothecary lemon Jeffrey right here

245
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,679
there's more in the bag over here and

246
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:58,889
this is some citrus sap shatter that's

247
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,669
some water hash and then in here this is

248
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:04,049
a fun little container this container I

249
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:05,579
grab some shatter and put shatter in

250
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:07,079
here and then when it gets low I just

251
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,520
grab shatter from another container

252
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,500
whichever this is my little to-go

253
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,669
container and this is what I dab on when

254
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,779
I'm out and about if I stopped at

255
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:14,490
someone's house or if I have a little

256
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,350
break this is what I dab out of and

257
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,000
everyone's like holy [ __ ] I'm so high

258
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,580
what's in there and it's just a mix of

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,080
[ __ ] everything everything good and it

260
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,139
sits in the car so it all just melts

261
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,970
into one little

262
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:26,289
that's nice and even it's all congealed

263
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,389
together you don't know what you're

264
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:30,519
getting it always tastes so good but

265
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:33,789
that that's that's my little time bomb

266
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,129
right there of dads what I was getting

267
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:39,069
to before we got sidetracked on Mike

268
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:43,600
having 50 containers what I was getting

269
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:46,000
to is he smokes a gram of flour and like

270
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,339
maybe a half a gram of shatter over a

271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,629
week the one gram of flour a day and a

272
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:51,459
half a gram of shatter over a week

273
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:53,470
probably if you put it all together and

274
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:55,838
he's gonna go to Mexico for like a week

275
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,410
yeah and when you come back you think

276
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:05,200
it's gonna take one dab oh yeah one dad

277
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:10,059
just to make it a lay on the couch in

278
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:13,120
two years I kind of I should try that do

279
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:15,489
it on vacation um in my experience the

280
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,259
only thing you need to go to in your

281
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,629
life to go from daily marijuana

282
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,700
consumption to no marijuana consumption

283
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:23,169
for a few days there's some interesting

284
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,450
[ __ ] in your life right there's a break

285
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:28,360
in the rhythm last time I went to the

286
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,970
the warm-up half a Mardi Gras oh yeah

287
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,919
couple of weeks before actual Mardi Gras

288
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,829
with the topless and in the drunkenness

289
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:38,169
is just like family fun drunkenness

290
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,849
where it's exactly the same but

291
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:41,528
everybody keeps their top well almost

292
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,570
everybody keeps their top off the people

293
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:44,980
that got the memo right people that know

294
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,390
what's going on there's always one or

295
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,459
two people that clearly showed up in

296
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:49,809
town this morning who are already way

297
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,919
too hammered and one of them keeps

298
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,659
trying to take their shirt off while

299
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:57,039
everyone in their group was like no it's

300
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:59,169
two weeks from them but just checking

301
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,990
out New Orleans was more than enough to

302
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:03,519
take my mind off and then you did get

303
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,490
some weed and it was super impressive

304
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,049
right

305
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,940
no I kept running into people that were

306
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:12,189
offering to sell me weed and it made me

307
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:16,660
laugh because more than one of them was

308
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:18,220
like dude my guy gets in one of them

309
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:21,610
I've been chatting with for like ten

310
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,879
minutes while we sat there and smoke a

311
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,649
cigarette and he gets me on the phone

312
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,120
with his guy like that's how far he

313
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,620

his money he's like I've done this

326
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,139
before I've hopped on my bike cuz that's

327
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,300

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,899
crowded to show up when the guys gonna

333
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,329
take one look at it and [ __ ] bids out

334

in New Orleans swamp weed away from me I

335
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,990
don't want none of this a couple of

336
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:23,569
times I ran into people smoking weed out

337
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:25,460
in public it smelled terrible we were

338
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,430
laughing my wife's not a cannabis

339
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:31,310
aficionado like I am I doesn't partake

340
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:48,949
at all I mean has it for like 20 years

341
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:52,429
she can smell me when I show up that was

342
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,060
9 or 10 days wasn't the trip where she

343
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,949
got pregnant

344
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:57,129
no that's the tripper we found out we

345
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:03,650
were pregnant ok I got there all right

346
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:05,360
but close cool reminiscent you have to

347
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:06,919
keep talking this one's gonna be a short

348
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,750
break but my consumptions been lighter

349
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,789
this round too so I'm looking forward to

350
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,909
it take a tea break every now and again

351
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:14,870
people it's good for your brain I'm

352
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:16,490
gonna use what you were talking about

353
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,259
into a segue but I want to finish this a

354
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,669
dab of lemon Geoffrey before I do it I'm

355
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,279
just hoping you turn at least some

356
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:24,559
colors cuz that dad was massive like I

357
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,360
got a good head just with the extra

358
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,219
vapor in the room I'm kind of a soldier

359
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,960
so it won't be as much but hair on my

360
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,399
arm did move and Michael went to pull

361
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,040
the extra leftover smoke because that's

362
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,870
so tasty usually like Mike DAP left in

363
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,969
the rig when he's done with it it

364
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,279
doesn't make me choke like mad because

365
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,920
it's the heat it's the the hot dab on my

366
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,529
smoker lungs yeah you melt that smoker

367
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,539
tar back in there yep all right so I

368
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:48,949
kind of set up something I got an email

369
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:49,129
from somebody today and you kind of went

370
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,870
the

371
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:53,450
right direction to make it a segue I

372
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,250
love it I'm opening up the email on my

373
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,170
phone because my iPhone walks cuz I have

374
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,830
it on this low battery mode so just lots

375
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:03,439
every seven seconds but this person

376
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,940
asked they said I started listen to your

377
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
podcast and I'm getting through some of

378
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,510
the episodes and loving the info I've

379
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:13,189
started growing and I'm on my second

380
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:15,769
grow at a boy boy because he can sit

381
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,630
well could be girl its 2017 continues to

382
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:21,259
say my wife is a tea one diabetic and

383
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:22,549
started getting gas Trio paresis I hope

384
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:24,649
I said that correctly I'm not a doctor

385
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:26,179
she has trouble with appetite and

386
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:28,579
indicas make her hungry which is great

387
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:31,969
she is also starting to get anxiety and

388
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,860
I know weed is great for that the

389
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,720
correct weed is good for anxiety some

390
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,720
weed will give people a panic attack

391
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,639
my favorite weed will give most people a

392
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,269
panic attack right you're in luck cause

393
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,480
for most folks what stimulates hunger is

394
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:48,949
also good for the anxiety so you're not

395
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,210
gonna have to hunt real far from what

396
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,680
you're already shopping for right it'll

397
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:55,580
be similar similar strains will have

398
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,809
that effect luckily goes on to say sorry

399
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,950
I'm coughing after that dab the email

400
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:00,529
goes on to say can you help me figure

401
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,870
out medical type dosing I know how to

402
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:05,360
get high but what does medical treatment

403
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,539
look like small amounts each hour every

404
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,129
two hours etc these ends the email with

405
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:11,750
we're in Oregon so strains here it can

406
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:13,279
be different so knowing characteristics

407
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,879
to look for in strains would be very

408
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,899
helpful as well thank you in advance I'm

409
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,570
not gonna see your name on there because

410
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,909
I don't know if you want me to but it's

411
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,030
a dude it is a boy so we did verify that

412
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:28,370
by the name also 2017 so that name could

413
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,779
be girl's name I gotta be careful with

414
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:35,690
all this new [ __ ] that's happening I

415
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:37,699
think Oregon okay

416
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,230
and they're looking for what does

417
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,879
medical doses look like what does

418
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,810
medical dosing which explains why you

419
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,350
ask me I question I was like why do you

420
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,489
started talking about taking a

421
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,990
consumption break and I was like well

422
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,879
this will be a smooth segue if my high

423
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,610
ass can make it work oh that was smooth

424
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:54,889
but I mean medical consumption is just

425
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,080
everybody's got to find that fine line I

426
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:01,439
think is what you're looking for is

427
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:05,279
that space between I've consumed a dose

428
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,940
low enough that it's non intoxicating or

429
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:12,599
it's not reducing the number of things I

430
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:16,140
feel comfortable doing or participating

431
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:19,500
in in my daily life and it's also a

432
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,820
large enough dose that it's treating

433
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,920
whatever medical condition you're

434
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,259
seeking to treat with that there may be

435
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:29,310
a threshold a short time period where

436
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:31,589
you are too high you are more high than

437
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:34,169
you'd prefer to be to get the medicine

438
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:36,569
to work medically for you but over a

439
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:39,450
small period of time the high will wear

440
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:41,339
off you'll adjust to the high and the

441
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,460
medicine part will still be valuable

442
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:48,179
I always encourage people to start very

443
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:50,390
very low yes and slowly work out because

444
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,370
I mean unless you're talking about

445
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,200
you've got a cancer diagnosis or

446
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:57,359
something like that

447
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,220
if you're looking to stimulate appetite

448
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:03,689
or or use some anxiety or help you sleep

449
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,960
start off really low start off with five

450
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,630
milligrams you know two and a half

451
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,049
milligrams seven milligrams something

452
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,150
light and see how that affects you and

453
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,589
slowly build up from there I talked to a

454
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,210
couple people that were like I started

455
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:21,000
with 100 milligrams and it's just too

456
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,829
much yeah and it's like well duh like

457
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,359
you just told me you started off with

458
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:25,619
the whole bottle of whiskey and didn't

459
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,459
like what it did to you like that's

460
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:32,069
because you didn't do it right yeah

461
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,470
nice and slow there's a I don't know

462
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:36,779
where to draw the line between medical

463
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,940
dosing and getting high because like I

464
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,009
said earlier you may have to smoke until

465
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,320
you feel a little head buzz before the

466
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:45,629
pain goes away but maybe that's part of

467
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,879
the medicine also maybe that being high

468
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,920
is actually part of what helps with the

469
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,750
medication because you forget that

470
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,210
you've got this condition that makes you

471
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,039
anxious and maybe that mental thing is

472
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,110
actually part of the medical treatment

473
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,990
for some people and it's I mean this is

474
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:02,339
a very individual topic because this is

475
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,309
going to be very different for each

476
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:08,429
person because I know lots of people

477
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:11,849
that need some of those intoxicating

478
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:14,100
symptoms to start kicking in before

479
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:16,829
the anxiety starts to dissipate before

480
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:19,159
the hunger starts to kick in before the

481
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:21,569
muscle spasticity starts to slow down

482
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,100
and then they just kind of have to chill

483
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:25,169
for a minute and wait for a little bit

484
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:28,079
of that intoxication to pass before they

485
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,640
go about whatever else I've gotta excuse

486
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,039
me I've got a traumatic brain injury a

487
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,120
lot of people to listen to the show

488
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,440
they've been through it with me

489
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:43,889
honestly if they've listened for the

490
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:45,509
past two years this episode and there

491
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,590
were a couple episodes where I wasn't

492
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:47,970
even [ __ ] there

493
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:50,099
I don't remember sitting at this table

494
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,390
recording I don't remember it but it

495
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,889
happened and I remember listening to

496
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,230
those episodes going wow I said some

497
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,450
dumb [ __ ] on those podcasts but

498
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,890
sometimes I have leftover effects from

499
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,200
that traumatic brain injury it'll bother

500
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,940
me all day sometimes and it's just

501
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,049
things that you if you have a brain

502
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,820
injury you know I'm talking about I'm

503
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:07,619
not gonna go into detail sometimes I

504
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:09,720
have to get high to make that go away

505
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:11,099
there's not a pill there's not a

506
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,110
treatment there's nothing that works

507
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,639
other than me just being high enough to

508
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:16,349
where I don't remember that that's

509
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,330
bothering me because I have to get

510
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:20,879
distracted from it but it's so

511
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:24,149
bothersome one that I can't get I can't

512
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,150
get away people find cannabis ability to

513
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,759
help you forget extremely beneficial for

514
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:34,560
a variety of medical conditions PTSD

515
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:36,629
nightmares is a big one but um basically

516
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,569
folks if you're not familiar with this

517
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,640
particular aspect of cannabis your body

518
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:43,559
has a system in place for helping you

519
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,680
forget stuff you don't need to know and

520
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:48,839
you don't want to know like if you think

521
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,180
about your last commute to work like how

522
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,949
many blue Chevy's did you pass if

523
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,620
anybody knows here to that question like

524
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,970
please go see a doctor

525
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:59,129
unless you're a man and then you're okay

526
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,660
yeah but your mind isn't supposed to

527
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,850
remember that kind of information

528
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,390
because it's not helpful or useful and

529
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:08,009
for most people who aren't Rainman

530
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:11,670
having that sort of eidetic memory

531
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:13,500
recall is just troublesome trying to

532
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:16,080
remember the important events that

533
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,910
happened in your day is is ridiculously

534
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,419
difficult if you remember every my new

535
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,950
detail and so basic memory you just

536
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,200
remember the important [ __ ]

537
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:28,440
in cannabis helps that system work a bit

538
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,170
more efficiently I've also heard people

539
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,970
describe it is it there's a number of

540
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,029
things your brain takes care of all day

541
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:38,160
like your breathing and your blinking

542
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:40,799
and your sweating that you don't have

543
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,460
conscious effort or conscious awareness

544
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,349
of and like your heartbeat for example

545
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,480
is one a lot of first-time consumers get

546
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:49,619
they get really baked they hear their

547
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,849
heartbeat they think they're gonna have

548
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:54,359
a heart attack and they get all worked

549
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:56,669
up you always hear your heart beat but

550
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,039
your body always hears it so it Tunes it

551
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,600
out until you get baked and then it

552
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,349
forgets that it's got that loop on

553
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:06,179
autopilot and people freaked yeah I

554
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:07,439
gotta go to the hospital man

555
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,410
I'm having a heart attack man I'm

556
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,160
freaking out man a friend of mine a

557
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:16,290
family member we just hit the two-year

558
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,160
anniversary of them showing up to my

559
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:23,909
house the first time they dabbed and

560
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:27,810
they were a very light consumer and they

561
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:29,460
took a huge dab and in their words like

562
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:34,889
as their face was getting warm and

563
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:39,269
tingly they asked what was in that I

564
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:42,060
feel weird and somebody said acid and

565
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:43,889
just not knowing any better they freaked

566
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,929
out and somebody had to give him a ride

567
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,240
home and they were halfway home and they

568
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:51,710
were like don't take me home take me to

569
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:58,559
Mike's house like he'll know what to do

570
00:22:51,710 --> 00:23:01,440
have popsicle you know unwind you a

571
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,819
little bit right it takes caffeine some

572
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,380
coffee and a peanut butter and jelly

573
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:08,159
sandwich most people will be just fine

574
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,600
yep just go slow folks especially when

575
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,210
you're just starting out there are a lot

576
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:15,240
of people come in to cannabis looking

577
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,069
for medical treatments right now they're

578
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,519
not looking to get baked at a concert

579
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:22,079
and so the introduction to the world is

580
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:23,099
very different than it was for a lot of

581
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,079
us right

582
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:27,149
well they this uh they seem like they

583
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,500
have been smoking because she they say

584
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,700
she has trouble with appetite indicas

585
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,230
make her hungry so they know the

586
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,400
difference between indica and sativa and

587
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,410
they know that she can smoke to get

588
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,130
hungry they also say that she's starting

589
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,480
to get anxiety that they

590
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,800
weed is good for so they seem like they

591
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,660
know what they're doing their main

592
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,039
question it feels like was what does

593
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,279
medical treatment look like small

594
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,899
amounts each hour every two hours etc

595
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:49,299
now that honestly is one of my favorite

596
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,730
parts about medical cannabis is that I

597
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:53,230
get to decide what works best for me

598
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,910
they don't give when you go to the

599
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,650
doctor even if the doctor gives you a

600
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,509
prescription for whatever pill you take

601
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,730
I don't take any pharmaceuticals I just

602
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:02,259
don't whatever pill they give you they

603
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,599
put a number on there how many you take

604
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:07,299
every hour and maybe that [ __ ] you up

605
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:07,869
makes you goofy maybe that doesn't take

606
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:10,299
the pain away

607
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:11,589
so there's oh well you get 30 pills

608
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:14,049
you're gonna last you a month that's

609
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:16,419
what you have to do with cannabis maybe

610
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:17,710
you can take a puff this big and it

611
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,110
takes your pain away maybe you got to

612
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,940
take 17 dabs to get to the position you

613
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:24,039
need to be in my favorite part about

614
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,480
cannabis is that I can grow my own or I

615
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,519
can go to the dispensary it sounds like

616
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,130
these folks are girl on their own but my

617
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,500
favorite part is that I can control my

618
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,150
own consumption for the needs that I

619
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,769
need it may be on some days I don't need

620
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,840
it as much on some days I need it a lot

621
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:39,549
more when it's cold my body hurts if I

622
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,990
worked for 12 hours a day in the garden

623
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:42,539
my knees feel blown out and I need to

624
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,069
take extra deads at the end of the day

625
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:47,200
they just my favorite part is being able

626
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:50,049
to decide my medicine so my guidance on

627
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,460
that part is what works best for you is

628
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:54,669
what's got to work if you're smoking

629
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,319
smoked light and then play a little game

630
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,700
take a Saturday and maybe pass your

631
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,159
threshold when you know you're perfectly

632
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,569
medicated smoke a little extra see if it

633
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,740
medicates you better or if you get too

634
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,789
high and it's uncomfortable it's only

635
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,029
gonna last a little bit you'll be just

636
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:06,250
fine

637
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:08,079
but you need to find that window you

638
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,339
need to find where you are you got to

639
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,539
experiment with that a little bit and

640
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:12,159
each train is gonna treat you a little

641
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:13,720
differently so be prepared for some

642
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,509
adjustments and some different stuff

643
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,400
some new things if you're new but

644
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:20,440
especially you first started every time

645
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,269
you bring a different strain especially

646
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,670
if you're shopping in a rec store or

647
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:25,990
retail store or black market on the

648
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,090
black market when you first get that

649
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:34,259
that fresh bag of pot home especially

650
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:34,259
when you're a new consumer a go II see

651
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:43,408
its potency can vary widely even when it

652
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:44,940
cooks the same so just go easy and you

653
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,350
should be should be able to find that

654
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,929
window that's gonna work well for you

655
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:51,089
without too much hunting right if you're

656
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:54,210
eating edibles do five milligrams then

657
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:56,609
do ten in the next day do 20 and find

658
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,259
your zone and if 25 is too much do 20

659
00:25:56,609 --> 00:25:59,339
from now on until it quits working

660
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,990
because you're gonna have to increase

661
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:02,699
just a little bit once the head buzz

662
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,200
starts wearing off also you'll be able

663
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,940
to increase the dosage without getting

664
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,950
so high the last part of the question

665
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,690
says we're in Oregon so strains here can

666
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,399
be different so knowing characteristics

667
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,679
to look for in strains would be very

668
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:15,629
helpful as well not exactly sure what

669
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,600
you mean by that characteristics to look

670
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:20,490
for in strains um into cus stuff it

671
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,408
sounds like it's probably best things

672
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,240
with high CBD if you have lab testing

673
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:26,730
available

674
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,500
maybe LA Confidential Jillybean is a

675
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,110
sativa dominant strain but it's really

676
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,210
mellow and puts a smile on my face and

677
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:35,548
it didn't seem to make me overwhelmingly

678
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,829
high there's something funny Kevin and I

679
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:39,720
were talking uh-huh yes kevro from

680
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,769
elevated concentrations used to be on

681
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,000
the show that's on some of the older

682
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:43,200
episodes he was over the other day we're

683
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,079
taking some dads and we were talking

684
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,640
about old strands we used to smoke

685
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:51,058
deadhead OG hues to make us have to take

686
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,409
a [ __ ] there was a who's dead head og

687
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:53,908
number two that every time somebody

688
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,890
would smoke it they'd be like Brian

689
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:57,419
gotta go like why you got a [ __ ] yeah

690
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,669
how could you tell because that we makes

691
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:02,130
everyone have to [ __ ] so there's some

692
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:04,710
phenotypes of dead head og it'll maybe

693
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,549
good for your gastrointestinal system is

694
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,440
every time I smoked did I had to poo

695
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:11,819
yeah if you can find that one it's all

696
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,850
gonna be about what's available in your

697
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:18,629
area and what works I specifically for

698
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:19,918
your wife's physical makeup because

699
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,659
cannabis is gonna react differently to

700
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,700
everybody I hope that question was about

701
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,559
selecting strains for her if it's about

702
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,240
selecting strains to grow an organ I

703
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:29,308
don't know if you're indoors or outdoors

704
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,589
and I'm really not sure what to

705
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:34,200
recommend for you if you want to email

706
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:36,028
me back and clarify that you know I'll

707
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,509
answer it for you sorry that our best

708
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:41,339
advice is just experiment slowly but

709
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:43,169
unfortunately that's where we're stuck

710
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:45,720
that's the point we're at right now with

711
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:47,730
cannabis which is really good question

712
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,380
but um the thing about it is you just

713
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,000
gotta it's

714
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,640
how do I know how hard of a punch I can

715
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,529
take in the same session a lot when I

716
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,110
was working a sales counter I ran into a

717
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:59,480
lot of people who I mean their story was

718
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:02,119
basically my doctor week and I kind of

719
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,559
ran out of options and somebody in my

720
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,399
medical team was like why don't you go

721
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:11,240
try this and so I drove over here help

722
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,070
yeah and I mean that was my job was

723
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,049
taking those people and then kind of

724
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:17,689
showing them the whole yeah everything

725
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:19,369
and that's what sucks about the new a

726
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,410
lot of the newer law ain't new but the

727
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:22,969
new system back when Mike and I were in

728
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,230
this you could come to our dispensary

729
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,180
and if you weren't sure what strain you

730
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,650
wanted we let you smoke both of them and

731
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:31,820
then you can decide what strain you

732
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:33,500
wanted to by the vaporizer pre-rolled

733
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:35,029
joints of everything I had my favorite

734
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,400
pipe on the counter when we were running

735
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:38,869
madam our I had a bong up there we used

736
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,340
before we got super busy I was having a

737
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:41,779
lot of fun smoking with everybody they'd

738
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:43,879
come just to buy an eighth and smoke it

739
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:47,000
with me it was so much fun but we'd be

740
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,620
able to smoke there and now when you go

741
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,930
to a medical shop it's buy and leave

742
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:52,639
it's pretty much shut up by elite is how

743
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,160
it feels in these medical facilities if

744
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,900
we could consume if we had a little room

745
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,540
in the back where a trained professional

746
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,850
like Mike or myself or there's a lot of

747
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:03,170
others that could help us they could

748
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:04,819
hang out and we could have somebody that

749
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:07,100
could help children and they could help

750
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:10,159
tell them like oh you've got this

751
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:12,230
condition we've seen these results from

752
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,850
this product or this is the best way to

753
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,860
do that or you and I feel like oh you

754
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,849
never smoked weed here's a bowl there's

755
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:18,949
a [ __ ] peanut butter and jelly

756
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:20,269
sandwich there's an Xbox or whatever

757
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,890
you're into there's a place to plug in

758
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:23,599
your iPhone there's a comfy safe spot

759
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,009
take your first ripoff of this weed

760
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,179
we'll show you how to do it don't inhale

761
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:27,470
it no more stop stop you're done you're

762
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,029
gonna be too high you know what I mean

763
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:31,779
because sometimes some people don't know

764
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:34,069
and they'll just get that pipe in oh

765
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:40,009
that is your first hit a weed ever oh

766
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:41,240
man we have to call your mom yeah the

767
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:42,950
first time that's all you need

768
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,289
the second time do two of those third

769
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,630
time three of them see where your

770
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:49,670
threshold is for a lot of people walking

771
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:53,600
into this now smoking is not your only

772
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:55,700
option like I'm sure Oregon's not far

773
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,129
behind Colorado with this but like we

774
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,470
have pills now yes you can just go to

775
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,460
the store and get a five milligram THC

776
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,400
pill

777
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,860
and so you know exactly what milligram

778
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,110
you're taking how often you're taking it

779
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:11,719
and you start I mean you're still stuck

780
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:14,059
experimenting and then figuring out how

781
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,059
many milligrams how often work best for

782
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:19,009
your condition but it's a little easier

783
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:21,139
to dose that way instead of like why

784
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:24,279
take two hits at the Sour Diesel and I

785
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:26,270
take one and a half it to the flow or

786
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:28,430
once you're into it for a little while

787
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:30,349
you'll find your rhythm it becomes fun

788
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,970
it becomes your little ritual and it's

789
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:33,679
part of your thing and that's part of

790
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:36,170
being able to control your own medicine

791
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,820
I feel like I've got my little tabs

792
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,289
everyone's got their stuff differently

793
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:41,149
you carry your products differently

794
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:43,099
everyone's got their little pipe carrier

795
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,600
and a little setup at home it'll become

796
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:47,929
part of your thing would be really fun

797
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:49,879
please do not start your cannabis career

798
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,890

799
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,360

00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,960
paranoid about that you get some quality

812
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:19,339
weed smoke it gently watch some ESPN

813

watch the Golden Girls what are we gonna

814
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:22,579
do hopefully treat you alright and then

815
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:24,259
smoke a little more next time and then

816
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:25,369
smoke one of these days just smoke until

817
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:28,460
you hit that threshold that's what I

818
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:30,109
want to see all right so our email also

825
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,710
taught your wife a little bit about

826
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,558
dosing and I hope that things get better

827
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:52,210
for the whole family

828
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:53,558
ditto ditto yes alright so on the last

829
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,690
we've done some of the episodes I think

830
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:58,148
it was two episodes ago three episodes

831
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,850
ago we talked about some rules that were

832
00:31:58,148 --> 00:32:03,369
coming down the pipe in Colorado some of

833
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:06,158
those have been changed and adjusted SB

834
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:07,268
1228 took another step forward does that

835
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,080
mean it's getting closer to actually

836
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:10,659
happening yep

837
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,128
I'm scared you should be it's gonna

838
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:15,820
change a lot of things for a lot of

839
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:17,528
people in Colorado yep and it's not

840
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:18,939
gonna do anything they think it's gonna

841
00:32:17,528 --> 00:32:20,888
do no it's only gonna make it harder for

842
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,830
medical patients to get access to safe

843
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:26,408
quality cannabis like they need we we

844
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:31,148
gave you good rundown last time but just

845
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:34,210
for anybody who's not familiar SB 1220

846
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:38,558
is this year's version of Colorado's

847
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:41,440
caregiver crackdown Colorado right now

848
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:45,069
the press keeps saying the rule is 99

849
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,629
plants right I've wanted to address that

850
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,678
I was gonna read an article but with the

851
00:32:46,628 --> 00:32:50,378
both of us here we don't even need to

852
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,048
read an article let's start with what

853
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:54,248
the rules were yeah that's that's kind

854
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:59,200
of where I was going with this right now

855
00:32:54,249 --> 00:33:01,629
in Colorado you can you can grow as six

856
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,340
plants is just any adult if you're a

857
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:05,769
recreational anyone over private

858
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:09,548
residents yep six plants in my house no

859
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:12,970
problem no problem if it's you and a

860
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:15,579
spouse or you and another adult over 21

861
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:18,429
12 plants no problem you just double it

862
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:20,769
okay and in Colorado all of these

863
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,840
numbers you cut in half and you can have

864
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:24,579
half and flower and half not in flower

865
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:27,189
okay now is there a limit to how many

866
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:29,138
people live in my house I that depends

867
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:33,490
on where you live a lot of places like

868
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:35,709
Denver several municipalities now have

869
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:38,169
passed their own little local rules

870
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:40,600
saying you can only have 12 you can only

871
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:42,879
have 16 you can only have 18 per

872
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,888
residence okay which already sets up

873
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:47,648
this kind of confusing loophole where

874
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:50,138
you and your roommates have a meeting

875
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:51,908
where you decide who gets to exercise

876
00:33:50,138 --> 00:33:55,628
their constitutional rights and who

877
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:58,240
doesn't and because these are new laws

878
00:33:55,628 --> 00:34:00,649
like these are just bizarre events that

879
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,079
take place in Colorado now

880
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,560
and those are just the recreational

881
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:06,529
rules

882
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:10,369
okay now medical which is what SB 1220

883
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:12,679
is targeting it applies to rec as well

884
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:16,269
but it just enforces that the plant caps

885
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:19,150
stay wide instead of letting it be local

886
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:21,860
medically in Colorado you can grow as

887
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:26,389
your standard medical marijuana count is

888
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:28,360
six plants but depending on what your

889
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:33,259
doctor thinks is medically appropriate

890
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:35,870
your card might save twenty plants or 50

891
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,550
plants or 150 plants and that's where

892
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:39,769
the media is getting confused and saying

893
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,169
the limit was 99 some doctors would

894
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:43,639
recommend 99 plants they were kind of

895
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:45,319
pushing the limits doing that that was

896
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:47,119
only if that doctor felt like it was

897
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,760
appropriate there was never anything

898
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,219
spoken of about it legally there was

899
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,140
kind of a gray area there the medical

900
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:57,039
rules in Colorado have been around since

901
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:59,859
the year 2000 so we're going on 17 years

902
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:03,380
that these rules have been in play now

903
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:05,720
and they've never been officially

904
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:08,539
amended they've just been amended in

905
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:11,569
practice and that's where the 99 plant

906
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:14,360
count comes from is the federal

907
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:17,269
government uses 99 plants is their

908
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,610
cutoff limit for your interesting if you

909
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:22,039
have 99 plants you are not interesting

910
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:24,019
if you have a hundred plants holy [ __ ]

911
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:25,789
Wow look at you you're very interesting

912
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:28,250
the federal government is very

913
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:31,369
interested in what you're doing now I'm

914
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:34,760
in so in practice in Colorado the cutoff

915
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:37,549
limit for the biggest medical marijuana

916
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,970
plant count cards sort of became 99 over

917
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:42,289
time I remember 500 count cards I

918
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:46,299
remember when an acquaintance of ours

919
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:50,150
had six 500 plant counts assigned to his

920
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,620
his name as a caregiver they couldn't

921
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,289
grow anywhere near that amount it was

922
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:55,969
stupid they just didn't have the time

923
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:59,210
the space to the energy of the money but

924
00:35:55,969 --> 00:36:02,329
they they racked up that plant count and

925
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,570
basically every year the rules in

926
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:07,610
practice for this get a little tighter

927
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:09,080
as this state takes a swing at

928
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,240
attempting to officially change the

929
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:13,289
rules and this year it looks like their

930
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:18,029
official rule change might actually make

931
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:21,860
through then this week they decided to

932
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:25,050
tweak the rules that are being proposed

933
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,150
everybody with a medical marijuana card

934
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,340
or any caregiver could grow up to twelve

935
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,230
plants for residents 12 plants per

936
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,240
residents as their proposed camp that's

937
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:35,639
to get that's the automatic default

938
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:39,689
limit is 12 plants per residents in

939
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:41,699
Colorado and if you're a medical

940
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,730
marijuana patient whose medical

941
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:47,460
marijuana card says they need more

942
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,380
plants than twelve or if you've got

943
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,269
multiple people living in a single home

944
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,849
or if you're a caregiver with more

945
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:56,550
plants in patients assigned to you to

946
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:58,589
add up to more than 12 you can go to the

947
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,030
state and local government so like

948
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,860
you're in the city of Pueblo you would

949
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,010
go to the city of Pueblo and the state

950
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:07,680
of Colorado and I'm not sure if it's

951
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:11,130
asked for permission or just let them

952
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,419
know and and sign up and then you could

953
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:16,110
do 24 plants

954
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:19,619
all right so 12 with just a medical

955
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:23,519
marijuana recreation or with an optional

956
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:25,829
on extended plank count or you have to

957
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,300
go register for 24 and then you also

958
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,920
have to have the extended plank out to

959
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,570
go with that yep you would still need

960
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,639
all your paperwork to cover your plant

961
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,820
cow I'll probably have to take that with

962
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:39,150
you when you go to register yep I'm sure

963
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:41,580
that if these rules pass when they pass

964
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:44,460
there will be an official process to go

965
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:46,049
through the really interesting stuff

966
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,150
with what happened with this bill this

967
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:52,920
week is the stuff that isn't really in

968
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:54,389
the press for stuff like this when it

969
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,539
gets a hearing in front of the house of

970
00:37:54,389 --> 00:38:01,049
the senator in this this case I think it

971
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:03,449
was a Senate subcommittee that voted on

972
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,800
it this week there has to be a public

973
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:07,019
announcement that they're holding the

974
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,870
hearing and then for stuff like this

975
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:12,840
it ends up with like hours and hours and

976
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:15,299
hours of redundant testimony is patient

977
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,860
after patient get up and say you know

978
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,240
this is gonna be bad for me this is

979
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,970
gonna make it much harder to get my

980
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,679
medicine and for stuff like this this

981
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:24,659
will kill me because I'm too poor to

982
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:25,799
shop in the stores to buy what I need to

983
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:27,569
make it home

984
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,869
and for the people doing stuff like

985
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:32,519
Phoenix tears in our so you can't afford

986
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:36,960
to buy a pound of recreational marijuana

987
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:39,659
and turn it into medicine right on that

988
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,970
like you can't trust that to turn that

989
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:42,929
into RSO if I don't know where the

990
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:45,569
product came from

991
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:48,089
I have no comfort turning it into an oil

992
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:51,600
to use as a cancer fighting agent when

993
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:53,850
you just think of so you're a wreck a

994
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,269
medical marijuana patient you can buy

995
00:38:53,849 --> 00:39:02,969
two ounces at a time you go to a med

996
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:04,710
shop and buy two ounces go home come

997
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:05,909
back the next day buy two ounces you do

998
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:10,230
that eight times now you've got your

999
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:13,109
pound like already it's taking you

1000
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:15,539
eight days just to inquire right your

1001
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:18,269
base ingredients for your meds for this

1002
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:20,039
month like when your caregiver will show

1003
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:22,619
up with it already processed for you

1004
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,329
right they bring it right to you or you

1005
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:26,039
go pick it up from them depending on how

1006
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:30,299
you've got it arranged yeah depends on

1007
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:32,719
homebound or not so I mean these these

1008
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,039
have serious implications for for people

1009
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,980
people's lives and livelihood at health

1010
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:40,199
and Colorado and so a lot of people tend

1011
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,530
to show up to these hearings so this

1012
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:46,279
week's hearing came out of nowhere and

1013
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:48,900
then when it started it was clear that

1014
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,340
the crowd that's typically there wasn't

1015
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,720
there because the hearing came out of

1016
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:54,869
nowhere no one was expecting it to

1017
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:57,959
happen and then the bill had several

1018
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:59,910
amendments that no one had heard no one

1019
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,210
knew what it was the bill was gonna do

1020
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:05,789
until after it was voted on or after

1021
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:10,320
public testimony was over then the

1022
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:12,529
amendments get discussed and so the

1023
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,030
first time 12:20 went up for hearing

1024
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:18,450
testimony was 9:00 at public testimony

1025
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:20,280
was nine hours yeah this week when it

1026
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:22,710
went up for a hearing it was like an

1027
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,320
hour and 40

1028
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:27,420
in that missing seven hours and change

1029
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:31,230
is the people who didn't have enough

1030
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,210
time and noticed you too and then come

1031
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:35,699
the end of public testimony we hear

1032
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:39,480
these amendments and that's where the

1033
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:42,929
plant camp Platt plant cap changed from

1034
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:46,588
16 statewide as a default back down to

1035
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:48,659
12 with you can register with the state

1036
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:50,009
and county they found a way to charge us

1037
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:52,769
some money they're gonna charge you a

1038
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:56,730
small fee for that 24 i Garin freakin tu

1039
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:58,650
well it looks like a couple of groups

1040
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,900
got together with the governor's office

1041
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:04,079
over the weekend and came up like

1042
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:08,750
hammered out some compromise amendments

1043
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,799
to make a couple of different

1044
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:14,190
organizations that are typically on our

1045
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,250
side of this conversation finally turn

1046
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:18,869
around and support the bill I heard a

1047
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:22,469
number of different groups that had

1048
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:24,390
words like patient caregiver in the name

1049
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:26,509
of their little organization and have

1050
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:31,319
alliance in their yep

1051
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:33,510
or maybe worked out to an acronym that

1052
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:37,500
might be familiar with that or Russian

1053
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:39,869
pilots stayin at getting close enough I

1054
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,329
was shocked at the number of supporters

1055
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:44,730
that had flipped from last week to this

1056
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:47,880
week with saying you know with these

1057
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,740
amendments we can support this bill last

1058
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,579
week we were dead set against it this

1059
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:55,679
week we're okay with it no one really

1060
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:58,440
knows what all happened behind those

1061
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,480
closed doors to get all of these groups

1062
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,720
on board but it seems shady [ __ ] to me

1063
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,338
of course um Kirsten why money right

1064
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:07,618
away

1065
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:10,769
she's an ape Associated Press reporter

1066
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:12,300
follow her Twitter if you want an easy

1067
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:15,690
way to find it go to my Twitter and look

1068
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,950
for retweets an emo Punk 15 on Twitter

1069
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,289
check him out you guys she is all over

1070
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:20,909
the Colorado Legislature think she

1071
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:23,429
writes for the cannabis occasionally um

1072
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:25,108
they use a lot of her stuff but she

1073
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:27,449
works for The Associated Press okay the

1074
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:30,900
cannabis indicates her stuff could do

1075
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:32,759
harm she knows the cannabis beat for

1076
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,680
sure she does some great reporting and

1077
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,560
her Colorado Legislature

1078
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:39,029
14 and this has been phenomenal her

1079
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,179
Twitter feeds been the highlight of my

1080
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:44,610
week two weeks in a row now so check it

1081
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:46,049
out people so if this happens all it's

1082
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:49,140
gonna really do in my opinion is make

1083
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:52,560
medical users have to go to dispensaries

1084
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:54,629
and pay dispensary taxes that's I mean

1085
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,889
that's the real goal behind the bill is

1086
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,890
to get rid of caregivers

1087
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,289
during public testimony the people who

1088
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,750
are supporting it the people who put

1089
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:08,199
this forward they're saying it's gonna

1090
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:10,090
get rid of home grows cartels home grows

1091
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:11,889
being robbed it's the same way that

1092
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:15,160
saying making guns illegal will get rid

1093
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:19,539
of guns this is even dumber sort of yeah

1094
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:21,879
yeah just I mean most gun owners are

1095
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:24,130
law-abiding citizens right and if you

1096
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,680
think bad guys are still gonna have guns

1097
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:28,960
because they're bad guys the people that

1098
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:30,819
they're targeting in this bill are the

1099
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,389
people that are growing large amounts of

1100
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,590
marijuana and sending a note of state

1101
00:43:33,389 --> 00:43:36,879
caregivers aren't doing that no I've got

1102
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:38,440
patients that would beYOU would murder

1103
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,990
me if I grew cannabis and it went

1104
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,860
anywhere but to your lungs there's not

1105
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:47,229
enough you follow the rules and so with

1106
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,180
the rules as they already are I smoke so

1107
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:52,539
much of what I grow yep like you get my

1108
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:55,929
leftovers basically repeatedly during

1109
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:58,449
the testimony people brought up the

1110
00:43:55,929 --> 00:44:01,389
caregiver registry was only became

1111
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:05,289
mandatory January 1st all of the new

1112
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:08,379
doctor rules and regs came down the pipe

1113
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:10,719
in October and so those are just now

1114
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,010
taking effect all the extended plant

1115
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,379
count stuff that we've already covered

1116
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,760
here in Colorado all of that's gone it

1117
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,410
doesn't matter how many plants I'm

1118
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,880
totally legally allowed to grow in

1119
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:23,739
Colorado unless your doctor is willing

1120
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,840
to risk their medical license and go to

1121
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:28,389
court to testify that you need more than

1122
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,240
six plants to treat your condition you

1123
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:34,210
ain't get more than six and so the

1124
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:37,119
people who have are allegedly being

1125
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:38,650
targeted by this bill are the people who

1126
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,630
are scamming the Medical Marijuana

1127
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:43,510
doctors to get extended playing counts

1128
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:45,190
they're it's a scam because those

1129
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,810
patients don't need anywhere near that

1130
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:49,000
level of Medicine so that there's a

1131
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,500
plenty of excess to send out Arkansas or

1132
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,590
wherever they're shipping it to east

1133
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,869
coast bro he's involved in these they

1134
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,700

neighborhood getting busted I was like

1146
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:22,250
seven or eight it was a dude I knew

1147
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,780
because he was friends with someone my

1148
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,400

1149
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,260
lived in California when I was a little

1150
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,150
tiny kitten everybody grew weed where I

1151
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,740
lived I lived in kind of on the coast

1152
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:33,680
and in a kind of the hood

1153
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:35,509
everybody grew weed that's what all the

1154
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:38,239
white people did know every weed we were

1155
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:40,130
kids the marijuana market in the US was

1156
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,769
shifting from an import market to a

1157
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,269
domestic production market so growing

1158
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:48,590
weed in your home has only become more

1159
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:50,269
popular as we've gotten older and in

1160
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:53,090
Colorado we've got a couple of great

1161
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:57,409
sets of laws where our medical marijuana

1162
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:59,240
system lets people treat their ailments

1163
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:02,569
with cannabis they let their doctor

1164
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:04,369
determine how much cannabis is necessary

1165
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:08,390
what how many plants are necessary to

1166
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:10,159
produce that medicine regiment and they

1167
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:12,129
allow you to assign a caregiver so that

1168
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:16,159
I don't have to spend most of my day

1169
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:19,099

1174
00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:35,360
afford my consumption level to keep my

1175
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:39,019
pain to the level where I'm fully

1176
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:43,329
productive member of society I would

1177
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:47,889
have to treat at least some of my pain

1178
00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:50,499
some other way that was not it's

1179
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:52,058
expensive because I don't have a bunch

1180

assign us is your caregiver discounts I

1189

1392
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:41,269
your life is rough but was supposed to

1393
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:44,780
try to get out to Colorado to do a

1394
00:54:41,269 --> 00:54:50,239
podcast with me but her computer took a

1395
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:52,310
big fat giant [ __ ] oh yeah and I've been

1396
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:54,079
trying to encourage Bo to buy herself a

1397
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:55,460
MacBook instead of [ __ ] with Windows

1398
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,039
because that seems to be most of her

1399
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,050
problem and her high ass is a big part

1400
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:02,000
of her problem she admitted it just

1401
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,960
being high you probably were Bo but your

1402
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,119
other problem is that you're [ __ ]

1403
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:08,150
with the Windows machine I've got a 2

1404
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:10,339
terabyte external hard drive and a

1405
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:12,200
MacBook and I record on to the MacBook

1406
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,490
and then I drop it all to the external

1407
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:14,839
hard drive so that I've got it on both

1408
00:55:13,489 --> 00:55:16,039
places and now if something goes wrong

1409
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,260
it's right over there in the hard drive

1410
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:19,969
almost everything I've got backs up to

1411
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,740
that hard drive life you just plug it in

1412
00:55:19,969 --> 00:55:22,819
and the computer just goes oh there's

1413
00:55:21,739 --> 00:55:23,539
that thing and it knows just backup

1414
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,269
right then

1415
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:28,099
