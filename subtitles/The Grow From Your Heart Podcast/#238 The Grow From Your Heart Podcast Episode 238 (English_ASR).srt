I've got a couple of things coming up in

57
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:26,849
this episode we're going to address an

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,099
email that was sent to me from a friend

59
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,650
he wants to talk about something I said

60
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,859
in the episode about bagged seeds so we

61
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,840
will discuss that but first I want to

62
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,450
read a news article that just came out

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,700
this article came out on September 16th

64
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:44,129
I found it in the cannabis of course

65
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,479
this article was written by David McCoy

66
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,060
and Ricardo Baca

67
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,939
and the article headline says Colorado

68
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,789
AG examining pot industry use of organic

69
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,669
term sub-headline says because marijuana

70
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,469
is illegal under federal law the use of

71
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:01,169
the term organic is federally regulated

72
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:03,299
the state licensed cannabis business

73
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:05,280
can't be certified as organic no matter

74
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,659
their practices I'm gonna turn up my

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,180
headphones just a little bit and then I

76
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,549
will read this article for it

77
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,439
and funds allowed enough here we go Mic

78
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,849
Check headphones that's much better all

79
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:16,590
right historical goes like this

80
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:18,060
Colorado's Attorney General is

81
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,620
investigating several marijuana

82
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,449
businesses over concerns the word

83
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,938
organic in their names or advertising

84
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:25,530
might be misleading to consumers the

85
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:27,328
office is reviewing complaints from the

86
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,340
from the consumers that the merchants

87
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,170
have been misrepresenting their product

88
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,479
when they say organic or organically

89
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,908
grown said Roger Hudson spokesman for

90
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,169
state attorney general cynthia coffman

91
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:38,548
we're looking for information inside

92
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:40,708
those complaints to make a determination

93
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,650
on what those next steps are

94
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,299
is it consumer fraud is it criminal the

95
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,799
agz office would not give more detail on

96
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,599
the scope of the investigation but a

97
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,938
lawyer who represents a marijuana

98
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:53,280
business contacted by investigators said

99
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:55,500
it appears to have limits the inquiry

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,568
includes grow operations some with

101
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,519
organic in their names recently caught

102
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,229
up in Denver quarantines over pesticide

103
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,150
concern concerns attorney Sean

104
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:04,378
McAllister said sorry guys I read that

105
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,750
statement a little bit oddly but you

106
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:09,298
caught what I said or what it said the

107
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,188
AG is ensuring that business is ensuring

108
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,989
that businesses that use the word are at

109
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:15,478
least consistent with the concept of

110
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,069
organic McAllister said because

111
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,199
marijuana is illegal under federal law

112
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:21,418
and use of the term organic is federally

113
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,430
regulated a licensed cannabis business

114
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,889
cannot be certified as organic no matter

115
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,780
its practices as such no marijuana

116
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,908
businesses in Colorado can technically

117
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,500
use the word in its name or in selling

118
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:34,439
its product according to officials and

119
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,209
industry insiders potential fraud

120
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,918
penalties under the Colorado consumer

121
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,829
protection act include fines of up to

122
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,000
ten thousand dollars per violation

123
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:43,620
Federal Rules say that business is

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,139
wrongly selling a product as organic

125
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,500
could face fines of up to ten thousand

126
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,930
dollars

127
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,089
yet those rules have not been enforced

128
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,819
in Colorado's marijuana businesses until

129
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,888
now state marijuana license records show

130
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,719
that twenty nine businesses growers

131
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,329
retailers and dispensaries use the word

132
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,789
organic in their name some use a trade

133
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:04,829
name containing the word organic to

134
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:06,629
market marijuana products or use the

135
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:09,629
term or do use the term in their

136
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,339
advertised a spot check of websites by

137
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:13,649
the Denver Post found businesses

138
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,658
claiming to sell 100% organic cannabis

139
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:18,000
offering organic treatments of medical

140
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:19,949
marijuana or use only organic methods to

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,478
produce their product some shops

142
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,889
describe their product as grown in

143
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,498
organic soil or that they

144
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,050
use organic growing techniques another

145
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:29,759
website touts certification of organic

146
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,400
standards and testing that mirrors the

147
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,949
US Department of Agriculture organic

148
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,138
certification Brook Weis owner of the

149
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,340
growing kitchen in Boulder said that

150
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,228
she's willing to take the risk of

151
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,089
labeling her company's edibles made with

152
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:44,068
certified organic seeds and fruits as

153
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:46,859
organic even if the marijuana in them

154
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:48,449
isn't it's a principle an ideology that

155
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,090
doesn't belong to anybody she said

156
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,528
nothing her plants noting her plants

157
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,778
would be certified organic if that

158
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:57,449
existed on the list of sacrifices and

159
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:59,848
Gamble's I take organic is definitely on

160
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,288
there but river rock cannabis in Denver

161
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:03,209
has backed away from using the term

162
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:04,918
until recently the company had been

163
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:07,348
known as river rock organic medical

164
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,028
cannabis the Attorney General sent

165
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:12,000
something saying that no dispensary can

166
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:14,310
be certified as organic retail manager

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,959
Chris Haggerty said the company changed

168
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,370
signs stopped handing out promotional

169
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,899
items with the company's name and even

170
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,389
stopped selling t-shirts with the old

171
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:23,338
company name Haggerty said a group

172
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,228
seeking to have marijuana certifiable as

173
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:27,389
organic said a system for informing

174
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:29,728
consumers how marijuana is grown is

175
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,680
needed the word organic is being used

176
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:33,120
inappropriately by people who are using

177
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,949
very toxic chemicals

178
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,079
there's no governing agency that is

179
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,000
regulating that said John Paul max field

180
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,459
co-founder of the organic cannabis

181
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,528
Association in Denver in the absence of

182
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,778
a body coming through and branding

183
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:47,610
organic cannabis that term can be used

184
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:50,848
by everybody even if it's not done

185
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,649
properly the USDA accredits companies

186
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:54,509
and state governments to certify any

187
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:56,939
farm is complying with federal Organic

188
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,770
regulations for agricultural products no

189
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:01,169
company may use the term without this

190
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:03,269
certification marijuana may not be

191
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:06,418
certified organic under the USDA Organic

192
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:07,829
regulations said a USDA spokesman who

193
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,209
could not be named because it's the

194
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:11,430
agency's policy when discussing

195
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:12,870
marijuana marijuana is considered a

196
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,550
controlled substance at the federal

197
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,098
level an organic certification is

198
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,699
reserved for agricultural products the

199
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:22,288
USDA's National Organic Program rules

200
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:24,060
say companies with organic in their name

201
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:26,158
cannot prominently display it on a

202
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,110
product and cannot use the name at all

203
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:29,939
if it misrepresents that a product has

204
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,800
been certified organic

205
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,990
it falls to the Colorado Department of

206
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,819
Agriculture to certify and accredit

207
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,829
agricultural businesses in the state as

208
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,810
organic as well as police for

209
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:43,439
inappropriate and illegal uses of the

210
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,959
word on behalf of the USDA if the state

211
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,610
chose to certify marijuana as organic it

212
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,069
would have to ignore federal rules and

213
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,199
that's unlikely said Mitch here director

214
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:55,149
of CDA's plant industry division

215
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,009
um that's weird because we've already

216
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:59,079
ignored federal rules and we have

217
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,029
legalized recreational cannabis so why

218
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,649
wouldn't we just do it again anyway

219
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,509
that's my opinion on that the state's

220
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,709
inquiry came after the Denver Department

221
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:08,379
of Environmental Health this year

222
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:10,839
quarantined more than 100,000 marijuana

223
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:12,879
plants over pesticide concerns one

224
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,250
company organic greens tested positive

225
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,079
for unapproved pesticides but because it

226
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,939
operates publicly as natural remedies

227
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,060
the eggs office allowed it to keep its

228
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:23,920
name said McAllister its attorney

229
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,750
they're actual corporation name is

230
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,759
organic greens but they don't use it in

231
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,220
advertising so they don't publicize

232
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,470
themselves as organic they don't do any

233
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,110
advertising as organic so nobody's being

234
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,259
mislead McAllister said confirming the

235
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,730
company name under AG scrutiny

236
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:41,620
McAllister said the AG is focusing at

237
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:44,080
least in part on companies that have

238
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,610
used pesticide that have used pesticides

239
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,770
not allowed by the state for use on

240
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,180
marijuana they understand you can't get

241
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:52,149
federal certification for the word

242
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:54,009
organic in marijuana he said the agz

243
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,840
office is not substituting themselves

244
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:58,000
for a certification agency but if they

245
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,980
clearly but if it's clearly not organic

246
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,379
if someone's using Mallett or Eagle 20

247
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,870
they're also looking for those cases

248
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:07,389
ballot Neagle 20 our pesticide trade

249
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,009
beams well whose active ingredients

250
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:12,189
contain chemicals the state has not

251
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:13,929
approved for use on marijuana I've said

252
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,890
this on a previous episode but I was

253
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,419
speaking with somebody from the

254
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,939
Department of Agriculture they actually

255
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:20,500
came to I'm the master grower at the

256
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,570
spot dispensary so I had to meet with

257
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,049
the Department of Agriculture they sent

258
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,940
two reps down to come talk to us and the

259
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:30,250
main rep told me that the main reason

260
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,740
that Eagle 20 has been banned from

261
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,110
dispensary uses is because if there is a

262
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,129
fire and the Eagle 20 burns the

263
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,009
off-gassing

264
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:40,330
turns into cyanide and the fire

265
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:42,759
department doesn't want to go into a

266
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,250
building that is filled with the gas of

267
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,809
cyanide so that's mainly why Eagle 20

268
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,909
has been banned also it's completely

269
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:50,559
toxic but he didn't even seem to care

270
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:52,209
about the toxicity of the product he

271
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,039
just wanted to tell me about it turning

272
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,530
into cyanide is why it's been banned

273
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,240
from use in commercial growth facilities

274
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,769
so I'll keep going with the article

275
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,840
there's one more sentence here left one

276
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:03,639
more short paragraph it says although no

277
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,590
chemical pesticide can obtain federal

278
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:07,240
approval for use on cannabis state

279
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,470
agriculture officials have determined

280
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,779
which products have labels whose

281
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,330
restrictions are so broadly worded that

282
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:17,079
using them on marijuana would not be a

283
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:19,330
violation so they're cracking down on it

284
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,009
you guys when I first started in the

285
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,509
medical marijuana world I was shopping

286
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:25,269
at a dispensary that had the word

287
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:26,799
organic in it and I knew right away when

288
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:28,539
I looked at the medicine when I saw how

289
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,149
they grew I knew there was nothing to do

290
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:33,709
with actual organics and we're just

291
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:35,959
trying to use the word organic as a

292
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:40,879
a marketing ploy and it was working and

293
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:44,810
also just to put this out there they do

294
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,750
require that all of the ingredients used

295
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:49,729
in the grow anything that was sprayed or

296
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,000
fed to the plants does have to be listed

297
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,590
on an instruction list or instruction

298
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,149
ingredients list I'm sorry an

299
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,860
ingredients list on the outside of the

300
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,019
container so all of that [ __ ] does have

301
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,269
to be listed on the package that the

302
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:04,340
cannabis or hatch is sold and actually

303
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:05,509
let me reach over here this is just the

304
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,280
inner packaging this one doesn't have

305
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,569
the ingredients on it sorry but most of

306
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,129
the time it's got a few things written

307
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,870
on it and if you come by cannabis in the

308
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:14,299
state of Colorado you'll get a little

309
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,009
jar like a childproof jar or whatever

310
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,479
they put the cannabis in and it'll have

311
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,700
some ingredients listed on it and you'll

312
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,399
see things like calcium and you'll see

313
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,900
things like mykos and beneficial

314
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,429
bacteria and you'll see stuff like that

315
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,220
that's all what was used in the growing

316
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:30,079
of the plant so they will also hopefully

317
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,300
list any pesticides that were sprayed on

318
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,580
there all right so they're cracking down

319
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:36,620
on the name organic then they are also

320
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,300
cracking down to make sure that your

321
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,980
[ __ ] is organic which I really

322
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:41,659
appreciate I really like that because

323
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,920
there are a lot of shops serving up do

324
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,299
do that you can tell it was not

325
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:46,969
organically grown you can taste the

326
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:49,879
fertilizers in it I know friends that

327
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:53,029
own hydro shops and I know friends that

328
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:55,279
are reps and consultants for

329
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:57,289
dispensaries and they go to places they

330
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,610
claim to be running organics and then

331
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:00,259
when they make their order from the

332
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,909
hydro shop or when they set up a

333
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,439
nutrient schedule with the consultant

334
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:05,689
they go with the product that is

335
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,970
completely not organic and they don't

336
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,020
seem to give a [ __ ] but you can't say

337
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,440
anything you just gotta let them do

338
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,659
their thing

339
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,240
so I'm glad now somebody is going to

340
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:15,649
call them out and make them accountable

341
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,350
alright I'm gonna take a DAB in a quick

342
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,120
drink and then we're going to address an

343
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,060
email that was sent to us by a listener

344
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,250
about something I said an episode number

345
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:27,229
90 so hang out for a few seconds and

346
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,639
I'll be right back all right you guys I

347
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,080
am back I just wanted to let you know if

348
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,759
you hear a bunch of a ruckus in the

349
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,200
background there there are no hostages

350
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,299
in my house there's actually a football

351
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,790
game happening right now there's a

352
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:39,409
Denver Broncos game and my neighbors are

353
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,699
having a party and I got my window open

354
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:42,259
a little bit so whenever something

355
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,230
happens in the game you can hear them

356
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:46,029
either cheer or jeer whichever way it

357
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,830
goes

358
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:49,689
it's pretty entertaining so if you hear

359
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,070
the screams no I don't have hostages

360
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,320
here in the house it's just a football

361
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,379
game and people are going crazy

362
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,330
um so alright just a few days ago I

363
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:59,799
received an email from a friend of ours

364
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,420
let's get into this email and pulling it

365
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,219
up in my phone right now here we go

366
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:05,229
all right this email is from our friend

367
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,480
Justin and it says I just listened to

368
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,759
episode 90 I guess I was operating on

369
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,590
some incorrect information you and Jessi

370
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,509
seemed to feel like Herms are really bad

371
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,530
I was told her seeds were pretty much

372
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,230
feminized seeds

373
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:19,539
since the genetics all came from female

374
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,000
so basically we would revenge out plants

375
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:23,980
after harvest and then light poison them

376
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,600
to make seeds for the future so I'm

377
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,789
wondering if those progeny from the

378
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,920
seeds would be predisposed to Herm in

379
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:32,019
the future if you could just explain a

380
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,000
little to me or recover this on the show

381
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:37,840
I would super-duper love that thanks

382
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,850
Ross to Jeff from Justin G alright so

383
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,370
the seeds you're talking about are not

384
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,920
necessarily Herms hermaphrodite seeds

385
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,350
are different hermaphrodite seeds come

386
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,849
from when there is a female plant in the

387
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,730
room that suddenly pops a male flower

388
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:55,330
and that male flower pollinates the room

389
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,550
and a few seeds happen from that small

390
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,500
pollination so there's a big difference

391
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:01,029
in kind of a hermaphrodite seed and what

392
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,980
you're talking about I took a few notes

393
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:04,419
and wrote a few things down I'm gonna

394
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,370
kind of try to read this to you and

395
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:09,250
sound like I'm not reading something to

396
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:11,529
you but here's what I wrote those seeds

397
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,419
that you made are made by stressing the

398
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:15,789
plants so it has so as long as there

399
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:18,879
were no males or stray pollen available

400
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:20,740
to the females and also the females are

401
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,049
solid females the seeds produced will be

402
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,389
females because of the lack of a why

403
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:27,969
male chromosome so technically those

404
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:29,949
won't be herm seeds if the none of the

405
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,779
females hermaphrodite it and made male

406
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,030
flowers they release pollen on in there

407
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,199
and they should be feminized so as long

408
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:36,850
as none of your female plants are

409
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,500
throwing off bananas or male pollen

410
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,110
sacks you will be making female seeds

411
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,379
here um if a plant is allowed to flower

412
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,570
for too long it'll often make seeds if a

413
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:48,189
plant is light stressed which is what

414
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,170
you guys are doing then those plants

415
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,900
will make seeds and those seeds are

416
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:55,959
feminized another way to make feminized

417
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:57,970
seeds is soma takes a plant that is

418
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,400
almost finished it'll be around week six

419
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,870
or seven for like a nine week plan

420
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,840
he'll take it around week six or seven

421
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,389
and then he will light a small fire and

422
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,310
put that fire next to the plant to make

423
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:09,509
it feel like it's in a forest fire he

424
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,699
will heat the [ __ ] out of the plant

425
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,080
he'll move the heat around the plant and

426
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,210
kind of freak it out and that plant

427
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,250
thinks it's in a forest fire and it's

428
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,110
panic reaction is to start making seeds

429
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,330
so I'll have to give it four to six

430
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,669
weeks from there to finish seeding but

431
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:27,389
by week twelve someone will have a big

432
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:29,909
batch of feminized s1 seeds that don't

433
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:33,029
have any other chromosomes in them

434
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:35,809
except this chromosomes coming from that

435
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:38,480
plant so you're going to be basically

436
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:41,219
copying the plant that you just stressed

437
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,629
so you are making feminized seeds there

438
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,370
when Jesse and I were talking about

439
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:47,159
hermaphrodite seeds we were talking more

440
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,889
about seeds that were caused by a

441
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:52,620
hermaphrodite issue in a row say one of

442
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:55,259
your females were to pop a pollen sack

443
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,480
during week seven or whatever our week

444
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,860
six or seven and that hits another plan

445
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,710
and it pollinates and it makes a little

446
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,810
bit of seed that seed will be kind of

447
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:06,180
questionable it may have from afroditi

448
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:08,250
traits but it still could be gold as

449
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:09,599
what we were talking about so there's a

450
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,940
little bit of difference in herim seed

451
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,009
and what you're doing a herm seed is

452
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,780
kind of a trait issue what you're doing

453
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,759
is kind of a manipulation sort of a

454
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:20,089
stressing and a panic reaction sort of a

455
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,279
thing I encourage you to keep doing that

456
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,389
you got any extra seeds man I'd love to

457
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,110
grow a couple of those and see what they

458
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:29,340
do I'll take some pictures for you so

459
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,509
one thing that I do that's kind of on

460
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,129
this realm and this is just because I

461
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:34,259
wanted to rant about this it's kind of

462
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:35,070
what this reminded me of before I breed

463
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,379
with plants

464
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,240
I will take my females and I will put

465
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:40,830
them in the flowering room and I will

466
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,629
set the timer to twelve twelve and I'll

467
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:45,389
let them flower for about two weeks and

468
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:48,870
as soon as I see Bud set I will reverse

469
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:50,580
the timer from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. I

470
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,529
will now have them off from 9:00 a.m.

471
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,690
and 9:00 p.m. and they will come on at

472
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:57,539
9:00 p.m. till 9:00 a.m. for about five

473
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,670
days and then after five or six days I

474
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:01,049
will put the timer back to the original

475
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:02,789
twelve twelve they'll come on at 9:00

476
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:04,319
a.m. and go off at 9:00 p.m.

477
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,730
and I'll pay real close attention to

478
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,769
them for about a week and a half and

479
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,660
then I'll [ __ ] with the timer again I'll

480
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:11,819
turn it on for twenty four hours

481
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,830
why not and then I'll just do weird

482
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,289
[ __ ] with my schedules in there and then

483
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,599
I'll put it back on 12:12 for a few days

484
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:20,700
and watch the plants and if they start

485
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,289
freaking out real bad then I kind of get

486
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,080
rid of the plants that can't handle some

487
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:26,369
stress sometimes I go why it stress

488
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,139
testing cuz a little bit will tell me

489
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,669
what I want to see but sometimes you get

490
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,830
curious as a grower and you want to go

491
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,120
through and really pummel a female plant

492
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:34,529
and see what that [ __ ] can handle

493
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,989
before you go putting her into a major

494
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:39,839
breeding project so I've actually got a

495
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,029
couple of plants that I can take them to

496
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,649
week two and totally reverse the light

497
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:45,480
cycle and it doesn't piss them off

498
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,759
I can do it a couple of times and they

499
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,150
don't her mout however if I let those

500
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:53,279
same plants go long enough without any

501
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,259
light stress if I let them go too long

502
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,750
they will start to produce seeds cuz

503
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,970
I've let some strains go up to 80 days

504
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,650
strains that should only go 60 I have

505
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,450
let them go 80 just to see what happens

506
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,590
when you grow as much as we do in a

507
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,840
plant with some things to tell you learn

508
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:09,119
a lot of [ __ ] I let him go a little bit

509
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,549
long just to see what happened and it

510
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,399
was seeded the plant had by that 20

511
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,809
extra days put seeds in my plant so you

512
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,430
can do it by light stress you can do it

513
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:19,589
by extending them there's a lot of

514
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,810
different ways to do it if you're going

515
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:23,549
to stress test your females I kind of

516
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,589
just told you how I would do it I would

517
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,480
just [ __ ] with the light cycles as a

518
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:28,919
breeder one thing I want to say is when

519
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,809
you grow out those seeds that you're

520
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,210
making from manipulated plants really

521
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:35,039
pay close attention to hermaphroditic

522
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,930
traits you may not find that

523
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,759
hermaphrodites until like week eight of

524
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,220
a nine week plant or of a ten week plant

525
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,829
so really pay attention to that that

526
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,839
shouldn't be there but you are making a

527
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:48,629
manipulated seed that's not natural so

528
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,949
there is a chance for some weirdness all

529
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,050
right I hope that answered your question

530
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,940

bit sometimes because I do get a lot of

550
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:32,049
messages of course I've got the IRA

551

552
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:36,129
I've got my own personal email account

553
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:37,629

periscope videos I've been getting a lot

555
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,380
more messages so things are going a

556
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:44,049
little bit crazy Facebook Instagram

557
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,570
Twitter all that stuff keeps me tied up

558
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:48,369
and I've been working at the spot doing

559
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:50,169
quite a few hours every week so that

560
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:51,879
limits my time for social media but I

561
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,580

growers house when I went to do a

590
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:49,599

say this guy has his [ __ ] together

677

00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,449
they'll lighten up and then maybe

679
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:35,419

recreational dispensary and sacred seed

from their store shelves

761
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:44,669

Monaco told the Denver Post about the

763

recall we're working through the process

764
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,519
and we'll have a statement on our

765
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:52,139
Twitter feed later tonight the sacred

766
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,119
seed recall apparently was the result of

767
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,350
pesticides a rogue employee secretly

768
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:57,359
applied in the middle of the night

769
00:29:55,349 --> 00:30:00,119
without permission CEO Jeremy Kilbourne

770
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,048
told the Post now is that just an excuse

771
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,369
you guys or do you think that that

772
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:04,470
really happened do you think they really

773
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:05,819
had a rogue employee go in the grow

774
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,240
rooms in the middle of the night and

775
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:10,769
spray pesticides now that pesticide had

776
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,609
to be in the damn building for that dude

777
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,289
to put in the sprayer

778
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,089
let me see had to go to the store he had

779
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:16,409
to buy a pesticide he had to drive to

780
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:18,539
work he had to wait for everybody else

781
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,650
to leave he had to mix that [ __ ] up and

782
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:22,349
then he had to spray this [ __ ] on the

783
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:24,269
plants I'm not gonna lie call them out

784
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:26,699
and say [ __ ] but I might say that

785
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:30,119
I'm not completely sure I completely buy

786
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,610
that whole story because how would they

787
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,798
know that a rogue employee did that if

788
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:38,129
nobody ever said anything until the [ __ ]

789
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:40,079
was tested and found spray on it like

790
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,610
they just oh yeah that was that time

791
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,928
that that guy did that they didn't know

792
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:44,250
that I feel like they just made that up

793
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:46,559
the more I talk about it the more I feel

794
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:49,230
like they are just using that as a

795
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:52,440
cop-out anyway I want to get back into

796
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:55,440
the article the next paragraph lists all

797
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,120
of the origin RM CF numbers on all the

798
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,529
products that are recalled because I

799
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,709
don't feel the need to read all of these

800
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:03,119
numbers 90% of my audience is not in

801
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,130
Colorado anyway so most of you guys

802
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,558
don't have any of these products if you

803
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,210
bought mahatma products you may want to

804
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:12,058
contact the dispensary where you got

805
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,919
them and you may want to get a refund so

806
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:15,690
i'm going to continue it says as in the

807
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,460
city's prior marijuana recall return

808
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,259
products cannot be sold until additional

809
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,539
testing clears them of residues of the

810
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,849
disallowed pesticides the businesses

811
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:25,649
also have the discretion to destroy them

812
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:27,449
we're in a state of shock killed weren't

813
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,548
said we pulled everything off of our

814
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,410
shelves self quarantined our grow and

815
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:32,970
our product we don't wholesale so no one

816
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,519
has our product out there except the

817
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,529
small amount of trim for processing the

818
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,599
product subject to the recall had been

819
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:41,428
tested at Muhammad Mahatma concentrates

820
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,439
in Denver which was already under a

821
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:45,419
recall issued September 8th for its own

822
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,548
products that had tested positive for

823
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,049
pesticides that state agriculture

824
00:31:47,548 --> 00:31:51,539
officials have not cleared for the use

825
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:53,308
on cannabis the city's inquiry of

826
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:55,499
Mahatma extended to several business

827
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:57,509
that send it marijuana trimmings for

828
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:59,460
processing into edible concentrates such

829
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:01,259
as wax and shatter which are then

830
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,749
returned or distributed to different

831
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:06,058
stores as a result of the first recall

832
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:08,100
Mahatma beacon pesticide testing on all

833
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:10,440
marijuana trimmings that arrived in its

834
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:12,509
Denver facility it was that testing that

835
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,149
found pesticides in the latest recalled

836
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:16,740
products Gilbert said Mihama informed

837
00:32:15,148 --> 00:32:18,628
him of the test results and the company

838
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,190
immediately contacted officials at the

839
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:22,378
Colorado marijuana Enforcement Division

840
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,090
we're going to be getting a tested and

841
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:25,949
figuring out the extent of damage and

842
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:28,259
destroying materials or throwing it out

843
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,048
however environmental help however

844
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:32,429
environmental health wants us to do

845
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:35,128
Kilbourne said we're reeling we're

846
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:36,899
reeling right now Kilburn said the

847
00:32:35,128 --> 00:32:38,908
sacred seed employee responsible for the

848
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:40,798
pesticide misuse had left on Tuesday and

849
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:43,499
offered an explanation in a resignation

850
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:46,019
letter he said I'm so sorry we had a

851
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:47,700
minor bug problem and I was concerned we

852
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,769
were going to lose the crop kill Warren

853
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,409
said of the letter not only did we tell

854
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:54,450
him not to use those pesticides we had

855
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:56,639
sent him on to and two others to

856
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,869
specialized pesticide handlers training

857
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:01,229
through the Colorado Department of

858
00:32:57,868 --> 00:33:03,089
Agriculture it was unclear how Dan rec

859
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,378
learned of the test results n'ver

860
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:06,569
inspectors said they only found

861
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:08,579
application log books for the past 30

862
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:10,648
days at Dan ray and the business that

863
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:12,199
older ones had been destroyed reports

864
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:15,018
show

865
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,450
this is weird a letter of resignation

866
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:19,130
with an apology and destroy Devas in

867
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,679
evidence this is turning into a cannabis

868
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,240
soap opera this is kind of neat the CDA

869
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,440
issued a list earlier this year of

870
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,450
products it says can be used on

871
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,308
marijuana because the drug is illegal

872
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,750
under federal law no pesticide is

873
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:31,819
specifically approved for use on

874
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,319
cannabis but some label restrictions are

875
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:35,689
so broadly written that using the

876
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:37,759
chemical would not violate federal law

877
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,380
mandates that no pesticide may be used

878
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,929
in a manner that is not consistent with

879
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,580
its label most marijuana growers are not

880
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:45,710
well-informed about pesticide use and

881
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:47,689
the rules behind them see dia CDA

882
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,429
officials have said so what appears to

883
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,788
solve a problem in a greenhouse could

884
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:53,720
actually be a violation of law

885
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:55,700
pesticides are regulated by the US

886
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,038
Environmental Protection Agency and it

887
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:01,880
offers no information about marijuana

888
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:05,089
because the drug is illegal so now we

889
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,799
are not able to test pesticides on

890
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:08,929
cannabis to find out the long-term

891
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,969
effect to find out how long that product

892
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,320
stays in the cannabis to find out how

893
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:14,809
much of it actually makes it to the

894
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,789
concentrate it's illegal to test these

895
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:18,588
pesticides on cannabis in the way that

896
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:21,858
we need to do it to find what combats

897
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:24,349
are our problems because cannabis is

898
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:25,398
federally illegal I'm sure you guys know

899
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:28,099
where I'm headed with this right the

900
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:29,378
solution to this problem right I'm sure

901
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:32,389
you guys all want to say it with me

902
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:33,618
legalize cannabis then we can test this

903
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,119
[ __ ] properly and we'll solve this

904
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:37,579
problem just legalize it they can make

905
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,619
money off of the testing labs would make

906
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:42,560
money there's another avenue of revenue

907
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:44,000
right there so there are more products

908
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,608
being recalled you guys because of

909
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,349
pesticides Mahama concentrates is

910
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:50,059
actually taking it upon themselves to

911
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:52,818
start testing everything that comes in

912
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:54,529
before they run it before they do the

913
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:56,989
extraction process they were testing all

914
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,540
the material that comes in I give kudos

915
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:01,009
to Mahatma that is a bold step and that

916
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:02,630
is a brave thing to do they have to pay

917
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,160
for the testing which cost money and

918
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,720
then they're also going to lose

919
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,309
clientele because anything that does

920
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:10,098
come back with the contaminate and it

921
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:12,259
cannot be ran so big shout out to

922
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:14,510
Mahatma you guys if you're coming to

923
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,430
Colorado to buy products I want you to

924
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,560
feel safe and this is what we're doing

925
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:20,480
to make you feel safe we're making sure

926
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,449
there are not ridiculous pesticides in

927
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,619
here

928
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:26,338
and they mentioned that Department of

929
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:28,680
Agriculture applicators training course

930
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:31,049
in this article if you are a growing

931
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:35,399
cannabis I recommend that you go and

932
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:37,829
read your state's pesticide applicators

933
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,269
training manual or certification manual

934
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:41,369
whatever it is it varies state by state

935
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:45,170
but your Department of Agriculture in

936
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:47,519
your state will have a an applicators

937
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,289
training guide or a certification guide

938
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,659
or something go read it you will learn

939
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:54,029
so much about pesticides about pesticide

940
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,368
use about pesticide safety you will

941
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,380
learn that most of these products are

942
00:35:56,369 --> 00:36:00,300
all derived from the same thing and they

943
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,539
are mixed with other carrier agents and

944
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:06,839
that alone will be a useful tool in your

945
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:08,400
ganja growing arsenal alright I do in

946
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:11,279
the future plan on doing an integrated

947
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,930
pest management episode I've got two

948
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,339
people lined up that I want to have on

949
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:15,809
that show and getting them here at the

950
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,789
same time has been a challenge I may

951
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:19,858
just do two separate episodes and get

952
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:21,088
them both on separate episodes alright

953
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:22,139
that was the news article that I wanted

954
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:23,730

960
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:37,338
how this pesticide drama has been going

961
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:39,869
and I wanted to kind of give props to

962
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:41,519
Mahatma concentrates for just stepping

963
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:43,318
up their game they're testing everything

964
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,000
now they found out they had a problem

965
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:46,349
instead of trying to hide it they're

966
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,579
like hey we [ __ ] up and look what

967
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:49,019
we're gonna do we're gonna test

968
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,970
everything it's gonna make a lot of

969
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:54,239
people accountable and I like the way

970
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:55,649
that this industry is moving all right I

971
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,209
do want to talk about one more thing you

972
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:59,460
guys this is just going to be a short

973
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,108
episode this is just a bonus Thursday

974
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,550
episode I wanted to get that news

975
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:04,529
article out but since I'm here recording

976
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,829
I want to talk about something that I

977
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:10,140
saw a few days ago while I was at a

978
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:11,910
consultation a lot of times when I go to

979
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:13,650
a consultation that people will have a

980
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:16,259
problem that they need corrected but

981
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,730
sometimes they just want me to observe

982
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,770
what they're doing and see what we can

983
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,269
improve or make easier for them that

984
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:23,969
will make their cannabis crop come out a

985
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:25,829
little bit better so I want to tell you

986
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:28,500
guys a little something about what I saw

987
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:30,269
at a consultation with a client a few

988
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,650
days ago and I just want to kind of

989
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:33,150
correct this and I don't know if you're

990
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,139
doing this wrong or if you could be

991
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,059
doing this better

992
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:38,368
I'm sure that there are a couple people

993
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:40,890
out there who will benefit from this so

994
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:43,470
I was just watching this guy working his

995
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:44,608
garden I just showed up at his house I

996
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,868
was like what's up man I know you need

997
00:37:44,608 --> 00:37:47,130
help let's go check it out and we walked

998
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:49,289
out there and he said I saved all my

999
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,670
chores for when you got here and we're

1000
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:51,569
just gonna do my gardening I was like

1001
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,130
that sounds great

1002
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:54,358
so I helped him out of filled some

1003
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,028
buckets and we did what we did and I

1004
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:59,940
watched him now the first thing this

1005
00:37:57,028 --> 00:38:02,130
dude did that I corrected was this guy

1006
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,200
gets a five gallon bucket and He pours

1007
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,180
his nutrients into a glass to measure

1008
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,219
and then he pours all the nutrients into

1009
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:11,608
the five gallon bucket you guys you

1010
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:14,429
cannot do that I will explain why I am

1011
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:15,778
NOT a scientist but I know why these are

1012
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:17,969
the reason that they're sold in

1013
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:19,349
different bottles so if you go by I'm

1014
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:20,969
just gonna use advance nutrients because

1015
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:23,460
it's the product that it's popped up in

1016
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:25,649
my mind they've got they've got a flower

1017
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,778
a they've got a flower B and then

1018
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,849
there's like a bloom booster and then

1019
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:31,739
there's like a flavor booster advanced

1020
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,809
nutrients has so many bottles the reason

1021
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:37,259
those are all sold separately is because

1022
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:40,920
if they put those products all into one

1023
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,559
container the elements in there will

1024
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,139
bond that's why we need to add those

1025
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:47,789
products to water and never mix them

1026
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:49,768
together concentrate those are very

1027
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:51,809
concentrated products you're only adding

1028
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:53,699
a few milliliters to five gallons of

1029
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:55,380
water so the first thing I'm gonna say

1030
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:57,298
is fill up your container that you're

1031
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,338
going to mix into probably a five gallon

1032
00:38:57,298 --> 00:39:02,309
bucket filled out with water first

1033
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:03,480
preferably reverse osmosis water but we

1034
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:05,789
can't all do that so fill your

1035
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,250
five-gallon bucket with water always

1036
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:10,259
fill it with water first then add the

1037
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:12,088
nutrients to the water never mix

1038
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:14,909
nutrients without water they are

1039
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:16,798
buffered they are sold separately for a

1040
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:18,629
reason they are buffered and chelated

1041
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:21,960
and they are not meant to be mixed in

1042
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:24,210
concentrate together so the best I can

1043
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,798
recommend is to either mix them into a 1

1044
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,358
gallon pitcher so that if you do make a

1045
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:29,940
mistake you don't waste 5 gallons of

1046
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:31,798
water or just mix the nutrients one at a

1047
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,200
time into your five gallon bucket but

1048
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:35,849
never pour them in concentrate form into

1049
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:38,129
a container together that is not a good

1050
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:40,140
thing you're causing problems already so

1051
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,119
fill your bucket get a pitcher of water

1052
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:44,940
from that bucket makes your nutrient

1053
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,410
solution into the pitcher use a quality

1054
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,450
measuring device you guys go get

1055
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:49,730
something from the grocer

1056
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:52,279
or a scientific store the stuff use for

1057
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,170
your kitchen is closed but it is not

1058
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,150
going to be as accurate as something you

1059
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:58,400
could get from the gross store and do

1060
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,780
not use something from the kitchen and

1061
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,369
then put it back in the kitchen you

1062
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,170
can't use the same [ __ ] you've got to

1063
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:04,639
have a dedicated one for your Gro you

1064
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,840
don't want to be mixing your whatever

1065
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,639
kind of food you're mixing you're

1066
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,650
measuring out your vanilla extract and

1067
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:11,000
the same damn measuring device that

1068
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,559
you're mixing up your nutrients don't do

1069
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,239
that that's tacky and it's unsanitary

1070
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,219
it's either gonna get you sick or your

1071
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,859
plants sick don't [ __ ] with that go get

1072
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:20,389
some dedicated stuff so measure really

1073
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,230
carefully you guys be accurate with your

1074
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:25,279
measurements if it says 25 milliliters

1075
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,809
okay well here's something I should say

1076
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,640
if the bottle says 50 milliliters

1077
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:30,710
probably use half of that to start I

1078
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:33,109
have never needed to use as much as

1079
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,550
recommended on the bottle the nutrient

1080
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,870
companies want you to buy more if they

1081
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,330
recommend that you use a little bit

1082
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:39,829
extra so you don't always have to use as

1083
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:41,150
much as it says start with maybe a half

1084
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:41,569
two thirds and work your way up from

1085
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,760
there

1086
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:46,280
but measure carefully if you're trying

1087
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,680
to put in 25 milliliters measure 25

1088
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,300
milliliters write it down so that if

1089
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:53,359
something goes wrong you know next time

1090
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,950
that 26 or 27 isn't what you did 25 is

1091
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,320
what you did and it either worked or it

1092
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:59,179
did not so 25 is your number to go to

1093
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,519
next time and adjust from there so

1094
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:02,809
measure carefully like I just said take

1095
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,280
notes all the time I should always

1096
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:05,659
remind you guys to take notes always

1097
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,250
take notes when you're drawing cannabis

1098
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:08,989
it's the only way you know what you did

1099
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,550
or what you didn't do and what worked

1100
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:12,529
and what didn't work I know you're gonna

1101
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,700
think I'll remember doing that you're

1102
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,140
growing cannabis which means you're

1103
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:16,460
probably smoking cannabis which means

1104
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,670
you're gonna forget so write that [ __ ]

1105
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,349
down so now you've got everything

1106
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:24,019
measured right you've taken a pitcher of

1107
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:25,639
water you've poured your girl a into a

1108
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:27,889
small measuring device dump that into

1109
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:29,629
the pitcher or be into the measuring

1110
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:32,629
device dump that in the pitcher all your

1111
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,099
additives put that into there then clean

1112
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,570
out your measuring device you guys go

1113
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:37,400
clean it right now before you do

1114
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,630
anything else go clean it all right so

1115
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,119
now you've got a pitcher dump that

1116
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,160
pitcher into your five-gallon bucket

1117
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,659
with water in there so now you've got 5

1118
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:46,659
gallons of perfectly mixed water

1119
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,610
if you do make a mistake all you gotta

1120
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,960
do is dump out that pitcher and then

1121
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,340
just start fresh of course you wasted

1122
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,900
your nutrients but you didn't just dump

1123
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,220
out five gallons of water you don't have

1124
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,110
to wait for a five-gallon bucket to

1125
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:59,239
refill it'll help you out if you're

1126
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,650
using reverse osmosis water you just

1127
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:02,989
saved even more because when you make

1128
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,519
reverse osmosis water there's a lot of

1129
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:06,019
water that gets thrown away so it's hard

1130
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:09,469
to it's hard to waste water when you're

1131
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:11,269
using reverse osmosis water let's see um

1132
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:12,799
so now you've got your bucket it's

1133
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:14,750
filled with your nutrient solution it's

1134
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,740
filled with water now it's time to test

1135
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,090
the pH I've seen people adjust the pH of

1136
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:22,639
their water before they add the

1137
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:25,010
nutrients which is a fail because you're

1138
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,929
going to pH it and then put [ __ ] in it

1139
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,820
yeah so once you've got all of your

1140
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:31,279
nutrients in there every single nutrient

1141
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:34,010
that is when you adjust the pH use pH up

1142
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,769
or pH down to correct it write it down

1143
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:39,620
you guys write down the pH if you get it

1144
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:42,980
at 6.5 write it down if you get it at

1145
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:44,359
6.3 write that down if it's 6.7 write it

1146
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,570
down if you're in hydro you're going

1147
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,130
lower still write it the [ __ ] down so

1148
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:51,860
that when you see those plants doing

1149
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,720
something you know if you were right or

1150
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,700
wrong with your measurement and you have

1151
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:58,069
a reference for where to go to next time

1152
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:59,179
you can't make adjustments if you don't

1153
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,280
know what you did last time

1154
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:02,719
so now we've got our nutrients mixed up

1155
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,900
in a five-gallon bucket we've got it

1156
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:08,419
properly pH to about 6.5 we wrote that

1157
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,849
down we wrote down how much nutrients

1158
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:13,190
we've used now it's time to water each

1159
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:15,289
plant you guys when you go watering the

1160
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,269
plants this is something that I saw my

1161
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:19,460
my client do the other day he poured the

1162
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:21,650
water directly in the center of the pot

1163
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,460
right over the stalk right in the middle

1164
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,639
of the damn plant

1165
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,800
um if you're using enough water that'll

1166
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:29,900
work but here's what I would recommend

1167
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,390
it is wiser and more healthy for the

1168
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,250
plant to start on the outer edge of the

1169
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:36,170
plant because the roots that are newer

1170
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:38,449
and fresher and growing and searching

1171
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,950
for water are those outer roots so you

1172
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,469
want to get the outer perimeter of the

1173
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:44,029
dirt wet the inside of the roots on

1174
00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:46,039
there the water will work its way in

1175
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,930
because the roots will pull it there so

1176
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,820
think about a cannabis plant let's

1177
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:52,279
envision a cannabis plant standing there

1178
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,110
out in the field by itself or with other

1179
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,090
friends whichever you got a cannabis

1180
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:58,099
plant standing there the leaves hang off

1181
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,759
of it and sort of like a tent shape if

1182
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:01,018
you think about it it's like a tent it's

1183
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:04,108
detecting the inside of that platform

1184
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:05,638
oyster so when the rain hits it if rain

1185
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:07,288
comes down from the sky rain hits the

1186
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:09,568
plant and it's being brought out to the

1187
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:11,969
outer edge of the plant hardly any water

1188
00:44:09,568 --> 00:44:14,728
will land on the ground near the stalk

1189
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:17,188
of that plant because all the leaves are

1190
00:44:14,728 --> 00:44:19,708
pushing it out to the perimeter so I

1191
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:22,708
kind of believe that a plant will grow

1192
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:24,629
as wide as its root mass will allow it

1193
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:26,518
so if you water the outer edge of that

1194
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,749
pot then your plants gonna grow wider

1195
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:30,028
because it's gonna feel like it's

1196
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,588
getting more water also that whiteness

1197
00:44:30,028 --> 00:44:33,329
of the plant should kind of represent

1198
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:35,548
the root mass so when the rain comes

1199
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:37,169
down the rain will drip off of the plant

1200
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:38,608
and fall right at the perimeter of the

1201
00:44:37,168 --> 00:44:40,588
plant and that's where those roots are

1202
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:42,268
in my opinion and so it'll drink that

1203
00:44:40,588 --> 00:44:44,068
right up and it also if you water the

1204
00:44:42,268 --> 00:44:45,718
outside of that it'll keep your roots

1205
00:44:44,068 --> 00:44:47,668
active so don't go dumping the water

1206
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:49,499
right in the middle of the pot kind of

1207
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:50,578
try to water around the outer edge then

1208
00:44:49,498 --> 00:44:52,348
you're gonna want to soak the soil

1209
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:54,449
anyway but make sure you get that outer

1210
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:56,789
area wet that's that's the important

1211
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:59,219
part not right there in the middle one

1212
00:44:56,789 --> 00:45:00,899
good way to do that you guys if you have

1213
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:03,088
time and I hope you do make a little

1214
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:04,918
mound around your stalk just grab a

1215
00:45:03,088 --> 00:45:06,778
handful of the soil in the in the pot

1216
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:08,338
and just kind of make a little a cone

1217
00:45:06,778 --> 00:45:10,079
Euler shape like a mound around the

1218
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:11,909
stalk so that when you water the water

1219
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,739
runs down that and runs towards the

1220
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:16,798
edges of the pots that's what I would

1221
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:18,778
recommend so my point is try to get the

1222
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:20,668
water to the outer edge of the pot not

1223
00:45:18,778 --> 00:45:22,139
so much in the center so that's a couple

1224
00:45:20,668 --> 00:45:23,398
of things that I saw at a consultation

1225
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:25,469
that I thought I would share with you

1226
00:45:23,398 --> 00:45:25,949
guys also you guys clean up after

1227
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:29,668
yourselves

1228
00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:31,769
um don't do something tomorrow that

1229
00:45:29,668 --> 00:45:33,298
could be done today because when you

1230
00:45:31,768 --> 00:45:34,678
start getting lazy as a grower that's

1231
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:36,719
when you fall behind that's when she

1232
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:38,939
gets messy when she gets behind and

1233
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,619
messy is when you have problems when

1234
00:45:38,938 --> 00:45:42,298
you're growing on a professional level

1235
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,949
and you're trying to have professional

1236
00:45:42,298 --> 00:45:45,268
quality buds for yourself and your

1237
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,489
clients and your patients and whatever

1238
00:45:45,268 --> 00:45:49,228
you whoever else you're growing for you

1239
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:50,880
need to be in there every day you need

1240
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:52,978
to be diligent you need to be on top of

1241
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,838
[ __ ] nothing can wait until tomorrow if

1242
00:45:52,978 --> 00:45:56,818
it needs to be done today you should

1243
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,739
probably get in there and do it today

1244
00:45:56,818 --> 00:45:59,969
because plants are only alive if you

1245
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:02,039
think about it your plants are only

1246
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:04,708
alive they're in flower for nine weeks

1247
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:07,049
that's 63 days plants only live for

1248
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:09,268
about a hundred days indoors maybe 120

1249
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:10,798
150 at the most so you've only got a

1250
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:12,989
hundred and fifty days why not make

1251
00:46:10,798 --> 00:46:15,300
every single day for your plant

1252
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:17,338
right your patients will know it your

1253
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,420
flowers will show it in the end it'll be

1254
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:21,239
well worth your time just get in there

1255
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,130
and do that [ __ ] um let's see I want to

1256
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:24,899
talk a little bit about defoliation a

1257
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:27,450
little bit I've been experimenting with

1258
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:30,358
defoliation what that is is just going

1259
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:33,299
and taking off all of the big fan leaves

1260
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:35,400
early and flower I put two plants side

1261
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,900
by side the same exact strain I used a

1262
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,780
Jeff Shoji because it's something I'm

1263
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,990
very familiar with and I tore off all of

1264
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:45,450
the fan leaves on one plant odd about a

1265
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:47,639
week into flower I all of the fan leaves

1266
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:49,769
if there was a pea deal I cut that leaf

1267
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:51,929
off at the pineal right at the stem so

1268
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:53,429
this plant looked completely naked it

1269
00:46:51,929 --> 00:46:55,440
was just a bunch of buds up a stick

1270
00:46:53,429 --> 00:46:58,529
there were no leaves and the one next to

1271
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,240
it looks like a big leafy pot play um as

1272
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,950
time went on the leaves grew back you

1273
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,649
guys I went and cut those leaves off

1274
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:06,929
again I did it about every seven to ten

1275
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:09,780
days I was in there cutting off major

1276
00:47:06,929 --> 00:47:12,058
amounts of leaf off of these plants it

1277
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,950
started growing so much leaf toward week

1278
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:15,569
six that it looked just like the plant

1279
00:47:13,949 --> 00:47:17,789
next to it that I had never d foliated

1280
00:47:15,568 --> 00:47:19,108
it was spitting out a lot of leaf but I

1281
00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:21,420
kept cutting them off there's little

1282
00:47:19,108 --> 00:47:23,130
tiny leaves just trying to grow out um I

1283
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:26,099
wasn't getting too crazy it was my first

1284
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:30,240
time trying it but I noticed that the

1285
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:31,349
lower buds got chunkier I didn't think

1286
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,149
it would work that way because my

1287
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:35,190
opinion has always been that those

1288
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,690
bigger leaves were the solar collectors

1289
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:39,900
they got off the light from my plant

1290
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:42,838
that gave the plant energy um I may have

1291
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,490
to experiment more with this defoliating

1292
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:46,619
I've noticed they get a little better

1293
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:48,179
airflow the plants seem to be just

1294
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:50,910
happier when I cut down a lot of the

1295
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:53,789
leaf so you guys if you have some leaves

1296
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:55,348
that are shadowing a bud or if your

1297
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:57,239
plant looks a little bit too leafy I

1298
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:59,068
encourage you to choose one plant in

1299
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:01,108
your garden and maybe experiment with a

1300
00:47:59,068 --> 00:48:02,279
little bit of extreme defoliation you

1301
00:48:01,108 --> 00:48:04,048
don't have to go extreme if you don't

1302
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,869
want to but if you want to the plants

1303
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:08,909
will handle that you guys I think I got

1304
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:11,068
on the one plant that I did not

1305
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:13,348
defoliate it was in a seven gallon pot I

1306
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:16,829
got five and a half ounces of Jeff's OG

1307
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:19,530
in the plant it was D foliated I got six

1308
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:21,030
and a quarter so that's three quarters

1309
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,410
of an ounce which is not a whole lot of

1310
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,320
a difference when you go buy a whole

1311
00:48:22,409 --> 00:48:25,899
room

1312
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,490
that's still 21 grams of cannabis just

1313
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,750
by cutting off some leaves and I did

1314
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:30,639
everything else the same you guys the

1315
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:33,039
plants looked very similar up until that

1316
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,690
moment so that's a little bit of

1317
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,920
defoliating if you guys have any

1318
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:37,059
comments or if you want to know more

1319

1320
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:40,119

other than a head shake was appropriate

1396
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,539
but it was just funny to watch you shake

1397
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:04,389
your head and think that the people

1398

1420
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:49,880
dispensary the

1421
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:52,610
a fire inspector the Pueblo West Metro

1422
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,349
fire inspector showed up and we've got

1423
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:56,000
these big windows he did a fire

1424
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:57,289
inspection and of course we passed I'm

1425
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,170
gonna jump right to that we [ __ ]

1426
00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:01,070
passed I'm not even gonna do any

1427
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:02,539
hesitation to that one we passed with

1428
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,940
flying colors but here's the great part

1429
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:07,550
we've got these big sliding doors they

1430
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:10,309
go over some windows our facility is set

1431
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:13,100
up to be a touring facility so we put

1432
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:14,960
giant glass windows between the tour

1433
00:53:13,099 --> 00:53:16,219
area and where the plants will be so

1434
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,829
that the plants will not become

1435
00:53:16,219 --> 00:53:20,659
contaminated by anything that our

1436
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:22,549
touring people will come in with and

1437
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:23,989
also they won't be able to touch the

1438
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:26,600
plant so it keeps us completely

1439
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:29,029
compliant and legal so we've designed

1440
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:31,159
the facility to be tore prepared so

1441
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:32,450
we've got these big giant windows what

1442
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:35,420
do you say they're 12 feet tall Mike

1443
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:37,250
easy okz twelve all right so these are

1444
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,349
big eight by twelve I'm just getting

1445
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,340
there about eight feet wide by about

1446
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:43,089
twelve feet tall

1447
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:46,160
big-ass panes of glass with gigantic

1448
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:48,190
their garage doors but calling them

1449
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:51,469
garage doors down place that yeah it's

1450
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:53,269
it's a good description but I can't do

1451
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:55,339
better but yeah it under placed

1452
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:57,920
significantly what we've got here their

1453
00:53:55,340 --> 00:54:00,350
garage doors made by Kodak and they are

1454
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,730
used in the darkroom film developing

1455
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:03,230
industry and the professional film

1456
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:05,449
developing industry is what I was told

1457
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:07,190
these doors are for so we've got these

1458
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:09,049
grow rooms and of course in the night

1459
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:11,450
cycle and the grow rooms we need a

1460
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:13,220
hundred percent darkness and we need to

1461
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:16,359
have that whenever the timer requires

1462
00:54:13,219 --> 00:54:20,329
that so these doors garage style doors

1463
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:22,700
roll up and down on a little button and

1464
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:24,349
it keeps the light out and it also maybe

1465
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:25,849
we're doing something in there that we

1466
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:27,380
don't want you to watch so maybe we can

1467
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:28,730
close it down for privacy so the workers

1468
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,280
can work in there without the torah' see

1469
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:33,349
in that little area so the fire

1470
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,030
inspector came and a big part of those

1471
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:36,920
doors is their fire safety if there

1472
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:39,380
happens to be a fire in that grow room

1473
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,610
those doors will pop down the smoke

1474
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:42,890
alarm will go off that when the smoke

1475
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,620
alarm triggers a drop and those doors

1476
00:54:42,889 --> 00:54:47,119
all drop at one time and then the fire

1477
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:49,038
hopefully is contained to that small

1478
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,308
area and we can put it out

1479
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,839
ah the fire inspector was walking around

1480
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:55,069
he had his arms crossed trying to be

1481
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,139
tough you know what I mean like the fire

1482
00:54:55,068 --> 00:54:58,998
inspector has to be a brute it can't be

1483
00:54:57,139 --> 00:55:01,248
a [ __ ] he has to hold his ground and be

1484
00:54:58,998 --> 00:55:03,018
a stern dude right and you can see the

1485
00:55:01,248 --> 00:55:04,188
look on his face like wow this is kind

1486
00:55:03,018 --> 00:55:06,108
of a nice facility

1487
00:55:04,188 --> 00:55:07,518
he was like checking it out like but he

1488
00:55:06,108 --> 00:55:09,018
was trying to not show it holding this

1489
00:55:07,518 --> 00:55:11,808
clipboard in his pan like a tough guy

1490
00:55:09,018 --> 00:55:13,188
and then he goes what I need to see is I

1491
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,989
want you to trip one of these fire

1492
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:16,848
alarms right here he just picked one

1493
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:18,978
randomly and he goes I need all of these

1494
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:20,419
doors to fall and we looked at each

1495
00:55:18,978 --> 00:55:21,889
other like they're gonna fall we've we

1496
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:23,268
tested them all day yesterday we like

1497
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:25,489
fine-tune this you know it's gonna work

1498
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:28,248
he pushes the button and goes beep and

1499
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:30,650
all the doors came down beautifully in

1500
00:55:28,248 --> 00:55:31,848
unison it sounds like a train starting

1501
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:34,039
up when they go down because there's

1502
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:36,229
like 15 of these doors that weigh 300

1503
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:37,910
pounds each coming down on a track and

1504
00:55:36,228 --> 00:55:39,108
they just all perfectly in unison and

1505
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:40,639
when they hit the floor there's a little

1506
00:55:39,108 --> 00:55:42,858
trigger that stops them and like a

1507
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:45,828
hydraulic that makes him just when they

1508
00:55:42,858 --> 00:55:47,748
stop he uncrossed his arms and looked

1509
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:50,959
around he goes I'm impressed I'm gonna

1510
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:53,418
sign off inside our little fire paper

1511
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:55,338
thing so it was so great to hear him the

1512
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:56,688
way you impress the fire inspector

1513
00:55:55,338 --> 00:56:01,068
you're doing something right a lot of

1514
00:55:56,688 --> 00:56:02,889
people work that's absolutely true shot

1515
00:56:01,068 --> 00:56:06,048
at the Sam Sam was a big help that day

1516
00:56:02,889 --> 00:56:07,879
the Department of Agriculture told us

1517
00:56:06,048 --> 00:56:10,278
they were impressed because we are doing

1518
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,959
what other people said is not possible

1519
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:13,369
for a girl facility other people can't

1520
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:16,038
seem to catch on and figure out how to

1521
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:17,838
do what Robert has done in that place so

1522

job for like nine hours was all it was

1542
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,719
on the shelf

1543
00:57:00,278 --> 00:57:02,960
basically the first 15 people to find

1544
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,700

bought it had I known it was there and I

1547
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:10,909
don't even buy into rehashing off

1548
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:13,400
deploys put a hat worn at work and said

1549
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:15,009
put one in the safe for me and managers

1550
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:22,460
didn't get a shot at it and bought

1551
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:23,900
employee under employees because I mean

1552
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,539

1561
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,650
applications to the dispensary and I get

1562

they want to work in a dispensary

1569
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:58,660
because they want to play with weed all

1570

a new edible option that I've had in the

1581
00:58:24,889 --> 00:58:30,289
back of my mind like when I see one grab

1582
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,629

1584
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:37,309

that edible yeah so still it's still

1588
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:48,049
like it's you still have a unit or at

1589
00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:50,960
least once a week something comes

1590
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:52,430
through that getting it in checking it

1591
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,920
out getting to tell other people about

1592
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:56,719

1593
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,920
now how much what percentage of your day

1594
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:59,329
and I'm going somewhere with this

1595
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,700
I'm kind of baiting you what percentage

1596
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:04,739
of your day is that unicorn chase I'm

1597
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:08,009
just titled at the unicorn chase at work

1598
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:13,639
I don't know 5% yeah okay and the other

1599
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:16,770
95% is [ __ ] work right not quite okay

1600
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:20,219
we're gonna freeze it like rolling doing

1601
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:23,250
our pre-rolled joints we do like a pound

1602
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:26,879
of worth at a time so that's 450 joints

1603
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:28,800
and change and it takes days to go from

1604
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,390
this is what we're gonna pre-roll to

1605
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:34,650
here's what we have on our pre-roll

1606
00:59:30,389 --> 00:59:36,118
selection and the entire time it's in

1607
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,889
the corner of the sales floor so we have

1608
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:39,780
customers all day going all do that

1609
00:59:37,889 --> 00:59:42,329
looks like the best job ever and it's

1610
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,800
not at all the best job ever it would be

1611
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:45,630
if you could smoke one of them the whole

1612
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,490
time you were rolling then it wouldn't

1613
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:49,829
be so terrible but just just sit there

1614
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:52,229
girl joint after joint after joint after

1615
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:53,940
joint after joint without being able to

1616
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:55,650
smoke it your hands get sticky you can't

1617
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:57,329
touch your face like it's easily the

1618
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:59,730
hardest grind at work right now

1653
01:01:11,019 --> 01:01:14,889
full-time employed there right now and

1654
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:16,449
we're short-staffed yeah we could

1655
01:01:14,889 --> 01:01:18,639
definitely use a couple people so turn

1656
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:20,619

1662
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:30,460
some work it's not gonna just be playing

1663
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:32,199
with weed and that was another thing I

1664
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,280
wanted to mention somebody was talking

1665
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:37,029
about well you guys are just hanging out

1666
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:39,220
smoking dope all day no do we can't even

1667
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:41,260
smoke tobacco on the property because it

1668
01:01:39,219 --> 01:01:42,519
might look like marijuana on the cameras

1669
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:45,700
and we don't need that mess with the

1670
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:47,409
regulator's yes we have to be I think

1671
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:48,939
the rule is a thousand feet from the

1672
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:51,369
premises before anybody is allowed to

1673
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:53,050
smoke in near any dispensary is actually

1674
01:01:51,369 --> 01:01:55,269
what I think the technical rule is it

1675
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:57,220
may not be true but that's I don't know

1676
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:59,559
if there's a like you can't smoke in

1677
01:01:57,219 --> 01:02:02,379
public in like parking lots or in public

1678
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:04,690
okay and as far as on the dispensary

1679
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:06,519
premises we're specifically barred from

1680
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:09,159
having any sort of consumption a lot of

1681
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:12,309
yesterday by state regulation that

1682
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:13,869
includes all employees yep there's been

1683
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:16,690
just a number of dispensaries that have

1684
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:18,579
been fined because employees had like

1685
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:21,010
vape cartridge pens in their purses and

1686
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:24,309
stuff we're not supposed to have I can't

1687
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:25,600
have my rig in my car no while I'm on

1688
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:28,210

1692

my fresh shiny green Toro rigged in my

1695
01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:41,529
case in my backpack in the car so that

1696
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:43,630
when I get off work I can drive over to

1697
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:45,760
Mike's house and dab him out I can't

1698
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:47,829
have it there or if I'm going to a

1699
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,900
concert or a comedy show after work I

1700
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:52,599

if I choose that I need to medicate

1705
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:07,539
during working hours I have to drive

1706
01:03:04,269 --> 01:03:09,579
home and take a DAB eat lunch and then

1707
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:11,259

1708
01:03:09,579 --> 01:03:13,179

1709
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:14,950
to work like shaking his head no like

1710
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:16,750
you shouldn't say that but people have

1711
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:18,189
seen my periscope they know that once in

1712
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:19,929
a while I've dad

1713
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:21,460
airplane yeah by the time I get back to

1714
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:27,819
work it's like a [ __ ] 30-minute drive

1715
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:30,070
back to the middle of the desert really

1716
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:32,230
commuted much further that's good I know

1717
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:34,150
more shitty jobs it's a good drive to

1718
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:36,519
come on to music and just jam out cuz

1719
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:38,740
it's a fast Drive it's mostly highway

1720
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:40,929
miles so it's legit all right let's put

1721
01:03:38,739 --> 01:03:42,009
the show back on the damn road no we're

1722
01:03:40,929 --> 01:03:44,559
not allowed to smoke at work we're not

1723
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:47,140
allowed to medicate anyone near the

1724
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,699
building if you think about it it's when

1725
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:51,609
you go to the liquor store like is the

1726
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:54,039
clerk drunk like when you go to the gap

1727
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:57,849
like fair point the kids probably dress

1728
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:58,929
then I'll gap but like we go so far with

1729
01:03:57,849 --> 01:04:00,699
it at work that there's a special

1730
01:03:58,929 --> 01:04:03,549
protocol for employees buying we buy

1731
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:05,139
stuff all day like every day there's at

1732
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:07,210
least two employees that work that day

1733
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:09,849
buying something but we've got special

1734
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:12,400
protocol for it because if it's just

1735
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:15,849
like in my car we can get a lot of

1736
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,980
trouble for it oh yeah even if you go in

1737
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:20,469
and you buy that diesel hatch what do

1738
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:22,449
you have to do with it it goes in the

1739
01:04:20,469 --> 01:04:23,469
safe until the end of the shift and then

1740
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:24,909
right at the end of the night like

1741
01:04:23,469 --> 01:04:28,359
whereas before we lock the front door

1742
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:29,920
it's employees want to anybody buying

1743
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:34,870
anything and then we all queue up just

1744
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:42,639
like custody okay yep and then it all

1745
01:04:34,869 --> 01:04:47,230
gets sealed in an accident bag it's all

1746
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:49,029
officials not even bring my backpack

1747
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:50,349
like once in a while I'm gonna have to

1748
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:52,390
bring clothes and stuff because I work

1749
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:53,710
in the back I'm required by the

1750
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,750
Department of Agriculture to have a

1751
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:57,070
change of at least one change of clothes

1752
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,869
like all the way down to the underwear

1753
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:01,390
and socks in a locker accessible because

1754
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:02,739
I'm handling pesticides and other

1755
01:05:01,389 --> 01:05:04,690
chemicals and things so I need I'm

1756
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:06,819
required to have a change of clothes but

1757
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:08,500
they're like bringing is little backpack

1758
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:10,240
and stuff as you need to bring here they

1759
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,559
don't we don't want backpacks and [ __ ]

1760
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,369
coming into the building we don't need

1761
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:14,230
it on camera

1762
01:05:12,369 --> 01:05:16,929
especially going to the back they're

1763
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:20,260
like please just don't like yeah so I

1764
01:05:16,929 --> 01:05:21,669
pretty much take think about mine

1765
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:24,340
because it never leaves the security

1766
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:26,050
desk right yeah come on I come in and it

1767
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,640
gets set on the counter and it comes off

1768
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,990
the counter again when I leave I go into

1769
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:30,579
the back and it's like a labyrinth back

1770
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:30,929
there there's all kinds of nooks and

1771
01:05:30,579 --> 01:05:32,400
trained

1772
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:35,159
there wouldn't be anywhere really to put

1773
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,809
my backpack anyway so your locker it

1774
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:41,068
wouldn't fit the lockers are only the

1775
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:43,859
lawyers a team yeah they're per size so

1776
01:05:41,068 --> 01:05:49,318
if you got a purse that's I work on a

1777
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:51,420
way off topic you guys really good

1778
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:54,179
people that are not from Colorado kind

1779
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:55,470
of like to hear our how our lives are

1780
01:05:54,179 --> 01:06:00,239
what's going on and since we're two

1781
01:05:55,469 --> 01:06:02,389
dudes that work it every day and are

1782
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:06,838
just blown the [ __ ] away about how

1783
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:08,400
regular it is how many uh so I heard

1784
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:09,298
another person ask this and I thought it

1785
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,798
would be interesting and I was gonna

1786
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:12,449
talk about it in a future episode but

1787
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:15,900
since you're here what's the breakdown

1788
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:17,818
of people where they're from like how

1789
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,139
many people are Colorado folk how many

1790
01:06:17,818 --> 01:06:21,599
people are from out of state and is

1791
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:23,460
there am i talking [ __ ] when I say that

1792
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:26,809
probably 50% of the people that come in

1793
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:29,099
are from Texas is that true yeah fully

1794
01:06:26,809 --> 01:06:30,630
especially if we do a breakdown over the

1795
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:33,059
if we're talking about like that a year

1796
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:34,619
range okay usually half the people that

1797
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:36,480
come through most recreational

1798
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:39,180
dispensaries are tourists that's

1799
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,608
statewide are places like Aspen it's

1800
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:43,889
like 80 or 90% Wow

1801
01:06:41,608 --> 01:06:46,858
marijuana is crazy expensive up that we

1802
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:48,960
get people from Aspen in our shop it's

1803
01:06:46,858 --> 01:06:50,519
crazy expensive in Aspen and they're

1804
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,440
down in Pueblo because they were driving

1805
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:55,288
through the area and weed Maps told them

1806
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:56,818
to stop here go to the spot and they get

1807
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:58,380
loaded up before they head back to their

1808
01:06:56,818 --> 01:07:02,250
city in Colorado where it's way more

1809
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:03,480
expensive intercity nice but easily half

1810
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:06,599
the people that roll through her from

1811
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:08,490
Texas it's comes in bizarre waves like

1812
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:09,630
I'm one day everybody from Alabama the

1813
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:11,909
next day everybody will be from

1814
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:14,940
Tennessee yesterday it was Missouri and

1815
01:07:11,909 --> 01:07:16,170
truckers we actually have a bus well I

1816
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:17,369
don't know how they actually traveled

1817
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:19,769
there were ten of them they come from

1818
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:21,778
Kansas and they all come together and

1819
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:23,849
they all would they always show up they

1820
01:07:21,778 --> 01:07:25,199
come about once a month there are ten of

1821
01:07:23,849 --> 01:07:28,230
them that show up it's like a field trip

1822
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:29,848
this kind of happens way more often than

1823
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:31,829
you'd think like families come through

1824
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:33,660
today there was a girl with her

1825
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:35,500
grandmother and her grandmother just had

1826
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:38,980
a filthy mouth

1827
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:41,019
after 30 Joe and the granddaughter was

1828
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:43,750
mortified in there buying weed together

1829
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:44,530
like it's we get [ __ ] like that constant

1830
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,539
that's kind of neat

1831
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:47,860
yep grandma and granddaughter buying

1832
01:07:46,539 --> 01:07:50,079
hers for there and they're all blown

1833
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,880
away because we have marijuana stores

1834
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,739
where you can walk in and just like

1835
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,480
every other store there's a salesperson

1836
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:58,089
there to tell you all about it the

1837
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,860
biggest obstacle about the shop is the

1838
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:01,900
security guard you have to have an ID

1839
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:03,700
that says you're 21 and if you got that

1840
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,019
go on in to buy some he goes it'll be a

1841
01:08:03,699 --> 01:08:06,549
second and he makes sure that there's

1842
01:08:05,019 --> 01:08:09,610
somebody back there and he goes go on

1843
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:10,990
back he can go buy weed yeah and people

1844
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:12,430
don't know what to think sometimes I

1845
01:08:10,989 --> 01:08:13,989
don't get to spend a lot of time upfront

1846
01:08:12,429 --> 01:08:15,699
because I'm supposed to be in the back

1847
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:17,199
in the cave girl on the weed but

1848
01:08:15,699 --> 01:08:18,608
sometimes I got a venture up to the

1849
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:20,500
front I got questions I gotta go find a

1850
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:21,789
boss and now they're hard to find so I

1851
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,289
just find myself in the bud room

1852
01:08:21,789 --> 01:08:25,659
watching and seeing what's going on and

1853
01:08:23,289 --> 01:08:27,310
a good portion of the people that I meet

1854
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:28,809
are from out of state and they all see

1855
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:30,700
the little board with the pins in it

1856
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:40,000
like what's this I know I just gave

1857
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:40,289

1858
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,489

1860
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:46,929

1861

1862

daily chronic we will read the article

1979

that goes a lot like this consumer

1980
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:15,159
should beware purchasing and using any

1981
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:16,750
such products the FDA says the Food and

1982
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:18,489
Drug Administration has sent letters to

1983
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:19,989
several makers of cannabidiol oils

1984
01:13:18,489 --> 01:13:21,489
derived from hemp telling them to stop

1985
01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:23,619
making medical claims about their

1986
01:13:21,489 --> 01:13:25,149
products ability to treat disease many

1987
01:13:23,619 --> 01:13:26,739
sellers of the Hep A Scanner bidi all

1988
01:13:25,149 --> 01:13:28,599
products who advertise their products is

1989
01:13:26,739 --> 01:13:30,699
legal in all 50 states because they are

1990
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,230
derived from industrial hemp have been

1991
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:34,569
making claims that their products are

1992
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:37,269
rich in cannabidiol and can be used for

1993
01:13:34,569 --> 01:13:39,670
the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment

1994
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:42,460
or a presentation of diseases according

1995
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:43,899
to the FDA the FDA which considers CBD

1996
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:46,180
an unapproved new drug said these

1997
01:13:43,899 --> 01:13:48,219
companies are misbranding the products

1998
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:50,350
and issuing false claims to consumers

1999
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:51,880
often these products do not even list

2000
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:54,310
their ingredients on the product label

2001
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:56,260
the FDA said consumers should beware

2002
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:58,510
purchasing and using any such products

2003
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:00,250
it is important to note that these

2004
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:02,560
products are not a lot are not approved

2005
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:04,449
by the FDA for the diagnosis cure

2006
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,820
mitigation treatment or prevention of

2007
01:14:04,449 --> 01:14:08,679
any disease in late February the FDA

2008
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:10,779
issued several warning letters to seven

2009
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:13,570
companies that manufacture and market

2010
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:15,309
hemp oils claiming to be rich in CBD

2011
01:14:13,569 --> 01:14:18,039
by promising cures for conditions such

2012
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:20,050
as cancer autism and epilepsy none of

2013
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:21,489
which have been tested by the FDA the

2014
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:23,170
companies who were issued warning

2015
01:14:21,489 --> 01:14:27,929
letters appeared to be violating food

2016
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:30,190
and drug labeling laws in some cases

2017
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:31,480
hold on throats going crazy here I'm

2018
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:43,349
gonna take a drink this happens

2019
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:45,489
occasionally we take a lot of grouse

2020
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:47,050
where am i I'm right here in some cases

2021
01:14:45,489 --> 01:14:49,750
the companies could not even smell

2022
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:52,869
cannabidiol or inflammation correctly

2023
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:54,699
the FDA notes on the market for a while

2024
01:14:52,869 --> 01:14:56,619
and it's always been crap well one thing

2025
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:58,840
that I wanted to get to is a lot of this

2026
01:14:56,619 --> 01:15:01,420
stuff is brought in from other countries

2027
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,980
because now that we have got this market

2028
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,569
they're doing kind of like what they did

2029
01:15:02,979 --> 01:15:07,059
with spice you know they see that this

2030
01:15:04,569 --> 01:15:10,149
CBD stuff is really popular and they're

2031
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:12,070
just sending us crap it may be partially

2032
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:14,170
CBD so if they can write that on the

2033
01:15:12,069 --> 01:15:15,939
bottle but then it's just other random

2034
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:17,380
oils just as a filler so you don't even

2035
01:15:15,939 --> 01:15:20,349
know what you're giving these sick kids

2036
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:21,550
you have to get I'll finish reading the

2037
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,170
article and I'll try to remember where I

2038
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:24,489
am with this rant the following

2039
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:26,859
companies and products were among those

2040
01:15:24,489 --> 01:15:28,869
notified by the FDA then there are

2041
01:15:26,859 --> 01:15:32,649
hyperlinks here also you guys it was a

2042
01:15:28,869 --> 01:15:35,170
bunch of companies cancer herb tea ,

2043
01:15:32,649 --> 01:15:37,389
Florida CBD life holdings of Arizona

2044
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:39,640
hemp oil care of California pure CBD of

2045
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:42,010
Washington it was a bunch of them and

2046
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:43,810
then it also says the FTD FDA also

2047
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:45,730
conducted tests of some products sold by

2048
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:47,830
these companies and found that in most

2049
01:15:45,729 --> 01:15:51,279
cases the products contained very little

2050
01:15:47,829 --> 01:15:52,539
cannabidiol or none at all and there are

2051
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:54,069
some bullet points that show some of the

2052
01:15:52,539 --> 01:15:56,350
test findings I won't read them all

2053
01:15:54,069 --> 01:15:58,840
it says the FDA tested two separate

2054
01:15:56,350 --> 01:16:02,590
samples of ultra CBD sold by CBD Life

2055
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:05,739
Holdings offer it's one ounce bottle for

2056
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:07,600
$45 on their website or on Amazon of the

2057
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:10,119
samples tested one did not contain any

2058
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:13,270
cannabinoids while the second contain

2059
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:15,069
only point zero two percent CBD all the

2060
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:17,860
products tested by the FDA that were

2061
01:16:15,069 --> 01:16:19,210
found to contain some CBD the ultra CBD

2062
01:16:17,859 --> 01:16:21,849
products contained the smallest

2063
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:23,619
percentage so you guys are paying for

2064
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:25,960
stuff that doesn't even have any CBD in

2065
01:16:23,619 --> 01:16:27,010
it which is gonna make me wonder what is

2066
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,920
in it

2067
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:31,659
this is a big issue for a lot of usko

2068
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:35,920
states that have passed Charlotte's Web

2069
01:16:31,659 --> 01:16:39,340
laws that allow for CBD only products

2070
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:41,109
but they don't allow for you to get them

2071
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:42,970
anywhere right essentially the law

2072
01:16:41,109 --> 01:16:45,399
requires you to come to Colorado or

2073
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:46,840
another legal state by something and

2074
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:49,509
then break a bunch of federal laws on

2075
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:51,430
your way home by taking it home and then

2076
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:53,440
yeah if you're able to smuggle at home

2077
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:56,320
you can go ahead and then legally use it

2078
01:16:53,439 --> 01:16:59,219
but that's mildly insane and so when

2079
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:01,739
you're googling and you see hey boils

2080
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:04,480
[Music]

2081
01:17:01,739 --> 01:17:06,699
CBD oils what there's one package says

2082
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:11,489
if you're lucky you're getting hemp seed

2083
01:17:06,699 --> 01:17:14,529
extract if you're lucky if you're lucky

2084
01:17:11,489 --> 01:17:16,539
the bottom layer of whatever oil some

2085
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:19,300
company in China makes and decided to

2086
01:17:16,539 --> 01:17:22,479
bottle up and label it as THC or CBD oil

2087
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:23,590
right yep so the article keeps going I

2088
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:25,449
want to finish this up just so we can

2089
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:27,970
finish the whole article it says the

2090
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:30,399
warned CBD companies have 15 days to

2091
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:31,750
follow the FDA to show the FDA how they

2092
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:34,899
are complying with the warning letters

2093
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:37,119
failure to comply to failure to promptly

2094
01:17:34,899 --> 01:17:39,189
correct these violations may result in

2095
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:41,079
legal action without further notice

2096
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:45,309
including without limitation seizure

2097
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:46,869
and/or injunction the FDA warns medical

2098
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:48,910
marijuana experts suggest patients

2099
01:17:46,869 --> 01:17:51,460
considering CBD treatment to instead

2100
01:17:48,909 --> 01:17:52,840
seek CBD rich strains of cannabis grown

2101
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:55,689
in states that allow medical marijuana

2102
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:58,180
such as Colorado who also require

2103
01:17:55,689 --> 01:18:01,960
independent laboratory testing of all

2104
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:04,900
marijuana products so medical experts

2105
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:09,460
are even saying what Mike and I say go

2106
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:12,279
to Colorado get some lab tested facility

2107
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:13,930
grown quality cannabis that's safe that

2108
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:15,429
doesn't have any pesticides in it

2109
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:18,340
because if it does it's been quarantined

2110
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:20,470
and taken away like we're almost to

2111
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:22,510
where we need to be regulatory wise here

2112
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:24,659
in Colorado they're going the wrong

2113
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:27,400
direction with their new regulations but

2114
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:29,229
where they need to be adding stuff as in

2115
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:31,000
pesticide testing those regulations

2116
01:18:29,229 --> 01:18:33,039
aren't up to speed yet because the

2117
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,500
testing labs aren't in place yet because

2118
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:37,779
the FDA will certify tests like it just

2119
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:39,579
spirals right because of our dumbass

2120
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:41,259
prohibition is everybody

2121
01:18:39,579 --> 01:18:44,529
- the show knows what I'm gonna say the

2122
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:47,530
solution there is to legalize it yes

2123
01:18:44,529 --> 01:18:49,300
just do it already yeah and then the FDA

2124
01:18:47,529 --> 01:18:51,069
would already be overseeing all this

2125
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:54,760
hemp seed extract [ __ ] you'd be able to

2126
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:57,009
legally confidently buy CBD oil this

2127
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,720
legit CBD oil you'd know what you were

2128
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:01,810
taking or giving your kid or whatever

2129
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:03,820
yeah so this is partially like to warm

2130
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:06,670
people if you're buying this crappy CBD

2131
01:19:03,819 --> 01:19:09,340
oil you're probably not getting any help

2132
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:11,380
for your ailment hey if you know if it's

2133
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:12,880
like what if what if it's a placebo

2134
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:14,079
effect if it's working and you felt

2135
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,150
better what do you what do you think

2136
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:17,649
sure they could do it in ER I don't know

2137
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:19,599
cuz maybe they're taking some weird [ __ ]

2138
01:19:17,649 --> 01:19:21,969
I'm not telling you to take or not to

2139
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:25,720
take any thats the truth if something

2140
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:27,310
works it works for a reason yeah but who

2141
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,990
knows what you're taking guys so the

2142
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:30,700
advice here is to come to Colorado or

2143
01:19:28,989 --> 01:19:33,819
legalize it where you are fight for

2144
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:35,889
legalization and my guidance is when it

2145
01:19:33,819 --> 01:19:39,639
comes time to legalize in your area

2146
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:43,150
don't pass CBD only legislation no pass

2147
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:45,640
cannabis like recreational or medical

2148
01:19:43,149 --> 01:19:48,519
cannabis use to where you can consume

2149
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:50,530
flower tor you can make extracts where

2150
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:53,440
you can consume extracts and edibles

2151
01:19:50,529 --> 01:19:57,099
make it all part of that because just

2152
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:59,919
the CBD is only going to work for a very

2153
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:02,230
small portion of the medical cannabis

2154
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:09,159
community CBD doesn't do a damn thing

2155
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:11,109
for me like I need my THC right right

2156
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:13,389
and I have a CBD episode coming up on

2157
01:20:11,109 --> 01:20:14,769
the future and guys I know I keep saying

2158
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:16,030
that but I'm putting it together there

2159
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:18,100
are some episodes I can throw together

2160
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:19,420
in like a day or two the CBD episode is

2161
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:21,160
going to take me quite a while it's

2162
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:22,659
going to be a series I'm gonna get

2163
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:24,789
several people to talk on it and tell us

2164
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:26,199
how CBD treats them but Mike is

2165
01:20:24,789 --> 01:20:34,689
definitely gonna be one of the people on

2166
01:20:26,199 --> 01:20:36,279
there already Doug is gonna be part of

2167
01:20:34,689 --> 01:20:38,009
that show Mike will be part of that show

2168
01:20:36,279 --> 01:20:40,329
we'll get a lot of people on there I

2169
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:43,329
just met a few people recently that are

2170
01:20:40,329 --> 01:20:45,489
well-known in the CBD community so that

2171
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:48,390
will help us out then we're finally

2172
01:20:45,489 --> 01:20:50,889
starting to get CBD CBD products real AB

2173
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:52,930
reliably in the rec market I got out

2174
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:54,789
some time I'm out notice that yeah I

2175
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:56,740
was impressed we were talking to the

2176
01:20:54,789 --> 01:20:58,810
purchaser for the shop and he was asking

2177
01:20:56,739 --> 01:21:00,550
us what he asked us for guidance we

2178
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:02,020
knows that were potheads he's like what

2179
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:04,060
should I buy guys and he showed us an

2180
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:06,220
order that he was able to get really

2181
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:07,630
high CBD products and we encouraged him

2182
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:09,159
to do that for the wreck shop so that

2183
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:11,079
we've got that available for people as

2184
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:13,210
well yeah come check it out you guys try

2185
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:15,640
some CBD see what it does for you it may

2186
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:18,310
help you out some people it's the

2187
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:19,720
miracle for me there's nothing but so

2188
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:22,630
like I'm saying don't go with the CBD

2189
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:24,220
only because CBD only wouldn't do

2190
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:26,170
anything for me it's the synergistic

2191
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:28,119
effect is what we're searching for in my

2192
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:29,890
opinion we need a little little bit of

2193
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:33,849
THC to make it all work I think it's all

2194
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:35,140
one one unified thing that's my opinion

2195
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:38,560
so when it comes time to legalize guys

2196
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:39,700
make sure you don't just do CBD I need

2197
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,200
to give a shout-out to the author of

2198
01:21:39,699 --> 01:21:42,760
this article I like to remind you too it

2199
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:45,189
was it was Thomas H Clark from the daily

2200
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:48,460
chronic you guys be careful if you're

2201
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:49,929
using an oil CBD products don't make

2202
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:51,430
yourself sicker than you already are

2203
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:53,770
know what you're using if you're buying

2204
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:56,680
stuff from a shop and it doesn't have

2205
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:58,840
lab testing start asking for it it's

2206
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,280
it's just a matter of time until this is

2207
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,900
just like everything else when you go to

2208
01:22:00,279 --> 01:22:03,399
a store and buy something you know what

2209
01:22:01,899 --> 01:22:06,939
you're buying you can look at the label

2210
01:22:03,399 --> 01:22:08,710
on it and know what's in it and be sure

2211
01:22:06,939 --> 01:22:11,889
that what's on the label is actually in

2212
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:14,560
it because the FDA is testing this yes

2213
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:16,840
yes well now we have the meed backing

2214
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,000
you up will in Colorado the FDA is not

2215
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:22,449
allowed to so we literally had to create

2216
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,369
from the ground up our own meed they do

2217
01:22:22,449 --> 01:22:26,800
I mean that I remember when the first

2218
01:22:24,369 --> 01:22:28,630
testing labs were open the state didn't

2219
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,640
give a [ __ ] that was the industry

2220
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:33,100
demanding it patients were beginning to

2221
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:35,350
demand it shops needed to know what they

2222
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:37,570
were putting out and testing and back in

2223
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:40,000
the day I was able to take my product my

2224
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:42,039
finished flowers my hash to a shop and

2225
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,649
have it tested there's discussions of

2226
01:22:42,039 --> 01:22:46,329
reopening laughs the caregivers I hope

2227
01:22:44,649 --> 01:22:48,460
so because right now they've lost the

2228
01:22:46,329 --> 01:22:50,289
rule so tight well part of the thing is

2229
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:51,850
if the shops have them so overwhelmed

2230
01:22:50,289 --> 01:22:53,560
there are so few labs that are qualified

2231
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:54,760
that right now if I wanted to take my

2232
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:56,680
product I'd probably have to wait a

2233
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:58,690
month anyway so they just disallowed us

2234
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,010
to be able to do it there's one type of

2235
01:22:58,689 --> 01:23:04,059
testing and I honestly can't remember

2236
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:05,349
what it is it's not potency but I can't

2237
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:07,750
remember what that special

2238
01:23:05,349 --> 01:23:09,760
the test that we were hoping to get done

2239
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:12,099
there's only one lab and it's in like

2240
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,510
Durango oh it's a residual solvent test

2241
01:23:12,099 --> 01:23:15,880
yep you guys are looking for yeah it's

2242
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:18,010
only for hash it's they can only do that

2243
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,719
in Durango and so we're literally

2244
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:27,909
discussing who we're gonna send it

2245
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:30,039
Arango gonna draw the short straw and

2246
01:23:27,908 --> 01:23:33,488
drive like 14 hours across the state

2247
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:38,500
it's 14 hours i'm ballparking okay I

2248
01:23:33,488 --> 01:23:40,839
might need a day off that'll be fun I

2249
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:42,939
think steep hill Halen can possibly do

2250
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:44,560
those same tests but I'm not sure I can

2251
01:23:42,939 --> 01:23:46,269
don't quote me there yeah that was a

2252
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,949
discussion I overheard a couple of

2253
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:49,659
months ago heard part of that today

2254
01:23:47,948 --> 01:23:52,238
actually we're talking about labs and

2255
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:53,649
such today one of the offices awesome

2256
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:55,448

2257
01:23:53,649 --> 01:24:02,529

2258
01:23:55,448 --> 01:24:04,388

2259
01:24:02,529 --> 01:24:05,948
about 33 minutes dude I've got a couple

2260
01:24:04,389 --> 01:24:07,690
more things here that I'm gonna save cuz

2261
01:24:05,948 --> 01:24:09,578
this right here is gonna take a while I

2262
01:24:07,689 --> 01:24:10,899
wanted to talk about I'm just gonna give

2263
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:12,189
it a couple of quick seconds here then

2264
01:24:10,899 --> 01:24:15,339
we don't have to get too much into it

2265
01:24:12,189 --> 01:24:16,779
ah you guys follow the UFC a lot I'm not

2266
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:18,578
a huge UFC follower

2267
01:24:16,779 --> 01:24:20,769
I followed Joe Rogan more than I follow

2268
01:24:18,578 --> 01:24:22,420
the UFC but that's attached that's my

2269
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:23,860
third degree of separation or whatever

2270
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:25,328
you're gonna call it but there is

2271
01:24:23,859 --> 01:24:27,429
something that happened in the UFC that

2272
01:24:25,328 --> 01:24:28,569
as a pothead as a cannabis activists as

2273
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:31,060
somebody who is part of the marijuana

2274
01:24:28,569 --> 01:24:33,969
community this got my attention there's

2275
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:35,889
a UFC fighter who tested positive for

2276
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:40,750
using cannabis who has been suspended

2277
01:24:35,889 --> 01:24:43,239
for five years five years dude his his

2278
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:44,800
career has been put on hold is uh his

2279
01:24:43,238 --> 01:24:46,959
salary has been put on hold and they

2280
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:49,599
also find him a hundred and fifty

2281
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:53,859
thousand dollars for passing for failing

2282
01:24:49,599 --> 01:24:56,440
a pee test for cannabis I think that's

2283
01:24:53,859 --> 01:24:58,448
kind of silly I don't think saying yeah

2284
01:24:56,439 --> 01:24:59,919
dude that's his job that's what this guy

2285
01:24:58,448 --> 01:25:04,178
training has trained his whole life for

2286
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:05,859
you know it's it's totally and totally

2287
01:25:04,179 --> 01:25:08,469
insane and there's a couple of different

2288
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:10,719
reasons why it's insane like if it was

2289
01:25:08,469 --> 01:25:13,420
steroids this would be a little insane

2290
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,469
like five years is an insanely long

2291
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:17,380
amount of time it's not a

2292
01:25:14,469 --> 01:25:19,149
performance-enhancing drug like it's

2293
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:21,159
been shown to be helpful and protect

2294
01:25:19,149 --> 01:25:24,009
against concussions and recovering from

2295
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:26,349
head injury yes and kicked in the face

2296
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:28,750
for a live ads his job yeah yeah like

2297
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:31,539
there's a thousand different reasons why

2298
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:33,760
this insane and I love uh I'm gonna

2299
01:25:31,539 --> 01:25:35,679
probably butcher her name so I apologize

2300
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,380
because you for sure kicked my ass but I

2301
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:40,000
think it's Ronda Rousey independently

2302
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:43,480
went off during the press conference and

2303
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,760
I saw that video oh yeah peripherally

2304
01:25:43,479 --> 01:25:47,859
followed this story but she went off for

2305
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,199
basically the same reasons I did right

2306
01:25:47,859 --> 01:25:51,819
to misquote Ronda Rousey but to

2307
01:25:50,198 --> 01:25:54,750
paraphrase and misquote her basically

2308
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:57,729
what she said was I have somebody uses

2309
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:59,679
steroids and they're in a ring fighting

2310
01:25:57,729 --> 01:26:02,289
that potentially gives them the ability

2311
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:04,840
to hit me harder and kill me but if they

2312
01:26:02,289 --> 01:26:06,670
are smoking cannabis that gives them the

2313
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:09,579
ability to heal themselves they are

2314
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:11,469
smoking a plant that was put here for us

2315
01:26:09,579 --> 01:26:13,510
to smoke and we were going to punish

2316
01:26:11,469 --> 01:26:14,920
people for it is basically what she said

2317
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:17,260
I'm gonna [ __ ] it all up already told

2318
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:19,060
you that I totally agree with Ronda

2319
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:21,670
Rousey is absolutely on the money with

2320
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:23,739
that there's a petition I'm not gonna

2321
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:25,149
sign the petition I haven't signed it

2322
01:26:23,738 --> 01:26:26,349
yet but if you guys what if you're if

2323
01:26:25,149 --> 01:26:27,729
you're in the UFC do you think it's

2324
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:30,730
wrong that this dude's been suspended

2325
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:34,389
here's the thing they did give him three

2326
01:26:30,729 --> 01:26:36,968
P tests and two of them were clean and

2327
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:38,380
this third one was not even necessary it

2328
01:26:36,969 --> 01:26:40,149
was by I've got a news article in the

2329
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:41,350
screen that I was gonna read but I

2330
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:44,859
didn't even want to get that far into

2331
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:46,449
this but it says Diaz submitted three

2332
01:26:44,859 --> 01:26:48,789
urine samples on the ninth one prior to

2333
01:26:46,448 --> 01:26:50,619
his fight and two and the hours

2334
01:26:48,789 --> 01:26:51,939
afterward I'm really going quickly

2335
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:54,039
through this of those three samples the

2336
01:26:51,939 --> 01:26:56,079
first and the third administered under

2337
01:26:54,039 --> 01:26:58,439
the world anti-doping agency protocol

2338
01:26:56,079 --> 01:27:00,670
and submitted for testing to the W ad a

2339
01:26:58,439 --> 01:27:02,889
accredited sports medicine research and

2340
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:06,310
testing lab in Salt Lake City both of

2341
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:10,090
those came back clean so that's the

2342
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:12,130
world anti-doping agency you can't cheat

2343
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:14,319
that pee test I don't care how bad you

2344
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:15,850
are they see your wiener they see your

2345
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:17,170
dick when you're peeing they watch the

2346
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:19,719
pee come out of the head of your pee

2347
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:21,340
hole like it comes they watch it into

2348
01:27:19,719 --> 01:27:22,658
the container and then they [ __ ] seal

2349
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:24,159
it themselves they're wearing rubber

2350
01:27:22,658 --> 01:27:26,710
gloves and catching it for you basically

2351
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:28,799
it's not the only reason I'm not an MMA

2352
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:33,939
fighter was on the [ __ ] list

2353
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:35,529
this is however the truth the 10:30 p.m.

2354
01:27:33,939 --> 01:27:37,000
test however was administered by a

2355
01:27:35,529 --> 01:27:39,880
separate testing representative and

2356
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:42,189
submitted to quest Diagnostics Anan W a

2357
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:44,590
DA accredited lab so that labs not even

2358
01:27:42,189 --> 01:27:46,479
accredited that test came back over the

2359
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:48,670
threshold for allowable marijuana

2360
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:51,579
metabolites resulting in the loan

2361
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:54,159
positive test this company that tested

2362
01:27:51,579 --> 01:27:56,350
him isn't even accredited by the world

2363
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:59,680
anti-doping agency and they did pass

2364
01:27:56,350 --> 01:28:01,329
there what the [ __ ] Las Vegas sporting

2365
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,610
whatever you're called the Nevada

2366
01:28:01,329 --> 01:28:05,170
sporting and something commissioned I'm

2367
01:28:03,609 --> 01:28:07,029
not cool with you guys this sucks you

2368
01:28:05,170 --> 01:28:08,680
guys need to go just sign the petition

2369
01:28:07,029 --> 01:28:11,380
so that Nick Diaz can get back get his

2370
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:14,260
career back five years for a UFC fighter

2371
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:15,159
dude that would that's that's like half

2372
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:17,320
of your career

2373
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:19,720
you only get to go from your early 20s

2374
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:20,529
until maybe 30 something unless you're a

2375
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,850
bad [ __ ]

2376
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:23,829
once you get the mid-thirties

2377
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:25,329
testosterone starts to drop in you can't

2378
01:28:23,829 --> 01:28:27,309
take the punches is he gonna come back

2379
01:28:25,329 --> 01:28:30,010
like Tyson after prison the [ __ ] knee

2380
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:35,830
blows out or something we talkin Philly

2381
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:37,090
and chief of pigeons no people it might

2382
01:28:35,829 --> 01:28:40,840
be neat to see but I don't wanna have to

2383
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:42,730
wait five years to see it fight for me

2384
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:45,310
this is just another example of why

2385
01:28:42,729 --> 01:28:47,979
everyone needs to get involved and get

2386
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:49,720
educated like this guy doesn't get to

2387
01:28:47,979 --> 01:28:51,729
fight for five years because he peed

2388
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:54,310
dirty other people are losing their kids

2389
01:28:51,729 --> 01:28:56,079
because they peed dirty like other

2390
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:57,970
people are going to jail because they're

2391
01:28:56,079 --> 01:29:00,039
selling people caught that people want

2392
01:28:57,970 --> 01:29:01,510
because we want to smoke a plant while

2393
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:04,390
other people can drink some [ __ ] that

2394
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:06,670
makes them drive like maniacs oh I can't

2395
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:08,230
blame it on alcohol but yeah because

2396
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:09,369
people want to smoke a plant we're going

2397
01:29:08,229 --> 01:29:11,139
to jail we're not allowed to have the

2398
01:29:09,369 --> 01:29:13,449
careers we want this dude can't fight

2399
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:17,369
this is terrible because we all hang

2400
01:29:13,449 --> 01:29:18,840
back like we all get [ __ ] on regularly

2401
01:29:17,369 --> 01:29:22,529
alright I think that's enough for Nick

2402
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:24,230
Diaz support that you guys I do Mike

2403

I've read about holding in the smoke

2461
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:33,619

2462
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:36,500
topic yeah we'll save that one we'll get

2463

that out on another episode yeah let's

2464
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,800

2465
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:42,260
of some positive [ __ ] we're here you're

2466
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:44,570
here okay here's some positive [ __ ] did

2467
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:46,880
you read that the CERN Large Hadron

2468
01:31:44,569 --> 01:31:48,529
Collider was supposed to open up two

2469
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,760
black holes which is gonna open a

2470
01:31:48,529 --> 01:31:51,319
wormhole and the earth was gonna be

2471
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,000
swallowed and we're all gonna die

2472
01:31:51,319 --> 01:31:56,719
that was supposed to happen on the 23rd

2473
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:59,899
and we're recording on the 24th so guess

2474
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:02,300
what we didn't die so that's a positive

2475

2632
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:50,369
got a new I think I talked about the

2633
01:41:48,029 --> 01:41:52,139
it's a mothership knockoff basically

2634
01:41:50,369 --> 01:41:54,569
that I got there about a week ago and

2635
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:57,300
then just last night I went picked up a

2636
01:41:54,569 --> 01:41:59,250
little hitman 2 mini with the hammer

2637
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:01,560
head on the inside and I had to grab it

2638
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:03,510
it's got a yellow logo I've never seen a

2639
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:05,039
hitman like this with the yellow logo

2640
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:07,350
before and I thought it was super cute

2641
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:09,029
so I picked it up and man it hits like a

2642
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:11,579
Mack truck so I'm super impressed

2643
01:42:09,029 --> 01:42:13,079
it really does it's uh your collection

2644
01:42:11,579 --> 01:42:17,550
is growing by leaps and bounds in the

2645
01:42:13,079 --> 01:42:18,269
new wonderful was the first word that

2646
01:42:17,550 --> 01:42:21,180
comes to mind

2647
01:42:18,270 --> 01:42:22,680
nice I don't have as many rigs you might

2648
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:24,210
think because well I got rid of a couple

2649
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:28,050
through a place to make room for these

2650
01:42:24,210 --> 01:42:29,340
so that's the truth I'm not as much of a

2651
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:31,380
rig junkie as you might think

2652
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:32,819

from a friend this is kind of not

2666
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:57,979
cannabis related and it's funny because

2667
01:42:56,719 --> 01:43:00,230
he starts his email this is from my

2668
01:42:57,979 --> 01:43:01,968
buddy Justin and now the email says so

2669
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:03,349

2670
01:43:01,969 --> 01:43:05,569

2699
01:44:04,939 --> 01:44:09,649
alright so let's talk about how I feel

2700
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:13,039
about Matisyahu um dude that's kind of

2701
01:44:09,649 --> 01:44:14,839
ah so one day my buddy Ross Christian

2702
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:16,399
who was one of the guys it taught me a

2703
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,119
lot about Rastafari I shot it to Chris

2704
01:44:16,399 --> 01:44:20,029
much respect

2705
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:22,219
Ross Chris gave me a little CD with one

2706
01:44:20,029 --> 01:44:23,659
Matisyahu song I came home and listened

2707
01:44:22,219 --> 01:44:25,939
to it and I was like that is the [ __ ]

2708
01:44:23,659 --> 01:44:27,619
right there I just really liked the flow

2709
01:44:25,939 --> 01:44:29,599
like the music was good but I liked the

2710
01:44:27,619 --> 01:44:31,430
way it felt it just flowed really smooth

2711
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,680
his lyrics were really smooth over

2712
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:35,180
everything so I downloaded more right

2713
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:37,369
and I loved it I found shake off the

2714
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:39,980
dust of rise and I found whybut stubs or

2715
01:44:37,369 --> 01:44:42,590
what was available at that time so I was

2716
01:44:39,979 --> 01:44:45,049
driving from Pueblo Colorado to Lawrence

2717
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:47,510
Kansas on a regular basis I had a band

2718
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:48,860
out there and I was lived here and had a

2719
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:50,060
band out there and then I travel back

2720
01:44:48,859 --> 01:44:53,238
and forth all the time to take care of

2721
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:55,489
life I had a CD player in the car and

2722
01:44:53,238 --> 01:44:57,839
all of my CDs got stolen except for the

2723
01:44:55,488 --> 01:45:00,189
one that was in the CD player

2724
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,929
to a bunch of people I know and it was

2725
01:45:00,189 --> 01:45:03,939
why if it stubs it was the wife at stubs

2726
01:45:01,929 --> 01:45:05,440
album so that's what I had to drive back

2727
01:45:03,939 --> 01:45:07,149
and forth to Lawrence Kansas and it's

2728
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:08,789
about at an 11 hour drive depending on

2729
01:45:07,149 --> 01:45:11,618
traffic and depending on how things go

2730
01:45:08,789 --> 01:45:13,408
so that's 10 or 11 opportunities to

2731
01:45:11,618 --> 01:45:17,649
listen to that CD from beginning to end

2732
01:45:13,408 --> 01:45:18,308
both ways yeah I totally fell in love

2733
01:45:17,649 --> 01:45:20,049
with that album

2734
01:45:18,309 --> 01:45:21,760
dude shake off the dust rise came a

2735
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:24,340
little bit later in my life I think I

2736
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:25,989
got that one right after I got tired of

2737
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:29,739
the Y right after the theft after

2738
01:45:25,988 --> 01:45:31,388
everything got stolen but yeah so I went

2739
01:45:29,738 --> 01:45:32,979
to Lawrence Kansas and showed a couple

2740
01:45:31,389 --> 01:45:33,190
of my friends I was like check this guy

2741
01:45:32,979 --> 01:45:34,959
out

2742
01:45:33,189 --> 01:45:37,629
and then we saw Matt Walker Russa and on

2743
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:39,399
the first night at Wakarusa fest in 2005

2744
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:41,170
I believe there wasn't anybody there

2745
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:43,448
there's like 40 of us up front checking

2746
01:45:41,170 --> 01:45:44,828
out Matisyahu the second night there had

2747
01:45:43,448 --> 01:45:46,988
to be a hundred and fifty people there

2748
01:45:44,828 --> 01:45:48,549
the third night that place was packed

2749
01:45:46,988 --> 01:45:50,229
he took one night off it was like a four

2750
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:52,989
night festival he takes a Saturday off

2751
01:45:50,229 --> 01:45:54,638
for the the Sabbath by the Sunday night

2752
01:45:52,988 --> 01:45:57,759
when he played it was packed you

2753
01:45:54,639 --> 01:46:00,489
couldn't even get in the yes over three

2754
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:02,349
nights he just blew up like that so I

2755
01:46:00,488 --> 01:46:04,509
I've seen ma kiss I got to go see

2756
01:46:02,349 --> 01:46:06,010
Matisyahu on my one of my birthday's my

2757
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:07,719
girlfriend took me to see him at the

2758
01:46:06,010 --> 01:46:10,539
Beaumont theater in Kansas City Kansas

2759
01:46:07,719 --> 01:46:12,550
of all random places when I lived in

2760
01:46:10,539 --> 01:46:13,359
Lawrence so yeah I got to see montes a

2761
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:15,159
few times have seen her at the

2762
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:17,948
bottleneck and Lawrence I've seen him a

2763
01:46:15,158 --> 01:46:19,719
lot but yeah that artist meant a lot to

2764
01:46:17,948 --> 01:46:21,219
me just from that time period it really

2765
01:46:19,719 --> 01:46:24,698
brings me back to that whole time period

2766
01:46:21,219 --> 01:46:26,289
of my life it got no water was my

2767
01:46:24,698 --> 01:46:27,519
favorite montes song and then

2768
01:46:26,289 --> 01:46:30,399
unfortunately when he came out with the

2769
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:33,219
album youth I feel like he put all of

2770
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:35,469
his life's work into the shake off the

2771
01:46:33,219 --> 01:46:37,599
dust arise album like all of his writing

2772
01:46:35,469 --> 01:46:40,118
for 20 years of being a person he put

2773
01:46:37,599 --> 01:46:41,710
into that and then he did check out her

2774
01:46:40,118 --> 01:46:43,569
life at Stubbs which is basically the

2775
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:45,219
same thing just live and they're like

2776
01:46:43,569 --> 01:46:46,448
all right now you've got a production

2777
01:46:45,219 --> 01:46:47,920
deal in a record deal let's make an

2778
01:46:46,448 --> 01:46:54,039
expensive album and he was like oh [ __ ]

2779
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:55,719
I almost like I don't I don't like the

2780
01:46:54,039 --> 01:46:58,029
new stuff as much as I did the old stuff

2781
01:46:55,719 --> 01:46:59,770
but that happens to a lot of artists I

2782
01:46:58,029 --> 01:47:01,840
feel the same way about spearhead kind

2783
01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:04,510
of goldish it was much better there's

2784
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:07,600
something about music that whatever

2785
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:09,789
drives you to create it

2786
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:11,620
dyes weren't enough money lands on top

2787
01:47:09,789 --> 01:47:13,090
of it right that's kind of how I feel

2788
01:47:11,619 --> 01:47:14,619
about it like especially if you're like

2789
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:16,510
an angry band that's where you see it

2790
01:47:14,619 --> 01:47:18,039
the most take all right you just got

2791
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:20,320
like a twelve million dollar contract

2792
01:47:18,039 --> 01:47:21,760
why are you still angry right and unless

2793
01:47:20,319 --> 01:47:23,769
they really start buying just more

2794
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,840
expensive heroin or something right yeah

2795
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:27,280
where would we board with music this

2796
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:29,650
we've really gotten off the rails this

2797
01:47:27,279 --> 01:47:32,529
is Cass but we're losing just a lot

2798
01:47:29,649 --> 01:47:35,349
about weed he knows so much more about

2799
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:37,449
music I do know a lot about music yeah I

2800
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:39,160
could probably do music podcast I've

2801
01:47:37,449 --> 01:47:40,510
played the drums for so long I can read

2802
01:47:39,159 --> 01:47:43,329
and write music and I know a lot about

2803
01:47:40,510 --> 01:47:45,699
music music playing and listening and I

2804
01:47:43,329 --> 01:47:47,260
also know about bands yeah we could do a

2805
01:47:45,699 --> 01:47:49,809
whole show about that cuz we've gotten

2806
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:51,070
way off topic but where would we be

2807
01:47:49,810 --> 01:47:53,080
where would music be where would

2808
01:47:51,069 --> 01:47:53,920
musicians be if they didn't alter their

2809
01:47:53,079 --> 01:47:55,659
minds a little bit

2810
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,159
The Beatles wouldn't never came up with

2811
01:47:55,659 --> 01:48:02,260
any of that [ __ ] if they didn't start

2812
01:47:57,159 --> 01:48:03,670
life would be very for sure the Grateful

2813
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:07,030
Dead would not have been fun if I was

2814
01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:09,569
not tripping my face off I think there's

2815
01:48:07,029 --> 01:48:12,219
a great Lenny Bruce rant to that effect

2816
01:48:09,569 --> 01:48:13,359
alright so I want to put the show back

2817
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:14,560
on track just a little bit we're almost

2818
01:48:13,359 --> 01:48:16,539
10 minutes in and we haven't talked

2819
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:18,520

2821
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:22,500

to pump your head and heart with good

2828
01:48:33,909 --> 01:48:37,569

2935
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:14,840
because we are in Colorado everyone is

2936

marijuana recommendation from a doctor

2939
01:53:18,979 --> 01:53:23,599

2940
01:53:20,479 --> 01:53:25,309
plants but in the city of Pablo within

2941

anyway it's legal here just follow the

3021
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:33,529
simple rules and if somebody's trying to

3022
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:34,310
steal those plants call the cops that's

3023
01:56:33,529 --> 01:56:36,829
what they're there for

3024
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:39,050
that's why legalization is beautiful is

3025
01:56:36,829 --> 01:56:40,369
we finally get to use law enforcement

3026
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:43,429
when somebody tries to steal our weight

3027
01:56:40,369 --> 01:56:44,599
yeah and we had a friend recently stolen

3028
01:56:43,429 --> 01:56:47,239
from who actually called and reported

3029
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:49,520
his plants stolen and the cop asked him

3030
01:56:47,238 --> 01:56:51,169
how much was that plant going to harvest

3031
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,550
you was it going to yield and he told

3032
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:54,170
him how much of what would yield and he

3033
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:56,150
said what would that cost you to buy at

3034
01:56:54,170 --> 01:56:57,649
a dispensary and he told him what that

3035
01:56:56,149 --> 01:56:59,779
would cost per ounce he called me and

3036
01:56:57,649 --> 01:57:02,210
got a price quote right it's on it be

3037
01:56:59,779 --> 01:57:04,670
this much per ounce dude and so on the

3038
01:57:02,210 --> 01:57:07,189
police report they values each plant at

3039
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:09,409
what an ounce would cost at my shop and

3040
01:57:07,189 --> 01:57:10,969
now those people that will be caught

3041
01:57:09,409 --> 01:57:12,889
because they've got video of them

3042
01:57:10,969 --> 01:57:14,960
they'll be charged with felony theft

3043
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:18,110
because they took over a certain amount

3044
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:20,329
of dollars worth of product like the

3045

beaut the real beauty of legalization is

3046
01:57:20,329 --> 01:57:24,829
that we can use courts and lawyers and

3047
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:27,500
cops like the violence doesn't have to

3048

3074
01:58:23,988 --> 01:58:28,078
illegal outdoor grows

3075
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:30,300
just put it inside and put it inside

3079
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:38,130
it you can grow year round right just go

is free you guys but you got it in the

3084
01:58:46,559 --> 01:58:49,708
city of Pueblo it's illegal and if you

3085
01:58:48,029 --> 01:58:51,389
grow and it gets something like this

3086
01:58:49,708 --> 01:58:53,609
happens it puts a black eye on our

3087
01:58:51,389 --> 01:58:55,409
entire industry our entire community on

3088
01:58:53,609 --> 01:58:57,839
the plant on the movement on everything

3089
01:58:55,408 --> 01:59:00,598
somebody got shot over some weed because

3090
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:04,288
somebody was growing it outside ok just

3091
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:06,059
for the ballpark a decent little gross

3092
01:59:04,288 --> 01:59:09,118
setup for six plants is gonna run your

3093
01:59:06,059 --> 01:59:11,610
what the best gear 3 grand oh dude I

3094
01:59:09,118 --> 01:59:13,408
could set you up ready to grow for less

3095
01:59:11,609 --> 01:59:14,639
than a thousand bucks right but like if

3096
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:15,618
you want with the best like three or

3097
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:20,010
four Oh

3098
01:59:15,618 --> 01:59:22,139
25 how much would you pay to not just

3099
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:23,550
sweat for six months eight months while

3100
01:59:22,139 --> 01:59:25,319
your plants are out back right if

3101
01:59:23,550 --> 01:59:27,360
someone's gonna steal your effort that's

3102
01:59:25,319 --> 01:59:30,500
the truth like for me it's definitely

3103
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:32,509
worth more than a grinder tip and

3104
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:34,460
if you think about it this way if you're

3105
01:59:32,510 --> 01:59:37,159
growing enough outside to make it worth

3106
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:40,039
shooting somebody for it

3107
01:59:37,159 --> 01:59:41,659
you are doing your growing more than you

3108
01:59:40,039 --> 01:59:44,210
need probably maybe you're growing your

3109
01:59:41,659 --> 01:59:46,849
entire year supply I can't judge you but

3110
01:59:44,210 --> 01:59:48,590
think about the situation if you need if

3111
01:59:46,850 --> 01:59:50,329
you're growing that much you might be

3112
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:52,159
asking for something if you're trying to

3113
01:59:50,329 --> 01:59:53,600
get greedy you might be asking you might

3114
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:54,889
be inviting trouble if you're trying to

3115
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,990
get greedy is what I think I'm saying

3116
01:59:54,890 --> 01:59:58,820

3117
01:59:56,989 --> 02:00:00,920
harvesting enough weed to get him till

3118
01:59:58,819 --> 02:00:03,739

3119
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:05,960

3122
02:00:07,550 --> 02:00:11,090
kid's going to jail for trash like it's

3123
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:13,699

3124
02:00:11,090 --> 02:00:14,180

02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:40,480
a feeling this guy would yeah okay you

3134
02:00:38,619 --> 02:00:42,010
know we had an incident in the city a

3135
02:00:40,479 --> 02:00:44,619
couple of years ago it got a whole lot

3136
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:46,570
of press because it was particularly

3137
02:00:44,619 --> 02:00:48,039
brutal this guy kind of lived in the

3138
02:00:46,569 --> 02:00:50,039
middle of nowhere and had a trash pile

3139
02:00:48,039 --> 02:00:52,329
with a bunch of scrap metal in it and

3140
02:00:50,039 --> 02:00:53,920
people kept pulling up in the middle of

3141
02:00:52,329 --> 02:00:56,289
the night and stealing his scrap metal

3142
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:58,449
so one night he got his rifle and turned

3143
02:00:56,289 --> 02:01:00,039
all the lights off and when the pickup

3144
02:00:58,449 --> 02:01:01,720
truck showed up the people climbed out

3145
02:01:00,039 --> 02:01:03,310
and turned flashlights on he opened fire

3146
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:05,050
he killed one of them wounded another

3147
02:01:03,310 --> 02:01:07,150
one held one of them at gunpoint till

3148
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:09,400
the cops got there it was looking at

3149
02:01:07,149 --> 02:01:12,579
like first-degree murder charges because

3150
02:01:09,399 --> 02:01:14,199
that's first-degree murder like you

3151
02:01:12,579 --> 02:01:17,739
can't lie in wait and kill people he

3152
02:01:14,199 --> 02:01:20,849
plays the [ __ ] an event like

3153
02:01:17,739 --> 02:01:23,380
I don't know it's just blow people oh

3154
02:01:20,850 --> 02:01:26,740
man this is gonna happen all over the

3155
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:29,699
country just Oregon - its Ripper season

3156
02:01:26,739 --> 02:01:32,199
you guys don't like that's a big part of

3157
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:35,019
growing marijuana it used to be because

3158
02:01:32,199 --> 02:01:36,729
it was illegal but it was always also

3159
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:38,350
because marijuana is worth a lot of

3160
02:01:36,729 --> 02:01:40,689
money especially in places where it

3161
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:43,420
isn't legal and if you can steal it from

3162
02:01:40,689 --> 02:01:44,889
someone your your cost is zero and you

3163
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:46,960
can take it somewhere where you can sell

3164
02:01:44,890 --> 02:01:49,539
it for six eight thousand a pound so

3165
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:50,920
people are gonna try to steal it and the

3166
02:01:49,539 --> 02:01:51,609
people that are gonna try to steal it

3167
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:56,020
are [ __ ]

3168
02:01:51,609 --> 02:01:57,519
these guys are professionals story I was

3169
02:01:56,020 --> 02:02:01,200
told a story of somebody who got into a

3170
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:03,310
greenhouse with a poly vinyl cover I

3171
02:02:01,199 --> 02:02:04,750
don't know exactly what that shit's

3172
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:07,000
called the greenhouse covering thick

3173
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:09,520
covering they cut a three foot tall slit

3174
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:11,439
in the cover is two slit three feet tall

3175
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:13,810
and they took every [ __ ] plant out of

3176
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:16,359
the greenhouse did not leave a footprint

3177
02:02:13,810 --> 02:02:19,210
nor a leaf behind and cleaned the entire

3178
02:02:16,359 --> 02:02:20,589
greenhouse out these guys are

3179
02:02:19,210 --> 02:02:21,760
professionals there are experienced

3180
02:02:20,590 --> 02:02:23,980
rippers out there and they're at work

3181
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:25,600
all for the next week or two just taking

3182
02:02:23,979 --> 02:02:27,309
crops that are finished alright I hope

3183
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:28,539
you guys get your plants cut down dude

3184
02:02:27,310 --> 02:02:31,920
if someone comes to steal your plants

3185
02:02:28,539 --> 02:02:31,920
please don't shoot them don't go to jail

3186
02:02:35,909 --> 02:02:39,250
don't let your dogs out if you let your

3187
02:02:37,989 --> 02:02:40,989
dog out your dog bites somebody you

3188
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:42,399
gotta put your dog down so and that

3189
02:02:40,989 --> 02:02:44,800
person may shoot your dog so just keep

3190
02:02:42,399 --> 02:02:47,589
the dog in the house like there's

3191
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:49,060
there's really not a great option here

3192
02:02:47,590 --> 02:02:51,909
like that's one of the things that sucks

3193
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:56,440
call the cops call the police you've got

3194
02:02:51,909 --> 02:02:59,139
I guess so huh or grow indoors we just

3195
02:02:56,439 --> 02:03:02,439
get shot for confronting some taggers in

3196
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:04,690
the alley so I'm really kind of anti you

3197
02:03:02,439 --> 02:03:07,029
know doing anything right now other than

3198
02:03:04,689 --> 02:03:08,049
like bringing official that's what

3199
02:03:07,029 --> 02:03:10,149
they're there for just call the cops

3200
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:11,800
yeah don't try to be a vigilante and I

3201
02:03:10,149 --> 02:03:17,889
always hated the not doing it because I

3202
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:19,960
had weed and I didn't because I had weed

3203
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:22,119
or smell like weed or just smoked right

3204
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:23,619
yeah

3205
02:03:22,119 --> 02:03:25,329
just call 9-1-1 and say hey there's a

3206
02:03:23,619 --> 02:03:28,859
car upside down on the interstate why

3207
02:03:25,329 --> 02:03:28,859
don't you stop sometimes [ __ ]

3208
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:33,060
all right guys gosh excuse my

3209
02:03:32,039 --> 02:03:35,970
throat-clearing I'm gonna give it one

3210
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:39,500
good one I'll be done that was just

3211
02:03:35,970 --> 02:03:39,500
exaggerating I think I'm good though

3212
02:03:39,649 --> 02:03:45,389
that's the bad news

3213
02:03:41,310 --> 02:03:49,440
let's find some yeah not great news

3214
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:52,590
this one we're not gonna talk about the

3215
02:03:49,439 --> 02:03:54,599
spot but guess what the spot will be

3216
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:57,210
uses an example in the following this

3217
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:59,250
bottle the spot passed all these tests

3218
02:03:57,210 --> 02:04:01,500
with flying colors we do not get any

3219
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:03,600
violations everything is legit at the

3220
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:06,779
spot we are champions so with that being

3221
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:08,789
said the headline for this article is 7

3222

02:04:38,539 --> 02:04:42,810
police issued 7 citations for underage

3234
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:44,640
retail marijuana sales during an

3235
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:46,680
enforcement operation at 30 shops last

3236
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:48,690
week officials said on Wednesday police

3237
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:50,490
say they conducted checks Friday in an

3238
02:04:48,689 --> 02:04:52,259
effort to audit any potential underage

3239
02:04:50,489 --> 02:04:54,779
sales and found there to be lower

3240
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:56,489
underage compliance rate to be a lower

3241
02:04:54,779 --> 02:04:58,710
underage compliance rate sir I read that

3242
02:04:56,489 --> 02:05:00,389
walkie we're disappointed said Lewis

3243
02:04:58,710 --> 02:05:02,939
koski director of Colorado's marijuana

3244
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:04,710
Enforcement Division in a statement up

3245
02:05:02,939 --> 02:05:06,659
until now these compliance checks have

3246
02:05:04,710 --> 02:05:11,039
been a bright spot for the industry this

3247
02:05:06,659 --> 02:05:13,859
recent check drops compliance to 92% and

3248
02:05:11,039 --> 02:05:17,100
we're at 99 before [ __ ] [ __ ]

3249
02:05:13,859 --> 02:05:18,630
making us look bad the news comes as a

3250
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:20,730
blow to recreational marijuana in

3251
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:22,470
Colorado especially since the in the

3252
02:05:20,729 --> 02:05:24,149
roughly 21 minutes months since

3253
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:26,070
recreational marijuana has been legal

3254
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:28,139
stores mostly have been lauded for their

3255
02:05:26,069 --> 02:05:29,639
compliance owners and operators have

3256
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:31,230
been praised for their handling of the

3257
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:34,619
hot-button topic of underage possession

3258
02:05:31,229 --> 02:05:36,799
and consumption so in Colorado what

3259
02:05:34,619 --> 02:05:40,448
they're mainly worried about is this

3260
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:42,550
weed being sold to people who are not 21

3261
02:05:40,448 --> 02:05:43,779
and also we being sold out the back door

3262
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:47,650
of the dispensary that isn't being

3263
02:05:43,779 --> 02:05:49,659
documented if underage sales and product

3264
02:05:47,649 --> 02:05:52,809
and leaving a shop headed out of state

3265
02:05:49,659 --> 02:05:55,119
uh you know in bulk in bulk yes that are

3266
02:05:52,810 --> 02:05:58,690
are the two things that were really

3267
02:05:55,119 --> 02:06:01,029
really really seeking to avoid here they

3268
02:05:58,689 --> 02:06:02,948
call those the fatal flaws yep those are

3269
02:06:01,029 --> 02:06:04,929
the things that will trigger federal

3270
02:06:02,948 --> 02:06:09,250
intervention if they get out of hand

3271
02:06:04,929 --> 02:06:12,250
yes and I mean just in my world all of

3272
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:14,260
the anti pop people love [ __ ] like this

3273
02:06:12,250 --> 02:06:17,170
like it doesn't matter that we only drop

3274
02:06:14,260 --> 02:06:19,750
down percentage-wise to inline with

3275
02:06:17,170 --> 02:06:22,300
alcohol and tobacco retailers like all

3276
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:24,130
three of those businesses sit at about a

3277
02:06:22,300 --> 02:06:26,560
ninety two percent compliance rate like

3278
02:06:24,130 --> 02:06:28,539
ninety to ninety two and we're at ninety

3279
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:31,270
two now thanks to this we were at ninety

3280
02:06:28,539 --> 02:06:32,859
nine thanks to Aspen [ __ ] [ __ ]

3281
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:35,380
there were two shops in Aspen that were

3282
02:06:32,859 --> 02:06:37,809
busted a while ago after they were

3283
02:06:35,380 --> 02:06:39,550
busted pretty much every shop in the

3284
02:06:37,810 --> 02:06:41,920
state got a letter saying hey make sure

3285
02:06:39,550 --> 02:06:44,679
your ID check system is up to snuff

3286
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:46,899
we're doing compliance checks we're not

3287
02:06:44,679 --> 02:06:49,690
trying to scam you like they're not

3288
02:06:46,899 --> 02:06:52,029
gonna pretend that they're 21 and show a

3289
02:06:49,689 --> 02:06:54,909
fake ID or something it'll be an under

3290
02:06:52,029 --> 02:06:56,349
21 ID and you'll [ __ ] it up that's how

3291
02:06:54,909 --> 02:06:59,469
you get stoned and in the state of

3292
02:06:56,350 --> 02:07:01,719
Colorado our IDs are vertical horizontal

3293
02:06:59,469 --> 02:07:03,340
yeah if you're over 21 it fits one way

3294
02:07:01,719 --> 02:07:04,569
on the card and if you're under 21 it

3295
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:06,550
fits yeah so that should be obvious

3296
02:07:04,569 --> 02:07:08,109
because you have to look at the

3297
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:10,900
verticals like I just had a family

3298
02:07:08,109 --> 02:07:13,269
member turn 21 and her ID so good for

3299
02:07:10,899 --> 02:07:15,129
several months so you've got to read the

3300
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:16,780
date but how it's not hard

3301
02:07:15,130 --> 02:07:18,699
happy birthday I know who you are happy

3302
02:07:16,779 --> 02:07:20,439
birthday everybody go get a little flip

3303
02:07:18,698 --> 02:07:24,428
calendar with the you can't buy [ __ ]

3304
02:07:20,439 --> 02:07:26,198
here if he was born before somebody up

3305
02:07:24,429 --> 02:07:27,640
front who's trained and experienced in

3306
02:07:26,198 --> 02:07:29,349
checking IDs right we have armed

3307
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:31,600
security checking every idea that comes

3308
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:33,550
to the store and we turn away 65 girls

3309
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:35,800
all the time because their ID expired a

3310
02:07:33,550 --> 02:07:37,210
week ago this is how strict our shop is

3311
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:38,770
and I know you said we were gonna talk

3312
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:41,289
about the spot but this is an example of

3313
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:42,850
what should be done ah you gotta do it

3314
02:07:41,289 --> 02:07:45,159
right right now the fire inspector

3315
02:07:42,850 --> 02:07:46,449
showed up and the fire inspector said

3316
02:07:45,159 --> 02:07:48,130
hey I'm here to look in the back of the

3317
02:07:46,448 --> 02:07:49,269
building and the security guard said and

3318
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:50,449
who are you and he said I'm the fire

3319
02:07:49,270 --> 02:07:51,920
inspector

3320
02:07:50,448 --> 02:07:53,329
security guard said sir can I see your

3321
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:55,039
ID and he said I don't have an ID I'm

3322
02:07:53,329 --> 02:07:56,149
the fire inspector and the security

3323
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:57,529
guard stuck out his head and said I'm

3324
02:07:56,149 --> 02:08:00,049
John on the security guard good to meet

3325
02:07:57,529 --> 02:08:01,399
you can I see your ID and the guy was

3326
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:02,929
like I'm the fire inspector I don't need

3327
02:08:01,399 --> 02:08:04,819
an ID because I don't know who you are

3328
02:08:02,929 --> 02:08:06,260
you can't come in here and sent the fire

3329
02:08:04,819 --> 02:08:08,269
inspector away because he didn't have

3330
02:08:06,260 --> 02:08:08,719
proper identification he was in a fire

3331
02:08:08,270 --> 02:08:11,360
truck

3332
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:13,429
but dude didn't have ID so we can't let

3333
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:14,988
him in there that's period

3334
02:08:13,429 --> 02:08:16,609
I've yeah period that's the rule you

3335

3336
02:08:16,609 --> 02:08:19,969
occur you could be Barack [ __ ] Obama

3337
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:22,939
and I don't think we let you in there

3338
02:08:19,969 --> 02:08:25,010
unless you pull out that ID we had cops

3339
02:08:22,939 --> 02:08:27,469

security guard checked their IDs it was

3342
02:08:29,750 --> 02:08:33,198

02:08:31,698 --> 02:08:34,789
tenders were standing there like dude

3344

he's really checking their IDs it's the

3345
02:08:34,789 --> 02:08:37,909
third one in a row he's getting his

3346
02:08:36,590 --> 02:08:39,350
wallet out he's bought his driver's

3347
02:08:37,909 --> 02:08:41,479

02:08:44,630 --> 02:08:48,500
comes in gets ID'd if your IDs expired

3352

3354
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:54,469
legal industry needs to be able to do

3355
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:57,289
this it's not complicated we make

3356
02:08:54,469 --> 02:09:00,198
vendors wait in the entry room if they

3357
02:08:57,289 --> 02:09:01,640
don't have them go back to the offices

3358
02:09:00,198 --> 02:09:03,919
you have to wait right here in this

3359
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:05,360
chair welcome and then we make them wait

3360
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:06,679

3361
02:09:05,359 --> 02:09:07,689
don't have their ID we handle everybody

3362
02:09:06,679 --> 02:09:09,679
else first

3363
02:09:07,689 --> 02:09:11,000
all right let's get back to this article

3364
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:12,289
we were talking a little bit about the

3365
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:14,810
spot we said we weren't gonna whereas

3366
02:09:12,289 --> 02:09:16,488
praising the rules that were followed in

3367
02:09:14,810 --> 02:09:18,020
Washington state by comparison which

3368
02:09:16,488 --> 02:09:20,389
legalized recreational marijuana at the

3369
02:09:18,020 --> 02:09:22,100
same time Colorado did but implemented

3370
02:09:20,390 --> 02:09:24,380
recreational sales six months later

3371
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:26,840
several stores have been reprimanded for

3372
02:09:24,380 --> 02:09:28,699
selling to minors Kowski said despite a

3373
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:30,770
lack of repeat violations at any one

3374
02:09:28,698 --> 02:09:32,719
licensed shop this represents a downward

3375
02:09:30,770 --> 02:09:34,610
trend in compliance that is concerning

3376
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:36,230
that is very true

3377
02:09:34,609 --> 02:09:38,359
we've been at it for just over almost

3378
02:09:36,229 --> 02:09:39,948
two years now holy [ __ ] time flies there

3379
02:09:38,359 --> 02:09:43,009
was a lot of information in that last

3380
02:09:39,948 --> 02:09:45,829
paragraph there re stinging purposefully

3381
02:09:43,010 --> 02:09:47,510
restating businesses that failed to make

3382
02:09:45,829 --> 02:09:50,659
sure that they're back in compliance

3383
02:09:47,510 --> 02:09:52,250
where they need to be yes another piece

3384
02:09:50,659 --> 02:09:56,029
of information you might enjoy dear

3385
02:09:52,250 --> 02:09:57,859
listeners is if you're a tobacco or

3386
02:09:56,029 --> 02:10:00,829
alcohol retailer the fines usually about

3387
02:09:57,859 --> 02:10:03,009
ten thousand for screwing up an ID check

3388
02:10:00,829 --> 02:10:04,600
if you're a marijuana retailer

3389
02:10:03,010 --> 02:10:06,760
the first two penalties you face or

3390
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:10,120
$100,000 fine and you can lose your

3391
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:11,860
license $100,000 so it's 10 times the

3392
02:10:10,119 --> 02:10:15,069
fine if you screw this up as a marijuana

3393
02:10:11,859 --> 02:10:17,049
business that could close a shop yeah

3394
02:10:15,069 --> 02:10:18,789
that could absolutely close a smaller

3395
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:21,610
dispensary that can shut it down a new

3396
02:10:18,789 --> 02:10:23,439
dispensary they could be gone yeah ouch

3397
02:10:21,609 --> 02:10:25,089
I know a lot of shops oh that would have

3398
02:10:23,439 --> 02:10:26,529
closed down in their first year that

3399
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:28,390
would have closed down that Mike and I

3400
02:10:26,529 --> 02:10:30,250
worked we met each other well I don't

3401
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:32,470
know we we became good friends through

3402
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:34,119
that probably that would destroy

3403
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:35,170
tomorrow they would yeah hundred

3404
02:10:34,119 --> 02:10:37,599
thousand dollar fine that woulda just

3405
02:10:35,170 --> 02:10:39,190
closed that place down and went there I

3406
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:40,630
would have been hungry all right I'm

3407
02:10:39,189 --> 02:10:42,460
gonna continue with the article here it

3408
02:10:40,630 --> 02:10:43,930
says when reach my phone representatives

3409
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:45,730
at 5:00 of the shop cited either

3410
02:10:43,930 --> 02:10:47,260
declined to immediately comment or said

3411
02:10:45,729 --> 02:10:48,629
they could not discuss the citations

3412
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:49,829
because of ongoing criminal

3413
02:10:48,630 --> 02:10:51,819
investigations

3414
02:10:49,829 --> 02:10:53,529
obviously we failed in our mission to

3415
02:10:51,819 --> 02:10:55,929
keep people under 21 out of our shop

3416
02:10:53,529 --> 02:10:58,059
sent Ryan Fowler owner of the cited

3417
02:10:55,930 --> 02:11:00,489
store red eye relief I'm incredibly

3418
02:10:58,060 --> 02:11:02,140
disappointed I must say I like the name

3419
02:11:00,488 --> 02:11:04,119
red eye relief that sounds like

3420
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:06,250
something I would have said I Drive by

3421
02:11:04,119 --> 02:11:08,319
two of these shops regularly when I'm in

3422
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:10,449
Denver I almost stopped at one of them

3423
02:11:08,319 --> 02:11:12,009
the last time I was up and never just a

3424
02:11:10,449 --> 02:11:15,639
few days ago should have stopped doodle

3425
02:11:12,010 --> 02:11:17,680
at you feller said four employees

3426
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:19,750
including a store manager were fired in

3427
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:21,700
the citations wake he added the shop

3428
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:23,380
will stop accepting vertical

3429
02:11:21,699 --> 02:11:25,238
identification cards and begin using

3430
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:28,150
electronic verification to ensure there

3431
02:11:25,238 --> 02:11:29,859
are no underage customers so even if

3432
02:11:28,149 --> 02:11:32,149
you're 21 and you have a vertical card

3433
02:11:29,859 --> 02:11:34,969
they're not going to let you win

3434
02:11:32,149 --> 02:11:37,250
yep which is nonsense yeah you can fully

3435
02:11:34,969 --> 02:11:39,380
let in people that are 21 and you should

3436
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:42,109
they're perfectly legally allowed to

3437
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:44,630
shop in your business um same thing with

3438
02:11:42,109 --> 02:11:46,279
the electronic card reader if you're you

3439
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:47,840
can't look at the day and see what it

3440
02:11:46,279 --> 02:11:50,689
says the electronic card reader I can

3441
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:52,250
help you that's true it shows your age

3442
02:11:50,689 --> 02:11:54,500
actually when you slide that card reader

3443
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:56,118
it shows the actual age yeah but if you

3444
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:59,029
can't read a year can you read a number

3445
02:11:56,118 --> 02:12:00,829
at all that's true you guys there are a

3446
02:11:59,029 --> 02:12:03,198
few dispensaries if you come to Colorado

3447
02:12:00,829 --> 02:12:05,059
and you shop at a dispensary there are a

3448
02:12:03,198 --> 02:12:06,379
few that run your card through that

3449
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:08,539
little card reader like they have at the

3450
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:10,639
bar that thing does not save any

3451
02:12:08,539 --> 02:12:12,198
information you guys it does not save

3452
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:13,760
any information it scans your ID and it

3453
02:12:12,198 --> 02:12:15,229
processes the information on your ID and

3454
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:17,210
then it shows how old you are is all it

3455
02:12:15,229 --> 02:12:19,098
does a lot of people are paranoid that

3456
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:20,599
that thing is showing your ID it does

3457
02:12:19,099 --> 02:12:22,429
not or that's keeping your information

3458
02:12:20,599 --> 02:12:23,779
it does not we're not allowed the

3459
02:12:22,429 --> 02:12:25,429
dispensaries are not allowed to track

3460
02:12:23,779 --> 02:12:27,618
your information the only thing that we

3461
02:12:25,429 --> 02:12:29,868
do keep track of is oftentimes

3462
02:12:27,618 --> 02:12:32,210
dispensaries will document what state

3463
02:12:29,868 --> 02:12:35,059
you are from and that is mostly for

3464
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:36,980
advertising and just marketing purposes

3465
02:12:35,060 --> 02:12:38,210
so we're not keeping your information we

3466
02:12:36,979 --> 02:12:43,388
don't want to know where you live we

3467
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:43,389
don't care we're out of room for records

3468
02:12:44,408 --> 02:12:48,920
we're sort of busy yeah like we don't

3469
02:12:47,599 --> 02:12:51,319
have time to even process that

3470
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:53,719
information let alone compile it a need

3471
02:12:51,319 --> 02:12:54,859
or anything to do with it either all

3472
02:12:53,719 --> 02:12:59,029
right I'm gonna get back into this

3473
02:12:54,859 --> 02:13:00,259
article um where was I there we go we

3474
02:12:59,029 --> 02:13:01,670
were very concerned about this matter at

3475
02:13:00,260 --> 02:13:04,010
the healing house said in a statement to

3476
02:13:01,670 --> 02:13:06,380
the Denver Post we are 100% committed to

3477
02:13:04,010 --> 02:13:08,000
compliance in all aspects of the law we

3478
02:13:06,380 --> 02:13:10,099
have had no issues in the past and we're

3479
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,170
taking this matter very seriously

3480
02:13:10,099 --> 02:13:13,880
officials say the citations for selling

3481
02:13:12,170 --> 02:13:16,699
marijuana to a person younger than 21

3482
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:19,368
were issued at 7 separate businesses the

3483
02:13:16,698 --> 02:13:20,598
charge is a class 1 misdemeanor oh so

3484
02:13:19,368 --> 02:13:23,059
they could also face criminal charges

3485
02:13:20,599 --> 02:13:24,800
huh the person who made the sale faces

3486
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:26,750
has already been cited was a criminal

3487
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:29,570
criminal charge and they'll be going to

3488
02:13:26,750 --> 02:13:30,770
court for it no I know we said we're not

3489
02:13:29,569 --> 02:13:33,289
gonna talk about the spot but when you

3490
02:13:30,770 --> 02:13:34,909
walk into most dispensaries there's a

3491
02:13:33,289 --> 02:13:37,429
security guard up front checking IDs

3492
02:13:34,908 --> 02:13:40,789
then he sends you back to the budtender

3493
02:13:37,429 --> 02:13:41,909
who sells you bud Huson then he rings

3494
02:13:40,789 --> 02:13:43,890
you up

3495
02:13:41,909 --> 02:13:48,359
who's responsible therefore that the

3496
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:51,930
security guard or the budtender you

3497
02:13:48,359 --> 02:13:54,059
should be checking an ID again worked

3498
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:56,280
we totally asked if we're at all worried

3499
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:58,730
about it we have a lot of faith in our

3500
02:13:56,279 --> 02:14:01,289
security guards we don't at all

3501
02:13:58,729 --> 02:14:03,899
tolerate the security guard not doing

3502
02:14:01,289 --> 02:14:06,300
his job correctly right there most of

3503
02:14:03,899 --> 02:14:08,729
those guys are there already goes the

3504
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:12,150
whole company's ex-military everyone and

3505
02:14:08,729 --> 02:14:14,039
that company's event so they're used to

3506
02:14:12,149 --> 02:14:16,769
doing everything perfect when they have

3507
02:14:14,039 --> 02:14:19,409
to it work and so it's simply done

3508
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:20,520
correctly every time we still ask from

3509
02:14:19,409 --> 02:14:22,139
time to time we've got a couple of

3510
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:25,020
people that come in the shop that looked

3511
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:27,810
very very young and they're both well

3512
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:29,820
over 21 but they don't look it yeah and

3513
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:32,100
so every time there's a new bud tender

3514
02:14:29,819 --> 02:14:33,449
there and even sometimes when you know

3515
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:35,550
there's just a lot of people there and

3516
02:14:33,449 --> 02:14:37,590
we want everybody to be confident that

3517
02:14:35,550 --> 02:14:39,360
we're not selling under 21 people we'll

3518
02:14:37,590 --> 02:14:40,710
just it can I see your ID again real

3519
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:42,630
quick man I'm sorry I just got to be

3520
02:14:40,710 --> 02:14:45,029
sure right because my butt on the line

3521
02:14:42,630 --> 02:14:47,520
true yeah you're way too pretty for jail

3522
02:14:45,029 --> 02:14:49,769
yeah it's like I really like you dude

3523
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:52,560
but you're not worth out okay no or your

3524
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:55,350
job yep this $40.00 sale is not worth

3525
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:58,890
$100,000 fine and my job right yeah the

3526
02:14:55,350 --> 02:15:00,210
criminal charge I'm gonna continue with

3527
02:14:58,890 --> 02:15:01,500
the article and I just realized that at

3528
02:15:00,210 --> 02:15:02,520
the bottom of the article I didn't see

3529
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:05,760
this when I skim through this the first

3530
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:08,670
time all of the shops are listed I like

3531
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:14,489
it so avoid them yeah or if you're not

3532
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:16,289
21 go there dispensaries need to be held

3533
02:15:14,489 --> 02:15:17,609
accountable said Tyler Henson president

3534
02:15:16,289 --> 02:15:19,619
of the Colorado cannabis Chamber of

3535
02:15:17,609 --> 02:15:21,509
Commerce your job as an owner and

3536
02:15:19,619 --> 02:15:24,269
operator is to insure your employees are

3537
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:26,640
readily trained that can't happen again

3538
02:15:24,270 --> 02:15:28,260
he added Henson said employers and their

3539
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:29,250
employees need to understand at what's

3540
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:31,260
at stake here

3541
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:33,779
officials say the violations can mean a

3542
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:36,060
license suspension a fine per individual

3543
02:15:33,779 --> 02:15:39,599
violation a fine in lieu of suspension

3544
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:42,090
up to $100,000 and license reef occasion

3545
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:43,980
and that sounds so serious when you put

3546
02:15:42,090 --> 02:15:46,529
it like that I mean think about it dude

3547
02:15:43,979 --> 02:15:48,609
what what did the one shop down here do

3548
02:15:46,529 --> 02:15:51,250
they got their license pole

3549
02:15:48,609 --> 02:15:52,509
my consumption on side consumers wasn't

3550
02:15:51,250 --> 02:15:55,449
like they were giving out dabs in the

3551
02:15:52,510 --> 02:15:57,730
bedroom no they had roaches in an

3552
02:15:55,449 --> 02:16:01,149
employee bathroom and it was enough for

3553
02:15:57,729 --> 02:16:04,479
them to lose to snore licenses underage

3554
02:16:01,149 --> 02:16:06,339
sales they haven't closed the shop that

3555
02:16:04,479 --> 02:16:08,769
I know of yet but I don't think any of

3556
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:11,159
the cases that have screwed this up have

3557
02:16:08,770 --> 02:16:14,140
gone through that process completely yet

3558
02:16:11,159 --> 02:16:16,210
time will tell it's brand new yep

3559
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:18,010
my guess is a couple of people are gonna

3560
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:20,079
lose their license if you get stung

3561
02:16:18,010 --> 02:16:21,310
twice I would bet on it oh yeah twice

3562
02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:22,960
they should yeah yeah

3563
02:16:21,310 --> 02:16:24,789
so it says sanctions may also include

3564
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:27,369
restrictions on the license police said

3565
02:16:24,789 --> 02:16:28,930
in a news release investigators say they

3566
02:16:27,369 --> 02:16:30,970
will file the cases with the Denver City

3567
02:16:28,930 --> 02:16:32,649
Attorney's Office which could issue its

3568
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:34,319
own discipline raging from license

3569
02:16:32,649 --> 02:16:36,279
suspension to license revocation

3570
02:16:34,319 --> 02:16:38,020
according to the Colorado Department of

3571
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:41,110
Revenue the marijuana enforcement

3572
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:43,630
division has conducted 172 compliance

3573
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:49,060
checks since January 1st of 2014 and

3574
02:16:43,629 --> 02:16:52,149
found 16 total violations so it goes on

3575
02:16:49,059 --> 02:16:54,760
to say Denver marijuana shops were cited

3576
02:16:52,149 --> 02:16:57,190
where citations were issued and then it

3577
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:59,680
lists them it says the herbal cure on

3578
02:16:57,190 --> 02:17:02,409

02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:26,110
reputation that are [ __ ] up I don't

3589
02:17:24,219 --> 02:17:29,229
know how a [ __ ] some of these shops

3590
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:32,380
messed this up red eye relief on South

3591
02:17:29,229 --> 02:17:35,579
Cherokee Street you know we can chalk a

3592
02:17:32,379 --> 02:17:37,779
couple of them up to a lazy employee or

3593
02:17:35,579 --> 02:17:39,610
somebody up at the front not giving a

3594
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:42,430
[ __ ] and you just hand him an ID and

3595
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:44,230
like they look I've been not old enough

3596
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:46,899
and gotten into clubs just by handing

3597
02:17:44,229 --> 02:17:48,399
the bouncer an ID here it was my ID that

3598
02:17:46,899 --> 02:17:50,590
said I was not 21 and he's like oh you

3599
02:17:48,399 --> 02:17:52,000
got an ID here just hands it back like

3600
02:17:50,590 --> 02:17:53,440
you said some people are [ __ ] smart

3601
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,840
enough to read an ID to figure out that

3602
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:58,380
nineteen seventy whatever means you're

3603
02:17:55,840 --> 02:18:00,148
this how old

3604
02:17:58,379 --> 02:18:02,069
sometimes so we can give a couple of

3605
02:18:00,148 --> 02:18:03,599
those just to dumb employees some of

3606
02:18:02,069 --> 02:18:05,099
it's just brought one of them one or two

3607
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:09,870
is probably just somebody let somebody

3608
02:18:05,099 --> 02:18:12,689
slip through just like I don't know what

3609
02:18:09,870 --> 02:18:14,670
it is but if you give that you know if

3610
02:18:12,689 --> 02:18:16,880
selling to people under 21 is part of

3611
02:18:14,670 --> 02:18:19,860
your business model you can go yeah

3612
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:21,449
we're trying to set a positive standard

3613
02:18:19,860 --> 02:18:23,219
here and do things correctly we're

3614
02:18:21,450 --> 02:18:23,639
literally front and center on the world

3615
02:18:23,218 --> 02:18:27,478
stage

3616
02:18:23,638 --> 02:18:30,779
when other nations bring up marijuana

3617
02:18:27,478 --> 02:18:32,579
legalization as an idea or a concept

3618
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:34,559
that they might want to pursue they

3619
02:18:32,579 --> 02:18:38,069
discuss what's happening in Colorado yes

3620
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:41,609
we are the mom every now and then I hear

3621
02:18:38,069 --> 02:18:43,860
about someone from France or London I'm

3622
02:18:41,610 --> 02:18:46,200
coming through Pueblo and taking a look

3623
02:18:43,860 --> 02:18:47,729
at what we're doing here in Pueblo which

3624
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:49,200
this never would happened five years ago

3625
02:18:47,728 --> 02:18:51,058
true there's no reason for any of these

3626
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:52,139
people to be here very trial and be

3627
02:18:51,058 --> 02:18:54,000
interested in what we're doing what

3628
02:18:52,138 --> 02:18:56,098
they're coming here to see how marijuana

3629
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:59,250
legalization works in practice

3630
02:18:56,099 --> 02:19:03,000
and if they see teenagers waiting in

3631
02:18:59,250 --> 02:19:05,239
line it's not going well it's not gonna

3632
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,290
spread and it should that's the truth

you prefer to take so you're looking for

3681
02:21:01,779 --> 02:21:06,880
regular dab sighs not this one time my

3682
02:21:04,270 --> 02:21:08,949
friend dared me to take I wanna know

3683
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:10,448
yeah yeah if you're about to just pull

3684
02:21:08,949 --> 02:21:11,710
off the dab for yourself if it's your

3685
02:21:10,449 --> 02:21:12,760
normal day if your dad but I want to

3686
02:21:11,709 --> 02:21:14,589
know what you pull off but your average

3687
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:16,988
and then tell me how many of those you

3688
02:21:14,590 --> 02:21:18,460
take in a dab session also because if

3689
02:21:16,988 --> 02:21:20,978
you take a half gram and you only take

3690
02:21:18,459 --> 02:21:23,438
one of them then that's cool if you take

3691
02:21:20,978 --> 02:21:24,368
five point ones that's cool so I just

3692
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:27,189
want to know how you do it

3693
02:21:24,369 --> 02:21:31,119
I'm just curious I myself like to take a

3694
02:21:27,189 --> 02:21:32,289
whole bunch of 0.3 like 0.3 is about

3695
02:21:31,119 --> 02:21:33,909
where I like to be and I like to take a

3696
02:21:32,289 --> 02:21:37,149
bunch of like about 6 or 7 of them

3697
02:21:33,908 --> 02:21:39,279
sometimes on a lunch break I'll take 3.3

3698
02:21:37,148 --> 02:21:40,358
ziz what I like for a lunch break I'm

3699
02:21:39,279 --> 02:21:43,800
gonna take a cab right now right now I'm

3700
02:21:40,359 --> 02:21:43,800
hitting the hit man let's do this

3701
02:21:46,250 --> 02:21:51,029
really well you don't remember how bad I

3702
02:21:48,020 --> 02:21:54,149
cost no cost

3703
02:21:51,029 --> 02:21:56,578
little cough so recently I picked up a

3704
02:21:54,148 --> 02:21:58,948
mother ship knockoff it really looks

3705
02:21:56,578 --> 02:22:02,219
just like a mother ship Klein but it was

3706
02:21:58,949 --> 02:22:04,168
thinner I think if the glass may be a

3707
02:22:02,219 --> 02:22:06,059
little thinner not that not so much the

3708
02:22:04,168 --> 02:22:08,760
go yeah maybe a little bit the glass way

3709
02:22:06,059 --> 02:22:10,889
too but the overall size of the rig the

3710
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:13,289
cylinder going up this is thinner in

3711
02:22:10,889 --> 02:22:16,378
diameter okay maybe a little bit

3712
02:22:13,289 --> 02:22:20,640
shrunken of a ship but it was a fifth of

3713
02:22:16,379 --> 02:22:22,319
the price of a mother ship it's a great

3714
02:22:20,639 --> 02:22:23,519
rate so shut up to elevate in Colorado

3715
02:22:22,318 --> 02:22:25,528
Springs I know I've said that once or

3716
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:27,238
twice this show but I've been buying a

3717
02:22:25,529 --> 02:22:29,399
lot of glass from them and I appreciate

3718
02:22:27,238 --> 02:22:31,318
the hookups this little hit man hits

3719
02:22:29,398 --> 02:22:32,728
like a goddamn truck I'm trying to act

3720
02:22:31,318 --> 02:22:33,868
like I'm not trying to choke and trying

3721
02:22:32,728 --> 02:22:35,219
to act like I've got my breath together

3722
02:22:33,869 --> 02:22:37,439
everything but guess what there's almost

3723
02:22:35,219 --> 02:22:45,028
no resistance is straight from nails

3724
02:22:37,439 --> 02:22:46,318
along oh that you just get a sometimes

3725
02:22:45,029 --> 02:22:48,119
you guys want to take a big dab it

3726
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:53,778
sounds like Charlie Brown's the adults

3727
02:22:48,119 --> 02:22:55,680
in the sounds like after a big dab

3728
02:22:53,779 --> 02:22:57,748
sometimes it takes me a minute to dig

3729
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:59,939
through that hole but I feel like I'm

3730
02:22:57,748 --> 02:23:01,738
back we're celebrating Oregon having

3731
02:22:59,939 --> 02:23:03,658
recreational sales of cannabis right

3732
02:23:01,738 --> 02:23:08,878
welcome to the club you're the closer

3733
02:23:03,658 --> 02:23:11,128
see the cool kids hostess this is from

3734
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:12,419
Portland Oregon and it says excited

3735
02:23:11,129 --> 02:23:14,039
shoppers looking to score some of the

3736
02:23:12,418 --> 02:23:16,439
first recreational marijuana sold

3737
02:23:14,039 --> 02:23:18,779
legally in Oregon bought up baggies of

3738
02:23:16,439 --> 02:23:21,078
Bud early Thursday taking advantage of

3739
02:23:18,779 --> 02:23:23,789
doorbuster prices and other deals

3740
02:23:21,078 --> 02:23:26,189
goddamn that's such a poetic opening

3741
02:23:23,789 --> 02:23:30,959
line for a news article whoever wrote

3742
02:23:26,189 --> 02:23:32,850
this is majestic some of the more than

3743
02:23:30,959 --> 02:23:34,439
250 dispensaries that already offer

3744
02:23:32,850 --> 02:23:36,149
medical marijuana in the state welcome

3745
02:23:34,439 --> 02:23:38,158
to recreational users soon after

3746
02:23:36,148 --> 02:23:39,958
midnight just moments after it became

3747
02:23:38,158 --> 02:23:48,838
legal to sell to anyone who is at least

3748
02:23:39,959 --> 02:23:51,600
21 right Shango premium cannabis in

3749
02:23:48,838 --> 02:23:53,309
Portland a co-founder Shane McKee said

3750
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:54,720
the first sale came about a minute after

3751
02:23:53,309 --> 02:23:57,118
midnight and many others quickly

3752
02:23:54,719 --> 02:23:58,918
followed I think it's not only

3753
02:23:57,119 --> 02:24:00,899
historical for folks in Oregon but

3754
02:23:58,918 --> 02:24:02,369
nationwide anytime people start selling

3755
02:24:00,898 --> 02:24:04,510
that as an alternative to alcohol or

3756
02:24:02,369 --> 02:24:07,569
tobacco he said in a telephone

3757
02:24:04,510 --> 02:24:09,609
Brad Suzman co-owner of Kanna daddy's in

3758
02:24:07,568 --> 02:24:11,260
Portland said more than 90 customers

3759
02:24:09,609 --> 02:24:13,870
bought pot in the first two hours at the

3760
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:16,120
store opened at 7:00 a.m. so people were

3761
02:24:13,870 --> 02:24:18,040
out there at midnight buying weed out

3762
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:19,930
there at 7:00 a.m. by and weed that's

3763
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:22,120
pretty neat it's like when a new video

3764
02:24:19,930 --> 02:24:23,710
game goes on sale something like that

3765
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:30,189
lines out the door people just buying

3766
02:24:23,709 --> 02:24:32,438
weed I'm torn with this story I first

3767
02:24:30,189 --> 02:24:35,739
I'm elated that another state is joining

3768
02:24:32,439 --> 02:24:38,020
the legalization ranks I'm glad they

3769
02:24:35,739 --> 02:24:40,809
they're celebrating I'm glad people came

3770
02:24:38,020 --> 02:24:42,729
out and that the lines were good a lot

3771
02:24:40,809 --> 02:24:44,829
of medical shops are converting so

3772
02:24:42,728 --> 02:24:46,239
supply might not be the problem it's

3773
02:24:44,829 --> 02:24:49,510
been another legal states which is

3774
02:24:46,239 --> 02:24:51,309
awesome but at the same time it's time

3775
02:24:49,510 --> 02:24:52,779
to knock off the shenanigans and step

3776
02:24:51,309 --> 02:24:54,519
all the way up into the legal industry

3777
02:24:52,779 --> 02:24:55,840
you got to put your best foot forward or

3778
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:57,880
you're gonna [ __ ] it up for everyone and

3779
02:24:55,840 --> 02:25:00,549
there were a couple of things about the

3780
02:24:57,879 --> 02:25:03,699
rollout in Oregon that could [ __ ] it up

3781
02:25:00,549 --> 02:25:07,179
for most of Oregon half of the state has

3782
02:25:03,700 --> 02:25:09,310
banned shops period the other half of

3783
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:11,020
the state allows a shitload and if you

3784
02:25:09,309 --> 02:25:12,250
look at a map it's like right down the

3785
02:25:11,020 --> 02:25:13,689
[ __ ] mountain range in the middle of

3786
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:16,540
the state

3787
02:25:13,689 --> 02:25:18,279
the coast side approves in their shops

3788
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:19,000
everywhere the other side of the

3789
02:25:18,279 --> 02:25:23,829
mountain range

3790
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:26,079
not a single shop of course and stuff

3791
02:25:23,829 --> 02:25:27,909
like opening at midnight when there are

3792
02:25:26,079 --> 02:25:29,559
hours that you're allowed to open and

3793
02:25:27,909 --> 02:25:32,318
not allowed to be open and they don't

3794
02:25:29,559 --> 02:25:35,170
involve 12:01 in the morning

3795
02:25:32,318 --> 02:25:36,818
there's the Maine reporter covering

3796
02:25:35,170 --> 02:25:39,219
marijuana up there that I follow on

3797
02:25:36,818 --> 02:25:41,109
Twitter one of her colleagues was handed

3798
02:25:39,219 --> 02:25:43,148
marijuana gummies

3799
02:25:41,109 --> 02:25:45,010
outside of the shop waiting in line

3800
02:25:43,148 --> 02:25:47,889
doing news reports he was just handed

3801
02:25:45,010 --> 02:25:49,090
free pot candy pot edibles specifically

3802
02:25:47,889 --> 02:25:53,439
candy or [ __ ] band

3803
02:25:49,090 --> 02:25:55,960
so we're giveaways and it's not like

3804
02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:58,200
this stuff is its resources on day one

3805
02:25:55,959 --> 02:26:01,449
it's I mean it's a celebration

3806
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:03,069
shenanigans happened there was a truck

3807
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:05,079
driving up and down the street not at

3808
02:26:03,068 --> 02:26:08,278
all affiliated with the dispensary we

3809
02:26:05,079 --> 02:26:08,279
were waiting in line at on

3810
02:26:08,819 --> 02:26:15,479
the guy buying threw out bags of edibles

3811
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:18,761
he drove buying gave out plants yeah I'm

3812
02:26:15,479 --> 02:26:20,949
90% sure it was somebody advertising for

3813
02:26:18,761 --> 02:26:22,750
another shop that was not at all getting

3814
02:26:20,950 --> 02:26:24,641
business right but it might have just

3815
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:27,310
been one of us who had blown a stack

3816
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:29,020
with joy it could have gone either way I

3817
02:26:27,310 --> 02:26:30,399
didn't get up close and investigate cuz

3818
02:26:29,021 --> 02:26:33,341
I didn't want to lose my awesome spot in

3819
02:26:30,399 --> 02:26:38,020
line right cuz by then I was halfway

3820
02:26:33,341 --> 02:26:40,690
through a two-hour line but there's you

3821
02:26:38,021 --> 02:26:43,150
Nana gets to be expected but it's day

3822

legal a decade ago [ __ ] but I mean

3841
02:27:27,370 --> 02:27:32,021

3842
02:27:28,899 --> 02:27:33,431
with dr. reefer the boulder city council

3843
02:27:32,021 --> 02:27:36,250
right now is talking about dialing

3844
02:27:33,431 --> 02:27:38,351
regulations back down to reality because

3845
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:40,479

3846
02:27:38,351 --> 02:27:42,670

3847
02:27:40,479 --> 02:27:44,229

02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:48,161
states that have legalized the sale of

3879

Oregon with far more dispensaries than

3881

3882

3883

3897
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:30,700
after midnight shop manager Ken Martin

3898

3899
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:35,109

3900
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:39,359
refill jars with pot to meet the demand

3901
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:39,360
two customers came in used to that

3902
02:29:40,809 --> 02:29:45,310
[Music]

3903
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:47,620
number which Jarrett went in to keep

3904
02:29:45,310 --> 02:29:49,390

3905
02:29:47,620 --> 02:29:52,420
customers who came in had just turned 21

3906
02:29:49,390 --> 02:29:54,431
he said debut Fleming I don't know if I

3907
02:29:52,421 --> 02:29:56,380
read your name right Divya Divya Divya

3908
02:29:54,431 --> 02:29:57,971
Fleming of Portland the first buyer in

3909
02:29:56,380 --> 02:29:59,380
the keys store said the atmosphere was

3910
02:29:57,970 --> 02:30:01,450
upbeat for the launch of the new

3911
02:29:59,380 --> 02:30:03,729
industry it's the end of prohibition

3912
02:30:01,450 --> 02:30:06,729
said Fleming who uses the drug for many

3913
02:30:03,729 --> 02:30:07,990
medicinal purposes because if I ever

3914
02:30:06,729 --> 02:30:09,700
mentioned that I was the first person to

3915
02:30:07,990 --> 02:30:12,460
buy recreational cannabis at the greener

3916
02:30:09,700 --> 02:30:14,979
side dispensary in Pueblo Colorado I was

3917
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:16,751
first [ __ ] anyway I'm pretty sure I

3918
02:30:14,979 --> 02:30:19,661
talked about that it was like way a long

3919
02:30:16,751 --> 02:30:22,479
time ago the store offered its first 25

3920
02:30:19,661 --> 02:30:24,550
customers 35 to 40% discounts and was

3921
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:27,040
handing out soda coffee juice and other

3922
02:30:24,550 --> 02:30:28,359
refreshments McKee said many stores in

3923
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:30,880
Oregon were trying to lure customers

3924
02:30:28,360 --> 02:30:32,229
with extended hours food giveaways and

3925
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:35,228
discounted Maryland

3926
02:30:32,228 --> 02:30:36,998
Oana shoppers who have shoppe errs have

3927
02:30:35,228 --> 02:30:39,278
one more incentive to buy early and

3928
02:30:36,998 --> 02:30:41,648
often under Oregon law Papa purchases

3929
02:30:39,279 --> 02:30:44,800
will be tax-free until January the

3930
02:30:41,648 --> 02:30:46,299
savings of up to 20% that's a good way

3931
02:30:44,799 --> 02:30:48,038
to do it get people to come in and see

3932
02:30:46,299 --> 02:30:49,059
how it goes and then start charging tax

3933
02:30:48,039 --> 02:30:50,470
that's pretty nice

3934
02:30:49,059 --> 02:30:52,510
the one thing I really like about

3935
02:30:50,469 --> 02:30:54,010
Oregon's law is they're really looking

3936
02:30:52,510 --> 02:30:54,880
to kick the black market in the balls

3937
02:30:54,010 --> 02:30:57,039
nice

3938
02:30:54,879 --> 02:31:00,488
so no taxes for the first little bit so

3939
02:30:57,039 --> 02:31:02,170
you know it's the old street theory that

3940
02:31:00,488 --> 02:31:04,898
they threw at us in middle school in

3941
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:06,158
there yep you get a taste the cheap you

3942
02:31:04,898 --> 02:31:08,170
want a free joint

3943
02:31:06,158 --> 02:31:10,118

3944
02:31:08,170 --> 02:31:12,129

3946
02:31:12,129 --> 02:31:17,920

3947
02:31:13,930 --> 02:31:20,020
the taxes manana no more watching how

3948
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:21,818
it's made for two hours doesn't look

3949
02:31:20,020 --> 02:31:23,649
like foot traffic none of that just walk

3950

3951

weed product and balance right all right

3952
02:31:26,318 --> 02:31:29,590
the article goes on to say store owners

3953
02:31:27,879 --> 02:31:31,209
say they're hopeful they can avoid the

3954
02:31:29,590 --> 02:31:32,889
shortages and price spikes that followed

3955
02:31:31,209 --> 02:31:35,049
the start of legal sales last year in

3956
02:31:32,889 --> 02:31:37,328
Washington and Colorado Alaska could

3957
02:31:35,049 --> 02:31:39,728
begin retail sales next year I think I

3958
02:31:37,328 --> 02:31:41,559
already read that huh once we're offered

3959
02:31:39,728 --> 02:31:42,188
a goodie bag with t-shirts but no free

3960
02:31:41,559 --> 02:31:44,439
marijuana

3961
02:31:42,189 --> 02:31:47,318
sounds like the spot another we'll have

3962
02:31:44,439 --> 02:31:48,818
a live band and 10% discounts several

3963
02:31:47,318 --> 02:31:50,498
stores have erected billboards in

3964
02:31:48,818 --> 02:31:52,658
Portland a shop in Maryland is

3965
02:31:50,498 --> 02:31:54,309
advertising on the radio I'm just trying

3966
02:31:52,658 --> 02:31:55,840
to basically stock up for maybe four or

3967
02:31:54,309 --> 02:31:57,818
five times with the normal volume would

3968
02:31:55,840 --> 02:32:00,279
be said Chris Byers owner of River City

3969
02:31:57,818 --> 02:32:02,260
dispensary in Merlin customers can buy

3970
02:32:00,279 --> 02:32:04,359
as much as 7 grams at a time of dried

3971
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:06,760
marijuana flower and leaf the part

3972
02:32:04,359 --> 02:32:10,988
that's generally smoked plus plants and

3973
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:12,789
seeds dried flower and leaf hopefully

3974
02:32:10,988 --> 02:32:15,059
there's not a lot of leaf in there yeah

3975
02:32:12,789 --> 02:32:16,930
basically buds is what they mean yeah

3976
02:32:15,059 --> 02:32:19,180
some of the people that write wheat

3977
02:32:16,930 --> 02:32:21,970
articles need to hang out with some weed

3978
02:32:19,180 --> 02:32:24,369
heads for the next year or so

3979
02:32:21,969 --> 02:32:26,049
pop infused candy cookies oils and

3980
02:32:24,369 --> 02:32:27,850
lotions will be available only to people

3981
02:32:26,049 --> 02:32:29,828
with medical marijuana cards as the

3982
02:32:27,850 --> 02:32:32,050
state works on retail regulations for

3983
02:32:29,828 --> 02:32:34,090
those products oregon has a robust

3984
02:32:32,049 --> 02:32:36,099
supply supply system that has supported

3985
02:32:34,090 --> 02:32:38,228
medical marijuana users and the black

3986
02:32:36,100 --> 02:32:39,850
market companies have invested in

3987
02:32:38,228 --> 02:32:42,158
massive warehouses in portland to grow

3988
02:32:39,850 --> 02:32:44,590
the drug indoors and southern oregon has

3989
02:32:42,158 --> 02:32:45,118
some of the nation's best conditions for

3990
02:32:44,590 --> 02:32:47,939
out

3991
02:32:45,119 --> 02:32:49,770
or cultivation Brewers don't face strict

3992
02:32:47,939 --> 02:32:51,600
regulations yet so the supply can more

3993
02:32:49,770 --> 02:32:53,819
easily flow into retail stores than it

3994
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:55,979
did in Washington and Colorado still

3995
02:32:53,818 --> 02:32:57,748
there is concern summer has historically

3996
02:32:55,978 --> 02:32:59,578
been a time of marijuana shortages in

3997
02:32:57,748 --> 02:33:01,888
Oregon and most of the outdoor crop that

3998
02:32:59,578 --> 02:33:03,658
is ready to heart and most of the other

3999
02:33:01,888 --> 02:33:04,408
crop is not ready to harvest sorry I

4000
02:33:03,658 --> 02:33:06,568
skipped word there

4001
02:33:04,408 --> 02:33:07,888
indoor growers have had minimal time to

4002
02:33:06,568 --> 02:33:09,838
wrap up production because lawmakers

4003
02:33:07,888 --> 02:33:11,998
only approved the October first start

4004
02:33:09,838 --> 02:33:18,449
date three months ago and they had time

4005
02:33:11,998 --> 02:33:19,109
to get one quick crop in said Jeremy

4006
02:33:18,449 --> 02:33:21,418
Pratt

4007
02:33:19,109 --> 02:33:23,429
he said we kind of have a seasonal

4008
02:33:21,418 --> 02:33:25,138
drawing market here in Oregon said the

4009
02:33:23,429 --> 02:33:26,638
owner of nectar cannabis which has four

4010
02:33:25,138 --> 02:33:28,708
stores in Portland we have lots of

4011
02:33:26,638 --> 02:33:30,269
products in the fall and then it kind of

4012
02:33:28,709 --> 02:33:32,520
gets tight this time of year anyway

4013
02:33:30,270 --> 02:33:34,859
green oasis which has two locations in

4014
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:37,020
Portland and more on the way has

4015
02:33:34,859 --> 02:33:39,059
prepared by trying to cultivate strong

4016
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:40,770
relationships with growers it will

4017
02:33:39,059 --> 02:33:43,078

4020
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:49,199
$40 Kohinoor Matthew Schwimmer said we

4021
02:33:47,609 --> 02:33:51,359
don't know if anyone else doing a band

4022
02:33:49,199 --> 02:33:53,279
and we thought it was a good idea to

4023
02:33:51,359 --> 02:33:55,770
give back to the community Schwimmer

4024

21 if you're 20

4042
02:34:44,090 --> 02:34:49,659
it'll just change the world when I think

4043
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:52,520
of what I used to deal with to buy weed

4044
02:34:49,659 --> 02:34:55,639
like did what was just standard when I

4045
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:58,399
was in high school and in college and

4046
02:34:55,639 --> 02:35:00,949
then in my 20s it was just a nightmare

4047
02:34:58,398 --> 02:35:02,930
especially in retrospect like it was

4048
02:35:00,950 --> 02:35:04,850
just life when it was happening it

4049
02:35:02,930 --> 02:35:09,200
wasn't that bad like I didn't mind

4050
02:35:04,850 --> 02:35:11,359
watching how it's made that much but now

4051
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:13,130
that it's totally legal and I work in a

4052
02:35:11,359 --> 02:35:15,950
pot shop and it's just like picking up a

4053
02:35:13,129 --> 02:35:19,728
cheeseburger on the way home it's so

4054
02:35:15,950 --> 02:35:22,370
much better yeah if I was afraid of it

4055
02:35:19,728 --> 02:35:24,438
at first big it's so much better I can't

4056
02:35:22,370 --> 02:35:26,720
adequately put it into words well I came

4057
02:35:24,439 --> 02:35:30,530
from the black market and I was afraid

4058
02:35:26,719 --> 02:35:32,959
of all of this and it's I don't know

4059
02:35:30,530 --> 02:35:36,439
freaky to a lot of people it's a huge

4060
02:35:32,959 --> 02:35:38,989
change if you live in a non legal state

4061
02:35:36,439 --> 02:35:40,398
you worry about what do you I don't know

4062
02:35:38,989 --> 02:35:42,469
how much weed you buy but when half of

4063
02:35:40,398 --> 02:35:43,909
it is gone you start thinking about [ __ ]

4064
02:35:42,469 --> 02:35:46,519
where am I gonna get more wheat cuz

4065
02:35:43,909 --> 02:35:48,260
there's no reliable spot I never have to

4066
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:51,739
think or am I gonna get my next bag of

4067
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:54,559
weed because if I don't if I don't grow

4068
02:35:51,739 --> 02:35:57,079
it I can go to the shop in which I work

4069
02:35:54,559 --> 02:35:58,909
or I can drive to one of my other buddy

4070
02:35:57,079 --> 02:36:01,010
shops or I can drive to one of my other

4071
02:35:58,909 --> 02:36:02,659
friend shops or I'm also a medical

4072
02:36:01,010 --> 02:36:05,059
marijuana patient so I could drive to a

4073
02:36:02,659 --> 02:36:06,559
medical dispensary excuse me I'm trying

4074
02:36:05,059 --> 02:36:08,689
to burp I could drive to a medical

4075
02:36:06,559 --> 02:36:10,760
marijuana to shop and get whatever

4076
02:36:08,689 --> 02:36:12,079
cannabis I need in there so it is a

4077
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:14,478
little bit better that way I made her

4078
02:36:12,079 --> 02:36:17,389
more available way more available it

4079
02:36:14,478 --> 02:36:18,829
made weed more advanced the innovations

4080
02:36:17,389 --> 02:36:23,209
that have come with this legalization

4081
02:36:18,829 --> 02:36:24,139
have been incredible so I like it I

4082
02:36:23,209 --> 02:36:27,079
think it's way better

4083
02:36:24,139 --> 02:36:30,010
I fear this much better legalization

4084
02:36:27,079 --> 02:36:32,840
it's beautiful we can do so many things

4085
02:36:30,010 --> 02:36:35,960
like it's not so like I never had

4086
02:36:32,840 --> 02:36:36,889
trouble finding pot before in my life it

4087
02:36:35,959 --> 02:36:40,429
never came up

4088
02:36:36,889 --> 02:36:43,430
I might have trouble locating good pot

4089
02:36:40,430 --> 02:36:45,079
or the same pot and it was always

4090
02:36:43,430 --> 02:36:47,600
horseshit whatever you bought like it

4091
02:36:45,079 --> 02:36:49,670
was never what they said it was just

4092
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:51,229
you'd ask do you have any of this and

4093
02:36:49,670 --> 02:36:52,520
they go oh yeah and they'd go get a

4094
02:36:51,228 --> 02:36:54,659
handful of something different if you

4095
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:57,180
like this is the name you said you know

4096
02:36:54,659 --> 02:36:59,700
um and you just believed it that was the

4097
02:36:57,180 --> 02:37:02,540
best you had hopefully you weren't

4098
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:07,380
getting cheated and that was just life

4099
02:37:02,540 --> 02:37:08,970
now with there's ten stores within a 15

4100
02:37:07,379 --> 02:37:11,039
minute drive from both our homes

4101
02:37:08,969 --> 02:37:13,500
yeah and that's pretty much true across

4102
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:14,910
Colorado with this yeah and you can go

4103
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:17,159
to two or three of them and see what you

4104
02:37:14,909 --> 02:37:18,840
do and don't like if every shops got

4105
02:37:17,159 --> 02:37:21,479
different pricing every shops got a

4106
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:23,549
different selection there are major

4107
02:37:21,479 --> 02:37:26,189
companies across Colorado where you can

4108
02:37:23,549 --> 02:37:28,049
kind of find their stuff everywhere um

4109
02:37:26,190 --> 02:37:29,460
sort of like Coke and Pepsi like you

4110
02:37:28,049 --> 02:37:30,869
don't have to go cheap with you store

4111
02:37:29,459 --> 02:37:33,029
yet she would choose Cuba choose

4112
02:37:30,870 --> 02:37:35,220
Incredibles there in almost every shop

4113
02:37:33,030 --> 02:37:37,860
at appear like there's a handful of

4114
02:37:35,219 --> 02:37:40,049
major edible companies that are

4115
02:37:37,860 --> 02:37:42,360
everywhere now I feel bad for the

4116
02:37:40,049 --> 02:37:43,049
delivery people that's a lot of

4117
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:46,021
paperwork

4118
02:37:43,049 --> 02:37:50,009
um Dixie like there's a bunch of them

4119
02:37:46,021 --> 02:37:52,500
and it's just beautiful you walk in and

4120
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:54,329
there's 3040 I mean sometimes only five

4121
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:56,489
or six but there's a selection of buds

4122
02:37:54,329 --> 02:37:58,860
you get a look at them smell them you

4123
02:37:56,489 --> 02:38:00,180
get to know the price like it's not

4124
02:37:58,860 --> 02:38:01,710
weird that you drove for someone's house

4125
02:38:00,180 --> 02:38:03,030
and spent 20 minutes in the living room

4126
02:38:01,709 --> 02:38:04,949
and you don't want to buy this you can

4127
02:38:03,030 --> 02:38:06,420
just thanks and leave yeah if you know

4128
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:07,800
why if you go to the dispensary you know

4129
02:38:06,420 --> 02:38:09,569
like what's in there you can leave you

4130
02:38:07,799 --> 02:38:11,159
don't have to buy anything there yeah

4131
02:38:09,569 --> 02:38:12,750
people ask me what the minimum purchase

4132
02:38:11,159 --> 02:38:16,079
is and it's like nothing if you don't

4133
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:17,430
want any of this please you don't have

4134
02:38:16,079 --> 02:38:18,989
to buy like I'll show you around

4135

4136
02:38:18,989 --> 02:38:24,299
what's going on but and then go look at

4137
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:25,319
a few other places nothing like half the

4138
02:38:24,299 --> 02:38:27,029
time when you do that I give you a

4139

4142
02:38:30,569 --> 02:38:33,479
obligated to buy something if you're in

4143
02:38:32,129 --> 02:38:35,879
a dispensary and you don't like what you

02:39:02,610 --> 02:39:07,319
any flowers with me and somebody wanted

4159
02:39:04,319 --> 02:39:08,579
to smoke some weed and so we're driving

4160
02:39:07,319 --> 02:39:10,379
and I was like a look at dispensary and

4161
02:39:08,579 --> 02:39:21,120
we pull up dude I would not smoke

4162
02:39:10,379 --> 02:39:22,949
anything in that [ __ ] place there's

4163
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:25,320
no difference on any of these strains

4164
02:39:22,950 --> 02:39:26,250
like it was yeah I just left I didn't

4165
02:39:25,319 --> 02:39:29,489
eat anything out of there

4166
02:39:26,250 --> 02:39:31,979
I've left mineus mini shop illest

4167
02:39:29,489 --> 02:39:35,550
some of them aren't up to par some of

4168
02:39:31,979 --> 02:39:38,489
them only still exist because enough of

4169
02:39:35,550 --> 02:39:41,430
the population legitimately had to stop

4170
02:39:38,489 --> 02:39:43,979
smoking weed 30 years ago because it was

4171
02:39:41,431 --> 02:39:45,659
too risky for him and only now that

4172
02:39:43,979 --> 02:39:48,209
they're retiring and that their kids are

4173
02:39:45,659 --> 02:39:50,101
grown are they getting out and trying to

4174
02:39:48,209 --> 02:39:52,050
buy weed again I mean for 30 years they

4175
02:39:50,101 --> 02:39:53,400
didn't know who to call yeah and we're

4176
02:39:52,050 --> 02:39:56,010
too worried about asking their friends

4177
02:39:53,399 --> 02:39:58,289
and neighbors about losing their jobs or

4178
02:39:56,011 --> 02:40:00,390
custody their kids or whatever you know

4179
02:39:58,290 --> 02:40:02,490
they just didn't but now they can just

4180
02:40:00,390 --> 02:40:05,819
pull up to a ship walkie and ask for an

4181
02:40:02,489 --> 02:40:07,979
eighth I talk to everyday have super

4182
02:40:05,819 --> 02:40:09,959
silver hair and huge smiles it's fun

4183
02:40:07,979 --> 02:40:11,550
I've been working outside of the shop

4184
02:40:09,959 --> 02:40:13,199
lately at my job that I've been doing it

4185
02:40:11,550 --> 02:40:14,399
just required some cleaning of some [ __ ]

4186
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:16,710
that's taken about a week and I've been

4187
02:40:14,399 --> 02:40:17,970
out in the back with the door open and I

4188
02:40:16,709 --> 02:40:19,229
see a lot of people walk by because

4189
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:21,420
there's a parking area over there and

4190
02:40:19,229 --> 02:40:24,119
they walk by me most of the people that

4191
02:40:21,420 --> 02:40:26,610
I see are older folks it's not a lot of

4192
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:28,051
young punks buying weed it's older folks

4193
02:40:26,610 --> 02:40:30,780
that used to smoke back in the day like

4194
02:40:28,050 --> 02:40:33,209
you're saying they'd have kids that are

4195
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:36,780
in college now like you see him come in

4196
02:40:33,209 --> 02:40:38,640
you see a 20-something college kid come

4197
02:40:36,780 --> 02:40:40,110
in with his mom or his dad and they go

4198
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:42,029
buy weed together and I think it's

4199
02:40:40,110 --> 02:40:44,579
really funny to see that [ __ ] most of

4200
02:40:42,030 --> 02:40:47,280
the 21 22 year old people I see you're

4201
02:40:44,579 --> 02:40:50,459
on family vacation that's awesome yeah

4202
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:52,801
it's a lot of fun we get a lot of

4203
02:40:50,459 --> 02:40:56,789
younger people too but definitely the

4204
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:58,199
tourist economy is is retirees if you

4205
02:40:56,790 --> 02:41:00,150
think about it make sense if you're 22

4206
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:00,900
there's no reason to fly to Colorado to

4207
02:41:00,149 --> 02:41:03,720
buy weed

4208
02:41:00,899 --> 02:41:04,949
except for the enjoyment of buying legal

4209
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:06,649
cannabis and getting to see what the

4210
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:09,030
selection and the hypes all about

4211
02:41:06,649 --> 02:41:11,699
because you know 30 people this we're

4212
02:41:09,030 --> 02:41:13,771
happy to sell you a bag of weed or at

4213
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:15,960
least one or two yeah there's no reason

4214
02:41:13,771 --> 02:41:17,159
to come here and spend the money on the

4215
02:41:15,959 --> 02:41:20,339
flight for what you can do at home

4216
02:41:17,159 --> 02:41:21,319
already but if you're 65 there's still a

4217
02:41:20,340 --> 02:41:24,290
lot of risk you know

4218
02:41:21,319 --> 02:41:26,300
oh [ __ ] yeah there's none here and it

4219
02:41:24,290 --> 02:41:28,790
just blows people away I heard that at

4220
02:41:26,300 --> 02:41:31,220
least twice three times a week know

4221
02:41:28,790 --> 02:41:32,570
where I'm from this is this is really

4222
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:34,069
frowned upon we would get in so much

4223
02:41:32,569 --> 02:41:35,899
trouble for this everyone would think

4224
02:41:34,069 --> 02:41:38,390
bad about us if they knew that we were

4225
02:41:35,899 --> 02:41:40,011
here doing this like please don't tell

4226

4235
02:42:05,149 --> 02:42:08,479
somebody who is over 21 if you've got

4236
02:42:07,011 --> 02:42:09,500
cannabis and you bought it in Colorado

4237
02:42:08,479 --> 02:42:10,850
and you're about to get on the flight

4238
02:42:09,500 --> 02:42:13,040

actually if they have dreadlocks that

4247
02:42:27,290 --> 02:42:36,490
last statement doesn't apply just

4248
