elite seeds and you can find them at

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:22,079
www.seannal.com it has become a

9
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,300
tradition that we start the podcast off

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,070
by talking about what I am dabbing today

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,199
I've been taking dad's of screaming

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,469
tangerines ambrosia from our friends at

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,500
apothecary farms this is labeled as

14
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:36,808
70.4% THC and 82.1%

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,369
total cannabinoids this is a little

16
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,949
saucy I would prefer a little more

17
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:42,390
crystals in here but the turkey flavor

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,789
that ridiculous

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,579
screamin tangerine flavor makes it worth

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,079
that saucy consistency so I'm loving the

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,910
flavor of this and it's got a great head

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,558
buzz to it and I'm gonna go back for

23
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:56,279
more so big shout out to our friends at

37
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,629
got a lot of great messages but my

38
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,789
favorite messages were about my dread

39
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,548
dude are those dreadlocks real how old

40
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,930
are those dreads killer dreads lots of

41
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,700
compliments on the dreads yes the

42
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,460
dreadlocks are real these dreadlocks are

43
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,020
14 years old if I would untie them from

44
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,029
the bun in which they were in when I was

45
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,548
on the show they go down to my knees

46
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,340
that's a little bit ridiculous because I

47
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,070
am 6 foot 5 so yes the dreadlocks are

48
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,740
real they are 14 years old and they go

49
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:54,298
down to my knees so if you've never seen

50
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,798

so by going to

68
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:07,170
www.onproperty.com.au/plus what's up

69
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,349
Rasta Jeff great podcast on the moon

70
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:13,289
questions read proteins what makes total

71
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:15,840
sense then he goes on to say my arise

72
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:17,219
platoon got a little stretch but they

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,860
are starting to put some meat on their

74
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,439
bones the last day or two then he goes

75
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,220
on to say also Gollum has devoured her

76
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,469
twin

77
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,449
okay now that is a funny conversation we

78
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,939
were talking about he grew some seeds he

79
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:32,489
grew some arise seedlings and one of

80
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:35,129
them grew two seedlings two sprouts out

81
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,540
of the one seedling we were talking a

82
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:38,490
little bit about that and I told him

83
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:41,129
that he should name it after the nurse

84
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,290
with the conjoined twin in South Park so

85
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,689
that plant got named nurse Gollum and

86
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,669
apparently eventually nurse Gollum

87
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,039
devoured her twin it is now just one

88
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,530
plant which is kind of how nurse Gollum

89
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,840
turned out so the message continues he

90
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,479
says question when I transplant into one

91
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,819
gallon fabric pots can I plant them a

92
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,759
little deep to help him out what is the

93
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,379
rule of thumb on this so here's what it

94
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,269
sounds like is happening this guy

95
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,949
sprouted some arise seeds and they are

96
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,659
getting a little tall they're probably

97
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,729
getting stretchy because of a lack of

98
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,319
light the white is probably not intense

99
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:15,269
enough or it is probably too far away

100
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,649
your little plants your little seedlings

101
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,329
are trying to stretch toward that light

102
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,039
that light is their main source of life

103
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,639
so they want to get as close to that as

104
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,319
possible

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,550
they're expecting sunshine and they're

106
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,709
not getting it so they're trying to

107
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,160
climb up trying to get to that light so

108
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,659
they've gotten a little bit stretchy

109
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,240
a bit leggy they're kind of tall on you

110
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,689
now it is time to transplant these arise

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,189
seedlings into a one-gallon fabric pot

112
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:38,050
I'm assuming at this point you've got

113
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:39,639
them in something smaller something like

114
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,930
a beer cup or maybe something even a

115
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,000
little smaller maybe you've got them in

116
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,069
a jiffy pot still I'm not exactly sure

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,769
what you're doing but it is time to put

118
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:49,689
these babies into a 1 gallon fabric pot

119
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:52,240
and you're asking if you can plant them

120
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:54,040
a little bit deep to help them out which

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,870
I'm thinking you mean you've got a 1

122
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,670
gallon pot you're gonna fill it up and

123
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,530
then where it should be full you're

124
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,600
gonna knock out maybe one or two inches

125
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:03,819
worth of soil and then plant your plant

126
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,590
there and then overfill it with that one

127
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:07,449
or two inches of soil so that you're

128
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:09,039
going to bury part of the plant as to

129
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:11,319
make it appear shorter so it's not

130
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,330
popping out of the soil as much but in

131
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,980
reality you still have that three inch

132
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:16,209
long ceiling or however long it has

133
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,680
grown so it looks like you've got an

134
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:20,049
inch popping out of the soil because

135
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,730
you've buried two inches if you feel

136
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,379
like those plants have gotten too tall

137
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,879
for you and you really need to minimize

138
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:27,009
their height to kind of keep them from

139
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,019
toppling over this is something you can

140
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:30,430
do you can do this with a little tiny

141
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:32,019
seedlings you can do this when you're

142
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,610
planning from your beer cup into a three

143
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:35,500
gallon you can do this when you're going

144
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,870
from a three gallon into a seven gallon

145
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,699
or a three gallon into a 50 gallon but

146
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,800
the thing you need to be very careful of

147
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,839
is keep in mind that you were burying a

148
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,360
portion of the stem however much of that

149
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,250
stem is going into the dirt that wasn't

150
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,139
buried before that part is not

151
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,540
comfortable and not familiar with being

152
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:54,819
buried with dirt and being submerged and

153
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,280
possibly being soaked with water for

154
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:59,230
long periods of time so the first few

155
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,239
times you water you need to be careful

156
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,770
to not soak that part of the plant

157
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,660
you've got a fresh part of the plant

158
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:06,490
that has been exposed for the entire

159
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,840
time of its life up until this time that

160
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,970
you're burying it and now you're gonna

161
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,250
get it really really wet you're going to

162
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,200
run the risk of some kind of soggy root

163
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,180
rot or something similar happening to

164
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,189
that stock I guess would be stock rot at

165
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,530
that point it's just gonna get funky in

166
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:22,329
there if you overwater your goal is to

167
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:24,219
get the water down deep into the medium

168
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:26,500
into those roots and you don't want to

169
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,270
drown that fresh stock part you need to

170
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,399
give that some time to adjust to

171
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:32,500
acclimate to its new surroundings so if

172
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,418
you're going to do that be very careful

173
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,009
with a smaller plant you're just gonna

174
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:38,859
have to water maybe a little bit less

175
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,930
less water at a time and more frequently

176
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,550
with a larger plant what you

177
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,560
and you in which you should be doing

178
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,990
anyway with larger plants as water the

179
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,970
outer perimeter of the pot as to not

180
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,740
soak the inside of the pot so much where

181
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,660
that main stock is it's going to be hard

182
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,129
to control where the water goes but if

183
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,130
you've got a really large pot you just

184
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,389
water that outer part where the so if

185
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:00,370
you got a three gallon pot and you just

186
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,900
put it into maybe a ten gallon you just

187
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,478
want that edge of the three gallon that

188
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:06,579
outer exposed roots to be hit by that

189
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,839
water not the inside of the stick so try

190
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:09,430
to aim the water I know that sounds

191
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,049
ridiculous but you see what I mean

192
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,490
you're trying to get right at that edge

193
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,110
there's a ring you're trying to hit the

194
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,610
out of the three and the start of that

195
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,560
ten that fresh dirt you're just trying

196
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,538
to wet that part for the first couple of

197
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,819
waters to give that stick some time

198
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:24,370
don't go too deep now don't get

199
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:26,500
ridiculous and go bearing it really deep

200
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,269
use some judgment think about the health

201
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,069
of your plant think about the size of

202
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:31,839
your stock think about the root mass

203
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,459
you've got just pay attention to what

204
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,019
you're doing and think about the plants

205
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:37,329
give the plant some breathing room and

206
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:40,149
do not drown it and do not smother it by

207
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:42,728
trying to do this but yes it will work

208
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:45,038
if you do it properly now something I'm

209
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,449
going to recommend is get a fan on those

210
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,430
seedlings if they're getting too leggy

211
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,439
if they're tipping over they need more

212
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,569
light and they need a fan so brighten up

213
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,189
the white get a fan on them give them a

214
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:55,629
chance if you kind of give them a little

215
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:57,788
struggle give them some adversity

216
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:58,990
they'll come out stronger in the end so

217
00:07:57,788 --> 00:08:00,879
give them a little bit of a struggle

218
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,228
with that fan make them kind of reach a

219
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,490
little bit so that they stand up a

220
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:05,228
little bit now something I've never

221
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,550
really said here on the podcast I don't

222
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:08,050
think and I'm gonna touch on this just

223
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,569
because I was talking about watering the

224
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,400
outer perimeter think about the way your

225
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,860
cannabis plants are shaped if we don't

226
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,658
interact with them they grow up and then

227
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,300
they grow leaves they kind of point down

228
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:21,009
kind of in a cone shaped fashion the

229
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,598
plant gets wider as it gets older it

230
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,610
gets taller and wider and taller and

231
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,219
wider but one thing it continues to do

232
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,169
is create the same type of effect as a

233
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,150
shingled roof if you look at the way the

234
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:33,250
water flows go spray the top of your

235
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:35,528
plants the water will run from the top

236
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,328
leaves down to the next set of leaves

237
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:39,038
and as they do it they come outward and

238
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:41,109
they come out word they come further and

239
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,759
further from the center of the plant the

240
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,100
more they drip down the plant that water

241
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,778
will keep continuing downward and

242
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,490
outward further away from the center of

243
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:50,528
that plant and if you look at a plant

244
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,570
after it rains right underneath the

245
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:54,610
plant is not wet but that ring right

246
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,990
around the plant it's really soaked with

247
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,269
water

248
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,159
because all the water has run down and

249
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:00,659
out and down and out and it's just

250
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,370
making a whiter and whiter ring as it

251
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,709
runs down and then right around the

252
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,820
plant it gets nicely watered so think

253
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,410
about that when you're watering your

254
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,420
container plants we want to water the

255
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:13,049
outer part where the most active root

256
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,610
tips are searching for water and food so

257
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,500
I hope there's some usable guidance in

258
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,629
there for your situation the email does

259
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,789
continue he says I've got some papaya

260
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:23,129
females I'm hoping to cross with one of

261
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:26,219
these arise males for my first cross

262
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:29,250
what are you looking for in King Solomon

263
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,050
I am super picky and super meticulous

264
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,179
when it comes to male selection but I

265
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:36,389
have done an entire podcast about

266
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:38,339
breeding and male selection episode 174

267
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,860
will help you out tremendously

268
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,480
but the most important part after you do

269
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,250
the male selection after you do the

270
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
breeding the most important part of the

271
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,690
whole project is to test your progeny

272
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,879
you have got to grow the offspring and

273
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,130
see what you've got that is the only way

274
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,500
to know if that male is delivering

275
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:58,139
traits that are desirable so the most

276
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,269
important part is to test that offspring

277
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,220
you know what the most important part is

278
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:04,829
to have fun with your breeding project

279
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,080
so do a good male selection pollinate

280
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,240
properly let the seeds finish harvest

281
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,310
and dry them properly grow them out but

282
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,899
most importantly make sure you have fun

283
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:14,459
with this breeding project I don't know

284
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,840
why I tried to make it so uptight I

285
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,850
forgot to grow from my heart for a

286
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,680
minute there I'm sorry you guys he wraps

287
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,420
up this email and he says what's up Nemo

288
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,709
punk 15 so we've got another listener

289
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,959
centered a big shout out to white Mike

290
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,220
white Mike is on vacation but as soon as

291
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,650
he gets back I'll give him a high-five

292
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,330
for you big shout out to white Mike also

293
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:32,370
a big shout out to our friend it left

294
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,259
field farms for this great email they do

295
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,210
thank you for the great email I hope I

296
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,069
answered all of your questions and I

297
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,940
look forward to hearing from you again

298
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,580

all right podcast world I do have a

300
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,020
medical marijuana renewal appointment

301
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,789
set for just a few minutes from now so I

302
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,069
am going to press pause I'm going to

303
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:51,360
take several ridiculous dabs because I

304
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,070
know I'm going to be in the waiting room

305
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,320
for several minutes then I'm going to

306
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,420
head to my medical marijuana renewal

307
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,210
appointment then I will be back to

308
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:03,179
resume this episode you guys take a few

309
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:06,190
dabs and I'll be right back

310
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:08,138
all right podcast world I am back and I

311
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,420
am officially a registered Colorado

312
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:12,789
medical marijuana patient for one more

313
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,740
full year my appointment was fairly

314
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:16,480
quick and fairly easy I spent more time

315
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,730
in the waiting room waiting to see the

316
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,259
doc than I did anything else I'm pretty

317
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,480
familiar with that paperwork I've done

318
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:24,129
the paperwork several times I've been to

319
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,959
that doctor's office and seen that

320
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,819
doctor several times so I'm very

321
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,768
familiar with the process and it went

322
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:31,958
fairly quickly and fairly smoothly this

323
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:33,669
time so I am a registered Colorado

324
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,068
medical marijuana patient for one more

325
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:37,990
full year it is done it is complete I

326
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:40,568
don't have to go back for another full

327
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,860
year let's continue on with this episode

328
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:44,229
ladies and gentlemen I was reading

329
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,629
emails I've got another great email here

330
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,089
in front of me and this email goes a lot

331
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:51,430
like this thank you for the grow series

332
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:54,009
and has been super informative you did

333
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:57,219
not mention if the temps in veg through

334
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:59,500
harvest are the same when using co2 most

335
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,019
people say to run temps at 85 degrees in

336
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,688
veg with co2 but I'm not sure if you

337
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:08,230
agree what about temps through flowering

338
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:10,509
with co2 and would you stop using co2 at

339
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:14,438
some point in flower thank you

340
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:16,329
signed Andrew M 14 hey Andrew M 14 thank

341
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:18,519
you for a great email and thank you for

342
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:21,039
pointing out that I missed a detail so

343
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,629
let's talk about this I did a long

344
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,009
series of grow lessons and we talked

345
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,899
about growing all the way from the

346
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,149
beginning to the end I talked about

347
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,629
temperatures and humidity levels and one

348
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:33,188
thing I overlooked was augmented co2

349
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:35,198
when we are increasing co2 to

350
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:37,539
high-performance levels we are able to

351
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:39,789
run the plants at higher temperatures so

352
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:41,740
yes I did overlook that one detail I

353
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:44,110
would agree where you say some people

354
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,209
say to run temps at 85 degrees in veg

355
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,759
with co2 I would say that that is

356
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:51,669
acceptable 80 to 85 degrees would be

357
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,500
great for a room running co2 I would

358
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,099
also run these high temperatures through

359
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,259
flower

360
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,000
however I would slowly reduce the

361
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:59,889
temperature through the flowering phase

362
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,600
we like to reduce the temperature kind

363
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:03,159
of mimic the outside fall conditions

364
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,569
bring out some of those colors they'll

365
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,198
also help bring out some of those sweet

366
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:06,969
flavors

367
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:09,639
it also helps speed up the ripeness on

368
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,980
some longer flowering cultivars so bring

369
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,019
out that cold a little bit later in

370
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,278
flower maybe weeks seven eight nine kind

371
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,879
of reduced the temperature a little bit

372
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,159
every week

373
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,439
and bring it down now the second half of

374
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,949
this question is would you stop using

375
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,050
co2 at some point and flower co2 can

376
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,700
become very expensive depending on the

377
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:28,240
size of your room and the efficiency of

378
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,950
your room

379
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,899
how sealed up your room is how often

380
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,460
you're exhausting the air maybe you're

381
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:37,809
just blowing the co2 right out with your

382
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:40,629
HVAC co2 can become very costly in an

383
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:42,729
ideal world I would not stop using co2

384
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:45,580
ever the plants would go into a room

385
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,550
with co2 from day one and all the way up

386
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,230
to harvest they would be in a high co2

387
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:53,349
augmented environment so no I do not

388
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,060
stop augmenting co2 later and flower I

389
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,670
like running it all the way through even

390
00:13:55,059 --> 00:14:00,339
when I do begin reducing those

391
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:02,649
temperatures I find that once you've

392
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,269
started increasing co2 it is really

393
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:07,539
detrimental to the performance of the

394
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:09,519
plants if you stop giving it that co2 so

395
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:12,490
think about it this way in my opinion

396
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,559
co2 is kind of the last thing you should

397
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,389
add to your growth that is the turbo

398
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,579
charge that's your nitrous you've

399
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,980
already got the nutrient regimen dialed

400
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,780
in you've got the light dialed in you

401
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,850
know how to take good care of the plants

402
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,220
you were a professional then you add the

403
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,960
co2 that's like the last bonus step of

404
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,800
the way that co2 is what is gonna push

405
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,389
you over the limit

406
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:33,789
but learn how to grow before you add

407
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:35,649
that so now you've got the co2 now you

408
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,689
are turbocharging your plants

409
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,490
you've got everything dialed in and

410
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,170
you're pushing that turbo button now

411
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,360
you've been pushing that turbo button

412
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,939
for six weeks now you were feeding those

413
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,680
plants a high high performance diet I

414
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,420
feel like if we've got all of the

415
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,359
nutrients dialed in if we've got the

416
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:53,709
wide styled in the co2 is dialed in we

417
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,960
are certainly in a high performance

418
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,300
environment now think about if you take

419
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,920
that co2 away and you try to feed those

420
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,839
plants the same feed regimen

421
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,429
they're not going to have one of their

422
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,500
things that works amount to make that

423
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:07,750
high-performance diet all click together

424
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,700
you're going to burn them they're not

425
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,250
going to be able to metabolize as much

426
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,050
food if we are not giving them the co2

427
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,870
that they were familiar with getting in

428
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:18,549
the past imagine if I put you on a solid

429
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,230
workout routine and I started feeding

430
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:22,539
you like a savage we give you the best

431
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,370
athletic diet that science could dial in

432
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:25,990
for you then once you got that diet

433
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,610
solid you're good at your workout you've

434
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,960
got a good foundation now we're gonna

435
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,680
give you some steroids now you're

436
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,240
lifting more

437
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,669
never you're running faster than ever

438
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,409
you're the 420 million dollar man at

439
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:37,269
this point but now one day I'm just

440
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:39,100
going to stop giving you all of your

441
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,899
protein but I'm going to keep giving you

442
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,790
the steroids and everything else and I'm

443
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,919
going to expect the same performance

444
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:46,870
from you something is going to go wrong

445
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:49,028
you're not getting all of the parts of

446
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,799
the cogs that make those wheels turn so

447
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:53,169
somewhere something is going to blow out

448
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,059
and when you stop inducing co2 in the

449
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:57,219
plants after they're really used to it

450
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:58,659
they really let you know that they miss

451
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,940
it they're like hey we want that [ __ ]

452
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:01,838
back I am NOT going to run laps as fast

453
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,880
as I used to

454
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,680
I'm gonna start getting slow I'm going

455
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,570
to start getting droopy and all of that

456
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,669
money that you spent on co2 for those

457
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,410
six weeks and flour and however many

458
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,370
weeks and vege now they're kind of not

459
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:14,980
even worth it because you're just

460
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,440
negating that by not inducing or

461
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,720
augmenting or increasing the co2 levels

462
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,020
to a high performance environment later

463
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,839
in Flour so that is my long answer no I

464
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:28,149
would not stop using co2 at some point

465
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,399
in Flour I would use co2 all the way

466
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,528
through flour try to plan ahead plant it

467
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,179
in your budget if you can predict that

468
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:36,370
you are going to be low on funding

469
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:39,338
toward the end of flowering try to

470
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,470
budget your co2 money late and flower

471
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,270
don't use as much co2 for the first

472
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,730
couple of weeks so that you can save

473
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:47,889
that funding for the last few weeks of

474
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,899
flower when that co2 is really going to

475
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:51,819
push those big beefy flowers to that

476
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:54,730
extra limit so think about your budget

477
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:59,379
and try to plan ahead and try to spend

478
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,730
your co2 budget wisely hey andrew m14 i

479
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:02,379
want to thank you for a great email

480

I truly appreciate it and I have learned

491
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:28,029
an absolute ton you are very welcome

492
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,640
thank you for the great email the email

493
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:32,200
continues he says secondly I have a

494
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,390
couple of questions that I hope you can

495
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,660
find the time to help me with so here it

496
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,540
goes

497
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,880
it seems that lemon Jeffrey is sold out

498
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:42,579
online at the several seed banks you

499
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,559
supply do you have any sort of timeline

500
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:46,099
when you

501
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:48,269
to have those genetics available again

502
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:50,248
yes I do that is a great question

503
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:51,870
because I can tell you that from the

504
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:53,460
time of this recording those lemon

505
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:55,768
Jeffrey seeds will be available in

506
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,230
approximately 80 days I'm recording this

507
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:00,359
in the first week of April so you've got

508
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,849
about 80 days and we will have more

509
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,918
lemon Jeffries seeds available and those

510
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:07,740
will be available at Oregon elite seeds

511
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,259
com they will get the first batch so

512
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,690
make sure you check there in about 80

513
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:14,610
days from now it's going to be April May

514
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,460
probably the middle of June

515
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:19,908
possibly the start of July we will have

516
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,038
lemon Jeffrey seeds and several more

517
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:26,220
feminized golden goat crosses available

518
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,579
through Oregon elite seeds calm and

519
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,409
again that is at Oregon elite seeds

520
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:33,269
dot-com make sure you check them out so

521
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:35,970
the email continues the next part says

522
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:38,009
also I purchased a pack of a rise from

523
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,929
hella dank and I am super excited to

524
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:41,339
grow those out well thank you for

525
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:43,320
purchasing those and thanks for having

526
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,798
the enthusiasm about a rise that is one

527
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:48,538
of my favorite crosses super high THC

528
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:50,908
super hyper vigor just a great plant to

529
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:53,190
grow overall he goes on to say I think I

530
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:55,889
would like to cross a strong indica to

531
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,659
your arise for my own personal use and I

532
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:59,189
do encourage breeding have fun with that

533
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:00,480
I have no problem with you using my

534
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,409
stuff once you've bought my seeds

535
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,839
they're yours

536
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:05,460
feel free to breed with it however make

537
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,259
sure you give me credit when you post

538
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,090
pictures or if those seeds go anywhere

539
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,038
just make sure you put a rise in the

540
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:12,959
little listing of what the cross is so

541
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,878
that people know what you used let's

542
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,190
continue with the email where was I I

543
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:19,439
know you were a big sativa guy but I am

544
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,139
wondering if you can suggest a strong

545
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,679
indica strain you think may be a good

546
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:27,808
pairing to match with the arize he wraps

547
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,389
up this email by saying if you do end up

548
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:31,740
reading this aloud feel free to use my

549
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:34,528
name thanks so much

550
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,329
from Kevin hey Kevin thank you for the

551
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:40,048
great email let's talk a little bit

552
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:42,778
about a great pairing for arise arise

553
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:44,638
was bred from a golden goat female so

554
00:19:42,778 --> 00:19:46,319
it's got that tropical sativa flavor

555
00:19:44,638 --> 00:19:48,449
going on it's got a really nice

556
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,908
structure it can take a lot of nutrients

557
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,669
really vigorous plant it is also bred

558
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:57,550
from a Daybreaker male Daybreaker is

559
00:19:53,669 --> 00:20:00,190
chem d and joseph OG it sort of has a

560
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:03,279
fresh tennis ball fresh rubber kind of a

561
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:06,430
smell along with that Oh G cush funky

562
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,710
dank dirty feet kind of a smell so a

563
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,289
rise is a very unique cross it is very

564
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,600
beautifully balanced 50/50 hybrid with

565
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:15,490
very unique parents and grandparents it

566
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,799
is a really great cross in my opinion

567
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,690
that's why it works so perfectly for so

568
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,359
many environments and it produces so

569
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,580
well you want to cross this arise to

570
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:27,250
something more indica dominant so where

571
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:29,019
you can create an indica heavy product

572
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,269
for yourself you like to smoke more of

573
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:33,789
an indica type of a thing I feel if you

574
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:36,069
cross the arize to something more indica

575
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:38,589
dominant you could possibly carry that a

576
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:40,629
rise potency that a rise hyper vigor

577
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:42,279
into something that is more indica heavy

578
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,080
maybe something that grows shorter and

579
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,059
squatty ER you can get that indica

580
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,009
potency up a little bit so let's talk

581
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:50,470
about how you would do this do you

582
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:53,319
intend to use and arise male or do you

583
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,519
intend to use and arise female that is

584
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,439
the first thing you need to think about

585
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,450
the second thing I would think about is

586
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,700
when it comes to the opposite are you

587
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,799
going to use another male or female

588
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,360
where are you going to acquire this do

589
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,089
you have access to good seeds do you

590
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:09,009
have access to a large variety or is

591
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:11,049
your access slightly limited

592
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:13,000
if you've only got access to clones

593
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:15,579
you're either going to be using this

594
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,920
other cross as your pollen receiver as

595
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:20,559
the female or you may be making a

596
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,140
feminized cross there are a lot of

597
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,059
variables to think about here I'm trying

598
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,970
to think of some of my favorite indica

599
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:29,500
heavy cultivars or varieties that are

600
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,870
available that you may be able to get

601
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:35,259
your hands on something I would honestly

602
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:38,769
enjoy seeing worked would be an arise

603
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:40,269
male put to an LA Confidential female

604
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:43,629
from DNA genetics

605
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:45,700
I think the progeny would be amazing so

606
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,250
if you have access to LA Confidential

607
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,529
from DNA genetics I would certainly

608
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,990
recommend that another thing I would

609
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:55,839
recommend would probably be the cataract

610
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:58,650
cush or the kosher cush I would love to

611
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,730
find a good male of the kosher cush

612
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,800
unfortunately they are only selling

613
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,870
those in feminized seeds at this time

614
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,819
yes I have considered getting a female

615
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:08,169
or getting a clone and reversing it but

616
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:10,929
that is not what I want to do at this

617
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,810
time I would love to have a kosher

618
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:16,060
mail from the old school kosher OG seeds

619
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,559
the DNA released years ago that is not

620
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:20,470
an option what I would like to see

621
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:23,079
happen is do you find a good male from

622
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:26,230
that arise pack and put that pollen on

623
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:28,149
the kosher the cataract or the LA

624
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,059
Confidential and yes all three of those

625
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,890
are from DNA genetics or reserve a

626
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:35,139
privado which is their little offshoot

627
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,390
company but I really appreciate their

628
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,700
indicas I think they make a good Oh G

629
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,680
cush indica kind of a line and I really

630
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,920
respect those guys and all of their work

631
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,840
so if you plan to use and arise male and

632
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,070
you can't name him Solomon that's mine

633
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,569
you gotta come up with your own name but

634
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:52,240
you can still using a rise male that is

635
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:54,099
fair if you're going to use that I would

636
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,589
recommend pollinating something on the

637
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:58,750
OG Kush heavy side if you want something

638
00:22:56,589 --> 00:23:01,089
more indica dominant to come out of your

639
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,549
across something short something stout

640
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:05,439
something with big fat leaves something

641
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,930
that doesn't take very long to flower

642
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,480
maybe bubba kush would be a fun cross to

643
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:12,910
go to the arize now let's talk about the

644
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,029
other way maybe you want to use n arise

645
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,769
female as your pollen receiver I would

646
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:20,019
still consider those first three strains

647
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:22,210
I mentioned the cataract the kosher and

648
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:24,759
the LA Confidential but I would also try

649
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,160
to find something with big fat leaves

650
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:29,769
short and squat with really indica

651
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,420
dominant traits again I don't know what

652
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:32,769
is available to you I know you've got my

653
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,080
seeds so it sounds like you've got

654
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:38,079
access to plenty of good seeds I would

655
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:39,970
find a super heavy indica strain that

656
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,500
gets your attention something that has

657
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,269
the traits which you were looking for

658
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,970
because that is what you were going to

659
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:47,440
get from your progeny what you put in is

660
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,990
what you get out so you're going to get

661
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,519
50% of the male 50% of the female you're

662
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,319
gonna mash it up and you're gonna get

663
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,849
all kinds of different expressions of

664
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:57,849
the different traits that are available

665
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:59,919
so I would find a male with big fat

666
00:23:57,849 --> 00:24:02,230
leaves and a short squat stature because

667
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,300
that arise probably gets fairly tall

668
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,799
it's probably got fairly skinny leaves

669
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:08,019
and like you said it is sativa dominant

670
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:10,089
so you need to find something with heavy

671
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:11,829
indica genes so that way you can kind of

672
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:13,750
dominate that cross that way those

673
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:15,369
indica genes are real dominant real

674
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,619
prevalent in your cross in your

675
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:18,879
offspring ooh something that just in my

676
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:22,659
mind is strain that I should recommend

677
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,490
um durango OG I think the Rango OG would

678
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,830
pair beautifully with the

679
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,299
arise I'm kind of hosing myself now I

680
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:30,250
can't make these crosses since I'm

681
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,710
giving everybody else the ideas but I

682
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,480
think durango OG and arise either

683
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,370
direction either one is a male either

684
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,009
one as a female i think they would both

685
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:41,229
work beautifully what would be fun is if

686
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:43,179
you got a pack of seeds of durango OG

687
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,039
you got a pack of seeds of a rise and

688
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,960
you grew both of them out and you found

689
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,549
a stellar male from each pack and a

690
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,829
stellar female from each pack so you've

691
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:52,720
got a boy arise and a girl arise and

692
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:55,689
you've got a male durango OG and a

693
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,519
female durango OG then do two separate

694
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:00,009
breeding projects cross the male arise

695
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:03,009
to the girl durango and the girl arise

696
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:05,349
to the male durango and then observe the

697
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:07,660
differences in both of the progeny of

698
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:10,178
your projects then you can really dial

699
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,700
it in and find what you want for your

700
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:14,710
personal medicine to be quite honest

701
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,779
with you this breeding project any kind

702
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,819
of breeding arise back to some indica

703
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:21,039
sounds like a very exciting project and

704
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:24,159
I'm sure that if you start with a good

705
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,990
solid indica plant that is either going

706
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,420
to be the male or the female I'm sure

707
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,220
you will get something that satisfies

708
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,050
you in the offspring you will make a lot

709
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,029
of seeds you'll have a lot of stuff to

710
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:36,428
play with and something in that batch of

711
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:38,319
seeds will be your keeper I think

712
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:40,150
cracking a pack of seeds is a lot like

713
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,589
buying a pack of baseball cards or I

714
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,420
guess nowadays you'd say Magic the

715
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:44,769
Gathering cards but when you open the

716
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,600
pack you go through you always get a

717
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:48,400
bunch of Commons maybe it kind of but a

718
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,349
couple of uncommons but then toward the

719
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,360
back there's always that one rare car

720
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:54,579
that you were super excited about so I

721
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,349
hope you find your Mickey Mantle early

722
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:58,359
on in your female huh that is the best

723
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:59,859
part you get to do the breeding you get

724
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:01,240
to do the male selection the female

725
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,829
selection you get to be the pollen

726
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,299
chucking you get to watch all the time

727
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:06,339
of those seeds develop you get to

728
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,500
harvest it then the funnest part in my

729
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:10,269
opinion is growing out those seeds to

730
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,369
see what you've got to look for that

731
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,929
Mickey Mantle card so I really hope you

732
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:15,159
enjoy this breeding project I hope I

733
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:17,140
gave you some good advice I know I

734
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,269
recommended a few strains and I know I

735
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,980
went both directions I'm not sure your

736
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:22,900
goal or your intention other than to

737
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,730
make an indica dominant cross from the

738
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,410
arize I hope I have led you in the right

739
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,929
direction a thank you for the great

740
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:31,900
email and I really look forward to

seeing pictures of the offspring once

742
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,350
you make these seeds I want you to grow

743
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,640
them out and then I want to see pictures
