44
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:49,798
business here at the start of the show

45
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,519
the next thing I want to talk about is

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,159
daylight savings time how did you manage

47
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,798
daylight savings time in your grow most

48
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,560
of us here in North America just had to

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,399
move our clock 1 hour forward so that

50
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,200
means your grow room came on 1 hour

51
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,239
later that means it stayed on 1 hour

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,840
later than it did the day before did

53
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,639
that mess up your schedule did that

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,399
freak you out a little bit I want to

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,598
know in the comments section how did you

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,360
adjust to Daylight Savings time there

57
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,199
was a few options of how you could

58
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,120
adjust to this you could simply let it

59
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,799
ride let that plant schedule do its

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,480
thing and then you adjust your life

61
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,800
around it just move things around one

62
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,759
hour that's kind of what I did a lot of

63
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,439
people they will adjust that light in

64
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,120
the flowering room and the light in the

65
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,680
vedro Just Adjust that timer 1 hour to

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,120
make it fit their schedule to make it

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,400
actually work with the real clock that

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,879
the time that it was on I find that a

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,719
bit uh abrupt to a flower room but many

70
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,120
people will do that then the other

71
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,878
option of course is to uh unplug that

72
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,280
light and leave it unplugged for would

73
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:48,598
it be 25 hours or 23 hours that would

74
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,959
have been 25 hours and then plug it in

75
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:52,479
at the next round of normal time those

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,039
are the three main options that I think

77
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,079
of to get you back on schedule for

78
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,919
Daylight Savings Time I Want to Know

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,239
What You Did let me know what you did in

80
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,878
the comments section here if you're

81
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,000
watching on YouTube YouTube Type A

82
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,439
comment let me know how you adjusted uh

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,199
your grow room and your life to Daylight

84
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,439
Savings time if you're here in the North

85
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,439
America region where we just switched

86
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,120
our clocks all right that was the first

87
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,479
thing I wanted to talk about the next

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,360
thing I want to talk about is a question

89
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,000
that I have been receiving quite a bit

90
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,000
lately I'm not sure what made this

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,759
strain real popular why people wanted to

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,680
talk about it but of course I'm talking

93
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,959
about a strain that I bred a while back

94
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,200
called double Paula we're going to talk

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,680
very briefly about double Paula I'm

96
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,000
already getting a smile on my face

97
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,400
because double paa is very elusive we're

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,158
going to talk briefly about double paa

99
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,519
what is double paa double paa is a very

100
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,679
beautiful plant um it was bred I bred

101
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,519
double paa in approximately I want to

102
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,319
say uh Circa 2017 it could have been

103
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,120
2018 um could have been that time frame

104
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:54,039
when I bred that one so I made that one

105
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,599
around 2017 2018 is about when I think I

106
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:59,318
made that one uh double paa is known for

107
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:01,119
making gigantic yields big old fatty

108
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:03,199
buds buds the size of my arms I got

109
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,719
skinny arms but they're long so it makes

110
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,958
big long arms I should have said my legs

111
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,120
my legs are better um so it makes big

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,759
giant buds big giant yields it will make

113
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,680
a a large variety of candy and fruity

114
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,358
turps there's like watermelon in there

115
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,160
uh there's some bananas there's like

116
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,879
apricot flavors do you say apricot or

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,840
apricot argue about that in the comments

118
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,159
as well but that turp is hidden in there

119
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,319
a little bit uh it's got candy flavors

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,600
in there it's got all kinds of fruity

121
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,680
candy deliciousness flavor that I really

122
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,160
enjoy um those big giant buds that I

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,478
talked about at making are bright

124
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,039
fluorescent green uh makes most of the

125
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,199
time makes really bright fluorescent

126
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:43,079
green flowers sometimes there are some

127
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,759
phenotypes that will be the complete

128
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,519
opposite they make a really dark color

129
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,840
with the golden leaf curl at the end uh

130
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,319
that's double paa most of the phenotypes

131
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,198
take about 65 to 72 days to finish on

132
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,839
you so uh let that one finish but you're

133
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,280
going to have big gigantic buds uh the

134
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,478
cix to Leaf ratio is very very nice on

135
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,359
the double paa uh not a whole bunch of

136
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,478
leaf on there uh it's really easy to

137
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,280
trim makes big giant buds really easy

138
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,959
for bag appeal really nice for the trim

139
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,000
crew uh big heavy colas is the next note

140
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,000
that I wrote down and then I wrote down

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,560
also heavy feeding um also it's going to

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,560
get tall I want to exaggerate that these

143
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,720
plants do get tall and they eat a lot so

144
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,360
um yeah like I said before double Paula

145
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,560
is shrouded in mystery still kind of is

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,038
that's the most I'm going to tell you

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,439
today but a lot of people are asking

148
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,120
about double paa honestly that's all the

149
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,120
info I'm going to give you double Paula

150
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,600
is kind of a secret um I don't know why

151
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,680
I just stuttered when I talked about it

152
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,360
but double Paula is kind of a secret in

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
my Arsenal I tell you everything I tell

154
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,520

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,280
uh double Pao will be a secret uh as

156
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,038
long as I can keep it a secret there may

157
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,079
be one other person out there that knows

158
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:52,038
the truth uh I don't know if they have

159
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,399
ever told anybody what double Paula

160
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:56,839
really is so that's my story with double

161

podcast this is the pet peeve section of

cringeworthy there's a lot of different

169
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,800
words for it sometimes I'll be looking

170
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,318
on the internet and I'll see something

171
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,120
in somebody's grow photos and I'll go ew

172
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,160
or sometimes I'll walk into a grow space

173

private grow if you see it online it

181
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,839

193
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,638
from somebody named redyed Rick I

194
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,000
actually found this one on

195
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,160
YouTube excuse me for the groly throat

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,120
of course I've been taking dabs today

197
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,080
red-eyed Rick said the number one cause

198
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,560
of house fires is the extension cord and

199
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,878
that was told to me by my residential

200
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,160
electrical teacher and fire chief in

201
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,759
trade school so yes uh they did not send

202
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
me this as a pet peeve but that is one

203
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,280
of my pet peeves is going into a grow

204
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,199
and seeing that spiderweb of electrical

205
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,000
cords of power cords of power strips

206
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,879
everywhere you guys that [ __ ] just like

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,199
our friend just said is the number one

208
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,240
cause of house fires is the extension

209
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,759
cord so if you're the grower that's got

210
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,160
all the extension cords all over the

211
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,360
place one of my friends yeah I'm talking

212
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,840
to you bro uh be careful because that is

213
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,680
a cause for fire go check on I don't

214
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,839
want you to use them I'd rather you not

215
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,918
use them uh get the electricity figured

216
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,959
out do it properly I understand some of

217
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,758
you guys are going to do what you're

218
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,719
going to do I don't promote it I don't

219
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,720
support it but if you're going to do it

220
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,240
use the best highest grade power uh

221
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,000
electric cords power cords what are they

222
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,840
called the extension cords you can get

223
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,800
the highest grade best quality you can

224
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,799
get and go feel them make sure they're

225
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,158
not getting too hot and pay attention to

226
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,319
how many amps you're pulling from that

227
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:13,000
wall socket because uh if you've got an

228
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,840
older house uh that wiring in there will

229
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,120
heat up that will catch on fire um I

230
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,439
don't want you to harm your family I'm

231
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,840
talking to everybody at this point not

232
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,800
just my one friend that I know has got a

233
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,878
[ __ ] maze in a zoo of extension cords

234
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
but I don't want anybody out there

235
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,000
anybody to get hurt by a fire I don't

236
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,199
want your house to get burnt down I

237
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,959
don't want the house to have a small

238
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,360
fire

239
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,639
I don't want the fire department to come

240
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,959
I don't want the adrenaline in your

241
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,679
heart um I definitely don't want the uh

242
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,199
the Cannabis industry the Cannabis

243
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,958
Community to be blamed for that fire

244
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,759
down the street imagine how shitty that

245
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,359
sounds uh Hey Bild you hear the House

246
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,480
burn down down the street yeah I heard

247
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,680
they were growing a bunch of weed in

248
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,480
there and one of the grow lights caught

249
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:52,199
on fire like that' just be the worst

250
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,519
[ __ ] for the community at this point

251
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,600
we're finally almost starting to be

252
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,759
taken seriously and people don't look at

253
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,040
us like a bunch of lazy Stoners Like a

254
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,439
bunch of criminals

255
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,319
we're past the BHO explosion phase of

256
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,959
this culture so let's move forward and

257
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,560
keep putting a positive impact on the

258
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:10,119
community and not move backwards by uh

259
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,000
burning the [ __ ] down with too many

260
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,440
extension cords so that is my pet PE for

awkward momentum moving I've got a bunch

270
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,278
of great emails here in front of me I've

271

273
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,838
on the top there's a bunch of tabs one

274
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,958

00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,078
Tab and you send me a grow question or

277
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,959
ask for grow help if I read your

278
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:53,078
question here on the podcast I will send

279
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:56,078

281
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,759
question on today's podcast came from my

282
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,600
new friend Lawrence big shout out to my

283
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,120
buddy Lawrence Lawrence make sure you do

284
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
check your email because you have got a

285
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,440
coupon code for a free pack of iy

286
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,599
genetics premium seeds Lawrence's

287
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,440
question uh this question came in kind

288
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,879
of oddly written but I was able to

289
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,360
translate it and break it down into uh

290
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,679
I'll just make it make sense for you

291
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,800
basically Lawrence said uh I bought a

292
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,120
pack of feminized seeds so they've got

293
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,120
feminized seeds and they're asking can I

294
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,679
use one of these female seeds out of

295
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,720
this feminized pack to breed with if I

296
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:31,799
put male pollen on this feminized seed

297
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,440
so basically they're asking is there a

298
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:37,120
difference in breeding between feminized

299
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,440
female plants and just using a regular

300
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,200
uh non- feminized regular male female

301
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,480
breed female plant is the basic of this

302
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,519
question here then it says much love

303
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,200
from our friend Lawrence Lawrence bro

304
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,159
thank you for the great content because

305
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,920
this will be fun to talk about for just

306
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:55,519
a moment here uh the main answer is uh

307
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:59,000
that is a great idea there is no problem

308
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,159
at all with breeding a male plant to a

309
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,078
Fe female plant that came from a

310
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,199
feminized pack of seeds there is no

311
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:06,399
problem with that at all I encourage

312
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,278
that that is something that I would

313
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,200
definitely do also what you can also do

314
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,600
is you can pollinate that female plant

315
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,399
that came from that female pack of seeds

316
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,920
with any other reverse female of your

317
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,440
choosing if you've tested it and done

318
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,838
the proper background research but um

319
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,480
yes that plant is a very viable plant

320
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,880
for breeding if you find a keeper that

321
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,079
you enjoy whether it came from a femin

322
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,519
seed or a regular seed yes you can breed

323
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:33,838
to that there is no difference in that

324
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,919
feminized plant and a regular male

325
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,760
female bred female plant there's no

326
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,559
difference the only difference is the

327
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,399
way that it was bred in my opinion in my

328
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,879
experience the difference is the pollen

329
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,078
um I've repeated this on this show a

330
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,159
couple of times we're going to say it

331
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,559
one more time here uh just to get the

332
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,919
message out here and I did learn this

333
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,278
analogy came from Mr Soul big shout out

334
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,639
to my friend Mr Soul uh Rick thank you

335
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,360
for the great info uh Mr Soul kind of

336
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,600
put it this way one time this is not the

337
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,560
way that it works this is an analogy

338
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,839
this is just a way to paint the picture

339
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,759
so that you can understand how feminized

340
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,839
seas and female uh breed feminized

341
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,078
plants work now imagine um just imagine

342
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,519
this is what we're going to build in our

343
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,599
brain right here on this side uh we have

344
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,799
got a plant and it is dumping pollen

345
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,680
just pollen is coming out of this plant

346
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,240
over here we've got a row of female

347
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,679
plants uh they're ripe for pollination

348
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,560
they've got their pistols are up in the

349
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,759
air they're horny their legs are up

350
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:32,439
they're looking to party they're like

351
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,439
dude let's get it uh let me move this

352
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,199
one dreadlock out of the way it's

353
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,800
driving me nuts there we go that was

354
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:38,439
starting to hurt pressed against my ear

355
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,919
anyway so we got a bunch of ladies over

356
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,199
here they're ready to party this dude's

357
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,360
over here he's ready to ski what we've

358
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,039
done basically essentially this is not

359
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,278
really what we did again this is an

360
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,399
analogy uh what we have learned to do is

361
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:52,519
put up a screen in the middle and put a

362
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,480
vacuum up top and suck out all of the

363
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:58,000
pollen that is male pollen we are only

364
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,720
putting female pollen on this side of

365
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,639
the room so what we're able to do is all

366
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,079
the plants on this side of the room will

367
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,639
be females now that's the only

368
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,759
difference after that pollination after

369
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,919
that female pollination happens there's

370
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,919
no difference they are just like every

371
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,879
other plant many people like to uh talk

372
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,639
like there's a a weakness to these

373
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,360
plants they have less Vigor they have

374
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,839
less potency something will be wrong

375
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,680
with them they're more prone to

376
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,160
intersect if the proper work was done

377
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,559
before the breeding project was started

378
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,000
those feminized plants have the

379
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,119
potential to be everything and possibly

380
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,639
more than those regular Plants could be

381
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,078
now what I wanted to get to is I want to

382
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,278
talk about breeding with these plants

383
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,719
I've been rambling for a minute the

384
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,198
point is yes you absolutely can breed

385
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,680
with those plants there's no difference

386
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,439
other than that pollination was SE the

387
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,359
male pollen was basically sucked out

388
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
again that's not how it works and again

389
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,440
uh thanks Mr soul for the great analogy

390
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,120
but the only difference was that pollen

391
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,639
after that everything is the same we

392
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,240
have got plants uh if you grew a

393
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,079
population so I breed male and female I

394
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,799
breed male female breeding plants and

395
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:05,039
feminized plants if you bought or I gave

396
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,919
you a bunch of packs of both of them and

397
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,559
we put all the fem seeds on one side and

398
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,479
all the reg seeds on the other and grew

399
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,758
them uh Once you pull out all the male

400
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,519
plants and put the plants in a

401
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,278
population together you're not going to

402
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,480
notice any difference other than the

403
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,679
strains you're going to be able to tell

404
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,199
phenotypes apart but there won't be any

405
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:22,198
difference in Vigor there won't be any

406
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:24,599
difference in pest pest or pathogen

407
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,679
resistance these plants are going to be

408
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,120
just as good as the regular plants if

409
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:30,359
not better so uh there's no big

410
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,919
difference I want to talk about now

411
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,879
about strains that I have bred from

412
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,198
feminized plants and I'm trying to think

413
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,838
of other things that I've done while I'm

414
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:40,439
talking about this but I know that

415
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,480
morning dew let's talk about Morning Dew

416
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,880
U morning de is a Grateful Dog female

417
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,360
which came from feminized seeds and then

418
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,559
I pollinated that with the arise that

419
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,360
makes morning de you guys love morning

420
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,838
dew plants Morning Dew makes amazing

421
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,639
plants I love it you guys love it um

422
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,000
highle breeders Growers and smokers

423
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,839
enjoyed the morning de I think it's

424
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,519
mostly sold out now but morning do was

425
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,480
made from a feminized female and a

426
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,000
regular male plant so that that's

427
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,240
something that this viewer this listener

428
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,440
was exactly asking about I took that

429
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,198
pollen put it on what was a feminized

430
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,399
female and that made amazing seeds now a

431
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,919
lot of people ask Will that give me uh

432
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,399
more a ratio of male to female seeds

433
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,879
after I do that no they come out about

434
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,440
50/50 still uh that's been a question

435
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,480
that a lot of people have asked it does

436
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,720
not make a difference another cross we

437
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,959
could talk about is the Lemon Sunrise

438
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,079
the lemon Sunrise was the lemon Jeffrey

439
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,119
female that's a lemon Jeffrey that's a

440
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,399
lemon skunk and a Golden Goat two female

441
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,240
plants bred together to make a feminized

442
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,159
lemon Jeffrey I took my selection out of

443
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,360
there my favorite lemon Jeffrey cut

444
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,958
pollinated that one with the arise and

445
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,800
that one made the lemon Sunrise which

446
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:50,119
were amazing freaking plants uh very

447
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,519
similar to the um the Cascade and the

448
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,959
Firefly and if you grew them all side by

449
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,839
side you could see the differences and

450
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,479
the commonalities but you would never

451
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,759
know that some of those were feminized

452
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,319
and some were not from femini seeds so

453
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,720
the overall answer here is uh absolutely

454
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:07,360
breed with those yes that is possible uh

455
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,600
the short answer is there's no big

456
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,519
difference uh in that female plant than

457
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,278
there was with a female selected from a

458
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,720
male female breeding population my

459
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,240
friend Lawrence thank you for the great

460
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,440
question I'm not sure where you are I

461
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,159
could tell that uh this was translated

462
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm not uh being disrespectful in any

463
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,000
way but if we can ship seeds to where

464
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,399
you are I look forward to getting you a

465
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,720
pack of IE genetics premium seeds my

466
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,399
friend Lawrence thank you for the great

467
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,519
message all right this next message came

468
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,039
from the iy genetics website also this

469
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,679
one came from our friend grumpy toad

470
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,399
shout out to grumpy toad don't be so

471
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,838
grumpy bro it can't be that hard being a

472
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,000
toad maybe it can I don't know the

473
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,279
question goes like this it says yo Rasta

474
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,278
Jeff yo what up grumpy toad it says

475
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:50,639
thank you for being a legitimate source

476
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:52,639
of grow knowledge I think I speak for

477
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,600
all of the community when I say that bro

478
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,120
thank you uh I appreciate that to be

479
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,278
called legitimate I've been legitimized

480
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,440
now that's like getting a little blue

481
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:03,000
stamp on Twitter so thank you bro I am

482
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,000
legitimate I appreciate it uh I try not

483
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,880
to say nonsense I try not to talk

484
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,519
[ __ ] on the show I understand that

485
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,919
what I say is going into a microphone

486
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,439
and out to the internet and people are

487
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,679
going to um apply the techniques I

488
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,919
recommend and buy the products I suggest

489
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,000
so I try to be mindful of those things

490
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,240
when I'm talking on here so thank you I

491
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,119
appreciate it that's what I'm trying to

492
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,078
say let me learn how to take a damn

493
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,918
compliment uh my friend has a question

494
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,399
it says I have a question here related

495
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,799
to breeding those are my favorite uh

496
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,519
also the audience really loves the

497
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:34,879
breeding questions it says when I see a

498
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:38,119
strain called a and it is a cross

499
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,320
between B and C so we've got strain a

500
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,399
which is a cross of plant B and plant C

501
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,480
that makes sense to me is there any

502
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,160
convention that says which of the

503
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,079
parents are the male what I mean is does

504
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,160
the male come first and the female

505
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,759
second peace from your friend grumpy

506
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,360
Toad and then there's a little note here

507
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:56,359
to myself that I'm going to keep private

508
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,479
but yes grumpy toad I'm glad that you

509
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:01,119
were asking this question because I see

510
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,120
a lot of um new breeders and I see

511
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,798
breeders on social media messing this up

512
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,038
and uh a lot of consumers know the basic

513
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,798
rule of this and I feel like if a

514
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,079
breeder got this wrong on a package it

515
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,240
would deter me from purchasing those

516
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,038
seeds so let's uh talk about the

517
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,480
standard here and let me touch back on

518
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:19,599
what you were asking so that I can make

519
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,000
this super clear for everybody when you

520
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,359
buy a pack of seeds let's just say

521
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,159
you're going to buy a pack of seeds from

522
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,119
me we're going to say that you're going

523
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:28,880
to get a rise just we're going to pick a

524
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,839
rise as a random pack of seeds a rise is

525
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,440
a Golden Goat female pollinated by a

526
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:37,759
daybreaker male so I would put Golden

527
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,640
Goat X daybreaker the reason I list it

528
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:43,000
that way and this will be easy to follow

529
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,120
once you figure it out ladies first I

530
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,519
always list ladies first when I'm

531
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,639
listing the cross the female plant will

532
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,519
be so maybe now that we're talking about

533
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,320
feminized seeds in this episode I will

534
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,519
say the plant that received the pollen

535
00:18:54,319 --> 00:19:00,279
will be the lady plant females first the

536
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,400
pollen donor will be listed second so if

537
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,319
you've got the two parentheses you see

538
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,519
Golden Goat X daybreaker that would

539
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,558
indicate to me right away daybreaker was

540
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,759
the pollen donor Golden Goat was the

541
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,558
girl that received the pollen so in

542
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,879
general Horticultural practices uh let's

543
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,279
try to teach everybody this in the

544
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,559
Cannabis cultivation world but ladies

545
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,440
first when listing genetics now there's

546
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:25,759
another step we can go with this um I've

547
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,080
got acoss that um it is three different

548
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,440
plants together but it was basically

549
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,319
these two plants over here in

550
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,720
parenthesis that was one really good

551
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,359
plant that just never got a name and

552
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,759
then there's another plant that got bred

553
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:41,798
to that so when I list the genetics it

554
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:44,038
is plant a cross to plant B and C in

555
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:46,918
parentheses now what that indicates to

556
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:49,839
me we're always going to do female first

557
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,280
so that plant a on this side is the

558
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,199
female in that equation and these two in

559
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,440
parentheses were bred together to make

560
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,000
one plant and then that one plant is the

561
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,480
pollen donor that pollinated that female

562
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,200
I hope that makes sense I'm going to try

563
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,038
to do it again the mathematical equation

564
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,279
that we would be looking at would be um

565
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:14,158
plant a times and then in parentheses b

566
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:16,359
x c So it's b cross 2 C just to be clear

567
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,559
on that one so plant a would be the

568
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,839
female because it's the first one in the

569
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,678
equation and then it was cross to these

570
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:25,439
two plants which made one plant I just

571
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,519
don't have a name for it it is B and C

572
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,640
in that equation B would be the female

573
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,319
pollinated by C that made a new plant

574
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,280
and they we're going to pollinate a with

575
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,119
that I hope that makes sense ladies

576
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,918
first even if you're having multiple

577
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,639
sets of brackets the lady will always

578
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,640
come first in that equation if you have

579
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,080
questions if I didn't make that clear uh

580
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,600
let me know in the comments or send me a

581
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,439
message we'll talk about it I'll do a

582
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,119
follow-up episode because without

583
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,919
drawing that out like a mathematical

584
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,038
equation on a chalkboard it kind of

585
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,520
doesn't make sense so um my buddy grumpy

586
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:57,158
toad I hope I answered this for you

587
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:01,240
because I really got rambling on that

588
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:03,039
one ladies first um lady times male and

589
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,558
then sometimes you'll see so if I had

590
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,798
two plants that didn't have a name um

591
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:09,839
just plant so we'll say Golden Goat to

592
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:11,319
daybreaker didn't get a name uh that was

593
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,480
not a rise we'll just say Golden Goat to

594
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,798
daybreaker in parenthesis and then we'll

595
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,759
say uh Platinum Tangi to Golden Goat

596
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:20,400
over here on the other side um we know

597
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:22,200
which is the male and female in both of

598
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,759
these and then if I cross those together

599
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,558
I just put an X in the middle and show

600
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:29,038
you the bunch of [ __ ] on the left side

601
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,839
is going to be the the female part the

602
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,240
bunch of [ __ ] on the right side is going

603
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,519
to be the male part all right I've got

604
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,599
