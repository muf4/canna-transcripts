00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,879
question there's first question came

52
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,899
from our friend Michael McCoy and it

53
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,819
goes a lot like this it goes hey Ross to

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,379
Jeff I have lemon Jeffrey Maze and

55
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,899
Morning Dew that I have purchased from

56
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,519
you I have an early stage of thrips and

57
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,860
I have started treatment with neem oil

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,140
I've been spraying every other day for a

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,300
few days now can I still feed my plants

60
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,878
even though I am treating them with neem

61
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,819
oil I use Remo nutrients and the plants

62
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,079
are right around a month old so you've

63
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,560
got a case of thrips you've been

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,640
spraying neem oil every other other day

65
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,140
eventually that neem oil is going to

66
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,059
start causing more problems than those

67
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,458
thrips I would settle down on the neem

68
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,219
oil in fact I don't recommend or use

69
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,780
neem oil at all in my grow neem oil is

70
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,300
banned in commercial production in

71
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,640
Colorado I would recommend a more

72
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,680
strategic pesticide I would also do

73
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,539
research on why neem oil is not

74
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,099
recommended there are a lot of side

75
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,019
effects to neem oil you may not want to

76
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:53,699
be involved in but I would recommend

77
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,459
switching pesticides I would recommend

78
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,259
something like evergreen or azamax or

79
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,479
even a Monterey Garden spray with

80
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,519
spinosad that would be that'd be much

81
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,539
more beneficial and useful than the neem

82
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,580
oil the neem is going to start

83
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,840
suffocating the plants it's going to

84
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,640
make your plants taste like [ __ ] when

85
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,979
you smoke them so I would switch that up

86
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,179
and stop spraying every other day that's

87
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:13,619
a little bit excessive you're going to

88
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,540
start clogging up those plants they

89
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,060
can't breathe that will cause more

90
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,519
problems also other than sprays I would

91
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,439
consider a soil dredge drench that soil

92
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,640
those uh those thrips are living a

93
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,139
little bit in the leaves but at night

94
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,598
time they go down and they sleep and

95
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,759
they make shelter in your soil so maybe

96
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,919
treat that soil consider that as well

97
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,019
also do a little bit of defoliation down

98
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,579
there at the bottom of the plant the

99
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,680
main question was should I be feeding

100
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,180
these plants yes they need all the food

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,560
all the energy they can get even though

102
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,480
they're getting attacked by bugs and

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,979
you're spraying them they still do need

104
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,479
to be fed they need energy they need

105
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,699
nutrition just like you do you can't

106
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,079
Battle Bugs you can't grow you can't

107
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,878
live your life if you don't eat the

108
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,280
plants are the same way so you've got to

109
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,378
feed them but I would definitely focus

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,419
on getting rid of those thrips defoliate

111
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,459
rotate your pesticides if you've been

112
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,619
spraying neem every other day for a few

113
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,780
days now they're getting used to it just

114
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,340
imagine if you woke up every day and I

115
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,080
sprayed some funky chemical in your face

116
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,180
the first day you'd go ah that [ __ ]

117
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,739
sucks by day three you'd go bad that's

118
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,060
kind of terrible by about the Eighth Day

119
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,319
you go yeah there's that [ __ ] spray

120
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,420
again and you just get up and go about

121
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,399
your day your thrips are doing that with

122
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,199
your neem oil the first day they went oh

123
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,638
God that's a lot of [ __ ] by now they're

124
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,959
going yeah there's that neem oil again

125
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,400
and they're making babies that are

126
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,199
prepared for neem oil they've just

127
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,000
evolved you've got super thrips now

128
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,340
you've got to switch up your your

129
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,680
strategy multiple modes of attack attack

130
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,060
the soil attack the the leaves do some

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,639
defoliating and then hit it with

132
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,100
multiple pesticides and a rotation all

133
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,840

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,180
severe panic attacks oh that's terrible

166
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,620
I've had panic attacks before uh kind of

167
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,139
crippling makes you feel totally weird

168
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,819
and out of place it says I know how much

169
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,560
you care and how much knowledge you have

170
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:53,038
on everything cannabis so my question

171
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,538
starts here which strain or strains do

172
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,060
you recommend from your lineup to start

173
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:58,620
as a baseline if this issue continues

174
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,120
with my wife I'm going to have to shoot

175
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,699
my shot at breeding her something

176
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,220
special but I need to do a lot more

177
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,080
research first my friend Andrew luckily

178
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,580
I've done a lot of breeding and a lot of

179
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,740
work to get you a head start you may not

180
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,240
have to breed your own plants there may

181
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,819
be something in my lineup that will

182
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,978
definitely help with your wife's anxiety

183
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,560
the thing is with cannabis and with most

184
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,758
medicines it's all going to be uh first

185
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,500
of all it's going to be plant specific

186
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,740
we'll say it's plant phenotype specific

187
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,418
but it's also body chemistry specific

188
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,100
things that I smoke make Mike's heart

189
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,560
race and they make me calm down and

190
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,840
normal some things that make Mike normal

191
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,399
make me lazy so it's all about our

192
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,159
different body chemistry and how our

193
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,659
brains and bodies react to different

194
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,979
terpenes cannabinoids Esters all the

195
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,259
compounds in the plants which we are

196
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:44,579
smoking so I can make some

197
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,500
recommendations but I've got to

198
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,000
recommend on like totally opposite ends

199
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,160
of the spectrum and you try one thing

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,959
and it's either going to fix her anxiety

201
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,819
or she's gonna have the worst panic

202
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,138
attack of her life while she's high and

203
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,460
then if that's the case you got to go to

204
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,900
the other end of the spectrum and that

205
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,519
one's either going to fix her or like I

206
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,439
said she's going to have a panic attack

207
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,839
so unfortunately the way to figure this

208
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,639
out I think is just smoke a couple of

209
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,379
different things and see which one works

210
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,720
let me make some recommendations I've

211
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,038
got a traumatic brain injury I hit my

212
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,080
head we'll talk just a little bit about

213
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,399
this I hit my head right here right

214
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,800
about where the headphones said I ding

215
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,318
my head pretty good in 2015. I was going

216
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,060
down some stairs to get a chair I think

217
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,098
the doorway had to be about six two

218
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,259
because I'm six five and that [ __ ] hit

219
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:27,659
me right here clip me super good I was

220
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,520
out immediately I bounced down the

221
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,580
stairs on the back of my head I woke up

222
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,439
I kind of knew where I was and who I was

223
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,639
but that was about all the details I had

224
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,918
I didn't know what happened I didn't

225
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,379
know why I was there I was at a friend's

226
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,000
going away party I did not say goodbye

227
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,860
to them to the best of my knowledge I

228
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,300
don't remember but I've got some weird

229
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,860
effects from that traumatic brain injury

230
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,720
they still are there it's been about 15

231
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,160
years I guess to eight years ago it's

232
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,259
been a long time see brain injury

233
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,139
effects anyway when I smoke lemon

234
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,660
Jeffrey and plants with high limonene

235
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,699
Terps a lot of the uh the skips and

236
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,199
clogs and brain issues they kind of

237
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,020
subside and go away with the lemon

238
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,500
Jeffrey and high limonene Terps uh Jack

239
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:09,060
the Ripper helps me out but also Jack

240
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,800
the Ripper gives some of my friends my

241
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,478
buddy Petro can't smoke Jack the Ripper

242
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,978
because he gets [ __ ] extremely high

243
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,439
and wants to have a major panic attack

244
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:18,899
so for me those Terps do a really good

245
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,339
thing for other people it puts them on

246
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,779
the edge the first thing I would

247
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,339
recommend is the Lemon Jeffrey though

248
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:24,899
because that makes my little my little

249
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,239
problems it definitely helps them go

250
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,799
away then another product for my lineup

251
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,598
that works to put everybody in a good

252
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,759
mood it's one of my daily smokes if it's

253
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,218
daytime if I want to get some [ __ ] done

254
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,179
but also kind of just have a little buzz

255
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,099
you know what I mean not get super

256
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,718
wrecked and go sit on the couch but a

257
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,158
little little dishes energy a little

258
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,379
vacuum energy because vacuuming doing

259
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,360
the dishes sucks but if I smoke some

260
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,860
orange gasm bro we'll do all the dishes

261
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,899
and not even give a [ __ ] I'll be looking

262
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,220
for other dishes to clean I'll take out

263
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,200
the trash I'll mop the floor just

264
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,639
because I'm so blazed on orangegasm that

265
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,920
it's a good day nothing could go wrong

266
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,539
so the lemon Jeffrey and orange gasm are

267
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,599
two that I would definitely recommend to

268
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:02,399
start testing out anxiety for my strains

269
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,440
but you got to hang out with her because

270
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,778
these could also it could backfire like

271
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,820
I talked about my brain chemistry her

272
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,259
brain chemistry I don't know you it

273
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,360
could be way different or it could be

274
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:14,759
completely the same I do have notes let

275
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,680
me read some of my notes here

276
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,299
um so some of the jtr crosses I should

277
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,799
mention this may be way too much for

278
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,899
some people some of the Jack the Ripper

279
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,879
crosses may be beautiful for some people

280
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,519
with anxiety when I smoke it it makes my

281
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,259
brain right when Petro smokes it he he

282
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,720
just gets [ __ ] racy and freaked out

283
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,399
so uh go uh go light with the Jack the

284
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,060
Ripper stuff but some of it may really

285
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,980
work for you if the limonene and the the

286
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:39,479
lemon Jeffrey the orange gasm and the

287
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,399
Jack the Ripper stuff doesn't work for

288
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,379
you at all I would try Big Mountain

289
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,539
fudge cake that is the totally opposite

290
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,159
end of the spectrum for my breeding uh

291
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,740
completely different plants I think that

292
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,600
one would work well it's got a just a

293
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,339
heavy feeling to it when you smoke it if

294
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,139
you can find a pack of moon tower that

295
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,519
would be awesome but those are sold out

296
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,319
I don't have any of those I'm not going

297
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,000
to make those again but uh maybe

298
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,278
something with some Bubba cushion there

299
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,958
maybe uh good for the anxiety that one

300
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,059
calms me down makes me super chill I

301
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,799
melt in the couch uh that one that's

302
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,739
movie weed for me if I gotta chill and

303
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,479
watch a movie then we'll work into some

304
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,339
of the arise crosses I get weird

305
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,379
feedback on the arise for some people

306
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,940
the arise makes them shoot up and get a

307
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:20,039
bunch of a bunch of energy for some

308
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,500
people the arise makes them melting into

309
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,120
the couch and chill out a rise crosses

310
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,639
may be good for you some of the specific

311
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,339
crosses I wrote down were Firefly why

312
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,838
Sun kiss moon tower and Dark Hollow

313
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,940
those may be great crosses for you to

314
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,440
try for the anxiety and I know it sucks

315
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,000
that I'm just giving you like this big

316
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,220
plate of options you're gonna have to

317
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,720
buy stuff and grow it and try it but

318
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,700
with cannabis like I keep saying it's

319
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,778
all about your body your chirps I don't

320
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,399
know what's going to work for you it's

321
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:45,838
uh this is still something we're

322
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,278
learning and something I'm definitely

323
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,320
learning and you're gonna have to learn

324
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,419
it with us and take a lot of notes when

325
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,579
you smoke something right down I smoked

326
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:55,979
lemon Jeffrey and I felt good I felt bad

327
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:58,439
if you have a remarkable experience most

328
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,120
of the time people will remember I know

329
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,860
somebody that got way too high on Lemon

330
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,480
wreath and every time they see a jar of

331
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,680
lemon wreath they leave the room just

332
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,959
because they know that that was a bad

333
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,719
problem when I smell tequila I remember

334
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,759
that [ __ ] experience vividly so uh

335
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,259
maybe try the big mountain fudge cakes

336
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,480
and Bubba Kush sort of stuff then the

337
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:16,980
last thing I wrote down is purple heart

338
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,659
I've got a strain called Purple Heart

339
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,139
That strain was made for veterans with

340
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:23,759
PTSD night terrors and anxiety this one

341
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,379
should be great for you the thing is

342
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,360
you're not going to get any of the the

343
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,519
Psychedelic on headbuzz it's just going

344
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,320
to be mostly calming which may be what

345
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,659
your wife is looking for

346
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,339
the thing about purple heart is it is

347
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,259
not available on the website it's not

348
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,940
available commercially anywhere you've

349
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,860

flyer on your emails and I really

389
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,759
appreciate when a busy man like yourself

390
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,920
finds time to respond to me bro I'm just

391
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,958
a normal person uh living the dream so

392
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,240
thank you for making that dream possible

393
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:03,419
it says quick off topic your living

394
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,579
Jeffrey's are in day 42 and wow what an

395
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:07,620
explosive plant bro I try to warn you

396
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:10,019
guys these plants veg like Monsters they

397
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,578
go super fast be ready it says the

398
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,620
branches are definitely being supported

399
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,778
with bamboo sticks otherwise everything

400
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,639
would be horizontal yeah bro you got to

401
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:19,139
give them some support uh they get beefy

402
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,940
they get heavy and they will fall over

403
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,740
that's a good sign bro that means you've

404
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,380
got some big fat chunky buds which is

405
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,240
what we all want he said I heard this on

406
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,399
your nutrient episode and I've heard

407
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,159
this from experience Growers if you are

408
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,200
careful you can raise your uh K booster

409
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,699
dose slightly higher than normal if you

410
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,860
are careful and know what you're doing

411
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,079
that's absolutely true if you know what

412
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,700
to look for you can push the plants if

413
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,739
you've got a good eye if you can

414
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,360
identify a nutrient burn if it's

415
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,519
nitrogen phosphorus potassium whatever

416
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,419
you're overdoing because then things are

417
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,759
going to start you're going to see

418
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:52,078
deficiencies and over feeds at the same

419
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,039
time if you go too hard but if you know

420
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,439
what you're doing I know what to look

421
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,019
for you can do it then he says what are

422
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,880
the precursor signs of nutrient burn to

423
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,860
look out for when doing this right now

424
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,480
I'm raising shine to two and a half

425
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,639
grams that's a good move right there bro

426
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,139
go slow but do keep raising it says I

427
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,899
don't want to get any further than this

428
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,759
it is working even watering up to one to

429
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,740
two grams seems to be working like a

430
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,139
charm sort of sounds like Common Sense

431
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,139
slowly acclimate your plants to a higher

432
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,759
dose it's because is it because more

433
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,919
taller let's see this sentence is hard

434
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,958
to read Because more tolerant if you do

435
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,578
it this way yeah that makes sense now uh

436
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,958
that's just the thought of mine not a

437
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:29,699
fact I looked up no that makes total

438
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,958
sense bro just like uh just like I

439
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,339
talked about the bugs earlier that are

440
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,319
building resistance they're getting

441
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,300
stronger every day your plants are going

442
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,160
oh he gave me two grams we can handle

443
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:39,539
two grams the next day you give them 2.1

444
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,578
and they go yeah that's a little push I

445
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:43,319
know what to do with this if you jump up

446
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:44,939
immediately they may freak out and go oh

447
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,060
that was way too much bro and they may

448
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,800
fry up on you totally does make sense uh

449
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,659
the main question here was how can I

450
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,159
tell if my plants are getting overfed

451
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,559
that's a really good question we want to

452
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,759
push them the one thing I usually talk

453
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,979
about when our plants are getting

454
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,899
overfed is what I call their fingernails

455
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,759
getting done just imagine the leaves on

456
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,740
your plants or the the lady the fingers

457
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,819
of a lady and they got their fingernails

458
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,620
done they're starting to just look a

459
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,660
little bit crispy at the tips that is

460
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,179
the first sign to look for of an overfed

461
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:14,159
plant those tips will start getting they

462
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,899
may turn brown they may turn yellow they

463
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,219
may get crispy but right at the tip of

464
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,259
all the big leaves that's where you're

465
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,120
going to notice it most likely where

466
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,159
you're going to notice it first with

467
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,500
most nutrient issues so you're going to

468
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,299
see the nails getting done then they may

469
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,740
get pale up the middle when you see that

470
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,539
pail up the middle you may think you

471
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,100
need to feed something more that's

472
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:34,078
because everything thing is out of whack

473
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,540
stop feeding so much kind of pull back a

474
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,879
little bit you may see crispy tips you

475
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,740
may see leaves starting to curl they may

476
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,600
get kind of crispy papery leathery and

477
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,159
then just start doing throwing up gang

478
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,778
signs and they're throwing up gang signs

479
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,419
saying [ __ ] you bro fix me that's what

480
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,278
they're doing uh you may just see leaves

481
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:51,778
that are weirdly dry leaves it the plant

482
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:53,220
is wet but there are just a few leaves

483
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:56,039
on there that are dry and crispy that's

484
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,899
a sign of either over feed or a nutrient

485
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,000
or a pH problem which when you start

486
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,620
over feeding you do create pH problems

487
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,299
then you start fighting the pH problem

488
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,560
you start over feeding then you throw

489
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:06,899
everything all out of whack you got to

490
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,458
start fresh so just pay attention as

491
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,980
soon as those Leaf tips start looking

492
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:13,379
like they're burnt maybe dial back just

493
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,079
a little bit or or maybe just keep going

494
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,639
just like you are unless it gets worse

495
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:18,838
um I like just a little touch of burnt

496
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,159
tips I tell you you know you're [ __ ]

497
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,120
pushing them that's like they're

498
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,198
sweating you know what I mean they're

499
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,820
starting to get ripped in there they're

500
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:24,958
doing the work that's what we want from

501
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,699
these plants we want to put them in

502
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,739
turbo mode but we don't want to burn

503
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:30,179
them up like a rocket ship

504
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,379
um then also other things to look out

505
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,539
for I've got some more notes Here here

506
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:35,759
too much nitrogen and flour especially

507
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:37,679
in early flour will start to make your

508
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,179
plants a little bit stretchy instead of

509
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,399
building buds they'll get taller they'll

510
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:42,778
start making a lot of fiber where the

511
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,519
bud sites are there will be a lot of

512
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:46,019
space and they'll never fill in that's

513
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,198
because you're feeding too much nitrogen

514
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,940
uh some of the uh this happens in dog

515
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,519
walker especially this happens in White

516
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,620
Walker this happens in a lot of the

517
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,120
stream a lot of the uh the cushier uh

518
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,679
what am I saying the chem dog strains

519
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
you'll notice this in if you over feed

520
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,458
them instead of making that one big

521
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,439
donkey dick Cola right at the top you'll

522
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,119
get a bunch of golf balls that make what

523
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,040
I call the stairway you get one butt

524
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,239
here one butt here one butt here and

525
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,578
they just kind of rotate around the

526
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,199
plant make a spiral staircase it never

527
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:15,359
really fills in the way that it could

528
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,919
have if you didn't overfeed it so some

529
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,899
of the chem dogs and cushy stuff they

530
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,540
will react that way if you over feed

531
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,699
them also on some of the more sativa

532
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,678
stuff you might start seeing excessive

533
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,360
foxtailing that can be from over feeding

534
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,400
uh so that could be a sign to look out

535
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,319
for but that's going to be like on a

536
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,640
longer finishing plant uh you'll notice

537
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,899
they're starting to just create more

538
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,820
growth and that's because the plant's

539
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,798
getting so much nitrogen it's going hey

540
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:39,298
maybe uh maybe I'm gonna just keep on

541
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:41,038
going so it starts spitting out New

542
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,079
Growth turning light green looking a

543
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,579
little fox taily all right my dude I

568
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:30,839
shout out to our friend The Man With No

569
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,340
Name hey bro I owe you a free pack of

570
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,959
seeds but please do send me a name

571
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:35,099
because that's how I can label the box

572
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,079
and get it to you you know the drill

573
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:40,259
I've said it enough times the question

574
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:42,659
goes if if I put a male plant that was

575
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,058
about to release pollen under 18-6 light

576
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,798
cycle for two weeks would it continue to

577
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:48,359
throw pollen or would it stop

578
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,339
immediately that's a very good question

579
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,659
I got a quick answer uh it will keep

580
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,399
going it's going to take a little while

581
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,440
for that plant to say oh you've changed

582
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,360
the light you've changed [ __ ] I will

583
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,558
change too and then once it decides to

584
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,000
change it's got to adjust all the

585
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,399
hormones it will take a little while

586
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,279
honestly male plants are a little more

587
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,140
difficult to stop flowering and re-veg

588
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,519
than a female plant just just seems to

589
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,320
be the case in my experience I've

590
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,960
reveged a lot of plants males and

591
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,579
females I've sex tested a lot of plants

592
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,620
by putting them under 12 12 and tried to

593
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:18,119
flip them back the males are always the

594
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:19,798
most stubborn to go back in my

595
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,319
experience so he will take a little

596
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,720
while to stop maybe uh at least a week

597
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,099
maybe 10 maybe 14 maybe 21 days

598
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,600
depending on

599
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,639
a lot of things

600
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,918
um how far into flower did he get it

601
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,900
says he's about to release pollen

602
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,220
um so he he's like oh he's already there

603
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,480
bro it's hard to get him to stop you

604
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,100
know that feeling bro he's about to let

605
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,058
it go it's hard to get him to stop you

606
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:40,859
don't want to stop when you're that

607
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,418
close either does he so it's going to

608
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:44,219
take quite a while depends on how far

609
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,259
into flower you went it depends on what

610
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,900
you're feeding uh it also depends on the

611
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,879
Spectrum and intensity of your light if

612
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,740
it's getting sunlight it may revert uh

613
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,600
re-vege much more quickly if it's

614
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,880
getting like a weak T5 light it's going

615
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:58,678
to take a lot longer uh maybe impossible

616
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,600
without enough light there's a second

617
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,519
part to the question it says thank you

618
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,759

619

um I think I got time for one more

624
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
question that was going to be the last

625
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,000
one I looked over we haven't gone nearly

626

track there's more to this message it

699
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:34,918
says I never considered myself a grower

700
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,960
until as of lately this year I'd say it

701
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,659
took a year to finally get a true grasp

702
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,579
on everything Ah that's healthy ego bro

703
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,020
too many people come in and pop some

704
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:44,460
seeds and grow a crop of mids and

705
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:45,960
they're like I'm the best grower on the

706
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,579
Block I'm glad you're humble about it

707
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,079
bro that means that you're able to learn

708
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,819
you've got a long way to go you're going

709
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,639
to be a badass grower welcome to the

710
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:55,558
team ah there's more it says this year I

711
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,200
produce some of my first flower it was

712
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:00,538
some Sour Bubba bag seed I live in

713
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,620
Georgia oh be careful bro uh I don't

714
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:03,359
know this person this is all

715
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,519
hypothetical this is all made up if

716
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,259
anybody's watching I live in Georgia so

717
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,179
having my own homegrown just to be

718
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,579
everything I could possibly get my hands

719
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,320
on here yes I'm sure of that bro just

720
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:15,538
that feeling of nurturing your own plant

721
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,399
you grew it from seed so you got to see

722
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:19,319
it from its little you got to smoke the

723
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,759
weed it came from then you got to see

724
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,558
the little baby all the way from a

725
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,058
little speck all the way up to a bong

726
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,940
rip and that's definitely a very

727
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:28,859
fulfilling feeling I it goes on though

728
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,538
it says I went back and listened to all

729
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:32,279
of the episodes I could and I've

730
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:33,960
listened to a few of them several times

731
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,298
bro thank you for the clicks on YouTube

732
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,519
I've been listening to you for almost

733
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:40,319
two years and I'm finally putting in the

734
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,359
time to write you it's about time bro

735
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,038
thanks for showing up it says most of

736
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,678
the time someone asks what I need to

737
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,419
know before so now I've got a few

738
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,340
questions isn't it weird how that works

739
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,900
so many people when they meet me in

740
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:53,519
person they go bro it's so weird I was

741
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,919
going to send you an email two weeks ago

742
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,599
but then the week I've missed I forgot

743
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,640
to send it you answered my question like

744
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,199
I sent it and you didn't even know uh

745
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,580
there's only so much time in the

746
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,259
cannabis grow there's nine weeks of

747
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:06,359
flour 10 weeks of flour then we got some

748
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:07,740
veg only so many weeks to talk about but

749
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:09,298
yes I do feel like there's a lot of

750
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,460
synchronicity when it comes to people's

751
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:13,079
Gardens and the subjects I choose to

752
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,419
talk about that's pretty awesome I'm

753
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,279
glad you've got a question this one goes

754
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:19,500
like this does the size of a cut matter

755
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,178
when you're trying to make a clone I'd

756
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,339
like to I would like a baby cutting

757
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,259
around the size of a pinky pinky finger

758
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:27,599
to do as well as a cutting that is

759
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:29,279
longer like an index finger have you

760
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,678
ever thought of or considered uploading

761
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,178
your videos to your website uh more so

762
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,220
asking you a thought of uploading your

763
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:37,440
clone video to your website

764
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,179
um there's a couple questions in there

765
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,980
size does matter when it comes to

766
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,298
cutting clones because

767
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,919
um it's all about hormones we need some

768
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:46,139
hormones in that plant to keep the plant

769
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,240
going that makes it give the urge to

770
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,220
make some Roots a little tiny plant's

771
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,679
not going to have enough life in it in

772
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,240
my opinion it will work it's just more

773
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,298
of a struggle a little bit of a longer

774
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,798
stem I like to leave one node and then

775
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:00,000
the top of the plant that extra node

776
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,798
down there is where a little bit of the

777
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,960
hormones are stored it will keep that

778
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:06,119
plant vigorous healthy happy and it'll

779
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,120
give it more opportunity to thrive in my

780
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:11,158
opinion so pinky finger is kind of short

781
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,500
I'm going into if you go into a rapid

782
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,840
Rooter that pinky finger half your clone

783
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,179
is already buried I'd want more up to

784
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,500
get more air to get more air flow to

785
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,419
breathe a little bit more if you go into

786
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,279
an easy cloner you got to put that bad

787
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:25,200
dog almost all the way submerged

788
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,940
nothing's showing up up top that's going

789
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,620
to be a little bit wonky more like a

790
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,419
index finger then you got more to work

791
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:32,099
with and probably you've got your main

792
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,720
leaves up top here you're going to have

793
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,699
a note about here and about here and

794
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,079
maybe even right down here there's a lot

795
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,940
of hormones in there and those are

796
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,918
really going to help the uh the overall

797
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,240
health of your plant I know that is

798
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,559
probably something most people don't

799
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,000
think about but if you leave a couple of

800
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:46,200
those little just little nubbins you

801
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,700
don't have to leave the whole Leaf just

802
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,259
the little the little shoe on there

803
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,120
there's hormones in there that will

804
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,640
encourage the production of that clone

805
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,619
there is more to this let me find where

806
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,200
I was uploading the videos to my website

807
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,298
bro uh that's a lot of bandwidth that's

808
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,880
a lot of technology and most importantly

809
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,259
that's [ __ ] expensive dude so ah no

810
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,299
that's probably not going to happen I

811
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,940
would like to find eventually I will

812
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:10,319
find a uh an alternative upload site

813
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,659
other than YouTube a lot of the other

814
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,639
places charge money uh they limit you on

815
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,620
how much you can post we'll get it

816
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,059
figured out I need I need a like I said

817
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:19,319
earlier I need a producer and an

818
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:21,359
assistant to get some of that [ __ ] done

819
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:23,399
with me let me find out where I was

820
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,678
there's more it goes like this recently

821
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,080
I took some clones I put them into

822
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,480
flower before I wrote this email I have

823
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,339
them in a tray with eight Cuts these

824
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,200
eight are over a week old and seem to

825
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:35,459
still be alive and well it sounds like

826
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,620
you're doing good so far it sounds like

827
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,600
you're over the hump honestly when when

828
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:41,939
you move your clones into flower do you

829
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,219
also eventually transplant them or do

830
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,500
you leave them in whatever you had them

831
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,120
in okay there's more let me keep going

832
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,038
because this so far this it got weird

833
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,899
but it makes sense now do you flower the

834
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:53,700
Clones out all the way to harvest or do

835
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,038
you only put them in flour to determine

836
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,298
the sex and then call the Clones I'm

837
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:59,220
just trying to figure out my Approach

838
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,179
since it's my first time doing it this

839
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,740
way

840
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,500
so if I were going to throw the Clones

841
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,720
into flower their only purpose was to

842
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,179
show me the sex so uh once they show me

843
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,159
flower I will remove the corresponding

844
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:13,019
males the all the male plants get away

845
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,820
and most of the time all of those clones

846
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:17,158
will get tossed if their sole purpose

847
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:19,139
was to show me sex then I'll just toss

848
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,120
those those don't get uh potted those

849
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,520
don't get used they've done their job

850
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,139
for what I wanted them to do if I do

851
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,579
plan on keeping that plant it would

852
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,278
definitely get up potted I wouldn't grow

853
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:31,079
it all the way in just a little shell or

854
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,359
just a little Cube I would at least put

855
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:34,740
it in a cup uh maybe a one or a three

856
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,240
gallon pot give it some opportunity

857
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,460
depending on how big you want the plant

858
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,440
to get if you just want to have fun you

859
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,700
can grow that plant in a beer cup and

860
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,919
veg it tilts about three and a half

861
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,360
inches tall it'll flower out about seven

862
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,860
to ten inches tall it'll be a really

863
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,259
cute representation of what your plant

864
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:50,759
will look like not a lot to smoke it'll

865
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:52,740
just be a couple of grams but if you do

866
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,658
a lot of those that adds up quite

867
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,099
quickly so yeah I would transplant those

868
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,480
into bigger Pots if you do plan on

869
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:59,939
keeping them if you're just going to use

870
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,640
those as sex testing plants then those

871
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,320
clone get tossed if you have any any

872
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,820
more use for them then I would save them

873
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,460
put them into a bigger pot I think I

874
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:10,139
said that it does go on it says do you

875
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,880
have any kind of extra notes on the big

876
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,559
