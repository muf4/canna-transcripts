friends at apothecary farms the label

says this has 67.8% THC and 80.4% total

16
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:41,968

looks it almost looks fluffy it is

20
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,038

all right podcast world I said I was

54
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,180
going to read listener emails on this

55
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:05,609
show let's jump right into it our first

56
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,099
email in this episode goes like this

57
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:09,750
good afternoon Rasta Jeff I just

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,759
listened to your episode on determining

59
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,289
ripeness I have a strain that has

60
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,688
another week of push

61
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:17,608
for I flush the plant I scope the

62
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:20,188
trichomes and I noticed that they are

63
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,930
all amber I'm not sure what sped up the

64
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:23,009
ripening but the buds themselves are

65
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,319
still pushing

66
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:28,560
well the buds may be pushing but the

67
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,878
main goal is to grow ripe trichomes you

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,348
want to harvest when the trichomes are

69
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:31,768
ripe so even if those buds are still

70
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:33,810
pushing

71
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,000
if the trichomes are ready it is time to

72
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,979
cut if you don't harvest that plant

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,568
those buds will keep pushing eventually

74
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,039
it will grow itself to death but if you

75
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:42,780
don't chop it down if you don't do

76
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,938
something the buds will keep pushing

77
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,370
that is a possibility if you give the

78
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:49,739
plants the opportunity so you say that

79
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,150
the plants are done one week early you

80
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,128
go on to say I'm wondering what

81
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,599
environmental factor could have done

82
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:55,679
this there are a lot of things that

83
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:57,688
could have done it but let's read

84
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,400
further into this email I bet we are

85
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:01,229
going to get some hints and some clues

86
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,930
and maybe some tips as to what went

87
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:06,688
wrong the message continues and it goes

88
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,280
just like this some background on the

89
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:10,620
plants that's exactly what we need

90
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,780
I had a sulphur burner start fire on

91
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,359
week one into flower well that is a good

92
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,459
hint of what went wrong in here only a

93
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:20,699
few big leaves dried out and died the

94
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,759
canopy is 12 to 16 to 16 inches away

95
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:26,579
from the light I'm using a 1000 watt HPS

96
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,578
the room temps got into the 90s early

97
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:32,400
into flower as I am running co2 in late

98
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,010
flower 78 I think he's saying it was 78

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,510
degrees in late flower he wraps up the

100
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:38,578
email by wishing me good luck and an

101
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:40,590
event and then he says follow my grow he

102
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:44,489
gives us his Instagram name he is

103
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,169
Gallatin Gardens it's G ALL atin Gardens

104
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,180
and then he says thanks and signs his

105
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,849
name hey thank you for the great email

106
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,219
Gallatin Gardens from Instagram let's

107
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:54,750
talk a little bit about why your plant

108
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,060
may have finished itself a little bit

109
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,489
early the first thing I want to touch on

110
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,019
again is the goal is ripe trichomes and

111
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,310
you said those plants are still pushing

112
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,408
that doesn't matter if the buds are

113
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,840
still swelling if those trichomes are

114
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:08,548
done if you've got 20 to 30% amber

115
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,560
trichomes it is probably time to harvest

116
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,299
they're going to quickly be 50 to 60

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,310
percent amber trichomes on that plant

118
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,108
and it will not be as desirable you will

119
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,060
miss your opportunity so let's talk

120
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,250
about reasons why this may have happened

121
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,658
that sulfur burner you talked about in

122
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,968
week one that did not help that is

123
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:25,528
probably not a major contributing factor

124
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:26,939
because it happened so early but it

125
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:28,920
certainly did not help it was

126
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,379
not your friend the next thing I would

127
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,699
think about is it probably got kind of

128
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,129
warm in there you said the temps got

129
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,740
into the 90s early in Flour that

130
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:39,750
probably wasn't helpful either you say

131
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,550
we're running co2 yeah you can go a

132
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,920
little hotter but you also had the

133
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,350
lights 12 to 16 inches away I don't know

134
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,780
if you have a glass between the bulbs

135
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,100
and the plant a lot of reflectors have

136
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,329
glass in the middle there and they are

137
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,070
air-cooled so that you're getting that

138
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:55,050
heat away I don't know your heat

139
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,939
situation it kind of sounds like maybe

140
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,040
those plants got a little bit too hot

141
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,870
perhaps you had the light too close I

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,730
don't know I'm not able to stick my hand

143
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,530
in there and feel what those plants feel

144
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,330
like so I don't know you guys don't be

145
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:07,949
afraid to put your hand around your

146
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:09,719
plants maybe wear a glove when you do it

147
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,610
so you don't get all sticky but just

148
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,170
grab a plant see what it feels like you

149
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,550
can touch it as your mom when you're a

150
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,689
little kid your mom ever touch reach

151
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,949
down and just touch your face and go

152
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:18,660
you're cold you need a jacket you're

153
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,069
like what the [ __ ] I know when I'm cold

154
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,420
those plants can't tell you when they're

155
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,889
cold you got to grab them you could

156
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,120
touch them you can feel them you can see

157
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,979
them if you're an experienced grower you

158
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,449
can see it if not touch them see how

159
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,950
they feel if they feel cold they are

160
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,019
cold you need to heat up the room a

161
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:32,579
little bit more you can do the same with

162
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,539
warm plants remember when your mom used

163
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,129
to reach down and touch your forehead

164
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,750
and say you don't have a fever you need

165
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:38,069
to go to school you can tell the same

166
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,810
about the plants reach down and touch

167
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,240
them do they feel warm do they feel cold

168
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,339
they may be nice and warm where the

169
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,900
leaves getting taco shaped was there any

170
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,668
bleaching to the tips of these plants

171
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:49,289
I'd like to know a few more things and

172
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:50,639
we could help you dial in exactly what

173
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,650
made these plants speed up but I'm

174
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,599
thinking they got a little bit hot they

175
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:56,668
were too close to the light that sulfur

176
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,500
burner certainly was not your friend and

177
00:05:56,668 --> 00:06:00,299
I'm assuming that since you had a little

178
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,740
bit of a heat issue and these plants

179
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,280
were probably too close to the light

180
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,960
there was probably a poor VPD throughout

181
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,059
the grow cycle the vapor pressure

182
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,250
deficit was probably not ideal for these

183
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,230
plants which will increase the ripening

184
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,569
time that is a stress a little bit of

185
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,879
stress may increase ripening times in

186
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,980
some plants also I'm going to assume

187
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,230
that there were swings in your day and

188
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,629
night conditions since you had such a

189
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,220
high daytime temperature I'm assuming

190
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,290
that your nighttime temperature probably

191
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,390
dropped fairly low and you are having a

192
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,430
large swing that may have encouraged

193
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,250
your plants to speed up a little bit and

194
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,769
finish sooner than you expect it I think

195
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,660
the co2 probably helped them speed up a

196
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,248
little bit as well it is possible that

197
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,199
one

198
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:44,239
your nutrients made these plants finish

199
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,459
a little bit early I'm not sure what you

200
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:48,828
fed them again I am assuming on the

201
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:51,199
vapor pressure deficit situation and

202
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:53,149
your diurnal swings I don't know what

203
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,009
the environment in your room was like I

204
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:56,629
don't know but I'm assuming that since

205
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,919
you had high temperatures and you had

206
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:59,869
issues before that you're probably

207
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,998
having other environmental issues and

208
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:04,099
those may be contributing factors to why

209
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:06,039
your plants are finishing a little bit

210
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:08,658
earlier than anticipated

211
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,699
now here is my main question that I

212
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:13,188
probably should have asked very first

213
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:15,919
why do you feel like the plants are

214
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:18,409
finishing a week ahead of schedule what

215
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,808
gave you that schedule did the seeds

216
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:22,428
come with a thing that says these plants

217
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:23,899
finish in eight to nine weeks and you

218
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:25,518
think they're eight to nine weeks in and

219
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:27,439
it's time to cut them did your friend

220
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,588
say hey I ran this clone in my room and

221
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,360
it takes exactly 63 days I want to kind

222
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:34,428
of know what gave you the idea that

223
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,199
these plants have the flowering time you

224
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:37,998
think they have are you experienced with

225
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,069
them have you ran them before if you

226
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,709
haven't ran them at least two times

227
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,959
before you don't know him well enough to

228
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:46,038
say that they are behind schedule

229
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,569
sometimes they change with the very

230
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:49,428
slightest changes in your environment

231
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,979
with the very slightest changes in your

232
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:53,598
feed so I'm very curious what gives you

233
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:55,639
the idea that these plants should be

234
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,009
done in the specific timeframe in which

235
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,299
you have decided I'm not doubting your

236
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,218
grow knowledge I'm not doubting your

237
00:07:59,298 --> 00:08:03,468
skill I just wonder where this number

238
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:04,998
came from now if that number came from a

239
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:06,949
seed pack and this is your first run

240
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:08,719
you've got to be more flexible you've

241
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,249
got to let the plants do their thing and

242
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:11,658
again I'm not second-guessing you're

243
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,249
growing these are all hypotheticals so

244
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,598
if you've got it from seed you need to

245
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:14,989
let it go long enough to see what it

246
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:16,368
does

247
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:19,008
don't worry about what the number on the

248
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:20,929
package says that is the ideal time

249
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,338
you're going to get outliers that take

250
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:24,109
longer you're going to get outliers that

251
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:26,088
finish sooner so if it's from a seed

252
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,218
pack you've got to be a little more

253
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:30,288
flexible with your time frames

254
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:31,759
if the clone came from a friend and your

255
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:34,578
friend said that it takes a certain

256
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,829
amount of time who knows if your friend

257
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:39,258
is a good judge of ripeness who knows

258
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:41,208
what type of environment your friend was

259
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:43,038
using maybe he was running an LED you're

260
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,388
running an HPS maybe he was feeding a

261
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,799
botanic hare and you're feeding it

262
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:47,839
whatever I don't want to assume what

263
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,578
you're feeding but maybe a lot of things

264
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,529
could have been different and a few

265
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:53,989
different things can make the plants

266
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:55,519
finish a week earlier or a week

267
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,580
later is depending on what you're doing

268
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,769
in the grow certain stresses can speed

269
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,170
up ripeness some stresses can slow down

270
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:05,329
ripeness some environmental factors will

271
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:06,889
make the trichomes ripen more early some

272
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,320
environmental factors will make the

273
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:10,879
trichomes ripen later I don't know what

274
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,680
happened in your grow room but it sounds

275
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,169
like you had quite a few stresses and

276
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:17,389
they probably contributed each and every

277
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:19,069
one of them contributed a small bit to

278
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,470
these plants finishing sooner than you

279
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,660
may have anticipated again I don't know

280
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,070
how you have decided that these plants

281
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:27,110
should be done by now maybe you've grown

282
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,660
them 20 times and you know I don't know

283
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,759
what your situation is but all of these

284
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:33,740
small stressors seem to have added up to

285
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,080
making these plants finish earlier than

286
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,810
you think they should have finished I'm

287
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,850
going to say they are possibly in panic

288
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:42,619
mode they know that they are getting

289
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,509
beat up they know that they have had a

290
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,389
lot of problems and they're just looking

291
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:49,309
for time to clock out there really just

292
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:50,689
done like is it done yet they're just

293
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:52,458
ready to clock out and go home

294
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,440
smoke a joint like we talked about in a

295
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,000
previous episode so they're finishing up

296
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,930
their lifecycle and they're just

297
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,370
wrapping it up

298
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,139
there's ripening up so that you'll cut

299
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,120
them down like hey I'm done just shot me

300
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:03,620
down dude no another thing we should

301
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,200
consider that I just thought about is

302
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,959
foliar sprays have you sprayed these

303
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,000
plants with anything foliar sprays can

304
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,739
mess up your trichomes foliar sprays can

305
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,799
mess up everything if you do it too late

306
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,570
and flower so did you follow your spray

307
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,370
also you say that you had that sulfur

308
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,709
burner catch on fire early and flower

309
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,240
how late into flower did you run that

310
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:25,639
Seoul for a burner did you keep that

311
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,009
going into week six into week seven that

312
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:30,439
also could have done damage and sped up

313
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:32,208
the ripening of your trichomes another

314
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,630
thing that may have sped up the ripening

315
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:38,000
of these plants is a reduction in light

316
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:39,620
did these plants start getting less

317
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,419
light than what they were used to a

318
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,220
light reduction could speed up the

319
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:44,838
plants the plants think that the end of

320
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,550
season is coming and they will speed up

321
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,079
a little more quickly if I've got a

322
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:50,208
plant that won't finish in the amount of

323
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,949
time I want it to finish sometimes I

324
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:55,278
will reduce the light so I'll go from 12

325
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:57,770
12 I'll start off with 11 on and 13 of

326
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,899
dark and then sometimes I'll go like 10

327
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,939
hours on and 14 hours of darkness and

328
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:04,370
then really late in flower with some

329
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,770
really picky cultivars I will have as

330
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,370
little as 8 hours of daylight and 16

331
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,980
hours of

332
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,778
darkness each cycle and that really

333
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,300
speeds up those plants of finishing so

334
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:17,809
did these plants get a light reduction

335
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:20,028
did a bulb go out is a bulb going out is

336
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:21,500
it time to replace a bulb is there an

337
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:23,750
issue in the grow room to where this

338
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,970
plant got moved away also I'm very

339
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,370
curious where are you checking the

340
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,230
trichomes on the plant trichomes on the

341
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,610
top of the plant trichomes in the middle

342
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,680
of the plant and the trichomes on the

343
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,870
bottom are going to be ripe at different

344
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,969
times so you may need to check the plant

345
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,230
in different areas I am really not

346
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,750
trying to sound like I'm second-guessing

347
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,580
you I am just simply listing things that

348
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,620
I think may apply to your situation that

349
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,420
you may have not noticed I am NOT trying

350
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,070
to doubt your ability or your skills as

351
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:50,750
a grower you reached out the question

352
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,120
I'm just doing my best to cover all of

353
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,429
the options so my main assumption is

354
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,190
that your plants finished earlier due to

355
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:59,870
stress that stress was probably from the

356
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,420
heat probably from the sulfur burner

357
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,159
that co2 probably did speed them up just

358
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:05,870
a little bit perhaps you fed them

359
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,929
something that made them ripen a little

360
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,120
more early than you had anticipated also

361
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,708
I wonder where you got this arbitrary

362
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,089
number of when they are supposed to be

363
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,769
finished again I don't know if you've

364
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:17,420
grown these plants 20 times I don't know

365
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,129
if it is your second run I don't know

366
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:20,539
where you got this number maybe you need

367
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:22,159
to adjust that number

368
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,569
maybe the plants were sprayed with

369
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,909
something that would have damaged the

370
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,589
trichomes then my last suggestion

371
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:29,509
suspicion that I would like to talk

372
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,339
about is perhaps those lights are going

373
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:33,200
out maybe one of your bulbs is bad

374
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,150
perhaps one of your ballasts is bad

375
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,920
maybe you're running a thousand watt and

376
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,659
you're not getting a thousand Watts

377
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,338
coming out so maybe you need to invest

378
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,958
in a lumen meter maybe you need to

379
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:43,459
borrow one from the gross store maybe

380
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,889
you just need to replace that bulb and

381
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,958
see if that was the issue that is just a

382
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:49,730
suggestion again I am NOT in your Gro

383
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,859
I've only got the information that you

384
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,050
sent me you sent a lot of great

385
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,149
