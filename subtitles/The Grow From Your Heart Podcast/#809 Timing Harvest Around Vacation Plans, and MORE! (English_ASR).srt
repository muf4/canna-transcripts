been great it goes on though it's says

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,480
I've been an avid listener for about a

62
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,039
year now and I finally have a question I

63
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,219
feel would be worth an email and maybe

64
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,659
even to read on the show I thought this

65
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,520
was a great question and a timely

66
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,620
question as well also I should mention

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,060
that part of the font got cut off so

68
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,039
some of the words here at the end of the

69
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,378
sentence are gone I don't know why my

70
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,878
printer made new margins uh technology

71
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:40,259
got me this time I'm just going to blame

72
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,598
it on the printer but I'm going to do my

73
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,878
best to read the message it says shout

74

cocktail you've got quite a beautiful

103
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:44,818
variety there says I'm currently 41 days

104
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,459
into flower this was received quite a

105
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:48,839
while ago uh you were PR probably by the

106
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,180
time I'm reading this by the time this

107
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,400
comes out you will be about 55 days into

108
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,260
flower I estimate by the time this comes

109
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,819
out I'm sorry I was a little behind on

110
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,798
the recording schedule already had shows

111
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:00,658
planned and scheduled and recorded had

112
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,700
to catch up I apologize you guys if I

113
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,500

114
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,479
try to do as many as I can in a show and

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,158
I'm recording ahead so your message may

116
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,199
have already been read just not put on

117
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,878
the podcast yet may not have put it up

118
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,919
on YouTube stay tuned to let me get back

119
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,359
into this message this is going to be a

120
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,939
long question if I don't get focused

121
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,459
here it says um so they're about days

122
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,319
she's about day 55-ish into flower

123
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,780
it says I attend the garden while I'm

124
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,978
away so that leaves me with limited oh

125
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,198
let's see

126
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:29,399
um so there is part of this cut off some

127
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,960
part of the sentence is cut off here

128
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,478
because I said my printer went wonky on

129
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,279
me uh that's a good excuse I do know the

130
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:38,579
situation here I'm sure it says I plan

131
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,198
to go on vacation uh and I have no one

132
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,359
to attend the garden while I'm away so

133
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,560
that leaves me with limited options I'm

134
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,840
sure that's what it's meant to say just

135
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,978
based on a conversation we had I says I

136
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,779
would hate to cut the girls down early

137
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:51,659
but I would also hate to have issues

138
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:53,939
while I'm gone uh then it's cut off but

139
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,500
then it goes on with should I and this

140
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,180
is where they present a few options I

141
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,978
love this when somebody has already done

142
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,439
some thinking put some thought into it

143
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,758
they just want a little bit of

144
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,199
affirmation encouragement reinforcement

145
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,300
on what they're thinking this is a

146
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,740
beautiful strategy uh so the options

147
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,259
that our friend has come up with on

148
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,780
their own says uh should I harvest early

149
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,460
and turn my bedroom into a moist fridge

150
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,198
for two weeks now if you're going on

151
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,299
vacation very soon I don't know exactly

152
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,240
when you're leaving but I remember based

153
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,680
on our conversation on Discord that I

154
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,360
was thinking this was not the option

155
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,459
You're Gonna Leave way too early if you

156
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,319
chop them down before you leave uh

157
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,758
you're just cutting down plants way too

158
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,978
early I would rather do one of the

159
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,660
options I see later on the list because

160
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:35,459
that way we do at least get an option

161
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,680
for Success at this way when we cut them

162
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:40,019
down this early you've still got

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,519
somewhere between 12 and 20 days to go

164
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,899
by the time this episode comes out and

165
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,719
you're going to be on vacation when that

166
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,859
happens uh these plants will not if you

167
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,660
cut them down early they will not be

168
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,939
worth a [ __ ] in my opinion and I would

169
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,100
rather uh you've already wasted veg time

170
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,860
and you've wasted 55 days of flowering

171
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,960
time that means electricity nutrients

172
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,699
also possibly felonies based on your

173
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,279
location I'm not sure exactly where you

174
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,660
are in the rules there but

175
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,519
um you've already gotten so far let's

176
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,979
not cut it down early let's go too long

177
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,258
if that is our option it says I can also

178
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:11,699
even Harvest earlier and try to dry it

179
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,740
before I leave no that's cutting you

180
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,139
down like another 10 to 14 days even

181
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,180
earlier I still don't like that you're

182
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,519
going the wrong direction I like this

183
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,000
option that you came up with uh this one

184
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:26,038
says should I water the day before I

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,720
leave yes this is what I would do when I

186
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,300
read this I got got excited this is how

187
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,340
I would do it water the day before I

188
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,620
leave let the 1212 light schedule

189
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:36,538
continue for a week then have them

190
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,240
scheduled to turn off and start the

191
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:40,500
plants drying and darkness then of

192
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,819
course it does cut off part of the damn

193
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,978
sentence here but I understand what

194
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,720
you're going to do let the plants dry

195
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:48,959
whole Darkness for two weeks while I'm

196
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,680
gone I had 60 uh per 60 relative

197
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:55,379
humidity and 60 degrees Fahrenheit

198
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,939
um that is that is probably what I would

199
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:58,500
do I would even this may sound weird

200
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,060
because I preach a lot of opposite stuff

201
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,459
but to make this crop even more

202
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,019
successful to stretch out your watering

203
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,279
time and prolong the life of these

204
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,219
plants while you're gone and make this

205
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,019
plan work I would water them the day

206
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,639
before you're like right as late as

207
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,198
possible before you leave the very last

208
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,900
option

209
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,580
um I like to put larger saucers under my

210
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,679
plants if I'm growing in a three gallon

211
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,120
pot I'll put a five gallon like a saucer

212
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,340
that would normally go under a five

213
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,019
gallon pot I'll water the plant heavily

214
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,359
then I will over water it until that

215
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,579
saucer is completely full so I've got

216
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,620
the the soil or medium is completely

217
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,359
saturated then I've got that tray

218
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,160
underneath it which is also saturated

219
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,598
that'll just keep waking up into that

220
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,639
plant you'll get a couple of days out of

221
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,740
it that way depending on the size of the

222
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,939
original pot and the size of the backup

223
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,319
water people are going to say you're

224
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,538
going to over water and drown the plant

225
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,800
not if they're big established plants if

226
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:48,120
they're big enough this won't be a

227
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,620
problem just a little bit of them is

228
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,598
down in the water the top part will dry

229
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,120
up they'll get plenty of oxygen this

230
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,918
will work so I would water them right

231
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,819
before you leave over water them a

232
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,339
little bit

233
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,020
put those big saucers under there you've

234
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:04,318
got the right idea flip the lights to 12

235
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:07,620
12 but I would put them on 11 hours on

236
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,819
and 13 hours off I know I preach a lot

237
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,340
of different things but in this

238
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,080
situation this is going to be ideal what

239
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,060
this will do is this will extend your

240
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,038
water that is in those pots by just

241
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,538
maybe even a day maybe two days but

242
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,818
that's what you want you want that water

243
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:22,560
there as long as you can get it at this

244
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,319
point that's going to buy you over six

245
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,699
days that's six days less light that

246
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,460
you're getting to these plants that is

247
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,840
going to create humidity and heat in

248
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,120
that room it's going to make the plants

249
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,158
uh drink more the water is going to go

250
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,560
away is what I'm saying so maybe

251
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,838
consider going to 11 hours on and 13

252
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,179
hours off to extend that water in the

253
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,880
room DJ Short has taught us to turn the

254
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,620
lights to 11 13 a long time ago it seems

255
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,299
to work for a lot of plants I do preach

256
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,639
an opposite technique but guess what

257
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:53,579
both do have their pros and cons this

258
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,620
time it is a pro for the 11 13. so this

259
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,480
does go on it says uh water them the day

260
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,519
before I leave uh flip the light

261
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,680
schedule to 11 13 is what I would do

262
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,600
then yeah then you're going to have at

263
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,219
least a week of them getting watered

264
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,740
four or five maybe six or seven days

265
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,720
depending on again I don't know the uh

266
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,039
the conditions in the room the amount of

267
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,440
soil the size of pots but you're gonna

268
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,659
get four maybe five maybe seven maybe

269
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,339
ten days worth of water out of this then

270
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:18,719
while you're gone the plants will run

271
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:22,080
out of water then they're going to

272
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,420
slowly die on the stick uh but that that

273
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,500
could be probably your best option right

274
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,319
because you're not going to cut them

275
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,639
down early they will finish uh it does

276
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,019
sound sketchy the leaves are gonna look

277
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,278
like [ __ ] when you come back the plants

278
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,080
are going to look a little bit funky but

279
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,299
you're not growing for leaves we're

280
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,160
growing for harvestable smokable buds

281
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,419
the buds are going to be great this is

282
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,219
what we're gonna do anyway we're gonna

283
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,778
let the plant grow we were going to cut

284
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,920
it down and hang it upside down until it

285
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:45,778
died we're just not going to cut it

286
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,939
we're going to let it do I've done this

287
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:49,139
a long time ago I called it stick curing

288
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,779
I felt like I may have invented

289
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,639
something new honestly I just I had I

290
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:56,338
poorly timed some [ __ ] and I didn't have

291
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,720
a dry room so I let this room flower and

292
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,920
then there's other other [ __ ] in my dry

293
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,600
and cure room and I was like well I'll

294
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,759
just let that plant [ __ ] stand there

295
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,980
and die it'll die eventually and it did

296
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,299
the plant definitely did die and then I

297
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,980
just went and cut the leaves off of it

298
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:10,019
and we smoked it we dried it cured it

299
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,639
and smoked it I called it stick curing

300
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,799
it already started drying on the stick

301
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,958
it tasted really good that weed got us

302
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,000
really really high it was quality weed

303
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,338
for what it had to go through I would

304
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,860
rather you have this weed that goes a

305
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,480
little bit long and gets dry and kind of

306
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,399
falls apart when the leaves already fall

307
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,899
off of it by the time you get home then

308
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,000
cut down something that's just fluffy

309
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,639
dandelions not even fully formed a buds

310
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,159
worth looking at worth smoking this I

311
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,019
think this would be a better option so

312
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,000
um yeah steak cure it water that [ __ ]

313
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,440
right before you leave let it grow it'll

314
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,399
die while you're gone depending on how

315
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,660
long you're gone I wouldn't imagine

316
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,639
you're gone for more than two weeks

317
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:47,159
maybe 17 days is what most people go out

318
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,199
of town for uh you'll be right back

319
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,519
so yeah I think it'll dry up it'll start

320
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,620
to get a little bit crispy by the time

321
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,299
you're gone when you come home leave it

322
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,278
standing and pull off all the leaves any

323
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,019
leaf that is still on there just take it

324
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:59,759
you might want to put some supports in

325
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,379
it if you can get some steaks some

326
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,360
steaks because as they die they may

327
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,919
start tipping over so stake them up if

328
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,800
you can that may be your best bet there

329
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,778
give them some support but uh water the

330
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,299
[ __ ] out of them go out of town set your

331
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:14,100
conditions to go off in about a week let

332
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:15,599
that light go off let it cook for a week

333
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,820
with no lights if you can put a camera

334
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,680
in there and watch it uh that wouldn't

335
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,480
be a bad idea you can get a cheap camera

336
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,338
on Amazon that you can open up on your

337
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,440
phone while you're in Italy and you can

338
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,300
look and see like are the plants are the

339
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,040
leaves up are they down are they all the

340
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,899
way down are they yellow are they Brown

341
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,819
are they falling off then you can decide

342
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,559
how to adjust that timer I don't know

343
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,060
what your timer is on I've got timers

344
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,458
that attach to my phone and all kinds of

345
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:40,259
other [ __ ] so maybe you can adjust to

346
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,059
that but you've got the right idea water

347
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:44,458
them if I can go home when you get back

348
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,919
pull off all those leaves then chop them

349
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,899
then dry and cure and harvest as usual

350
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,299
the be a little bit dry already you're

351
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,039
getting a little bit ahead of yourself

352
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:55,019
especially in that 60 60 room that is

353
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,360
going to be great so there are questions

354
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,459
with the question it says is it possible

355
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,320
to trigger self-seeding if the whole

356
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,719
plant is left in darkness for too long

357
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,180
anything is possible but I don't think

358
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,680
it's going to happen within that week if

359
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:09,179
it does happen the seed won't have any

360
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,458
time to form you're going to cut it down

361
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,019
before that seed even does anything it

362
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:15,059
takes six to eight weeks to make a seed

363
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,320
fully form so with just a few days

364
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,778
you're not going to have much there to

365
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,480
worry about I doubt that it will happen

366
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:23,458
that is more likely more common if you

367
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,320
were to leave the pla the light on too

368
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,299
long and let it flower too long I think

369
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,860
the dark will kind of actually may help

370
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,838
you prevent that from happening so that

371
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,339
may be a good thing but like I said

372
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,079
anything is [ __ ] possible these are

373
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,880
cannabis plants and nature does find a

374
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,859
way is another thing I always say but I

375
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,299
think uh I think you'll be just fine

376
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,879
there something else I haven't thought

377
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,319
of no I think uh I think you've got the

378
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,700
right idea I've met you you're a very

379
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,160
intelligent person you seem to think

380
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,899
things through you've got the right idea

381
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,939
the team give you a lot of feedback and

382
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,320

383
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,940

384
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,260

that Golden Goat Vigor in there so that

474
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,500

475
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,479

00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,299
so yes there was a lot of potential for

486
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:17,339
Gigantic seeds in there

487
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,899
um on the opposite anything I cross with

488
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,120
the Durban Poison makes little tiny

489
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,620
seeds most of the time so uh that's just

490
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,820
a variation that's going on there but

491
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,399
sometimes when I do the Durban Poison

492
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,899
outside I get bigger seeds it's just the

493
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,360
way that science and nature want to play

494
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,220
together there's more it says I can't

495
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,019
freaking wait to pop these for the next

496
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,300
grow bro I hope to see pictures if you

497
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:38,578
get a winner uh maybe name it something

498
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:40,019
cool and send me a [ __ ] cut bro what

499
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:41,159
was the bad Ninja Turtle remember there

500
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,659
was a ninja turtle and they made one

501
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,159
that was like their cousin and he came

502
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:45,360
out with fangs and [ __ ] he was still a

503
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,000
turtle but he was kind of wild there's

504
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,500
like a snapping turtle name it that okay

505
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,720
um it goes on it says for size

506
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,458
comparison that is a shredder seed next

507
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,839
to one of the dinosaur eggs yeah they

508
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,359
were giant bro I will give you credit

509
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,339
those were big seeds I said I can't wait

510
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,680
to see what Sprouts I'll also be running

511
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,779
some table seeds as well hope you had a

512
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,578
great fourth bro my fourth was excellent

513
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:08,039
It's good to hear from you I hope to see

514
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:10,078
pictures of the table seeds people are

515
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,178
going what are table seeds bro

516
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,578
if you have not been following along for

517
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,919
a long time I do put out a product I

518
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:18,298
call table seeds sometimes I sit at my

519
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,799
desk sometimes I sit right here

520
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:21,959
sometimes I got another cozy location

521
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:24,058
with a chair where I will package up

522
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,919
seeds all day I'll spend all day just

523
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:27,899
getting a jar of seeds or a bag of seeds

524
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,679
or a bin of seeds and putting those into

525
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,120
packs of either 5 6 12 50 depends on

526
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,400
what I'm doing right but I just package

527
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,139
up seeds all day sometimes when I'm done

528
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,059
I will discover that maybe like right

529
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,160
along here along the iPad stand or maybe

530
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,660
along here by the microphone stand I

531
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,919
dropped a few seeds along the way I

532
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,538
don't know what they are because I may

533
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,640
have worked with multiple batches of

534
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:49,679
seeds throughout the day and I do not

535
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,140
have confidence to say that these seeds

536
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,759
are whatever seeds they are I don't want

537
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,080
to mislabel them sell them to you and

538
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,419
you get something that is not what you

539
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,279
purchased I put them in a bin and I call

540
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,660
them table seeds just seeds that I

541
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,759
picked up off the table that I'm not

542
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,380
sure what they are then I package them

543
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,119
up in just different batches depending

544
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,400
on what I'm in the mood for sometimes

545
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,019
it's 10 packs sometimes it's 15 or 20.

546
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,179
throw a few in a bag and then we sell

547
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:14,220
them on the website for a very low price

548
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,500
so that everybody can get some seeds you

549
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,200
don't know what they are but it could be

550
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,779
anything from the irie genetics lineup

551
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,460
it could be it could be orange gasm it

552
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:26,279
could be lemon Jeffrey it could also be

553
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:30,240
Mach 1 to a rise it could be Jack the

554
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:31,798
Ripper to a rise it could be a ryze f2s

555
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,779
it could be anything that I've had on

556
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,220
the table within the past amount of time

557
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,440
which I was playing with seeds it could

558
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,880
be unreleased [ __ ] it could be uh

559
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,259
pre-release of things that will come out

560
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,000
in the future but you never know what's

561
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:43,679
in that bag because it's just [ __ ] that

562
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,798
I scooped up off the table and I don't

563
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,600
uh I don't scoop them up like these from

564
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,700
today's batch go into a pack of table

565
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,259
seats they go all into one jar I've got

566
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,120
one little section of table seeds I

567
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,740
shake it up we mix it it's like a big

568
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:57,839
bag of uh it's like a jelly bean bag

569
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,640
there you never know what flavor you're

570
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,279
going to pull out when you grow those

571
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,840
bro do let me see let me make sure that

572
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:05,339
I've recovered all I read all of this

573
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,439
that I've covered all of this question

574
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,240
uh the reason I feel like they are so

575
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,519
big is what we're going to call hybrid

576
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,140
Vigor I bet those seeds are going to be

577
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,359
vigorous they're going to make giant

578
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,340
plants to grow super fast and I'm sure

579
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,319
you're going to have some crazy amazing

580
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:21,480
Terps come out of that the blueberry

581
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:24,538
cookies makes this like Tangy fruity

582
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,519
sour funky terp the Platinum Tangy of

583
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,960
course is oranges and Funk and then you

584
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,579
got that Golden Goat in there to give

585
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,319
you that tropical stuff all of those

586
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,480
plants are vigorous and super potent

587
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,399
that plant's Gonna Be A Winner bro good

588
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,380
idea to cross that I hope it goes Super

589
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,900

607
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,679
up your seeds this question goes a

608
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:19,740
little bit like this it says in regards

609
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,780
to cocoa and perlite mix versus a peat

610
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,700
and perlite mix what is the main

611
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:26,038
difference there is a major difference

612
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,380
there that I can notice right away if

613
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:30,000
you were to grab a scoop of let's start

614
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,100
with the peat if you just reached into a

615
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,579
bag and grabbed a scoop of peat that is

616
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:37,199
going to be a spongy gooey moist organic

617
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:39,720
feeling substance in there kind of like

618
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,700
you got some uh some Earth some foliage

619
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,500
some uh it's kind of like grabbing a

620
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,600
sponge it's got that spongy texture to

621
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,819
it when you squeeze it it'll fluff back

622
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,759
up it'll squeeze it's soft it's earthy

623
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:52,319
it's got that organic feel to it perlite

624
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,839
on the other hand is like grabbing a

625
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,240
glass uh grabbing a handful of small

626
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,519
glass rocks it's really light for its

627
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,980
volume so it takes up a lot of space and

628
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,259
provides air the peat will suck up water

629
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,240
and hold in water and not provide any

630
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,220
air space the reason I use the perlite

631
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,200
and a cocoa mix is to put some

632
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,298
separation in the cocoa fibers there's

633
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,179
not enough oxygen in there so I'll put

634
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:17,279
at least 30 percent perlite in a mix of

635
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:19,320
cocoa to make it fluffier make it a

636
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,940
little bit more oxygenated that way I

637
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,139
feel like when I water all that cocoa

638
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,120
it's going to compress it's going to

639
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,980
compact all of the oxygen gets pushed

640
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,019
out of the top The Roots get squished in

641
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,298
there I feel like those roots strive

642
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,220
more strongly if I put some perlite in

643
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:34,319
there and allow just less crushing space

644
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,360
and put some air in there I think that

645
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,279
that's what works best for me so that's

646
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:41,339
what I do that's the main difference in

647
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:43,500
a perlite NP mix it goes on it says can

648
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:45,298
you use microbes in both yes absolutely

649
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,579
you definitely can and should use

650
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:49,019
microbes in both of those mixes all

651
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:51,359
right the last part of this question

652
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,418
does say are there any pros and cons

653
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,099
versus cocoa versus Pete

654
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,780
um yeah I think if you do the peat in

655
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:59,699
there it's a different texture different

656
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,859
consistency than the cocoa it holds

657
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,419
water uh differently it's got a

658
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:04,979
different porosity is that even a word

659
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:07,799
we're going to make that a word now ding

660
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,779
that's the word of the day but uh it

661
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:11,519
holds water so you're going to have in

662
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:13,319
consistent water spots you're going to

663
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,538
have some spots that are more dry some

664
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,279
that are more wet in your container and

665
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:19,200
I don't like that I'd rather have smooth

666
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,759
even consistency wet all the way down

667
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,558
this way drier up toward the top that's

668
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,900
just how it works that's what I'd rather

669
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,519
have other than pockets of pee over here

670
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,620
that are more wet than the cocoa that's

671
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,019
over here I just that's not what I would

672
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:33,538
prefer so the pros and cons are just

673
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:36,480
more consistent watering more consistent

674
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:39,058
uh watering inside the rhizosphere and

675
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,279
more consistent wet and dry times you're

676
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:43,259
going to get more dry back time with the

677
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,720
cocoa also I believe you get better

678
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,400
airflow and better root development if

679
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,440
you put a little bit of perlite in there

680
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,080
a minute ago I did say that I like to do

681
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,320
approximately 30 percent per light if I

682
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:58,079
had my way I would do probably somewhere

683
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,240
between 20 percent uh perlite and 10 to

684
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,339
15 personalite the bigger one the

685
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,900
chunkier one just to put some chunks in

686
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,639
there then we would do a whole bunch of

687
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,360
the cocoa I think that gives me about 70

688
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,820
to 65 percent cocoa left then while I'm

689
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,038
making that mix I would put a big scoop

690
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:16,079
of azos in there give myself some some

691
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,419
microbes to get started then we would

692
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,158
plant into that my dude Owen thank you
