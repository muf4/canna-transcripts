little assortment of apothecary stuff

31
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,460

32
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:05,308
Malibu Malibu pier cush talkin is harder

33
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,409

00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,919
so good it's pretty tasty better you're

38
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,710
all slow and mellow - I'm over here

39
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,079
dabbing the guava papaya live batter

40
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:25,408
from Green Dot labs it's a blend of

41
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:30,000
camphor and papaya the package says sour

42
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,770
fuel and soft fruits okay I'll agree

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,688
with that it's uh it's like a sour

44
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,368
fruity candy I don't know about the fuel

45
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:37,739
on there I don't really get the fuel

46
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:40,530
most of the time I agree but sour fruity

47
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,810
candies almost like a sour patch with

48
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,189
the powdery sugar on the outside where

49
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,810
it's real crispy he get the crumbly

50
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,688
sugar it's kind of got that kind of a

51
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,100
flavor in my opinion guava papaya live

52
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:52,949
batter loving it

53
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,239

YouTube also we have upgraded we are on

72
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,949
Spotify we approved this show to not

73
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,780
move we have added to Spotify I had a

74
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:38,639
couple people ask if I'm gonna Joe Rogan

75
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,020
them and if I'm going to disappear on

76
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,269
other platforms no we're going to

77
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,550
Spotify also because a lot of people

78
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,200
only listen on Spotify I'd like to

79
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,060
expand the podcast get it out there I

80
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,560
want everybody to be able to listen it

81
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,050
was silly to not have it on Spotify

82
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,629
there was a technical glitch it was not

83
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,640
allowing my service to work with Spotify

84
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:59,250
mine comes from my website I had to make

85
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,929
a correction I thought of a very easy

86
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,060
solution it took me a night of

87
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,860
brainstorming it actually took about six

88
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,449
dabs and then I went oh that's the

89
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,040
[ __ ] solution I did it and everything

90
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:11,518
seems to be working so we were on

91
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,199
Spotify from 500 on up is on Spotify

92
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,000
some of the episodes won't load into

93
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,159
Spotify I do not know why they have

94
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,069
rejected them the files are the correct

95
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,379
files the shows are good shows I don't

96
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,030
know if it's copyright and music that I

97
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,930
have selected I don't know why but a few

98
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,939
of them got rejected

99
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,590
Spotify simply won't accept them to the

100
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,419
feed they won't play so I apologise if

101
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,310
you're missing if you want Spotify the

102
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,919
solution is to come over to YouTube and

103
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,629
check us out on the YouTube channel um

104
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,699

120
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,390
rejecting some of my episodes because of

121
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:17,728

smoothly I've talked about all the gear

212
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,379
that I've got going on we bought I

213
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,879
replaced the MacBook with patreon

214
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,620
contributions what time the MacBook

215
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,079
started sparking and making [ __ ]

216
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,670
smoke so I replaced it with patreon

217
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,949
contribution so that's what the patreon

218
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,840
money does i pays for the web connection

219
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,279
it pays for the website i covers quite a

220
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,409
few things there's we've got to back up

221
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,059
fun in case anything goes wrong or if we

222
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:33,480
try to do some upgrades so thank you

223
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,829
guys you really are helping out next

224
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,350
purchase here is gonna get me out of the

225
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:39,689
void so if you don't like the black void

226
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,430
behind me chip in if you do comment

227
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,930
that's pretty good they won't know what

228
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:47,280
you mean until a couple episodes away

229
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,629
but get Mike out of the void yep we

230
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,629
covered all the stuff I think all the

231
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:54,980
important business stuff patreon killed

232
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:59,490
it I think it is time to work into the

233
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:01,680
the the email portion of the show yeah

234
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,750
yeah I was gonna say they did very well

235
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,579
the folks did very well on my patreon

236
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,800
this month we're almost to another level

237
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:09,719
my number thinks my brain thinks in

238
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,090
number of levels and increments are you

239
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,680
guys if we get to the next level I would

240
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:19,500
consider another podcast episode maybe

241
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,759
at least one more every other week but

242
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,879
if we could get it to the level I'm

243
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,529
thinking more content more content I

244
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,899
would add another episode I think or I

245
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:30,119
don't give me faster yeah I would have

246
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,709
to focus less on other things and I

247
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,810
would just be able to fill out free up

248
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:35,460
some more time for more podcast content

249
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,049
so if we get up to that next level I may

250
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,979
do another episode and Mike was like bro

251
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,269
what are you gonna do for another

252
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,620
episode every week where are you gonna

253
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,870
come up with content I said have you

254
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,320

stack of emails here in front of me the

266
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,350
first email on today's episode goes just

267
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,570
like this it is from somebody who called

268
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,070
themselves IRA vibes and it says hail up

269

Russ to Jeff I wanna thank you for the

270
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,940
great information I received from

271
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:21,039
listening to your podcast I've been

272
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,650
growing everything from the late 70s in

273
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,299
my homeland in Jamaica not just the holy

274
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,340
herb but the food that I eat

275
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,599
that's awesome big respect for that big

276
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,899
shout out to my friends on the island of

277
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,899
Jamaica it says the only difference is I

278
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:37,329
grow natural and no salts but now that I

279
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,669
have moved to the USA I find it hard to

280
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,740
do the same because the soil is not the

281
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:43,360
same here yeah we've we've kind of

282
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,399
destroyed the soil we don't have any an

283
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,779
agricultural mindset like in Jamaica and

284
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,129
Jamaica they're thinking about the

285
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,250
future all the time we're thinking about

286
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:53,049
right now and maybe tomorrow so the soil

287
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,169
has been kind of tore up here a little

288
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:57,549
bit it's all urban also notice the soil

289
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:59,500
is different can't grow the same so they

290
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:01,479
decided to grow outdoor and use cocoa

291
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,070
and canna newts but was not kidding I

292
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,500
would I know the plant could produce

293
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,660
wall oh I was growing in Jamaica

294
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,090
I was on a mission to get information

295
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:12,279
from the top readers and growers to see

296
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,649
what they were using I until I stumbled

297
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:18,309
across the DG see there we go so they

298
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,840

thanks for being an extremely positive

363
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,149

much appreciated hey thank you for

365
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:32,799
noticing that I try to stay upbeat um

366
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,029
man thank you it goes on to say I have a

367
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,578
few questions for you I recently

368
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:39,039
listened to episode 4 Oh for grow less

369
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:41,799
in part 4 I heard you talk about shine a

370
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,599
few times uh and I have questions about

371
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,389
the shine I'm wondering what weeks of

372
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,329
bloom you recommend using shine that is

373
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:51,459
a really good question shine is a

374
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:53,138
product from veg bloom it's a product

375
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,208
from they're called hydroponic research

376
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,649
is the name of the company I like the

377
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:59,229
product shine if you're growing and

378
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:01,448
hydroponics if you're growing in Coco

379
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:05,190
soilless mix I think shine is a great

380
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:07,809
product for adding bulk flavor density

381
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:11,110
trichomes it is a really good bloom

382
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:12,879
booster um it is kind of based on your

383
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,860
plants and your budget and the

384
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,328
availability of the product some people

385
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,269
have a harder time getting it based on

386
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:21,698
their location if it is in the budget

387
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:22,750
start it early if it is not in the

388
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:24,729
budget started

389
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,250
a bit later so if you can afford to use

390
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,500
it a week one or week two a flower do it

391
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,299
if it is more cost-effective for you to

392
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,009
wait two weeks start it at week three

393
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:35,049
but I'm sure you want it in there by

394
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:36,879
week three by day one of week three you

395
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:39,009
want to start putting it in there if not

396
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,720
you definitely need it by week four and

397
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:42,879
I would use it all the way through the

398
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,850
bloom phase especially the bulking weeks

399
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:48,970
like five six seven eight then I stopped

400
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,980
using it around flush in most cases

401
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,779
sometimes I'll use it for if I'm

402
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,690
flushing for fourteen days I'll use the

403
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,370
plus of the shot of the shine for about

404
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,410
a week of that because it's not gonna

405
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,029
build up in the plant it's gonna it's

406
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:02,319
gonna you're not gonna taste it it's not

407
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:03,759
gonna get stuck in there we're flushing

408
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,620
out mostly other things we still got

409
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,009
seven days to flush that out I think

410
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,070
it'll really bulk up so I use it early

411
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:13,629
week two if you can if you can use it a

412
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,950
week one use it a week one if you can't

413
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:16,360
I'm not saying you can't afford it but

414
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,800
it's an expensive product you've already

415
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,840
bought a lot of things maybe you don't

416
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:21,729
have it week one's a good idea week two

417
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,470
is great week three really get it in

418
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,720
there by week three week four you better

419
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,460
have it by now if you haven't gotten it

420
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,870
by week four you can still add it at

421
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,210
five and six but it would have been much

422
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,190
better if you did it earlier so that's

423
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,440
when I would start adding it this person

424
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,330
says oh you can use it can you use it to

425
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,940
help stop the initial stretch yes if you

426
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,710
do use it early use it before flower if

427
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,060
use it a few days before you go into

428
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,040
flower it will help slow down the

429
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:46,869
stretch that in a combination with

430
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,039
popping and twisting the branches that

431
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,839
will definitely help slow down the

432
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,990
stretch and give you big fatter plants

433
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,300
um it says I also heard you mention some

434
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,919
kind of enzyme what a kind of enzyme

435
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,838
would be good to add at the end with my

436
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,639
shine and then it says I'm using

437
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,380
advanced nutrients so what I need to use

438
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,519
since e-zyme as my enzyme that is a

439
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:07,990
really good question um just because you

440
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,759
were using the advanced nutrients

441
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,529
product line does not mean you need to

442
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,049
stick with their enzymes you can use

443
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:16,059
whatever enzyme product is going to work

444
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:19,899
with your nutrient regimen anything

445
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:21,939
since he's I'm slf 100 hydros I'm any of

446
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:23,079
that stuff is going to work for you the

447
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,670
thing you have to pay attention to

448
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,560
mostly when you're mixing nutrient

449
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:28,870
companies is if you're using something

450
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,039
like a base or a cal-mag or something

451
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,779
like that you don't want to use a base

452
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,639
nutrient that's got a bunch of nitrogen

453
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,230
but they also put some phosphorus and

454
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,429
potassium in there and then you use a

455
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,740
bloom booster from a nut

456
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:40,569
company it's got the potassium and

457
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,190
phosphorus but they also put nitrogen in

458
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,660
there just because in their recipe would

459
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,770
have worked but now you've got two

460
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:46,209
different companies with two different

461
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:48,250
recipes they had two different game

462
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,990
plans the quarterback threw the ball

463
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,820
they thought that in their game plan

464
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,230
that the [ __ ] runner who's the who

465
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,580
catches it the [ __ ] catcher what's

466
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,560
his name the wide receiver they thought

467
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,450
bad dude was gonna go out and left but

468
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,949
he's using a different company he went

469
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,540
out and right so nobody caught the ball

470
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,680
so now you got [ __ ] a dropped ball

471
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:04,539
and you don't wanna drop balls when

472
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:05,559
we're growing so I just think about if

473
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:07,000
you're using two different companies

474
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,759
that's when you have to pay attention to

475
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,799
blending products and product lines but

476
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,789
if you're just excuse the throat you

477
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,899
guys I'm talking about those dad's

478
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:16,120
really ER that's what did it

479
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:19,000
ah if you're using just enzymes I think

480
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,129
any enzyme will work I really like slf

481
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,850
100 it's a great product hi gross I'm is

482
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,679
a great product

483
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,028
since he's I'm is an okay product if

484
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,708
you're using the advanced and you want

485
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:29,588
to stick with a brand specific line go

486
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:32,199
for it but it is not necessary they said

487
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,640
what enzyme would be good to add any of

488
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,140
those would work for you it's a very

489
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,610
good idea to add those enzymes at the

490
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:38,080
end it helps clean stuff up it helps

491
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,139
break down anything that may be left in

492
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,690
there ah I'll repeat the three again slf

493
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:45,759
100 it's pricey but it's a good product

494
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,080
hi crews I'm it's pricey but it's a good

495
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,939
product but you're using advanced

496
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,670
nutrients that since e-zyme is probably

497
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,320
the most expensive enzyme out there so

498
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:54,039
those are three that are readily

499
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,959
available

500
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,120
kanna's i'm is available there are a lot

501
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,379
of great enzymatic products out there I

502
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,120
find the one that fits your budget

503
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:02,950
something to think about

504
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,599
they may look really expensive when you

505
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,120
go to buy the bottle but it may say use

506
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,980
one milliliter per gallon so if you're

507
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,659
using one mil per gallon as opposed to

508
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,429
something that takes 10 mils per gallon

509
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,620
you have to do the cost effectiveness of

510
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,509
the milliliter cost per mil in that

511
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:18,519
container at that time don't get sticker

512
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:21,099
shock because one is super expensive if

513
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:22,959
you only use one mil but half of

514
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,458
whatever it's gonna last you a long long

515
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,620
time if you have to use 10 mils of it

516
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,179
it's gonna go much more quickly so you

517
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,428
may be paying more right up front but

518
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:32,290
it's gonna last you a lot longer mm-hmm

519
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,400
all right Xavier I think I helped you

520
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:36,639
out with that one I hope I gave you a

521
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,070
good answer um well let's talk about how

522
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,720
much shine to use ah that's probably a

523
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:42,609
good thing to recommend I start off

524
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,589
lightly if you're going to go if you're

525
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:46,089
gonna go early just do one gram if

526
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:48,069
you're gonna go before a flower or a

527
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:49,119
week one or two a flower start off with

528
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:52,808
one gram

529
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:55,359
her per gallon thank you Mike one gram

530
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:57,789
per gallon and then yeah per per

531
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,339
whatever per can of Mountain Dew a 1

532
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:01,389
gram again one round per nostril yeah no

533
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:03,459
don't say that

534
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:06,160
uh-huh people are wonder what kind of

535
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,630
show we've got don't snort the shine who

536
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,720
knows you may get all kinds of trichomes

537
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:12,880
but one gram of shine per gallon then at

538
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,308
week two increase it to two and stick

539
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,870
with that until week four then slowly

540
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:19,000
increase it as needed

541
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:21,729
if you want to you can stick with two

542
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,069
grams you can get all the way up to more

543
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,240
than two I've done a lot I don't want to

544
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,039
give you numbers cuz you guys gonna [ __ ]

545
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,210
your plants up pay attention to the tips

546
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,799
of the leaves when the tips of the

547
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,870
leaves get a little little brown a

548
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,460
little bit yellow that's as much as they

549
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:34,899
need don't go any more than that you're

550
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,130
pushing them as hard as they need to go

551
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,350
they're starting to get their nails done

552
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,720
they're about to burn so start off with

553
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:42,339
one slowly work your way up to two maybe

554
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,990
work your way up to three pay attention

555
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:46,000
what the plants do if you're really

556
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,380
happy with what they're doing maybe try

557
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,299
a little bit more don't go much past

558
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,980
three and a half you guys don't do that

559
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:53,289
they'll get [ __ ] sad they'll get mad

560
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,970
okay angry they'll cook up on you but

561
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:56,769
increase it slowly and pay attention to

562
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,150
what they do if you're in cocoa you've

563
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:00,579
really got a lot of opportunity to

564
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,080
increase slowly during soilless mix you

565
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:04,359
gotta just water as you can but pay

566
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,308
attention so start off with one gram

567
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,169
work your way up don't go more than

568
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:09,490
three and a half the guys have bed bloom

569
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,259
are gonna email me and say three and a

570
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,710
half [ __ ] grams dude maybe I was

571
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:16,679
fired oh he was so good but everything

572
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,730
else has to be in line also you can't be

573
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,230
overloading anything else are under

574
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,250
loading everything else has to be in

575
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,630
line you can't just think I'm gonna

576
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,250
throw three and a half grams of shine in

577
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,600
here it's gonna be the magic bullet if

578
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,640
everything else has to be in line for

579
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:31,269
that shine to work it's like building a

580
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,070
body builder if if my I've got chicken

581
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:34,389
legs bro I'm six foot five I weigh like

582
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:35,769
a hundred and ninety pounds I got

583
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,150
[ __ ] chicken legs I'm not I'm not

584
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:39,069
ashamed of that if they don't grow I

585
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,900
could do I could go do leg day every day

586
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:42,819
Bron I'm just gonna get more chicken

587
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,470
legs and it'd be like if you took my

588
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:46,269
chicken legs and put Brock Lesnar's

589
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,740
shoulders on there and he told him go

590
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,179
ahead and Bend go ahead and [ __ ] lift

591
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,620
all that weight not a benchpress I know

592
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:52,420
I need my legs so some kind of standing

593
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:54,279
lift lifts all that weight my legs are

594
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,539
gonna crumble so if you just have a

595
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:57,069
shitty plant and you think you're just

596
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,629
gonna go feeding it a bunch of shine

597
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:59,559
it's not prepared for that it's not

598
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,030
gonna be able to take it it's got

599
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:03,069
chicken legs bro you got to work the

600
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:04,930
whole plant everything has to be

601
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:07,629
in harmony her doll to work beautifully

602
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:11,950
like that you look like you had

603
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:14,950
something to say Mike nope just try to

604
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,799
plan your new feeds out from the start

605
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:20,110
so that you're not rushing to add [ __ ]

606
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:24,069
in the middle that's where people get

607
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:27,039
into trouble yeah I forget that people

608
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:29,740
don't plan ahead very well if you were

609
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,839
on week 6 you should know what you're

610
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,339
feeding all the way up to the day you

611
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,679
flush and you should know the day you

612
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:37,839
flush when I put a crop into flower I've

613
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,390
got a general idea of what day it's

614
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,409
coming down like it may be my first run

615
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,870
with a plant but I know it's either

616
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,060
gonna take 9 or 10 weeks I've chosen

617
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:47,199
that I'm gonna give it 9 or 10 weeks and

618
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,779
then I'm gonna pay attention to it I'm

619
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,809
gonna cut it down so I know that the

620
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:54,549
week 8 I need to flush I already know

621
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:56,049
what I'm gonna feed it week 1 2 3 I

622
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:59,529
already know I've got the recipe figured

623
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:02,500
out the the biggest thing with really

624
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:05,889
good cannabis is is a plan and sticking

625
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,720
to a plan when people start changing

626
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,140
[ __ ] in the middle or trying new [ __ ] in

627
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,360
the middle or I wanted to start that

628
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,960
nutrient this week but I didn't have it

629
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,909
so I'm gonna start it next week and next

630
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,350
week becomes to timeline and then you're

631
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,650
telling people I wanted to started shine

632
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:25,480
I start the shine on week 2 I meant to

633
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,730
get it out by week two but I missed week

634
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,650
two and then week three kind of got away

635
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:32,529
from me so I started it kind of and a

636
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,390
week for ya and then you say that shine

637
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:35,859
wasn't the product you expect it because

638
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,180
you didn't get it in there you missed

639
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,459
two and a half weeks worth of shine

640
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,890
opportunity and it's not just newts

641
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,890
either like I've talked to people that

642
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:47,500
are they got to their harvest moment and

643
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,390
they went to grab the the plant cutters

644
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,619
bolt cutters to chop their plant down

645
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,880
and thought where am I gonna hang this

646
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:56,879
girl yeah what oh and now they're

647
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,320
scrambling and hanging clothesline and

648
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,630
it gets weird just cuz they didn't plan

649
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:05,109
yeah and all of a sudden they're they're

650
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:07,630
a quality cannabis is a c- because they

651
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:09,250
didn't plan out one step because amazon

652
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,420
took an extra week because they didn't

653
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,369
deliver something that they should have

654
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,870
ordered during week two like you guys

655
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:15,189
know you're growing cannabis you know

656
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,268
you're gonna have a harvest in a few

657
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,940
weeks start think

658
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:20,348
had yeah good idea Mike so I have all of

659
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,879
your nutrients if you're in veg and

660
00:22:20,348 --> 00:22:23,648
you're going to flower next week

661
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:24,968
order your flowering nutrients get them

662
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:26,138
here go to the store and buy them if

663
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:28,389
you're waiting on Amazon if you're

664
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:30,338
waiting on something go get them things

665
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:32,019
are super weird in the world right now

666
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:34,388
yep it's getting a lot harder to do that

667
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:37,479
right now so the planning becomes even

668
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:38,858
more and more vital yeah and things are

669
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:40,690
gonna start running out you guys so I've

670
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:44,138
done an episode before on being prepared

671
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,849
to be prepared you leave the gross

672
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:47,978
stores alone I'm trying to avoid all the

673
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:50,138
pandemic and kovat and weird talk but

674
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:51,999
leave the gross stores alone all right

675
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:53,348

starts off with the people thanking me

690
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:24,429
and saying I'm the best I don't pick the

691
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:26,288
emails that say that they all say that

692
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:27,820
it's not a selection thing that's just

how they start thank you guys I love

694

00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:34,479
based on that I'm not trust me or please

696

I can't talk can't stop talking about

698
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:39,609
your current flower

699
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:42,039
uh you were making the listeners in

700
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:44,288
Prohibition land said oh they said don't

701
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:46,179
stop talking no they said do stop

702
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:48,278
talking about if anything stop talking

703
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:49,690
about your current flower they're upset

704
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:52,469
and sad that we're over here smoking the

705
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:55,269
guava papaya and telling them about it I

706
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:56,828
like to check in on places like Reddit

707
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:58,808
and check out what people are smoking

708
00:23:56,828 --> 00:24:04,928
around the country and every now that I

709
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:06,638
see some my god yeah Scotty real has a

710
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:08,709
little bit of brick weed on his shelf

711
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:10,449
behind him in the show and it's funny

712
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:11,798
just to see the brick weed sometimes

713
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,959
like hey bro wanna smoke a joint he's

714
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:17,168
playing with it you're like oh no dude

715
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:19,119
no but our friend Edward says seriously

716
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:21,309
I love the show and I did my best with

717
00:24:19,118 --> 00:24:24,038
my monthly contributions hey thank you I

718
00:24:21,308 --> 00:24:25,598
appreciate that I will have to associate

719
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:26,618
the name in the email with the patreon

720
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:28,628
so I can see what you're contributing

721
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:30,039
and send you a special thank you it goes

722
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:31,599
on to say my question

723
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:34,240
I have some new seedlings they have

724
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,829
reached about five inches only the top

725
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,410
four leaves have appeared and they are

726
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:40,359
falling over uh so we've got that's

727
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,830
about four inches I'm picturing GI Joe

728
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,259
GI Joe is like three and a half three

729
00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:46,869
and three quarters so they're about five

730
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:49,390
inches and only the top four leaves have

731
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:51,579
appeared and then they fall over then it

732
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,990
says why I put some toothpicks next to

733
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:56,079
them but they are not strong enough to

734
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,910
support the weight what should I do

735
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,669
so this is what we call getting its

736
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,620
leggy yeah they're stretchy and leggy

737
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,880
youyou don't want to put some popsicle

738
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:06,219
sticks you don't wanna put pins in there

739
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,480
to keep them up um are you can that may

740
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,150
be what you have to do at this point but

741
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,089
that's not the idea um what should I do

742
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:14,410
those plants want a little bit light

743
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:15,970
they want a little I was gonna say one a

744
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,070
little bit more of everything except

745
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,009
water they want more life they want more

746
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:22,659
air ah yeah B needs a little bit of wind

747
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:23,170
on them but I think they're reaching for

748
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,790
the light

749
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,680
you've probably got them under a low

750
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:28,960
quality light a low power light

751
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,670
certainly not be correct spectrum light

752
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,680
so they're going hey the main thing I

753
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,300
want out of life right now is light I'm

754
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,350
looking for it I think it might be up

755
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,419
there I'm gonna try to keep growing

756
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:39,039
until I get to it and it's not gonna get

757
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,259
to it because the light is not the right

758
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,059
light so you need more to light then you

759
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:44,319
need a little bit of wind a little bit

760
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:45,399
of wind will prevent them from getting

761
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,990
so stretchy

762
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,370
yeah just a tie don't go [ __ ]

763
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,930
breaking them and destroying them but a

764
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:52,329
little wind makes them kind of struggle

765
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,590
and they kind of think about Mike wood

766
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:57,389
what's the first thing you do if I were

767
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:57,389
just to shove you punch me back right

768
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:01,419
you spread your feet to get your balance

769
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,909
when you get pushed you spread your feet

770
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,410
so if I when you blow on the plant it's

771
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,910
gonna get rattled it's gonna spread its

772
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,130
roots to try to hold itself up and get

773
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:16,779
stronger so then in my pleasure about

774
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:18,750
the stock a little bit yeah then I'm

775
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:21,129
going to assume it's been over watered

776
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,299
also you're probably over watering if

777
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,130
it's not getting enough light it's not

778
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:25,990
growing it's not doing anything it's not

779
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,940
it's probably a little bit over watered

780
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,620
and that is probably because it is not

781
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,779
in the appropriate soil you need some

782
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:33,729
aerated soil for a seedling so think

783
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:36,009
about lights air water and soil and make

784
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,750
sure that all of those are correct but

785
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:39,160
it sounds like light is probably the

786
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,109
main culprit here put some more light on

787
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,029
it that should keep it a little bit

788
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:44,079
tighter I've noticed if you listen to

789
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:46,298
the previous episode

790
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,308
I switch to the LEDs my growth went

791
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:49,839
crazy so that is a huge testament to

792
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:52,298
different light I went from T fives to

793
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,189
LEDs and saw double the growth really

794
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:56,918
quickly so the light is probably the

795
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:59,048
culprit then it goes on to say have you

796
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,490
helped anyone with an aquaponic system

797
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:02,079
there are many YouTube videos and

798
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,210
write-ups out there but no one gives a

799
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:07,028
real concise answer let me know your

800
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,440
thoughts I have built one with love and

801
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:11,230
I would love to share my progress with

802
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,019
you uh so yeah I do not grow

803
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,759
aquaponically but I do know the guy

804
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:17,980
named aquaponics Steve and he's got a

805
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,099
podcast called growing with fishes and

806
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:24,639
they specialize in growing with fishes

great avenues to expand your aquaponic

834
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:23,769
and cultivation uh uh organic

835
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,000
cultivation knowledge boy Mike we should

836
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,950
dab something different on the next

837
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,190
episode does that [ __ ] papaya guava

838
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:34,360
shake I mean stuttery and weird today

839
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:36,220
exactly yeah going with the last email a

840
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:38,979
lot of people when they're first

841
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:41,019
starting to get into growing they they

842
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,288
say I want to start growing herb and I

843
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:46,778
want to grow and then there's a very

844
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:52,019
difficult way to grow that comes after

845
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:54,669
that either with fish or column or with

846
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:58,059
gonna steal a train car and bury 80 feet

847
00:28:54,669 --> 00:29:00,460
of water sprayers Oh air apana CLE upon

848
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:02,769
yeah all right grow underground and

849
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,690
train cars and I mean honestly if it's

850
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:07,960
your first couple of grows just focus on

851
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:10,210
getting good growing in your space yeah

852
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:20,769
understand it managing the environmental

853
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:23,710
controls of your space and learning how

854
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:26,200
to manipulate it successfully for what

855
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,360
you're trying to do yeah Linda the gear

856
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,580
learned basically the plants learn that

857
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:32,199
what light cycles do like what happens

858
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:34,269
when I trim a plant here one of the

859
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,130
basics of plant growth the cycles the

860
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:38,440
nutritive cycles and then learn how to

861
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,490
make all that happen with fish but if

862
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,440
that's really the way you want to jump

863
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,390
in I'm no one to just sway you from

864
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,759
living the [ __ ] dream but it is

865
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,370
really a challenging way to jump in I've

866
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:51,879
seen some really beautiful in Theory

867
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:53,889
setups that they use fish but they all

868
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,130
scare the [ __ ] out of me because fish

869
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:59,440
plus an environment that's good for fish

870
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:01,420
plus water pumps and hoses in my brain

871
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,730
equals a night

872
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,009
lots of clogged hoses I just keep

873
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:09,309
picturing Brian cleaning out the little

874
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:11,319
sprayer nozzles oh yeah the facility you

875
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:13,299
know I'm talking about and just man

876
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:17,609
instead of that stuff it's fish [ __ ]

877
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:20,049
that's just what I picture yeah yeah

878
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:23,709
being cultivators to work in a [ __ ]

879
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:27,720
SeaWorld no yeah I'm sorry no [ __ ]

880
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,720
SeaWorld but anyway the more that it's

881
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:35,050
right now you tell me dude

882
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,670
environmentally sustainable growing is

883
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:38,919
killer and so if you can keep us

884
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:41,259
thriving grow going based on a fishpond

885
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,700
like by all means do it it's gotta be

886
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:43,900
fun yeah cuz you get to take care of

887
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,490
fishies and you probably get to name the

888
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,110
tilapia that are swimming around or

889
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,089
whatever but that's I don't know that's

890
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:52,779
a whole new ballgame fish food is way

891
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:54,399
[ __ ] cheaper than bottled news well

892
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:56,079
maybe what do you feel because you got

893
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,330
to think about that fish food is going

894
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,949
to turn into fish feeding a mistake it's

895
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:01,689
gonna turn into the nutrients for my

896
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,279
plants so I may totally change up my

897
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,920
fish food diet at that point they may

898
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,559
get caviar or a steaks and whatever they

899
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,960
want at that point

you at the next endo Expo whenever that

949
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,799

950
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:52,549
live now ah I need a wee diesel Expo

951
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:54,440
zoom Expo stop it Mike it goes on to say

952
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:56,599
I recently saw an Instagram post of

953
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,720
yours where you posted your reverse

954
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:01,519
spray yes I posted a big leader of

955
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,589
silver thiosulfate that I had freshly

956
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,629
mixed up it says I've been working with

957
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:07,399
SDS spray for some months now and I've

958
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:09,200
always been under the impression that it

959
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,059
should come out clear after it is mixed

960
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,819
in your Instagram post it appears

961
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:16,700
slightly colored do you use or be use a

962
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:18,980
surfactant or do you think this is what

963
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,600
happens when we use expired product

964
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,849
because that has happened to me before

965
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:24,379
or is the color of your spray normal as

966
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:25,548
it comes out thanks for taking your time

967
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,070
to read this and

968
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:29,569
okay fat dab for me dude I've got a fat

969
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:31,278
dab on the dabber so that as soon as

970
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:32,989
this show ends I'll hit this dab for you

971
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,778
this one is gonna be dedicated to you I

972
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:37,879
do know the picture for you yeah yeah

973
00:33:35,778 --> 00:33:40,429
we're gonna do it properly I do know the

974
00:33:37,878 --> 00:33:42,709
Instagram poster speaking of I made that

975
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:44,659
jar of silver thiosulfate I shook it up

976
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,100
i diluted it I applied it to some plants

977
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:47,450
I remember that day I remember that

978
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:50,599
batch I remember that photo

979
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:53,778
uh the Silas silver thiosulfate solution

980
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:56,209
in that jar is quite clear what's not

981
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:57,440
clear is the wall behind me I took that

982
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,538
photo in front of this wall right here

983
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,100
it is sort of an off-white color that

984
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,710
came through in the photo so it looks

985
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:06,259
like the photo the solution of dabbed at

986
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,819
eggshell paint behind it yeah yeah yeah

987
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:10,449
it's off white bro it's from supreme

988
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:13,128
it's off white I'm just working on but

989
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:14,628
it's not pure white it's kind of yet is

990
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:16,909
eggshell II back there it's been too

991
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:18,648
much dab smoke so it made the solution

992
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,929
look like it did have some color to it

993
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:23,058
but no it is completely clear it should

994
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:24,679
be clear sometimes you may see little

995
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:25,579
flakes in it that means that your stuff

996
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,780
didn't dissolve you should have

997
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:28,250
dissolved it shook it up more tea

998
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,010
probably shake it more it'll break up in

999
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,568
there ah but it should be clear if it

1000
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,829
turns dark colors when you're mixing it

1001
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:35,480
that means that your solution has

1002
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:37,010
probably been exposed to too much light

1003
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,440
or that there's moisture or something

1004
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,540
went wrong in either the silver or the

1005
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,490
sodium powders is what that probably

1006
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:45,318
means one of the companies has stopped

1007
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:47,539
sending me fine fine powder and they

1008
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:50,029
sent me bigger chunks those chunks don't

1009
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:52,940
dissolve very well and sometimes I do

1010
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,740
see colored particles floating around so

1011
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,780
what I've begun to do is I put those

1012
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,578
chunks in a baggie and I wrap that

1013
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,589
baggie in newspaper and I crush it with

1014
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:02,298
a hammer to make those chunks smaller

1015
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:04,578
and I don't get that problem anymore and

1016
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:06,048
the solution works better so that's a

1017
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:07,369
little tip for you if you're buying from

1018
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:08,750
the same company as myself and they've

1019
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:10,640
started sending you the pellets instead

1020
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,858
of the powder crush the pellets it's the

1021
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,108
same [ __ ] you just have to crush down

1022
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:17,358
their big crystals um they think they're

1023
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:19,608
doing any favors by sending a big the

1024
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:21,769
big buds and we just want the shake so

1025
00:35:19,608 --> 00:35:23,029
no I do not use a surfactant I soak the

1026
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:25,699
[ __ ] out of the plant to the point of

1027
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,740
runoff I don't only spray the leaves I

1028
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:30,139
make it a point to spray the the branch

1029
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:31,729
of the plant the main meristem the main

1030
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:34,848
branch of the plant also gets sprayed

1031
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,650
with silver um I think that is

1032
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:39,230
everything that we need to cover on that

1033
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:41,740
one the spray was clear I don't

1034
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:44,019
use a surfactant on if you've got colors

1035
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:47,029
probably contaminants yeah

1036
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:49,130
say that again Mike nice easy question

1037
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,210
nice easy question yeah I'm glad you

1038
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,608
asked because that means you're paying

1039
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:55,699
attention this stuff was clear bro it

1040
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:57,440
was just the wall behind me would you

1041
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:59,269
read the question I smiled because I was

1042
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,740
hoping personally that it was like an

1043
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:05,719
Instagram filter now just just the wall

1044
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:07,879
behind me needs a little bit of repaint

1045
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,259
and even better answer yeah there's a

1046
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,880
lighting or the wall something gave it

1047
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,920
some color but it is clear it is

1048
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,750
completely clear you'll be happy to know

1049
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,108
that all of that thiosulfate has been

1050
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:20,630
applied to a plant and now that female

1051
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:22,429
looks totally like a male and it is

1052
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,990
about to produce pollen here in the next

1053
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:26,480
five to seven days and should have a

1054
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:30,319
nice uh big tray of pollen to play with

1055
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,440
that'll be a good time all right Mike I

1056
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,180
think we've been going for a little over

1057
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,679
30 minutes maybe unless we make an edit

1058
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:39,879
or two here so I think we got enough

1059
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:41,750
content to call it a quality podcast

1060
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,220
it's kind of weird now that I'm not

1061
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,329
[ __ ] baked out of my brain the show

1062
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:47,209
is over and I feel like I could do a

1063
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:49,429
podcast now just downshift into reality

1064
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:52,250
yeah I got landed in the middle of that

1065
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:53,750
show somewhere let's fix that yeah we're

1066
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,309
gonna we're definitely gonna fix that as

1067
00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:00,019
soon as I do the catchphrase we will

1068
00:36:55,309 --> 00:37:02,570
take some dabs together just one man

1069
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:04,489
