use and then there's a picture we got

165
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,940
three to five no like seven or eight

166
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,099
lights hanging in a little growth

167
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,450
facility here with the ballast up on the

168
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,129
ceiling just to kind of show you a nice

169
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,050
little visual of electricity being ran

170
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:05,090
and then it says oh this article I

171
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:07,429
better give some credit here who Chris

172
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,280
Mooney from the Washington Post wrote

173
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:11,479
this he says across the country there's

174
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,730
a growing trend toward the legalization

175
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,519
of marijuana four states Oregon

176
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,230
Washington Colorado Alaska have voted to

177
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,149
allow people to possess limited amounts

178
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,039
of marijuana for personal use and also

179
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,090
to let producers apply for licenses to

180
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:26,269
produce and sell it

181
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:28,370
DC also just voted to allow voted to

182
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,199
allow personal possession all of this on

183
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,169
top of the 23 states that allow it for

184
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,460
medical reasons in some states we just

185
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:35,870
read two different articles that gave me

186
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,350
different numbers on that didn't we one

187
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,639
said 21 said 23 maybe they were taken at

188
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,970
different times maybe they're dabbing

189
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,620
also hit dabs is the the way this gets

190
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,110
counted up is confusing because there's

191
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,850
Senza that second Sanjay Gupta special

192
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,539
there's been a whole bunch of CBD only

193
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:57,350
states across the south is sudo medical

194
00:09:53,539 --> 00:10:00,139
how you count that if you count that the

195
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,850
numbers law he was just about 25 now the

196
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:04,789
guy that was making the big fuss in New

197
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:10,250
Jersey was just in the news today one go

198
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:11,419
back at it like Blood Money Christie

199
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,009
being all fat and crazy

200
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:14,839
that's that should be just used to be

201
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:16,549
the governor of Florida - so I mean like

202
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,440
after his brother or something

203
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,240
he's just an art man never gonna be

204
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,300
President order in the court in some

205
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,310
states where businesses

206
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:24,750
are also now legally cultivating and

207
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:26,909
producing marijuana a mainstream inner

208
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,278
industry is emerging marijuana sales

209
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:34,819
totaled 700 million dollars in Colorado

210
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:37,740
last year for instance yeah you spend uh

211
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,290
the first three months that I was here

212
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,659
yeah I posted a picture on Twitter the

213
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:46,319
only time I bought legal pot last year

214
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:49,649
it was on January 1st so I could exact

215
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,089
sixty bucks so that was me yep about 125

216
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,919
on the first at the greener side

217
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:54,540
dispensary but I bought a lot of this

218
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:59,599
shatter from green and healthy lately

219
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:59,599
yeah 2015 is gonna be a different tale

220
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,310
almost black cherry chem done I ran a

221
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:07,409
lot of black cherry Kevin in his tasty

222
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:09,000
very tasty it's a little heavy on the

223
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:13,620
indica side so for daytime it's a little

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,690
bit much sometimes alright but let's see

225
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,980
700 million dollars in Colorado a last

226
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,329
year for instance but there's a

227
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,220
surprising catch it turns out that

228
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:22,229
indoor marijuana growth in particular a

229
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,750
cultivation method often favored in the

230
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,000
industry for many reasons usings uses a

231
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,278
surprising amount of energy

232
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,350
indeed the level of power use appears to

233
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,970
be so significant that one scholar is

234
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,550
now suggesting that as the industry

235
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,170
grows states and localities should take

236
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:38,699
advantage of marijuana licensing

237
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:40,860
procedures to also regulate the

238
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:45,329
industry's use energy use and greenhouse

239
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,350
gas emissions damn hippie this new

240
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:48,719
industry

241
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,610
let's see given that this is a new

242
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,410
industry that is going to be pretty

243
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,149
highly regulated I felt like the state

244
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:56,338
and local policy makers have a unique

245
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:58,440
opportunity to incorporate energy usage

246
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,420
and climate assessments into their state

247
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,579
marijuana licensing fees says Gina

248
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,379
Warren a professor at the Texas A&amp;M

249
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:06,599
University School of Law whose paper

250
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,879
titled regulating pot to save the polar

251
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,800
bear energy and climate impacts of the

252
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,629
marijuana industry will soon appear in

253
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:19,409
the Columbia Journal of environmental

254
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:22,198
laws wow that's catch that this is hot

255
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:24,289
and polar bears in the same close

256
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:27,029
together

257
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:28,740
I just saw a polar bear like running

258
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:30,089
through a field of pot like it was yeah

259
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,830
I just thought that that was like an

260
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:42,120
obstacle of a sentence to get through

261
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:47,070
the entire paragraph is one sense let's

262
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:51,269
see if there's a comma a comma so I

263
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:53,220
wrote a ellipse and then another comma

264
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:55,620
and then a period yeah there's so much

265
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,930
punctuated that's that yeah yeah good

266
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,490
writing props the published statistics

267
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:01,019
on energy use from indoor marijuana

268
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,539
production will blow your mind whether

269
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,819
or not you use this stuff in a 2012

270
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:07,230
study of carbon footprint of indoor

271
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,540
cannabis production published in the

272
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,950
journal inter energy policy researcher

273
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,169
Evan Mills noted that on occasion

274
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,940
previous unrecognized spheres of energy

275
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:17,129
used to come to light and marijuana is a

276
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,840
textbook example the study estimated

277
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:22,500
that indoor cannabis both legal and

278
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,389
illegal uses six billion dollars worth

279
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,580
of electricity every year amounting to

280
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:28,740
one percent of overall US electricity

281
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,810
and in some production intensive states

282
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,940
like California it was much higher three

283
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,379
percent Mills found Ivan read into this

284
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,820
article much further but I'm going to

285
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:38,159
assume that Colorado is gonna hit like

286
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,930
5% of that because we're killing it on

287
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,429
the indoor grows the only thing that

288
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:45,829
would hold Colorado back from that would

289
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:48,629
be there is less people here then some

290
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:51,600
it's the percentage of our overall usage

291
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:54,210
yeah yeah so one average kilogram of

292
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,190
final product is associated with 4,600

293
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,170
kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions to

294
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,870
the atmosphere or that of 3 million

295
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:03,569
average u.s. cars when aggregated across

296
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,100
all national production roll mills the

297
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,500
reason is simply the technique the

298
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,210
technology required specific energy uses

299
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,279
include high intensity lighting

300
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,620
dehumidification remove to remove water

301
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,879
vapor and avoid mold formation space

302
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,769
heating or cooling during non

303
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,500
illuminated periods and drying

304
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:20,819
preheating of irrigation water

305
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,440
generation of carbon dioxide by burning

306
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,940
fossil fuel and ventilation and air

307
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,490
conditioning to remove waste heat

308
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,490
Wright's Mills that's a well researched

309
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,830
they did all that math and they haven't

310
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,659
figured out how much carbon tax the

311
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,570
plant sent back out there

312
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:38,579
mmm there's an well no but there's

313
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,230
another side of that coin depends on the

314
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,850
plant you know I agree with this article

315
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,560
Foley I'm just saying there's like

316
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,360
there's a there's a little bit of

317
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,969
subtraction that needs to be done before

318
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,350
we freak out a little true that she

319
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,460
keeps on going and she says Oh outdoor

320
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,200
production also has environmental

321
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,060
consequences it has been charged with

322
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,200
deforestation and high levels of water

323
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,909
and pesticide use

324
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,350
but as pot becomes more legal and

325
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:02,879
mainstream notes warrant outdoor

326
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,009
producers will have to abide by

327
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,529
pre-existing in their environmental laws

328
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:08,850
just like everyone else in effect that

329
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,669
means indoor production the chief

330
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,710
climate change that makes indoor

331
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,269
production the chief climate change and

332
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,980
energy concern according to Warren's

333
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,809
article while underground indoor

334
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,550
marijuana production already consumed

335
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:22,769
the plenty of energy legalization will

336
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:24,829
increase energy use even further as the

337
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:27,299
industry grows so will its negative

338
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,950
externality she writes which is why

339
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,779
she's proposing that all states that

340
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,430
legalize marijuana use should also

341
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,439
require the growing industry to power

342
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:35,189
itself cleanly and it's not without

343
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,230
precedent

344
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,000
starting in October of this year Boulder

345
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,789
County and Colorado will require many

346
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,889
facilities to directly offset 100

347
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:46,500
percent of electricity propane and

348
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:51,080
natural gas consumption the renewables

349
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,080
or other means that's a fun challenge

350
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:58,049
now yeah Warren says she's not picking

351
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,389
on the marijuana industry with her

352
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:02,069
proposals it's just that well we don't

353
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:03,629
often have new industries appear that

354
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,700
use a lot of energy and are likely to be

355
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,039
highly regulated as they become legal I

356
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,570
think it could actually be a marketing

357
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,159
tool for the industry says Warren

358
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,660
because if you have people who are

359
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,100
purchasing the product who are the type

360
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:15,539
of individual who cares about the

361
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,620
environment then they would gravitate

362
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:20,789
toward the green marijuana production

363
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,500
what she's saying makes sense because we

364
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:23,699
are sucking up a lot of power and I've

365
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,379
thought about it I don't know how to do

366
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,090
it maybe somebody can send me an email

367
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:29,370
or something one thing I want to do I

368
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,690
consider myself a pro grower I could

369
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,310
grow you can give me a plant that's half

370
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,200
dead and then in 90 days I'll give you

371
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:35,549
some tasty ass buds out of it I can

372
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,879
overcome those problems in a grow room

373
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:41,339
now I want some guidance on how to

374
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:44,070
lessen my carbon footprint I recycle my

375
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,220
soil but still I have to run lights for

376
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:49,250
12 hours on a 12 hours off there's no

377
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,750
are there other things we can do to kind

378
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,730
of lessen our carbon footprint if you

379
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,149
guys know send me ideas you can tweet

380
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,720
them to me

381
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:59,799
it's at G fyh podcast you can email me

382
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,910
it's girl from your heart at hotmail.com

383
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,039
yeah well I want to see I want to know

384
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:05,809
how there's all kinds it seems an

385
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:09,438
argument right now I mean you would try

386
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:11,779
to find those cannabis cultivators would

387
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,900
start looking for places like wine but

388
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:16,789
yeah you know places they would right

389
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,709
next to rivers where they can have a

390
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:20,930
water bill oh we're talking about like

391
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,100
my pre-existing indoor grow like people

392
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,140
that have a home grow or a small

393
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:26,629
warehouse grow like I want to find out

394
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,339
ways that people like us like you you've

395
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,380
got a trap house grow I want to see you

396
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:32,210
a way that you can kind of make a little

397
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,520
less in your electricity bill just save

398
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,079
you however much it is maybe cut 10% of

399
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,490
that off absolutely well you could

400
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,049
definitely do that with solar you know

401
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm saying like you're you're just

402
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,930
cutting out the hundred dollars that it

403
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,540
takes to run your house would be a

404
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,279
hundred dollars less over a year that

405
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:49,639
would add up you know tremendously

406
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:50,839
that's 15 to you know quite a bit a

407
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,509
hundred dollars just watch do you try to

408
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,889
do bad right now right now it's twelve

409
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:57,980
dollars but I'm just saying like you

410
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,600
know the local application of this is

411
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,250
the city of Pueblo just required

412
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,069
everybody growing doors you can't grow

413
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,230
outside not in any fashion this year in

414
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:08,299
Pablo that's kind of silly hopefully in

415
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,660
a year we'll have green house rules down

416
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:13,279
here but yet they cut it off and but not

417
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:19,670
until the very end no you're talking

418
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:24,920
about the card six persons in my own

419
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:27,950
backyard it no legal is really if you're

420
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:30,620
not on the game yeah b-positive legal

421
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,990
the Sun is not there looking for more

422
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,339
illegal pot grows here and now more than

423
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,630
they were before we have legalized

424
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:36,980
cannabis to tell you the truth because

425
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,450
now they want to regulate the [ __ ] out

426
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,099
of it before they didn't have time now

427
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,950
it's an issue all right I want to read

428
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:44,929
which one do we want to do this one do

429
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,720
you want to do the which one the good

is writing a lot do you want to do the

437
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:08,729
one about racism drop in call from the

438
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:09,688
cannabis to treat by Kristen Wyatt of

439
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:11,578
The Associated Press

440
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:13,288
Alaska it says the legalization of

441
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:14,788
marijuana in Colorado hasn't solved the

442
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:16,469
racial disparities in enforcement the

443
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:18,658
drug policy performers had hoped to end

444
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:20,249
with blacks still far more likely than

445
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,409
whites to be charged with pot related

446
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:23,608
crimes a new report says the report

447
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:25,859
issued Wednesday by the Perl

448
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:28,228
legalization drug policy Alliance showed

449
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:30,028
that marijuana arrests in Colorado all

450
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:32,399
but stopped after voters made the drug

451
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:34,919
legal in small amounts for those 21 and

452
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:36,328
older but the report noted continuing

453
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,919
racial disparities involving the

454
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:40,408
marijuana crimes that remain including

455
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,649
public use in possession in excess of

456
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:45,899
the ounce limit study the study examined

457
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:47,308
drug arrests in all 64 Colorado counties

458
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:50,068
for two years before and after

459
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:51,749
legalization in 2012 the total number of

460
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:54,618
charges for pot possession distribution

461
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:57,118
and cultivation plummeted by almost 95%

462
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:59,578
from about thirty nine thousand two

463
00:19:57,118 --> 00:20:02,578
thousand tend to just over two thousand

464
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:06,598
last year that's if it only takes an

465
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:10,548
hour of the cops time that's 37 cop

466
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:12,778
hours 37,000 37,000 cop hours we just

467
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:14,608
reallocated - [ __ ] that's worth

468
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,769
something usable yeah they can be out

469
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:18,388
solving a crime any crime looking for

470
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:19,798
your bike that got stolen yep looking

471
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:21,238
for something the bad happened I don't

472
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,519
even want to create crimes in my head I

473
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:25,499
have to say it has been nice like not

474
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:33,078
worrying about the bag to Tim my pocket

475
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:36,629
yeah only crime most marijuana consumers

476
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:39,178
like trough traffic infractions don't

477
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:40,888
weed like it's literally the only

478
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:48,209
problem is once you pull me over it's

479
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:49,618
like here's the bag yeah hope it smells

480
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:51,239
good in here a lot of money for that

481
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:52,468
here you can have my sweater give me

482
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:54,749
five minutes and then when you come back

483
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:55,769
tell me it smells like weed yeah all

484
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:56,519
right so I'm gonna keep reading cuz we

485
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:58,469
want to get through a couple articles

486
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,729
even after legalization blacks were more

487
00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:01,439
likely twice as likely

488
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:03,649
oh sorry I read that wrong blacks were

489
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:06,589
more than I've stuttered because

490
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:08,869
Wordsworth we're saying blacks to

491
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:11,200
American would be the correct term

492
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:14,209
is a little harsh when I ran into but

493
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,980
I'm not a member of the PC squad I

494
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,390
didn't write this article so if you want

495
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,390
to complain that we're calling Africans

496
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:32,740
raid it when you got those two guys did

497
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,739
that not me I found it slightly

498
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,880
even after legalization african-american

499
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:46,160
folks were more than twice as likely as

500
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:48,740
White's and whites this just oddly

501
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:52,210
written you tell us community is that us

502
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:55,039
or in the dabs or is it how it's written

503
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,558
we the racist waters they are they

504
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,178
blacks were also more much more likely

505
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:00,859
to be charged with illegal cultivation

506
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:11,990
of pot or possession of more than an

507
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:13,729
ounce legalization that for the long

508
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,319
time issues that law enforcement had

509
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,360
with the black and brown community said

510
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:19,909
art way Colorado director for the drug

511
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,049
policy Alliance still the drop-off and

512
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,058
overall arrest is good news for

513
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:25,159
minorities said Tony Newman also of the

514
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:28,039
drug policy Alliance despite the

515
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,570
uprising racial disparities the massive

516
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,730
drops and arrests have been enormous ly

517
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:36,769
beneficial to people of color Newman

518
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:38,808
said is this is this my system or I

519
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:44,420
think we stopped referring to people by

520
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:47,480
the general you know the term that I

521
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:50,269
related to in there I can't even now

522
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:55,519
I've just based on a already pastor yeah

523
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:57,049
it was the all right the analysis did

524
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,599
not break out data for Colorado's

525
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:00,678
largest ethnic minority Latinos that's

526
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,019
because data comes from the National

527
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,940
incident based reporting system system

528
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:07,369
which does not tally numbers for Latinos

529
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,779

533
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,339
insisted that officers are not rape

534
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:17,449
racially profiling pot users no they're

535
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:18,429
not there is calling on blacks and

536
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,660
whites

537
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:29,830
that's all they're doing it's not a

538
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:31,570
profile to general rape laws weapon was

539
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:38,829
a racist there are other factors going

540
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:40,899
on here that we need to address racial

541
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:42,639
disparities did ease somewhat for

542
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,740
marijuana distribution charges blacks

543
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,220
accounted for about 22% of such arrests

544
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,960
in 2010 and around 18% in 2014 the

545
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,059
arrest data got a mixed response from

546
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,160
the regional head of the n-double a-c-p

547
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:55,539
did the head of the n-double a-c-p know

548
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,410
that you were calling them blacks when

549
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:01,389
you wrote this on the overall decrease

550
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,220
in arrests charges and cases ignore is

551
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,650
enormous ly beneficial to communities of

552
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,289
color who bore the brunt of marijuana

553
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,670
prohibition rosemary Harris little said

554
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:12,279
in a statement however we are concerned

555
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,140
with the rise in a disparity for the

556
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,000
charge of public consumption and chat

557
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,730
and challenged law enforcement to ensure

558
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,670
this reality is not a discriminatory in

559
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:24,940
any manner wow that was hard to read I

560
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:26,590
in 2014 the years the year Colorado's

561
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,840
recreational marijuana stores opened

562
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:30,490
blacks were three point nine percent of

563
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,259
the population but accounted for nine

564
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,150
point two percent of pop possession

565
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:36,460
arrests for illegal marijuana

566
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,670
cultivation this disparities didn't just

567
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,380
persist they got much worse in 2010

568
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,880
White's in Colorado were slightly more

569
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,130
likely than blacks to be arrested for

570
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,930
growing pot after legalization the

571
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,470
arrests rate for whites dropped into

572
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,880
matically but ticked up for blacks in

573
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,740
2014 the arrest rate for blacks was

574
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,510
roughly two point five times higher

575
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,000
there's a lot more of this article but

576
00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:01,509
I'm not gonna read it it's almost done

577
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,960
but we get the point I don't like the

578
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:06,640
way it's written and I just got a lot of

579
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,380
really good information but it seems

580
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,060
like it was written really really fast

581
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,490
by someone who wasn't really thinking to

582
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:15,369
meet that deadline in the 60s well

583
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:17,920
they're still called I really like that

584
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:20,259
reporter but yeah this strikes me as a

585
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,720
little bit odd do you Mike tell me do

586
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:25,240
you just like all of his workers it's a

587
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,259
it's a lady

588
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,120
she's got a porter inside of the

589
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,140
Colorado marijuana's take a drink of

590
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,429
this water and then we're gonna read

591
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:43,120
another article written by the same

592
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:45,950
person and we're gonna try to [ __ ]

593
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,989
see like something like if we read in

594
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,870
public you wouldn't want to say it full

595
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,220
throat it was just gonna ask you would

596
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:56,689
you say that out loud at the mall

597
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:58,880
like probably not but she's very that's

598
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:02,570
how she would state it in a courtroom

599
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,090
you know I mean our politics I mean

600
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:06,829
let's just be real though no civil

601
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:08,539
rights person I don't I don't even want

602
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:11,480
to be called the whites over here I the

603
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:13,359
whites and they're not the blacks

604
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,190
[Music]

605
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,219
because I long hair and that means you

606
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:22,150
get pole but you're still a person

607
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,150
that's why I was trying

608
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:28,250
[Music]

609
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:31,009
yeah but crime in the arrests are down a

610
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,690
lot but it's still high for black stay

611
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:34,629
off my facebook I'm sitting there June

612
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:38,269
in the math of my head that's roughly

613
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:42,020
22,000 people of color that didn't get a

614
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:44,420
rest or [ __ ] with last year but still

615
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:47,089
the data is so screwed up like we really

616
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,730
need to restructure most of how we

617
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:50,750
enforce the laws I want your opinion on

618
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,370
that article the people that are

619
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,929
listening tweet me email me you know how

620
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:59,569
to do it I said it earlier what your

621
00:26:53,929 --> 00:27:01,610
opinion was it oddly written in a racist

622
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:04,428
tone like I didn't like the way that is

623
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:06,500
it racist to say it that way I didn't

624
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:07,519
like it I didn't like it so I abandon

625
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,230
we're gonna read another article this

626
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,859
for the conference says Colorado bill

627
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:14,860
seeks to standardize marijuana testing

628
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:17,209
um what I've noticed is a lot of people

629
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:18,619
in Colorado don't trust the testing

630
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,210
facilities anymore because we'll take a

631
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:22,039
test to one lab and it will come out at

632
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,029
22 percent you could take another test

633
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,159
to another lab and they'll come out of

634
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:26,599
29 percent and of course everyone's

635
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,890
gonna start going to the lab that gets

636
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:31,219
higher tests because you want to be able

637
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:33,679
to brag about higher results so it's

638
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,329
there's no real standard for the testing

639
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,070
lab so we can all just open our own lab

640
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:39,500
pretty much and be like I got the test

641
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:42,049
laughs is an email or a printed piece of

642
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,849
paper so you get a PDF and then you

643
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:45,649
don't worry about if those high-dollar

644
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:48,529
people couldn't pay more for better

645
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:50,210
testing routes so Colorado is moving to

646
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:51,799
establish another marijuana first the

647
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,049
first government standards for marijuana

648
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:55,519
testing a bill approved by its first

649
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,779
committee in the state legislature on

650
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,329
Thursday would create a statewide

651
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:01,759
laboratory standard for the state's 18

652
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,839
pot testing labs currently the labs are

653
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,430
certified by the state health

654
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:05,959
authorities but they don't have uniform

655
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,269
rules for testing pot potency

656
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,640
homogeneity and contaminants as required

657
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,440
by state law lab owners say they need

658
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,080
the standards because different labs now

659
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,029
produce very different results existing

660
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:18,619
pot tests generally just look for

661
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,930
whether the drug whether the drug is

662
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:22,750
present not how strong it is in most

663
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,820
industries there are long established

664
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:27,740
long established processes said Ian

665
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:30,500
behringer owner of a pot testing lab

666
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,210
called rm3 however for cannabis like

667
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,430
most of the industry we're making up the

668
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,620
rules as we go along I'm glad he admits

669
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,940
that now the labs can currently be used

670
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:39,469
or did I click there we go

671
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,539
the labs can currently be used by

672
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,370
licensed marijuana producers the bill

673
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:45,230
was amended to remove lab access to

674
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:47,089
private individuals and industrial hemp

675
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,490
growers now covered in separate bills

676
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:51,379
still pending in the legislature which

677
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:53,599
kind of bars me from getting my cannabis

678
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,310
tested now the stuff that I used to draw

679
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,779
up my private girl for my patients I was

680
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:58,099
able to take that to the lab and get it

681
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:59,899
tested and we could see what was in

682
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:01,459
there and I think we all need access to

683
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,340
that I don't understand why they cut us

684
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,500
off this is not only that this is the

685
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:07,429
latest step in a dance that's been going

686
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,559
on for 10 years

687
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:12,049
like I remember we didn't have testing

688
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:13,819
labs because the existing labs that had

689
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:15,859
the equipment and the know-how are

690
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:17,809
banned from working with candidates

691
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:19,879
because they all require FDA and federal

692
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:21,409
licenses yeah so we had to build these

693
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,550
from the ground up I didn't know there

694
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,740
were 18 of them in the state that's

695
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:26,210
pretty cool okay yeah so it says a

696
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,650
separate bill advanced Thursday in a

697
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,140
Senate committee would allow industrial

698
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,790
hemp growers to use the labs to Colorado

699
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,160
currently allows farmers to grow hip

700
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:35,509
marijuana's non-intoxicating cousin but

701
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,490
only if the plants fall below a

702
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:40,210
threshold for the plants intoxicating

703
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,440
ingredient THC it's not an ingredient

704
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,360
however the farmers can take their

705
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,670
plants to a lab to make sure they're

706
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:48,079
meeting the standard the testing bill

707
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,090
creates what's called a reference

708
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,679
library a standard set of protocols for

709
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:53,799
testing

710
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,630
the lab owner said the state needs to

711
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,000
essentially referee all the

712
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,560
methodologies that were using we all

713
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,150
understand the need to reveal the

714
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:03,190
special sauce we've been using to

715
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,870
further the industry behringer said the

716
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,509
bill now heads to a separate committee

717
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:11,679
before consideration by the full house

718
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:13,690
full house I just watch that I agree

719
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,519
this needs to happen do we need to know

720
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,009
this is huge it's one of the beautiful

721
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,539
parts of legalization is it's it's like

722
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:21,460
everything else these guys are the

723
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:23,950
regulators they need to be regulated if

724
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,809
people the testing labs for sure need to

725
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,130
know what they're doing they'll be using

726
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:29,349
the same equipment playing by the same

727
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,320
rules we're gonna start seeing reality

728
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:35,139
in our testing but you can spot [ __ ]

729
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:39,509
on the shelf if you're us like I know

730
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,509
your flower doesn't have 40% THC the big

731
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:50,500
claims they have a 30% strain and I've

732
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:52,359
seen it and it's mids it is not 30% it's

733
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,869
definitely not there yeah I know about

734
00:30:52,359 --> 00:31:01,929
the National remember the guy that was

735
00:30:55,869 --> 00:31:04,239
all hyped up about his 29% yeah yeah I

736
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,250
think so yeah the apple pie strain and

737
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,750
we both took one look at it we both look

738
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:11,049
at him we both looked at us and it was

739
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,279
like we tried not to giggle we all saw

740
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:14,950
you - there's pokerface right then

741
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:19,750
definitely it was mids everyone knows

742
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:22,809
when you [ __ ] the bed to have just

743
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,279
saying like but now with these testing

744
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:25,929
labs if we get them all standardized and

745
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:28,240
regulated then we won't have to worry

746
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:30,160
like if you're like this hash was tested

747
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,049
super clean and super high in potency

748
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,370
I'm like what where'd you get it done

749
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:35,019
did you get it at the place that you pay

750
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:37,299
a lot more and they just give you really

751
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:39,160
high reasonably small yeah did you go to

752
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:40,839
the place it's reputable like if you got

753
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,460
a test it steep hill I trust you but I

754
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:44,470
don't know any of the other places steep

755
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,090
hill gave me a tour of their facility

756
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,740
and showed me what's going on

757
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:49,389
they blew my mind all the other places

758
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,009
you just give them a sample and they

759
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,890
drive away and send you an email later

760
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:55,900
they're not there they're 100% cannabis

761
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,270
to correct or yeah that's all they test

762
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,460
is red so do you edibles in your right

763
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:02,619
absolutely

764
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:06,759
toy like oh yeah we got we got science

765
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:09,039
stuff in here it's more important as we

766
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,420
just required that all edible dosing be

767
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,909
pretty much perfect

768
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:15,670
yeah you guys remember how that first

769
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:17,470
regulatory check went through yeah that

770
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:22,210
was like episode six I think that was a

771
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:24,430
long time ago we talked about that THC

772
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:28,840
and they had zero at appear what's going

773
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:31,210
on kick a man for the [ __ ] up last year

774
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:32,500
but yeah there are a whole bunch of

775
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:35,110
companies that couldn't make it in then

776
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:38,230
we had new rules that require that only

777
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:41,439
ten milligrams of THC are in each easily

778
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:46,450
identifiable segment which meant no more

779
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:49,299
450 milligrams of Snickers Mountain

780
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:53,460
medicine bar so delicious somebody
