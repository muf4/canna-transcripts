the outdoor season yes i may do some

141
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,719
outdoor stuff this year i don't talk

142
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,319
about it because i don't like too many

143
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,840
people knowing you don't need to know

144
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,519
what or where i'm doing outdoors because

145
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,359
that gives people too many opportunities

146
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,478
too many people out there suck so i've

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,080
got to keep that a little bit on the

148
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,319
down low until it's done and then i'll

149
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,599
tell you all about it but it is time for

150
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,918
everybody out there if you're going to

151
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,280
grow outdoors in north america i guess

152
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,959
if you're in other parts of the world

153
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,559
you may be wrapping up outdoors right

154
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,879
now maybe done i don't know where you

155
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
are but in north america here it is

156
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,918

157
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,280

161
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,560
time to start thinking about it if you

162
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,560
don't have seeds or clones or some sort

163

165
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,399
about it start figuring it out but there

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,399
are many things to think about before we

167
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,159
decide what plants to put outside how to

168
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,879
get them where to get them from let's

169
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,600
think about it um selections the first

170
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,918
thing on my note here is selections what

171
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
does good in your area let's find a

172
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:57,519
selection for you a plant a clone a

173
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,879
cultivar um the line the kind of the

174
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,560
strain is what a lot of people are going

175
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,279
to say the strain that will work best

176
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,360
for you in your area

177
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,359
many people are going to try to focus on

178
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,800
hype uh right now there are strains that

179
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,639
are popular i'm not going to say any

180
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,840
because then the breeder of that strain

181
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,600
will get back to me and say hey you said

182
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,038
my strain was hype there are a lot of

183
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,199
things that are just popular because of

184
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,879
social media and because of the name and

185
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,600
maybe a rapper saying about it or some

186
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,519
[ __ ] and it's not super quality it looks

187
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,960
good on instagram it's frosty it looks

188
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,478
nice but it doesn't have

189
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,120
mold resistance it doesn't have bug

190
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,839
resistance think about more important

191
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,720
things other than hype terps potency and

192
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,879
yield

193
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,880
does that plant work in your environment

194
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,879
if it doesn't finish on time where you

195
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,719
are the terps don't matter the potency

196
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,719
doesn't matter the yield doesn't matter

197
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
if it's not done before the first frost

198
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,880
comes in your area it doesn't matter how

199
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,879
good that plant was going to be it's got

200
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,800
to get finished if your plant can't

201
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,879
handle heat or fog or drought or

202
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,400
humidity or whatever comes to your

203
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,079
neighborhood your environment throughout

204
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,399
that grow season it won't be able to

205
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,519
survive until the harvest so don't focus

206
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,478
strictly on terpenes production flavor

207
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,839
buzz

208
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,598
weights don't think about that kind of

209
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,000
stuff as much it's important trust me

210
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,319
that does matter but more importantly

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,240
the resistance the ability the skills of

212
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,240
that plant can it survive where you are

213
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,240
that's much more important than a lot of

214
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,160
those other things so can that plant

215
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,360
take the uh i'm not sure where you are

216
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,639
that's why i said maybe it's going to

217
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,479
get drought conditions if you're in

218
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,478
arizona it's going to get hot as [ __ ]

219
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,519
and really dry if you're by the ocean

220
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,199
you're going to get humidity you're

221
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,478
going to get air coming off of the ocean

222
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,000
with a lot of water in it you're going

223
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,478
to get windy environment you're gonna

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
get fog can your plants handle the fog

225
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:34,959
if you're up in the pacific northwest

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,639
you're gonna get different [ __ ] if

227
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,239
you're in colorado different [ __ ]

228
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,918
mississippi different [ __ ] it's gonna be

229
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,560
different wherever you are so get plants

230
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,719
that will work best for you and your

231
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,079
environment then think about where are

232
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
we going to grow where is your

233
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,439
anticipated space and think about it

234
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,279
heavily you're going to have those

235
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,639
plants out there for months it's not

236
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,918
just going to be a couple of weeks to

237
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,400
camouflage them you're going to be out

238
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,240
there daily taking care of them tending

239
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,399
them watering them you've got to feed

240
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,879
them prune them twist them lollipop them

241
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,239
check on them i manage bugs manage

242
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,919
problems you're going to be touching

243
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,598
them every single day it's not as easy

244
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,680
to be secretive about these plants as a

245
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,120
lot of people would like to think where

246
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,639
are you going to do this are you going

247
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,680
to do it in the backyard you're going to

248
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,960
do it in the front yard you're going to

249
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,038
do it on the side of the house do you

250
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,399
have a big ass field where are you going

251
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,918
to do it do you have a big field way out

252
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,918
in the middle of nowhere where do you

253
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,000
plan on doing this think this through

254
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,519
very well think about from the day you

255
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,120
plant it to the day you cut it down to

256
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,478
the day you dry it cure and smoke it

257
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,800
what are you going to do with this plant

258
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,038
and the product have a plan now let's

259
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,639
set ourselves up for success we're going

260
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,479
to harvest around halloween and we need

261
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,879
to start thinking about it now in march

262
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,719
i know that sounds crazy but plan ahead

263
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,158
that's the only way we win when we're

264
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,000
growing cannabis don't come to the part

265
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,519
where you're like uh it's day 50 what do

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,440
around day 30 so you can prepare

268
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,439
at least be ahead all right where are we

269
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,680
going to grow does your anticipated

270
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,839
growth space get enough sun you get

271
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,039
enough direct sun are there uh slight

272
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,320
interruptions are there dark

273
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,000
interruptions is there a lot of [ __ ]

274
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,360
around there that is going to come on

275
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,120
lights that are going to come on during

276
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,200
the night cycle and possibly disrupt

277
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,120
your photo period is there a lot of [ __ ]

278
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,959
blocking the sun is there a lot of wind

279
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
there what kind of environment are you

280
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,239
in are there animals are there pests are

281
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,080
there intruders what kind of ground do

282
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
you have there are you going to grow in

283
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,639
beds are you going to grow in pots are

284
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,320
you going to go straight in the ground

285
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,240
are you going to build a greenhouse what

286
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,160
kind of obstacles and challenges is your

287
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,278
anticipated grow environment going to

288
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,838
bring you

289
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:28,000
do you have regular access to this place

290
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,360
a lot of people think ah there's a hill

291
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,879
a mountain that goes this way if you

292
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,480
take that one hill by the creek and take

293
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,639
a left nobody will ever find that spot

294
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,560
sure awesome can you get there every

295
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,639
single day to apply water to those

296
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,079
plants is that going to be safe also is

297
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,360
that a safe place for you to grow i

298
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,120
think that's coming up on the notes

299
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,399
let's think let's look ahead is that

300
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,480
compliant and legal we're just going to

301
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,039
jump right into it is that location

302
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,399
compliant and legal i know some of us

303
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,319
are going to do our own thing we may

304
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,039
grow where it's not legal we may be in

305
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,480
an illegal area but be careful don't

306
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,399
grow on federal land if you're growing

307
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,560
in a state park federal land land owned

308
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,679
by a lawyer or somebody prominent in the

309
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,119
community you could really shoot

310
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,958
yourself in the foot growing on that

311
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
land it could be even worse than just

312
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,278
growing in your own land so be careful

313
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,920
where you choose to grow in colorado an

314
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,919
outdoor grow must be secured and locked

315
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,159
up and inaccessible to thieves or

316
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,599
children or anybody like that it cannot

317
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,439
be available to school kids or

318
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,278
neighborhood kids it's got to be in a

319
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,880
greenhouse with a lock on it where

320
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,200
nobody can get in there that also does

321
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,958
work kind of helps to work as thief

322
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,399
deterrent it will not be the best way to

323
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,518
keep a thief out if the thieves want in

324
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,720
there they're going to get in there

325
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,278
that's something we're going to segue

326
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,040
into before that let's talk about a

327
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,200
lawyer if you're going to grow cannabis

328
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,799
legally or illegally especially an

329
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,800
outdoor crop where people can see it

330
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,599
things may go wrong i highly recommend

331
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,199
you develop a relationship with a lawyer

332
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,440
a lawyer will become your best friend

333
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,200
you don't want to ever need them but

334
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,880
it's great to have a lawyer on speed

335
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,079
dial a lawyer on the team a lawyer in

336
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,919
the crew that's already got a bag of

337
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,199
money with your name on it so every time

338
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,479
you call you go lawyer this is my

339
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,519
problem and they just reach into the bag

340
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
they take out a couple of the hundred

341
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,720
dollar bills or a thousand or a couple

342
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
thousand dollar bills and throw it in

343
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,680
their stack and they go all right here's

344
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,039
how you solve the problem and they just

345
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,879
check out how much money they've taken

346
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,000
out of your bag and you both know got a

347
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,360
little bit of a balance with you over

348
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,200
there whenever i call there's money in

349
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,360
your desk so you're gonna talk to me get

350
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,440
a relationship with a lawyer this sounds

351
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,039
crazy be a hundred percent honest with

352
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,800
your lawyer about what you're doing if

353
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,879
you're growing illegally tell that

354
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,359
lawyer you're growing illegally tell him

355
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,039
where why how and what your plan is that

356
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,560
way he can prepare for when [ __ ] goes

357
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,838
wrong because there's a good chance [ __ ]

358
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,439
could go wrong that's why we've got a

359
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,959
lawyer let him know what you're doing

360
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,399
that lawyer needs to know the details

361
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,639
because if there's a case built against

362
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,839
you whoever's building that case has

363
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,679
every [ __ ] detail it is 2022 they've

364
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,200
got aerial photos they've got documents

365
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,639
from where your phone was they've got

366
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,079
everything you've posted on social media

367
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,039
all your credit card receipts your car

368
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,719
mileage your gps in your car your onstar

369
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,399
your anti-theft piece

370
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,920
something is tracking you you're being

371
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,519
snitched on by yourself by your

372
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,599
equipment by your technology by your

373
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,440
movement all day every day so if you're

374
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,278
going to do something they are building

375
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,959
a case against you make sure your lawyer

376
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,399
knows every detail of the case as well

377
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,479
so that he can help you when the time

378
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,240
comes i know that sounds sketchy but

379
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,720
you've got to think about what if when

380
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,120
you were entering this type of

381
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,639
enterprise environment activity you do

382
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,320
need to be prepared so shout out to the

383
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,919
lawyers shout out to the people keeping

384
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,839
us safe on the team behind the scenes we

385
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,599
need them just as much as we need the

386
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,839
growers the smokers the breeders the

387
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,040
tremors everybody the lawyers are

388
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,560
essential

389
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,799
all right we've talked about the lawyer

390
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,479
now i'm going to segue into a part that

391
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,919
i don't like talking about but this is

392
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,079
required when we're talking about

393
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,159
growing outdoor cannabis you've got a

394
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,439
big-ass plant outdoors somebody may have

395
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,799
seen it maybe you ran your mouth and

396
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,480
told somebody about it maybe the one

397
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,719
person you told told two people they

398
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,920
told two people now like 17 people in

399
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
your neighborhood know they all know you

400
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,360
got that big plan out there they all

401
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,720
know your schedule because we're humans

402
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,000
we're predictable we all do the same

403
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
[ __ ] all the time mostly just because

404
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,320
that's how life works

405
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,559
that plant is at risk somebody may

406
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,160
decide to come try and remove that plant

407
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,159
from your grow space without your

408
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,159
permission people are [ __ ] people

409
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,838
are desperate especially now we had a

410
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,439
lot of things disrupt the world people

411
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,519
are struggling people are doing dumb

412
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,440
[ __ ] to try to stay afloat somebody may

413
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,360
try to come get that plant

414
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,360
i don't know what you're going to do

415
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,278
when somebody ends up in your yard

416
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,120
trying to take that plan if you were

417
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,399
growing illegally my advice is just let

418
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,399
them take it

419
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,919
i don't think that anybody's life is

420
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,078
worth a cannabis plant if they're

421
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,519
stealing my plant from my backyard i am

422
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,919
not going to shoot somebody for that

423
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,600
plant if that is what you choose to do

424
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,159
that is what you choose to do but i want

425
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,839
you right now to take a moment and think

426
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,480
about what am i going to do if somebody

427
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,399
comes in that yard to steal my ganja

428
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,639
plant then once you've decided what

429
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,519
you're going to do think about would a

430
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,519
jury agree with your decision if you do

431
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,519
choose to blast somebody down because

432
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,519
they're stealing your ganja plant a

433
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,839
judge and a jury may think that you have

434
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,198
decided that that person's life was

435
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,519
worth less than your medicine now to you

436
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,919
it may be but does the judge and the

437
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,919
jury agree i don't want it to ever come

438
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,919
to that point i really truly don't but

439
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,159
that is something we must think about

440
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,399
somebody may try to steal your [ __ ] how

441
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,639
are you going to protect it how are you

442
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,000
going to deal with it then down the line

443
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,919
how are you going to deal with this for

444
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the next five years if you protect your

445
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,759
crop this could be a legal case that

446
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,240
could cause a lot of problems so think

447
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,759
about that before the plant goes outside

448
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,919
how am i going to deal with this a lot

449
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,439
of people in america are gun happy we've

450
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,278
all got a gun since the pandemic

451
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,720
everybody's ready to protect themselves

452
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,799
are you ready to bring that out and

453
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
protect your crop i don't recommend it i

454
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,759
wouldn't shoot somebody for weed plants

455
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,720
in my backyard if you went back there i

456
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,078
don't have weed plants i live in the

457
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,278
[ __ ] city my neighbors could just

458
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:36,479
[ __ ] reach over and take anything

459
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,078
they wanted basically they wouldn't

460
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,278
shout out guys i love you but they would

461
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,278
see the ganja plants they'd throw a

462
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,439
[ __ ] fix i live in the [ __ ] city

463
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,039
and [ __ ] here um if they were out there

464
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,480
and he tried to steal him i'd just say

465
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,240
hey man don't don't [ __ ] hurt the

466
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,839
neighbors don't shoot any dogs don't

467
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,799
[ __ ] up the fence just get what you need

468
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,160
and get out of here bro just get the

469
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,439
[ __ ] out don't come back that'd

470
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,639
basically be my approach that's why i

471
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,800
don't grow outside cause i'm in the city

472
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,159
and somebody will will steal my [ __ ]

473
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,078
you've got to think now what you might

474
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,519
do i don't want to go on too much about

475
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,919
that let's move forward because i don't

476
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,278
want to think about it um is is hitting

477
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,599
somebody worth your crop is shooting

478
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,720
somebody worth your crop or is i you've

479
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,839
got to think about it now because i

480
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,278
don't want you to be in that position to

481
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,199
have to panic and think about it plan

482
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,039
ahead any sort of thing when it comes to

483
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,639
defense tactical strategy you should be

484
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,559
thinking way ahead so

485
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,079
now let's talk about preparation

486
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,919
let's talk about something a little bit

487
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,399
more light-hearted a little bit less

488
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,078
creepy our whole goal is to grow weed

489
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,399
outdoors this year we want to produce an

490
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,679
outdoor crop we've got free sunshine

491
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,440
we've got an environment out there that

492
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,758
is probably ideal for growing cannabis

493
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,279
if you're in north america so how are we

494
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,278
going to prepare prepare for this what

495
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,799
is your main strategy how do you want to

496
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,159
do this are you going to grow

497
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,439
organically are you going to grow with

498
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,799
salt are you going to grow like i said

499
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,000
before are you going to grow in a

500
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,439
greenhouse are you going to grow in

501
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,720
raised beds are you going to use pots

502
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,160
are you digging holes and going straight

503
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,120
into the ground

504
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,039
do you plan to amend the soil

505
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
do you plan to just water every day and

506
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,039
put bottled nutrients into there what is

507
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,439
your goal the next thing to think about

508
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,198
is water how are you going to get water

509
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,240
to your grow space a lot of people may

510
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,679
think they're going to grow out there on

511
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,759
that plot of land their uncle left them

512
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,439
a few years ago how's the dirt out there

513
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,440
how is the soil out there more

514
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,800
importantly is there access to water do

515
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,560
you have a truck you can load up enough

516
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,240
water to take out there as frequently as

517
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,559
needed do you have a place you can get

518
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,240
that much water out there water is a big

519
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,919
thing to think about that people really

520
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,680
overlook when it comes to preparing for

521
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,679
an outdoor grow it's one of the most

522
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,439
essential things but you don't think you

523
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,039
don't realize how much water that plant

524
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,720
is going to need they're going to grow

525
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,639
crazy fast outdoors they're going to get

526
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,399
real tall real bushy it's going to get

527
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,639
100 degrees out there they're going to

528
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,639
want to drink a lot of water depending

529
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,560
on where you are if the earth is real

530
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,919
rocky if it's real damp they may need

531
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,919
more they may need less water but

532
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,360
they're going to get thirsty now a big

533
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,479
thing to think about

534
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,320
and maybe i should have talked about

535
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,680
this earlier but what is your budget

536
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,600
what kind of budget do you have do you

537
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,000
have budget a budget to buy a bunch of

538
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,079
nutrients to amend the soil do you have

539
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,519
a budget for really good genetics do you

540
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,599
have a budget for all of the stuff you

541
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,480
need or you want a shoestring budget

542
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,000
use your budget wisely i recommend good

543
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,078
genetics if you don't have good genetics

544
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,679
to start with you cannot meet the goals

545
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,279
you are hoping for so start with good

546
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,679
genetics like i said the correct

547
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,439
genetics in your environment so you need

548
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,280
good genes whether that's clones or

549
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,880
seeds you need good genetics we're going

550
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,558
to talk a lot more about that in a

551
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,319
moment then i would recommend getting

552
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,078
that soil amended well so you've got all

553
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,759
the things you need in the soil i'd

554
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,519
recommend investing in a couple of top

555
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,480
dresses for later on in the flowering

556
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,918
phase

557
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,720
make sure you allocate a little bit of

558
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,799
that budget for pest management and uh

559
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,200
pest deterrent maybe you've got deer or

560
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,558
bunny or bear or [ __ ] something else

561
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,319
wherever you are i don't know where you

562
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,399
are you're going to have to allocate

563
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,319
part of the budget to mitigating damage

564
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,759
from pests don't forget about that so

565
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,319
think about the budget think about what

566
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,519
you're going to need plan ahead

567
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,279
do you have a helper do you need

568
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,759
somebody to help you how are you going

569
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,918
to pay them don't [ __ ] your helpers over

570
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,839
i know so many friendships relationships

571
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,840
bro ships bromances that are [ __ ]

572
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,000
dead because people have built groves

573
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,519
together one guy had land one guy had

574
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,279
plants another guy had an idea and they

575
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,279
all said at the end of this we'll split

576
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,798
it up three ways and we'll all win guess

577
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,798
what one guy took all the [ __ ] and now

578
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,160
two people are mad those two people talk

579
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,839
[ __ ] about guy number three every time

580
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,600
they get a [ __ ] chance guy number

581
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,279
three doesn't have any [ __ ] friends

582
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,038
[ __ ] goes weird when that happens don't

583
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,879
ruin friendships over growing cannabis

584
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,960
that's not what it is about cannabis is

585
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
to unite us to unify us don't [ __ ] your

586
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,360
friends over if you hire them to grow

587
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
for you

588
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,399
take good care of the trimmers don't be

589
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,919
a [ __ ] to the tremors because

590
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,559
without them your product looks like

591
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,559
[ __ ] love and respect all the tremors

592
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,399
pay the [ __ ] out of them tip them all

593
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,839
right where do we go from there uh we

594
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,840
got the budget figured out how about

595
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,678
security what are you going to do for

596
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,359
security we talked about your plan for

597
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,038
the lawyer what are you going to do to

598
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,199
keep that growth safe and secure the

599
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,119
number one thing that i can recommend

600
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,240
for keeping a growth safe and secure is

601
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,239
to shut the [ __ ] up if nobody knows

602
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,079
about it nobody can steal it don't tell

603
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,279
anybody about it nobody needs to know

604
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,798
your best friend doesn't need to know

605
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,160
your girlfriend doesn't need to know

606
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,359
that girl you brought over that one

607
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,640
night doesn't need to know that dude

608
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,479
from the dispensary doesn't know your

609
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,120
friend at work doesn't need to know

610
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,319
nobody needs to know but you that way

611
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,479
nobody's mooching off you when it's

612
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,319
harvest time also nobody needs to know

613
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,919
about that plant out there if they can

614
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,839
see it there's a problem keep it where

615
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,440
nobody can see it because that seeing

616
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,279
that plant invites thieves a lot of

617
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,360
people are not thieves until you wave

618
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,519
some [ __ ] in front of their face if you

619
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,918
go hey look 10 foot tall weed plant free

620
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,279
weed free weed free weed for a week for

621
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,038
two weeks for three weeks they're just

622
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,558
watching it get bigger by the end of the

623
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,839
fourth week a motherfucker's gonna jump

624
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,678
a fence and get your weed and you're

625
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,519
just taunting them at this point so

626
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,640
think about security keep your [ __ ] safe

627
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,558
protected uh covered be smart about it

628
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,480
i know people that say nobody's gonna

629
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,399
jump this fence and get that

630
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,079
who what what the [ __ ] neighborhood do

631
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,000
you live in somebody's going to jump

632
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,199
that fence and get that [ __ ] i think the

633
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,880
other way because of where i'm from

634
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,480
where i was raised that shit's going to

635
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,160
get stolen that's just how it is if you

636
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,839
leave something outside where i'm from

637
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,200
that's just like sam it's free it's just

638
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,199
putting a [ __ ] free sign on it where

639
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,440
i'm from so step up your security get

640
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,360
your [ __ ] prepared also keep in mind

641
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,360
booby traps are illegal if you guys set

642
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,719
up a booby trap to protect your grow and

643
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,399
somebody gets hurt you did commit a

644
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,240
crime you can be charged with the

645
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,400
original cannabis crime and an assault

646
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,519
charge and a booby trap charge don't do

647
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,880
that kind of [ __ ] also if law

648
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,918
enforcement were to stumble into that

649
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,120
booby trap that's an extra charge

650
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,480
i don't know maybe some people don't

651
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,558
care about the rules and laws but keep

652
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,240
in mind booby traps are an extra crime

653
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,759
you'll get an extra trouble for that all

654
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,679
right where are we going from here we

655
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,359
have got some of the most important part

656
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,200
is going to start coming up now males

657
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,798
and females and tested cuts is what i've

658
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,480
got written on my list

659
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,000
you guys at the end of the grow season

660
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
in the middle of the grow season i start

661
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,119
seeing people post really heartbreaking

662
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,960
pictures i see people posting six foot

663
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,279
tall 10 foot tall plants that are as big

664
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,798
around as a volkswagen and they're super

665
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,558
bummed out because they just found out

666
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:47,119
that that boy is either interest or that

667
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:50,158
that plan is either a boy or an intersex

668
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,319
plan this is easily easily preventable

669
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,240
the the key to this is don't run into

670
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,839
untested cuts outside don't put some

671
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,640
[ __ ] outside that you did not run

672
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,199
indoors one time and establish what that

673
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,600
plan is is it a boy is it a girl is it

674
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,919
intersex is it a mutant is it a total

675
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,599
piece of [ __ ] don't put plants outside

676
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,120
until you know what they are

677
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,000
i do understand that it can be

678
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,000
challenging to acquire or obtain seeds

679
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,279
or clones or something to grow this year

680
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,960
i get it you might be new you might be

681
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,519
in a place where there's

682
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,000
limited or minimal or maybe no access

683
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,918
but still you've got to be very careful

684
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,839
if you put a male plant outside and you

685
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,919
don't know it's a male plant that male

686
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:31,279
plant could flower and pollinate every

687
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,960
crop for miles where i am in the city of

688
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,319
pueblo colorado we've got a lot of

689
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,960
growers here a lot of people like to

690
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,798
grow outdoors there are also many

691
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,558
commercial grow facilities just a few

692
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,119
miles from me that grow outdoors they've

693
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,038
got outdoor grow facilities if one of us

694
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,119
busted out a male plant and let it just

695
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,558
full-on skeet pollen everywhere for a

696
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:53,279
week we would ruin crops not just a crop

697
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,960
we would ruin crops of crops around here

698
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,519
and that is a dick move don't be that

699
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,279
guy to let a male plant go and ruin

700
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,440
everybody else's crop because you are

701
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,639
not a responsible grower i know it's

702
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,000
hard to get the plants that's what i

703
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,600
started with but

704
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,400
maybe you can trust your friends maybe

705
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:10,558
you can trust your dispensary but

706
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,240
nobody ever says hey i might have a

707
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,240
disease everybody says no i'm clean and

708
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,159
then guess what one day you find out you

709
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,839
got some [ __ ] everybody does the same

710
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,280
thing with their plants they give you a

711
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,798
clone and they go bro my garden's the

712
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,119
[ __ ] cleanest there's no bugs in

713
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:25,359
there the people that boast and brag the

714
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,119
most about having the cleanest garden

715
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,959
generally have the worst [ __ ]

716
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,519
problems is what i have learned so be

717
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,038
careful where you get your clones from

718
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,599
if they come from a dispensary if they

719
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:37,599
come from a friend definitely expect

720
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,918
them to have a problem expect them to

721
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,599
have spider mites fungus gnats thrips

722
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,480
something of that nature maybe powdery

723
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:46,798
mildew it is your job to treat those

724
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,480
incoming plants for those bugs you are

725
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,319
now the gardener you're now the farmer

726
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,640
it is your job your duty your

727
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,480
responsibility to get this crop from

728
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,400
beginning to end successfully that is

729
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,200
your only goal as the farmer is to

730
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,200
harvest a successful smokable profitable

731
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,120
crop so you've got to get the plant and

732
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,038
it is now your job to treat them for

733
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,879
bugs and for mildew and make sure that

734
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,720
these problems don't expand if they do

735
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,320
come with the plants now when you get

736
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,960
these plants

737
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,960
if you get seeds or plants or clones is

738
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,880
what i'm trying to say i would test them

739
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,279
that's why i'm saying get them now it is

740
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,320
march this would give us time to at

741
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,279
least sex test our plants it is very

742
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,759
easy

743
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,918
you can run a small plant indoors and if

744
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,960
you put it under 12 hours of lighting or

745
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,720
it's 12 on and 12 off in about 10 to 14

746
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,798
days that plant will show you if it's a

747
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,880
male or a female don't put the boys

748
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:40,158
outside call them chop them down throw

749
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,159
them away only put female plants outside

750
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,840
definitely do a sex test before you put

751
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,278
things outside because like i said we

752
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,519
don't want that male plant out there

753
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,359
ruining everybody's garden

754
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,038
now something else to think about is

755
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,319
that clone may have been tested by your

756
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,879
friend it may have been ran by your

757
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,519
friend but do you trust their selection

758
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,440
i like to grow from seed indoors make my

759
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,599
selections then put those selections

760
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,360
outdoors your first run with the plant

761
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,959
shouldn't be outdoors i understand that

762
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,119
not all of us have an indoor setup we

763
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,519
can't all get plants and clones and test

764
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,399
them but ideally you would get a pack of

765
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,960
seeds do a pheno hunt indoors find the

766
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,880
good one then put it outside and one of

767
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,798
the important things i want to get to is

768
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,440
maybe that clone that you got from your

769
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,839
friend was awesome in his indoor grower

770
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,759
in her indoor grow or maybe in his or

771
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,319
her indoor grow or outdoor grow in

772
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,919
california but where are you outdoors

773
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,079
maybe that plant that was selected in

774
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,440
norcal won't do the best in virginia

775
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,519
maybe something that was selected in

776
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,360
jamaica and grew amazingly there won't

777
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,558
grow as well in upstate new york maybe

778
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,639
something that grows really well in

779
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,319
upstate new york won't grow as well here

780
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,720
in colorado there's different

781
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,319
environments different environments it's

782
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,079
basically it different parameters which

783
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,079
these plants have to survive through

784
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,319
find the plants that work best in your

785
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,000
area if you can find an outdoor grower

786
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,240
who's been growing in your area for

787
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,319
generations they probably have the

788
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,480
plants that work the best for them for

789
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,639
you in that area because they know what

790
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,159
to expect they know that around the

791
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,679
middle of august it's going to get real

792
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,520
hot and then as september goes on it

793
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,360
starts to get real damp and then by

794
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,798
october it gets foggy they're going to

795
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,158
know the [ __ ] to expect and they know

796
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,000
the day it's going to snow and so they

797
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,080
know that this plant will finish right

798
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,679
before the snow usually comes so pay

799
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,759
attention to those local growers and see

800
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,600
what they're growing don't fall for just

801
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,440
hype don't buy [ __ ] just for hype like i

802
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,759
said earlier it's got to be able to take

803
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,038
temperature swings bugs

804
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,200
humidity

805
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,119
heat dryness it's got to handle a lot of

806
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,798
[ __ ] outdoors that it never got shown

807
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,399
indoors so make sure you're getting

808
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,720
clones that are good for the outdoors

809
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,080
not just for an indoor grow environment

810
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,919
so if you're going to buy a pack of

811
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,199
seeds i highly recommend you get i would

812
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,120
recommend if you're going to go straight

813
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,679
outdoors i would definitely recommend

814
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,519
feminized seeds that will eliminate the

815
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,519
opportunity for male plants you do still

816
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,359
have to keep a close eye on them there

817
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,038
still is the opportunity for intersex

818
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,439
plants you can get problems mutants

819
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,919
freaks still pay attention but it will

820
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,159
cut the chances in half of finding a boy

821
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,080
it'll cut the chances probably 99 of

822
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,240
finding a boy is what i should say

823
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,918
so that'll help you out you had a 50 50

824
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,599
chance of getting boys in there you just

825
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,120
cut that part right out of the equation

826
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,240
now you've got girls so if you're going

827
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,558
to get the seeds you're going to grow

828
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,120
them outdoors i would definitely sex

829
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,960
test them before you put them outside

830
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,479
don't just run them outside because then

831
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,880
you're going to be heartbroken or if you

832
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,319
do grow them outside grow extra and pay

833
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,039
very close attention and look for the

834
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:28,399
boys because like i said you've got a 50

835
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:30,000
chance of regular seed being a male

836
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,600
plant so pay very close attention to

837
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,839
those plants you do grow outside if you

838
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,759
did not sex test them all right ladies
