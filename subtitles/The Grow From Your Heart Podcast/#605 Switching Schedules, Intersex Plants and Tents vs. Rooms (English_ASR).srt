episode i've got quite a few emails

46
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,239
selected

47
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,799
before we get there let me do a quick

48
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,599
update i did an episode talking about

49
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,118
light leaks

50
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,879
and light leaks during the night cycle

51
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,478
causing problems for our plants

52
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,478
i got a lot of messages saying yeah but

53
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,078
what about the moon i grow outdoors and

54
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,920
the moon is really bright and the moon

55
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,759
does not mess with my outdoor plants

56
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,920
you are absolutely correct the moon is

57
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,680
part of nature if the nature if the moon

58
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,478
disrupted our plants outside nature

59
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,560
would be [ __ ]

60
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,640
so let me explain briefly why the moon

61
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,439
does not disrupt your outdoor flowering

62
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
plants

63
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,199
as the sun sets it puts off a red

64
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,799
spectrum i don't know that the sun

65
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,240
actually puts off the red spectrum

66
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,799
something with the atmosphere the angle

67
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,519
of the sun

68
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,479
and the sky create a red spectrum of

69
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,239
light that happens

70
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,679
in our environment and is fed to our

71
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,319
plants the plants receive that red

72
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,360
spectrum

73
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,319
that is known as far red lighting that

74
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,759
far red lighting

75
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,359
triggers something in our plants knows

76
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,199
it known as phytochrome

77
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,040
that phytochrome red response makes the

78
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,399
plants think oh it is sleepy time

79
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,239
and i should go to sleep we are

80
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
basically giving the plants a little

81
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,159
dose of nyquil when they see that red

82
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,640
light spectrum so they go to sleep there

83
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,000
a little more solidly put to sleep than

84
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,719
the plants that we have in our indoor

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,560
garden

86
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,080
unless you're supplementing with far red

87
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,598
light pucks so

88
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
the reason your plants are not freaking

89
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,039
out outdoors is because of that far red

90
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,200
spectrum has put them to sleep

91
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,639
they are in a more deep sleep state than

92
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,079
our plants that are in the

93
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,318
indoor environment because they're not

94
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,519
getting sun and they're not getting that

95
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,759
far red also

96
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,840
your grow lights your flashlight does

97
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,518
not compare at all to the sun they're

98
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,800
used to getting that sunshine all day

99
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,400
that's the most intense

100
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,480
light they can get it's also the proper

101
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,080
light so they're getting the best light

102
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,639
the most intense all day then they get

103
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,120
that far

104
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,119
red spectrum triggers phytochrome that

105
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,759
is why they do not freak out from the

106
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,200
moonlight

107
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,280
it is nothing compared to that bright

108
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,639
sunlight they're getting that combined

109
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,158
with the far red spectrum the

110
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,000
phytochrome red response

111
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,199
they do not freak out outdoors due to

112
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the moon

113
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,839
they will however freak out outdoors due

114
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,959
to your porch light or a street light

115
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,200
right above your garden

116
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,239
that is all plant specific but the moon

117
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,839
should not disrupt your plants however

118
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,640
unnatural lights still do have the

119
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,239
opportunity

120
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,158
to disrupt your plants in the night

121
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,680
cycle outdoors i hope i've cleared that

122
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,359
up i hope i made that clear

123
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,719
a big shout out to everybody who sent me

124
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,720
that question because i got that

125
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,039
question from at least 10 people

126
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,919
they said why don't my plants freak out

127
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,079
from the moon

128
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,839
that's how nature works dude so why i've

129
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
cleared that up now let's move into the

130
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,319
uh

131
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,158
real part of today's episode i've got a

132
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,280
bunch of emails here in front of me i do

133
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,519
have one more note

134
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
i am still selecting testers you guys i

135
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,799
sent an episode out a while back telling

136
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,200
you how to become a tester

137
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
asking for tester applications i got

138
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,719
probably

139
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,319
2500 tester applications they are in a

140
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,840
folder i'm going through them

141
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,359
don't feel discouraged don't feel

142
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,560
dismissed or forgotten if you have not

143
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,239
gotten a reply

144
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,080
i am going through testers and i am

145
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,120
still selecting testers they are still

146
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,200
being sent out

147
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,878
so keep your hopes up and keep in mind i

148
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,639
don't just do testing once there are

149
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,959
always new things being created so i'm

150
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,879
always going to need new testers

151
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,560
i'll select about 10 testers for every

152
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,000
batch of seeds that i'm trying to do

153
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,918
when i send them out i do about 10 at a

154
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,519
time so i'll select 10 testers

155
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,519
i'll get them going then i select about

156
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,639
10 more get them going select about 10

157
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,799
more get them going

158
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,400
chances are seven out of each batch of

159
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,079
10 are going to reply which will give me

160
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,198
three open spots for the next time i'm

161
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,000
looking for testers

162
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
i've got 70 reliability on the testers i

163
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,959
send stuff

164
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,160
out to so testers will fall off new

165
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,198
testers will be needed

166
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,639
don't feel like you missed an

167
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,319
opportunity don't feel like i ignored

168
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,079
you don't feel like i blew you off

169
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,599

196
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,399
this one comes from our friend yee

197
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,720
[ __ ] ha and it goes a lot like

198
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,439
this

199
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,919
greetings rosted jeff recently why my

200
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,439
wife

201
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,439
mentioned to me that she thinks she

202
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,279
would like to try her hand at growing

203
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,639
her own medicine that is awesome

204
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,638
i love it when the wife tries to get

205
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,160
involved with growing she's smoking it

206
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,000
why shouldn't be she be right in there

207
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,600
helping you growing is not a boys club i

208
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,600
think the ladies should be involved

209
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,919
so it says how awesome is that dude that

210
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,479
is awesome a family that grows together

211
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,439
uh grows together literally then it says

212
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,599
i am currently

213
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,478
i currently run my lights from 6am to

214
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,080
6pm

215
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,000
because i work from home and it's just

216
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,000
been convenient that makes sense

217
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,759
however with her work schedule and

218
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
spending time with our family this time

219
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,879
frame is not going to work

220
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
so you've got it on your perfect

221
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,240
schedule but it doesn't include the wife

222
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,638
so we need to make some adjustments

223
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,400
very logical and rational needs here it

224
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,439
says i'm thinking about switching

225
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,120
from 9 pm to 9 00 am so we can both go

226
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,038
into the garden together when the lights

227
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,800
come on and the kids are in bed

228
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,719
that is a great strategy it makes a lot

229
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,319
of sense you guys will both be home at

230
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,639
night the kids are in bed you can hang

231
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,240
out

232
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,079
you can smoke you can go in the garden

233
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,879
then you can wrap up the night together

234
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,560
also electricity is cheaper at off-peak

235
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,399
hours so you will save a couple of bucks

236
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,399
on the electric bill by doing this

237
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,079
it goes on to say i run a perpetual

238
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,318
flower space and i hate to make this

239
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,318
drastic time change on my girls

240
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
but i'm willing to do it if it means

241
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,000
sharing my passion with my wife that is

242
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,199
great dedication a great sacrifice

243
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,918
you're ready to make

244
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,840
now the question part is my question is

245
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,560
how fast can i make the transition and

246
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,119
timing

247
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,079
for my lights on at 6 am to my lights on

248
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,560
at 9 00 pm

249
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,359
without having detrimental effects on my

250
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,959
plants

251
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,560
my thought is to change my timer by

252
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,239
three or four hours at a time

253
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,319
but leave a week or two between those

254
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,000
changes to let plants adjust

255
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,439
would that be a better uh would that be

256
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,399
harmful overall

257
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,918
or just [ __ ] it and swap the timer

258
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,638
thanks again for all you do for us

259
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,478
2020 surely would have been much much

260
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,240
much much worse without the grow from

261
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,399
your heart podcast in my ears

262
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
and i read genetics in my garden that's

263
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,000
a great compliment thank you i'm glad i

264
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,478
could make 2020 a little bit better for

265
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,560
you

266
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,159
it looks like we're off to making 2021

267
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,959
even better for you already

268
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,720
here is my solution for your uh it's not

269
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,560
a problem but it is a question here's my

270
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,479
answer for your question

271
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,519
excuse that i'm sorry if you heard that

272
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:46,159
come through the microphone i do

273
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,159
apologize

274
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,400
excuse me here is the answer i would not

275
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,759
gradually slowly change the timer i

276
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,519
wouldn't do that that's probably going

277
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,400
to be more confusing more stressful to

278
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,719
the plants

279
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,239
i myself would let's see the lights go

280
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,960
off at 9 00 a.m

281
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,240
when they go off at 9 00 a.m unplug them

282
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,959
leave them unplugged

283
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,560
i'll let that 9 pm let's see i'm reading

284
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,839
this wrong let me back up normally the

285
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,959
lights would go off

286
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,839
at 6 00 pm so when they go off at 6 pm

287
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,478
today

288
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,598
unplug them let them stay unplugged all

289
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,079
the way until the next

290
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,878
6 p.m now you've done 24 hours of total

291
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,878
darkness

292
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,400
they got their 12 hours of sleep time

293
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,960
they're not going to freak out too much

294
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,120
on you

295
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,799
now what i would do is i would plug them

296
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,759
in turn them back on

297
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,839
at 9 00 p.m so you're gonna go 24 would

298
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,839
be six you're gonna 27 hours

299
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,440
you're gonna go about 27 hours of total

300
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,880
darkness before you get them back on

301
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,680
their normal schedule

302
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,158
but that is much less stressful to the

303
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,239
plants

304
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,360
than manipulating the timer a little bit

305
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,320
every day they're not going to know

306
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,839
what's going on

307
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,600
if you manipulate it a little bit every

308
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,760
day and they're constantly going to try

309
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,040
to adjust and catch up with your changes

310
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,039
and your manipulation

311
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,319
and that will not make the plants happy

312
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,480
the way to bite the bullet

313
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
like i said unplug that timer let it

314
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,440
stay unplugged for the duration of the

315
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,278
normal dark cycle

316
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
let it go for another extended dark

317
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,799
period and then plug it in at nine

318
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,639
o'clock when you want them to come on

319
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,639
the reason i say to do it for the

320
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,199
extended dark and don't do the slow

321
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,720
interval

322
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
is these plants are just going to get an

323
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,800
extended dark period they won't freak

324
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,159
out too much on a long dark period

325
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,599
they'll think they just got a nap

326
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,278
they may just think that it was a cloudy

327
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,000
day they didn't get any photons for that

328
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,080
day i find more problems more errors

329
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
more potential for intersex traits when

330
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,360
we manipulate the timer

331
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,120
too drastically too many times this is

332
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,480
one big switch they're going to take a

333
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,000
long nap and then they're going to wake

334
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
up and they'll be back on schedule

335
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,679
just like a person i think if you wanted

336
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,879
to if i changed my schedule from 9 00

337
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,239
a.m to 9 00 p.m

338
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,159
and you wanted me to work nights

339
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,759
tomorrow i'd probably just try to

340
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,600
sleep a long time and then wake up and

341
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,958
be refreshed from my brand new shift

342
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,200
i think your plants are going to like it

343
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,319
this way so they go off at let me make

344
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,920
sure i read the times right because i

345
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,080
want to give you the correct times

346
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,639
they currently come on at six and go off

347
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,200
at six so at 6 pm when they go off

348
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,600
unplug that timer let them run for 24

349
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
full hours off now you're back at 6 pm

350
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,639
you want to turn them on at 9 wait that

351
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,240
extra three hours and turn them right

352
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,879
back on and start your new schedule

353
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,560
there

354
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,639
make sure you've got that new timer set

355
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,078
from nine to nine make sure any other

356
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,838
timer you've got maybe you've got some

357
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,759
pumps some blowers some fans

358
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,360
maybe you got some other stuff set up

359
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,799
make sure that those timers are all

360
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,240
adjusted as well

361
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,838
now that you're running your lights at

362
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
night you may want to walk around the

363
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,320
exterior of your grow i don't know if

364
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,920
that

365
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,000
i've got a window right here if my grow

366
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,519
space was right here i would go outside

367
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,879
at night and make sure you can't see any

368
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,039
light through that window

369
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,958
also during the daytime i would go in

370
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,319
the grow and turn off all of the lights

371
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,838
and stand in there for a few minutes and

372
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,839
make sure none of the sunshine is coming

373
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,320
from that window into my grow

374
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,839
during their new dark period so there

375
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,600
are some things to investigate some

376
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,440
things to check and things to adjust

377
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,720
but i do think your plants will respond

378
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,800
and react quite well

379
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
to the longer uh what are we going to

380
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,599
give them 27 hours of darkness it looks

381
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,519
like

382
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,040
i think they will be just fine with that

383
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
extended dark

384
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,319
period you [ __ ] hot good luck

385

386
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,120

show please don't use my real name

405
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,240
we've got you used to we found we've

406
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,958
discovered your alias it says by the way

407
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,799

408
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,559
is really nice thank you i do appreciate

409
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,838
that uh if you're a new viewer a new

410
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,199
watcher a new listener

411
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,640
we got some new stuff here at the start

412
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,440
of the year we got a fresh new table got

413
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,199
some new paint

414
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,640
things are looking good it's exciting to

415
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,399
be in the new set

416
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,559
anyway i'm rambling so we'll keep moving

417
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,720
it says i hope you see this soon but it

418
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,399
probably won't matter at this point

419
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,320
uh instead of waiting to get this on the

420
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,440
show i actually replied directly to our

421
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,519
friend used to be cool

422
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,600
so he did get an answer right away it

423
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,000
says i've had a major league

424
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,759
herm issue in my flowering tent and i

425
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,159
can't figure out what i've done to cause

426
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
it

427
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,719
i'll give you some background first it

428
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,600
is a cheap 4x4 tint and it does have

429
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
light leaks

430
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
you've already named a big part of your

431
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,560
problem cheap tint

432
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,319
light leaks those are things we can

433
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,919
avoid we can fix let's get a better temp

434
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,839
and not have light leaks but

435
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,199
it is a completely dark room while the

436
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,000
lights are out

437
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,360
um hopefully uh hopefully it says i have

438
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,240
thoroughly checked this well then i'm

439
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,759
going to believe you

440
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,600
it says i was supposed to get a new

441
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,559
gorilla tent prior to the start of

442
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,320
flowering cycle

443
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,879
but after waiting two months for it to

444
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,560
rot to arrive it had a defective part

445
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,838
isn't that a bummer when you order grow

446
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,599
gear and you're on a deadline and the

447
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,360
[ __ ] comes and it's broken

448
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,879
oh that's so frustrating don't get me

449
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,399
started on a rant cause we could go all

450
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,078
day on that it says i'm supposed to get

451
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,320
a replacement part on monday

452
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,159
after only waiting another month for it

453
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
to come so i went into flower in the old

454
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,199
tent one more time

455
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,800
one last time understandable sometimes

456
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,759
we got to do what we got to do

457
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,278
but i think you know where you're

458
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,039
getting like light leaks you've already

459
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,879
said that tent is cheap and has

460
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,559
light leaks in it are you sure that that

461
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,519
room is completely dark are you going in

462
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,039
that room to

463
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,720
get something to check on something is

464
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,360
that other room getting lit up randomly

465
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,959
at night

466
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,320
are you the only person in the home or

467
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,599
the building where this happens maybe

468
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,639
somebody else is going in there

469
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,560
and you don't know about it and they're

470
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,759
flipping on the light not accusing just

471
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,319
mentioning options

472
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,559
it goes on to say my setup is four hlg

473
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,440
quantum board panels that i run at 130

474
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,359
watts each

475
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,600
at approximately 18 inches above the

476
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,120
tops of the plants sounds good so far

477
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,720
the four separate panels allow my

478
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,000
flexibility with plants of varying

479
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,399
heights i see that

480
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,759
i grow in living soil with smaller

481
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,559
plants and five gallon pots and the

482
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,198
largers in

483
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,399
sevens i feed recharge and mammoth p

484
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,159
once a week

485
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,759
i water two to three times a week

486
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,120
according to the need

487
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,559
i started with two clones of your

488
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,839
raphael two clones of mr soul cindy 99

489
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,439
and then i'm not going to read the other

490
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,560
ones because i do know that the other

491
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,480
ones did her

492
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,838
one clone of another strain one clone of

493
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,039
another strain

494
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,600
from seed and two of something else from

495
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,599
seed

496
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,480
it's easier to tell you what didn't herm

497
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,959
the raphaels and the cindy 99s did not

498
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,879
herm

499
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,719
big shout out to mr soul uh your

500
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,000
genetics and my genetics didn't herm in

501
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,519
this person's garden they got a whole

502
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
list of other stuff that did so

503
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,278
shout out mr soul you're doing good work

504
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,880
it says everything but these

505
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:19,838
were smaller plants and he did list some

506
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,480
plants and i'm not going to say the

507
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,760
names of them

508
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,278
because i don't need to call out these

509
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,639
other breeders and other seed companies

510
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:25,919
for having hermaphroditic plants that's

511
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,959
not what this is about that's not what

512
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,599
i'm here for

513
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,278
it says today was day 22 of flower my

514
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
habit is to check all of my plants on

515
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,958
day

516
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,480
15 for problems i also d-leaf on day 15.

517
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,719
good strategy so far

518
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,399
no pollen no pollen sacks were detected

519
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,480
on the plants on day 15

520
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
however i just had a feeling i should

521
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,720
check them again today

522
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,320
and i found pollen sag so we've got some

523
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
male plants popping up on your female

524
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,160
plants

525
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,240
not a good thing says two uh

526
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,600
two were so covered that i destroyed

527
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,120
them immediately

528
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,720
the other two i hoped i could save by

529
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,360
cutting off little limbs with the pollen

530
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,199
sacks

531
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,519
the sacks were all on the bottom half of

532
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,000
those plants uh that's a good strategy

533
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,519
that lower plant may hurt more early

534
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,559
more easily because it's not getting as

535
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,560
much light

536
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,078
but if they're herming that heavily that

537
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,359
quickly it's just gonna move around and

538
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,278
i would just get rid of them because i

539
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,519
don't want that to cause more problems

540
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,120
it says the reason i wrote is to see if

541
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,799
i have any chance of saving the

542
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,399
surviving hermed plants

543
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,919
i'm certain the pollen has been spread

544
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,000
to other plants but i'm not sure how

545
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,240
badly the other plants will be seeded

546
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,159
is there any chance no more pollen sacs

547
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
will grow and these plants can be saved

548
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,360
or should i just destroy the ones

549
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,879
that hermed they'll probably keep making

550
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,639
male parts they're already

551
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,559
triggered they already they already have

552
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,159
that tree uh once somebody shows you

553
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,679
it's an [ __ ] it's an [ __ ] it's not

554
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,559
gonna just stop being an [ __ ] because

555
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,159
you want it to

556
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,439
nothing's gonna change in there these

557
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,319
plants are gonna be [ __ ] till the

558
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,079
day they die

559
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,079
so they're probably gonna keep making

560
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,599
male plants it goes on to say thank you

561
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,278
for any advice you can give i hope you

562
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,519
have a great 2021

563
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,679
my 2020 sucked ass and i hope i never

564
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,560
see another year like that again

565
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,479
from our friend used to be cool bro i

566
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,239
apologize that your 2020 sucked i hope

567
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,759
we can make 2021 better

568
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,600
hopefully we can fix the garden and quit

569
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,839
having light leaks and herm issues

570
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
so i told him that the problem was most

571
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,360
likely light leaks is what i explained

572
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,800
in an email i did reply via email to get

573
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,720
a quick answer to my friend

574
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,039
then he said i do understand that but

575
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,560
can you tell me some of the major causes

576
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,240
of hermaphroditism

577
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,518
so i did kind of change the direction of

578
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,399
this message and we're going to talk

579
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,360
about things

580
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,078
that i believe will lead to intersex

581
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,959
traits in

582
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,559
our cannabis garden uh one of the things

583
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,958
that i wrote on my notes is

584
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,159
uh he's trying to save these plants he

585
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,679
wants to cut off some branches and

586
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,600
rescue them and have a harvest

587
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,359
i said with all the options available

588
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,879
why keep troublemakers around those are

589
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,480
[ __ ] plants let's get rid of them

590
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,320
and have a positive garden so i wouldn't

591
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,079
even waste time with those if you've got

592
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,199
the option i would just call them count

593
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,638
your losses now

594
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,078
get rid of them of course your crop's

595
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,120
already seeded so if you do want to

596
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:56,479
finish them out

597
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,000
the crops are already going to have

598
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,680
seeds in it so you can keep them going

599
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,278
but i would get rid of them i don't need

600
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,879
trouble makers in my garden i would get

601
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,640
rid of them immediately

602
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,439
now let's talk about the causes of

603
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,319
intersex traits hermaphroditic plants

604
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,000
male and female traits on the same plant

605
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,759
possibly the same branch let's talk

606
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,558
about what causes this

607
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,359
basically i wrote down genetics plus

608
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,838
environment

609
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,958
equals expression so you've got genetics

610
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,038
that hold the potential

611
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,240
to show intersex traits you give them

612
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,240
the right environment

613
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,679
that's when they will express their

614
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,120
intersex traits

615
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,640
we can bring out a lot of things in

616
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,719
plants we can bring out colors we can

617
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,600
bring out terps we can bring out flavors

618
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,240
aromas

619
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,798
structures potency we can also bring out

620
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
this

621
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,319
intersex hermaphroditic trait if the

622
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,280
plant does hold that trait

623
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,918
so what are the causes of intersex

624
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,200
plants

625
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,360
i said genetics some plants are just

626
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,798
genetically intersex plants they were

627
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,359
bred from plants that contain an

628
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:53,359
intersex

629
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,279
trait if one of your plants in your

630
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,639
breeding project has an intersex trait

631
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,359
you've got the opportunity

632
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,640
to pass that trait along it could be a

633
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,798
recessive trait

634
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,160
if your great-grandparent plant had that

635
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,200
trait it might not show up in the

636
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,960
grandparent it might

637
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,640
not show up in the parent but it may

638
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,919
show up in the next progeny

639
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,240
it could be hidden for several

640
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,880
generations but that intersex trait

641
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,558
is a trait and that comes from poorly

642
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,400
selected plants when breeding

643
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,240
plants need to be tested for intersex

644
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,240
traits before we breed with them

645
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,240
also after seeds are made you need to

646
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,400
grow them and make sure that those

647
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,599
plants don't possess the intersex trade

648
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,720
if they do they shouldn't be sold they

649
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,399
shouldn't be released

650
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,240
they should be grown by a private grower

651
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,160
and his own garden who knows what he's

652
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,200
created who's willing and ready and able

653
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,759
to take that risk so a lot of it is just

654
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,440
uh it is genetic what else could be

655
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,440
causing these hermaphrodites

656
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,360
poorly bred plants then we put them in a

657
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,360
room and we give them the environment

658
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,038
now let's talk about the environment

659
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,199
environmental triggers that will cause

660
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,038
our plants to show intersex traits

661
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,279
i've mentioned this a lot light

662
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,839
interruptions in the flowering phase

663
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,279
are notorious for causing intersex

664
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,038
traits in our plants that is one way

665
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,678
that i test my plants for intersex

666
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:03,759
traits

667
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,038
i give them light stress so if you've

668
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,879
got a dark period

669
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,798
your dark period should be 12 hours of

670
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,160
uninterrupted light or uninterrupted

671
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,160
darkness i apologize

672
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,919
or possibly 13 hours depending on what

673
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,519
schedule you've chosen to go to

674
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,360
do not interrupt that if you have to

675
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,038
turn on a light or walk in that room

676
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,119
you are running the risk of causing

677
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,759
intersex traits in your plants

678
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,678
so light leaks and light interruptions

679
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,319
are in my opinion one of the leading

680
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,440
causes

681
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,639
of intersex traits in our plants

682
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,720
another major cause is too much

683
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,320
heat if you get these plants too hot

684
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,400
early in flower

685
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,359
you can always cause them the

686
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,759
opportunity

687
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,918
to go intersex to throw male plants on

688
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,160
our female flowers too much heat

689
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,200
is a good cause of intersex straight uh

690
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,919
traits

691
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,880
root stress over watering sitting in

692
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,960
cold water

693
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,160
sitting in stagnant water sitting in

694
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,079
cold water

695
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,000
sitting in too warm of water all of

696
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,798
these things can cause stress to the

697
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,960
root zone

698
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,400
which in turn will make our plants show

699
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,960
intersex traits

700
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,440
these plants the main goal of a cannabis

701
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,919
plant

702
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,880
for the plant itself is to reproduce it

703
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,799
wants to grow

704
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,320
it wants to get pollinated it wants to

705
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,158
make seeds and it wants to be grown

706
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,720
again next year

707
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,159
cannabis plants have this magical trait

708
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,600
if they are not pollinated

709
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,520
if you keep growing them long enough

710
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,599
they will do everything that they can to

711
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,240
produce their own seeds to grow next

712
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,319
year

713
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,679
if we give these plants the triggers

714
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,439
they are more than ready

715
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,360
to create seeds on their own and

716
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,798
continue their generations these plants

717
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,199
are survivors

718
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,038
your goal is to produce big fat beefy

719
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,038
buds with ripe trichomes and amazing

720
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,679
aromas and amazing flavors and a nice

721
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,240
buzz

722
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,240
the plant's whole goal is to reproduce

723
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,919
we are tricking it into not reproducing

724
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,599
by not putting pollen near it

725
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,520
but the plants do hold the trait that

726
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,599
they can unlock within themselves

727
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,839
to become self-sufficient and create

728
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,918
seeds on their own so we have to avoid

729
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,599
the environment and the triggers for

730
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,038
that to happen so don't keep your plant

731
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,240
too wet too cold

732
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,038
too dry or in standing water for too

733
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,359
long

734
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,240
also another cause of intersex traits

735
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,240
can be over

736
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,519
feeding if we over feed these plants

737
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,960
they can say hey i don't know what's

738
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,798
going on i'm getting cooked

739
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,319
i'm just gonna make some pollen sacks

740
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,158
and try to reproduce and make some more

741
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,079
seeds and try again next year so

742
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,760
over feeding can put our plants into a

743
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,960
panic mode that can cause

744
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:24,240
intersex traits another major cause of

745
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,960
intersex traits

746
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,798
is bug infestations i've seen

747
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,159
infestations in commercial grows and

748
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:30,879
private grows where they've hired me to

749
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,640
go help

750
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,640
that the plants are so stressed they're

751
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,640
beginning to hermaphrodite on you

752
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,159
so if you've got bugs and the bugs are

753
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,720
real bad it's time to get rid of the

754
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,039
bugs

755
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,400
get some predators in there or consider

756
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,000
just chopping that [ __ ] down and

757
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,679
starting over if you're starting to see

758
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,759
intersex trades because your bugs are so

759
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,240
bad you really need to step up your

760
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,240
integrated pest management system

761
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,599
another thing that can cause plants to

762
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,480
go herm on us

763
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,439
or show intersex traits is just basic

764
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,079
stress

765
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,240
basic surprises we talked earlier about

766
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,918
just changing a timer two hours a day

767
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,440
that's basic stress those plants don't

768
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,200
want that two hours a day that's why i

769
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,038
recommended go a long dark period let

770
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,640
them sleep then wake them up fresh

771
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,158
if we keep doing a bunch of random

772
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,799
chaotic [ __ ] to them

773
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,440
drastic swings in temperature drastic

774
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,158
swings in

775
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,600
feeding solution temperature drastic

776
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,919
swings and humidity

777
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,038
those things will trigger the intersex

778
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,240
traits in our plant

779
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,319
they'll say hey i don't know what's

780
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,079
going on man is it the end of the world

781
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,839
i'm getting stressed out something bad

782
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:30,720
is going to happen to me i must

783
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,798
reproduce

784
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,038
we must continue our generation for the

785
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,038
next year they will figure out a way

786
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,558
to go hermaphrodite on you and make some

787
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,839
seeds so that they can grow

788
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,839
again next year

789
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,158
all right just had to check my timing so

790
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,798
those are most of the major

791
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,080
causes of intersex traits in my opinion

792
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:51,918
i'm sure there are other things that

793
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,720
will cause intersex traits to appear in

794
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,200
your plants

795
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,079
if the plant holds the intersex trait it

796
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,480
just depends on

797
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,678
how strong that trait is sometimes we

798
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,440
see purple in plants

799
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,600
sometimes we don't see purple sometimes

800
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,038
we see intersex sometimes we don't

801
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,959
it's a trait that can be carried in the

802
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,200
plant sometimes it's a strong gene

803
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,880
sometimes it's a not so strong gene it

804
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
just depends on if you give the proper

805
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,559
environment

806
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,000
to trigger that trait in that plant all

807
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,839
right i'm going to read one more message

808
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,200
before we start wrapping up this podcast

809
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,158
and this one goes

810
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,519
just like this it says hey ross to jeff

811
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,840
i've been using your gear for a little

812
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,359
bit

813
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,639
and it's fire thank you for the

814
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,000
compliments and i'm glad you're having

815
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,080
success with my seeds

816
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,640
it goes on to say i'm currently running

817
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,879
a two-tenth setup i've got a 4x4 and a

818
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,720
5x5 great setup so far

819
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,240
it says both are running spider farmer

820
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,079
sf 400 lights

821
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,759
one is stuffed with golden goat my

822
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,519
question is what are the pros and cons

823
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,200
of taking down these two tents

824
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,720
and putting up panda film to build a

825
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,558
5x10 room

826
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,880
is it better to have everyone together

827
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,839
or is it better to run multiple tents

828
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,440
i'm on cannabuzz uh name prohibited and

829
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,079
organic andy make sure you guys go

830
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,919
follow name prohibited and organic andy

831
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,000
on cannabis shout out to my cannabis

832
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,120
crew this is a great question our friend

833
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,240
has two tents

834
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,918
and they are wondering if they should

835
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,278
just take down the two tents and build

836
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,840
one big room

837
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,480
there are pros and cons to both of those

838
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,480
things

839
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,839
having one big room means you've got one

840
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,319
big room to work with

841
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,918
i am six foot five i don't fit in a grow

842
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,439
tent trying to stand up in a grow tent

843
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,159
is a pain in the ass for me

844
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,120
i prefer a big room however i've got a

845
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,200
big grow room

846
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,158
with a grow tent in it what i know

847
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,840
that's weird right

848
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,600
i've got a breeding room where i keep

849
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,278
all of the females in one section

850
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,798
and the male plant goes in a tent so

851
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:33,599
that i can control his environment

852
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:35,599
separately

853
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,519
i can get him flowering before everybody

854
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,879
else i've also got a filter in there so

855
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,319
i can suck out the pollen

856
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,240
so that the pollen doesn't get to my

857
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,558
female plants too early

858
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,640
so i've got a grow room with a grow tent

859
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,720
in it i've got a lot of experience using

860
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,559
tents i've got a lot of experience using

861
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,400
bedrooms or basements converted into

862
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,240
grow spaces i've also got a lot of

863
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
experience turning giant warehouses into

864
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,120
grow spaces

865
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,080
so i do see the pros and cons of both

866
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,678
if you have the small spaces that is

867
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,038
less trimming at one time

868
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,120
you may be able to set that up on a

869
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,558
perpetual grow but if you've got one

870
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,000
tenth that finishes at one time and

871
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,119
another that finishes another

872
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,119
you know that these are going to get

873
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,639
trimmed you can put a veg space in here

874
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,158
you can run flour in here you can have

875
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,679
two different light cycles

876
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,520
that's really advantageous you don't

877
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,880
have one harvest at one time and you've

878
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,639
got two light cycles

879
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,320
so now you can have one vegging one

880
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,440
flowering you can always have one 30

881
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,439
days into flower

882
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,360
one 30 day or just starting so you can

883
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,798
have offset schedules there that's

884
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,079
advantageous

885
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:36,319
um power consumption if you've got two

886
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,079
small tents you only need to control the

887
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,200
environment in those two small tents if

888
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,000
you build a big room

889
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,519
you've got to power the big room also

890
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,038
you may need to climb and control the

891
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,480
two tents differently you've got two

892
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,440
different sizes one's going to get more

893
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,038
humid than the other

894
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,558
how are you moving that air around if

895
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,038
you take the tents down you got one big

896
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,079
room

897
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,960
with one constant humidity and vpd going

898
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,240
on in the room

899
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,640
so that's a couple of things to think

900
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,159
about it is much easier to dial

901
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,278
in a small room uh than it is to dial in

902
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,679
a large room

903
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:07,278
also if you've got those two tents maybe

904
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,798
you've got some plants that like

905
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:12,558
uh a lot of humidity or plants that like

906
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,639
real low humidity you can put those in

907
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,079
two different tents maybe you've got

908
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,679
uh maybe you want to reduce the light

909
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,119
cycle or increase the light cycle on

910
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,960
110. you can do that with the two

911
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,079
different tints you cannot do that

912
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,759
in one big room i mentioned before

913
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,199
i'm too [ __ ] tall for a grow tent so

914
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,000
if you made me grow in a bunch of grow

915
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
tents

916
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,119
i'm going to get cramped i'm going to

917
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,120
get frustrated the plants in the back

918
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,079
are not going to get as much work

919
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,439
they're not going to get as much

920
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,480
attention the plants up front are going

921
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,159
to look stellar

922
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,519
the stuff i can't get to is going to be

923
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,360
a mess if i'm in a room

924
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,558
i can walk around every single plant i

925
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,000
can look at every plant

926
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,759
i don't have to keep ducking and bumping

927
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,798
my head on [ __ ] so i think that the

928
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,919
rooms are better

929
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:52,400
for me if you've got the grow tents

930
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,679
that is one more layer of protection

931
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
you're not going to get as many

932
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,159
opportunities

933
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,919
for light leaks like we talked about

934
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,799
earlier in your grow tent the grow tent

935
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,400
is in a room

936
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,079
you can black out the tent then you can

937
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,519
turn off the lights in the room you know

938
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,918
that you are double dark

939
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,440
uh if you have that no tent environment

940
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,159
and you walk into that room you open up

941
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,519
that door

942
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,919
there is a light leak in there the

943
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,359
plants are exposed so there are a couple

944
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,840
of options to that

945
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,519
both work great it's all about finding

946
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,278
what works best for you if you want that

947
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,639
one big room that is super comfortable

948
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,480
that is easy to work in

949
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,399
but you can't have separate light cycles

950
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,880
you can't have separate environments

951
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,479
uh and if you get an infestation of bugs

952
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,240
it's definitely in the entire room

953
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,360
sometimes you can contain things to one

954
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,960
tent

955
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,479
my favorite part about having the tent

956
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,240
is that you can veg in one area

957
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,240
you can flower in another or you can

958
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,839
have staggered flowering rooms

959
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,159
if you've got a big enough room to fit

960
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,720
the 5x5 and the 4x4

961
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,120
what i would almost suggest is use the

962
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,960
5x5 and the 4x4 as two

963
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,639
staggered flowering rooms so you got one

964
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,319
that starts on the first of the month

965
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,320
and then wait a full month and let that

966
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,918
flower 30 days the first of the next

967
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,918
month get that one flowering

968
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,520
now every 30 days you've got a crop and

969
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,720
you've got the rest of that bedroom or

970
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,599
whatever the room is

971
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,038
to use as a veg and clone and mom area

972
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,000
you've just bought yourself a veg and

973
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:07,839
clone space

974
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,359
so flower in the two tents and use the

975
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,158
rest of the bedroom the rest of the

976
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,398
basement

977
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,159
as the rest of your grow those veg

978
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,639
plants they can be under 24

979
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,360
18 6 of lights so you can just put them

980
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,960
in that room

981
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,038
and then you got your tents for 12 12

982
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,798
for blackout as long as your tints don't

983
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,038
have light leaks you just created two

984
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,599
perpetual flowering areas that are off

985
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,079
staggered cycles and you've got a full

986
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,359
veg

987
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:34,079
area so uh if that were my space

988
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,599
i would have a four by four a five by

989
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,839
five and a bedroom

990
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,639
inside of that uh grow space i don't

991
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,879
know if you've got

992
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,880
full access to the whole room or whatnot

993
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,278
but that is what i would do

994
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,039
so uh having tents is good because you

995
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,558
can have separate environments

996
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,319
if you got a problem in one tent you may

997
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,839
not have a problem in another tent

998
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,439
you can do different things in different

999
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,720
tents you can have longer light cycles

1000
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,320
shorter light cycle

1001
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,919
or you can have one big room where it's

1002
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,038
much easier to work and you don't need

1003
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,679
as much equipment

1004
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,519
so those are some of the pros and cons

1005
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,960
my uh my biggest thing is that i'm too

1006
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,200
big for the grow tents

1007
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,240
um i i'm just too big for them so i

1008
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,080
can't go in there and get the

1009
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,519
i can't stand up in a grow tan i can

1010
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,240
stand up in my grow rooms

1011
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,599
can't stand up in the tents i like both

1012
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,038
environments there's nothing wrong with

1013
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,439
growing intense i see a lot of

1014
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,798
people on social media bash grow tents

1015
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,640
people that have bigger environments say

1016
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,480
oh you're just a tent grower

1017
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,240
tents are amazing don't ever let a tent

1018
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,679
discourage you but i'm gonna read this

1019
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,359
again and see if i've got any more

1020
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,080
suggestions i can make based on what you

1021
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,558
wrote

1022
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,278
um no i think it's gonna be easier to

1023
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,839
dial in the two tents uh separately for

1024
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,599
custom cultivars but also i like the big

1025
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,079
room because it's just easier to work in

1026
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,000
so

1027
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:44,158
once again my wrap up is i would have

1028
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the two tents on staggered cycles

1029
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,520
uh maybe one run during the day and one

1030
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,200
during the night so that you can have 12

1031
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,558
12 in both tents and have them both

1032
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,159
constantly flowering

1033
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:53,599
uh which will save you on power

1034
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,600
consumption honestly

1035
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,199
i used to run two five by five tents in

1036
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,398
one room and one would come on at nine

1037
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,480
a.m to nine pm

1038
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,079
the other would be nine pm to nine am i

1039
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,839
did not have to upgrade the electrical

1040
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,519
in that room and i was still able to run

1041
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,599
both of my tents with a thousand watt

1042
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,599
light in there uh that's the old antique

1043
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,678
dinosaur lights used to run thousands

1044
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,038
uh of course now i've upgraded to leds i

1045
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,440
feel like i'm rambling but

1046
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:17,200
again uh i would do the two tents for a

1047
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,159
flower and use the rest of the room as a

1048
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,319
veg space

1049
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,440
if that is an option if not i would

1050
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,119
stick with the two tenths because it

1051
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,159
sounds like you got good control

1052
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,759
and a layer to protect from light

1053
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,360
leaks all right ladies and gentlemen
