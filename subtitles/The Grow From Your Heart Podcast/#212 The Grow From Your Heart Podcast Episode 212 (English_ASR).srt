[Music]

3
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,698
what's up podcast world it is the first

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,439
of the month it is throwback Thursday

5
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:44,030
and it's time for episode number 212 of

6
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,469
the girlfriend Hart podcast that's right

7
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,840
I'm coming in with a bonus Thursday

8
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:50,030
episode this week I am NOT doing the

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,010
chunk of old episodes this week I am

10
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,980
doing something a little bit differently

11
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,658
we are going to do a garden first of the

12
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,369
month garden checklist I'm gonna list of

13
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:59,960
things that you should be checking on in

14
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:02,209
your garden maybe you should check on it

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,710
more frequently than you do the first of

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,088
the month is always a good time to do a

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,159
garden check before we get to the garden

18
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:09,560
checklist let me do an update on an old

19
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,479
episode on an episode I think was the

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,549
last episode with Mike we read an email

21
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,859
about keeping the Terps allowed at

22
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:19,129
harvest time one thing I didn't mention

23
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:20,840
was fresh frozen if you really want to

24
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:22,939
keep those Terps loud chop down the

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,469
plants cut the buds off the sticks get

26
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:25,489
them into a bucket and freeze them

27
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:27,349
that's right

28
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:28,908
live resin is made with fresh frozen

29
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:32,000
material and it is the tur pious [ __ ]

30
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:34,039
you can get the HC FSC can be made with

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
fresh frozen or dry material that seems

32
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:37,909
to come out better with frozen so if you

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,850
want to keep the Terps loud freeze that

34
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,780
[ __ ] is your best bet

35
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,129
alright so let me dig into the notes

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,659
I've got here I've got a whole bunch of

37
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:47,328
notes we're just gonna go over some

38
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,560
things that you can do on the first of

39
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:49,158
the month it would greatly improve your

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,689
garden

41
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,490
probably prolong the life of some of

42
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:54,289
your equipment and maybe give you a few

43
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:57,048
more grams per watt in your grow so

44
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,280
let's get right to it on the first of

45
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,710
the month something I always like to do

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,939
clean my air conditioning filters if

47
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,339
you've got a homegirl with the portable

48
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:05,898
air conditioner you got that filter that

49
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,090
pops right out of the back just pop that

50
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:09,530
up take it to a hose take it to a sink

51
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,629
just rinse it off wipe it off real good

52
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,000
put it right back it doesn't take much

53
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:15,769
effort whatever erican whatever kind of

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,299
air conditioner you've got check the

55
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,739
filters see if they need to be replaced

56
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:20,450
see if they need to be cleaned to see

57
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,400
how often it needs to be done and do it

58
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:23,810
today it's the first of the month go

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,609
check them right now if they're clean

60
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,349
that's cool write it down think about

61
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:28,700
how long away from now you need to check

62
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,289
them go check them on the first and next

63
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:32,179
month if they're dirty [ __ ] change

64
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:34,030
them and keep an eye on how long those

65
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,870
things last without getting super dirty

66
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,939
something we should go over before we

67
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,950
get too far get a calendar get a

68
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:42,439
notebook start making some notes start

69
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:43,638
making some check marks if you don't

70
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,139
know when the last time you did some

71
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,850
[ __ ] was how do you know how long things

72
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:48,150
last how do you know when the next time

73
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,769
you need to change that bulb

74
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,480
that filter house how do you know if you

75
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,329
don't write it down so get a calendar

76
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,359
make a Google document some [ __ ] make

77
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,860
some notes keep things in check so

78
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,569
another thing I would recommend check

79
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,390
your bulbs I would recommend getting a

80
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:05,488
lumen meter in a lumen meter and a piece

81
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:08,488
of string or a lumen meter and a ruler

82
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,890
and what you're trying to do is put that

83
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,120
ruler and the lumen meter you're

84
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:13,708
measuring the distance from the bulb so

85
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,420
that you can be consistent so that every

86
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,729
time you measure the distance from the

87
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,979
bulb you were 12 inches away or 18

88
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,568
inches away whatever you choose then you

89
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:22,979
know exactly how many lumens you're

90
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,568
getting at that distance I like to use a

91
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,369
just a piece of string and hang the

92
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:27,449
lumen meter when the string hangs you go

93
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,039
right here you're like oh that's that

94
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:31,738
many inches and every time you know

95
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,019
you're that far from the bulb so lumen

96
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,938
meter check the bulbs you may be here's

97
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,920
one thing if you are pumping electricity

98
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:39,509
into a bulb and that bulb is almost dead

99
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,158
it's still receiving all of the

100
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:42,959
electricity but it's not putting out the

101
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:44,158
lumens or the par watts so you're

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,810
spinning money and you're not doing [ __ ]

103
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,150
to your plants you're just burning money

104
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,829
it's just the boxes outside spinning

105
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,000
your power meter is just of going but

106
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,129
you're not getting [ __ ] out of it so

107
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,909
place that bulb if it's not living up to

108
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:58,560
your standards and then write a note

109
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:00,180
mark down how long that bulb has been in

110
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,159
there every time you put in a new bulb

111
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,900
market they should only go from one

112
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,250
maybe two cycles I don't like to let

113
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,319
them go longer than that these double

114
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,269
ended bulbs they just burn out they

115
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,009
don't give you any warning swap them out

116
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,250
after one or two crops that is my

117
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:16,228
recommendation carbon filter covers you

118
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,569
guys I am guilty of this my carbon

119
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,579
filter cover completely looks like [ __ ]

120
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:21,959
in my photography it looks black I have

121
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,598
taken it off and I have cleaned it with

122
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,280
oxy clean I don't know what else to do

123
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,959
but I know it's not filled with dust and

124
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,129
dirt it's cleaned up so I mean you guys

125
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,120
need to take that [ __ ] off there and

126
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:31,589
clean it some of you guys just need to

127
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,788
cut it off of there throw it away and

128
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:35,038
get a brand new one from the pictures

129
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:37,348
I've seen on some of your instagrams so

130
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:39,360
your carbon filter cover may need to be

131
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:40,740
cleaned your a carbon filter itself may

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
need to be replaced we're gonna talk

133
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,240
about that and just a few more things

134
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,430
here ah check your ro filters if you're

135
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,050
running RO water check those filters and

136
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,819
membranes they may be getting funky they

137
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,870
may be sludged up you may be wasting

138
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:54,120
more water than what you're actually

139
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,788
cleaning you might want to check on that

140
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,709
stuff check all of your RO the fittings

141
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:00,219
the seals everywhere where it reaches or

142
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,989
where it connects check out

143
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,380
stuff make sure it's well sealed and not

144
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,850
leaking odd check clean the glass in

145
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,860
your sealed hoods if you've got those

146
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,370
ducted hoods like a Magnum with glass in

147
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,199
it clean that glass inside and out

148
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,389
debris carbon filter dust [ __ ] flies

149
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,879
around inside of there randomly clean

150
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,990
that let the bulbs cool down before you

151
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,149
get in there and clean it unplug that

152
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,439
[ __ ] wait like 45 to an hour and then

153
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,969
get in there and clean the inside of

154
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,639
that glass clean the outside of that

155
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,890
glass also make sure that all that

156
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,899
ducting is sealed make sure that all of

157
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,610
your from the let's see from the blower

158
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,169
or from the the carbon filter to the

159
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,160
blower to the ducting to the light to

160
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,080
the other side of the light to the

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,460
outside make sure that all of that is

162
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,689
sealed make sure you don't have any air

163
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:43,689
leaks make sure you don't have any light

164
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:45,790
leaks all right so check the timers for

165
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:47,680
accuracy and settings I know this sounds

166
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,480
like a no-brainer but sometimes power

167
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,430
goes out sometimes equipment [ __ ] up

168
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,040
go look at all of your timers make sure

169
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,660
they are set for the correct time maybe

170
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,430
daylight savings time happened and you

171
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,919
didn't fix it just go make sure they're

172
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,720
all set at the correct time also make

173
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,250
sure they are set for the correct cycles

174
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,720
maybe you [ __ ] up something maybe you

175
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,490
had an idea maybe you got high one night

176
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,580
and bumped into something just go check

177
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,490
it's always a good idea um let's see

178
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:14,769
what else check your smoke alarms and

179
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,329
fire extinguishers I know that isn't

180
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:17,978
something we all think about but if you

181
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:19,689
were growing cannabis in a home or a

182
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,310
commercial environment you should have

183
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:23,769
smoke detectors and fire extinguishers

184
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,509
on hand what are you gonna do if you

185
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:27,250
have a fire and you don't have a fire

186
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,539
extinguisher you're gonna burn down the

187
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,490
[ __ ] house you're gonna be that guy

188
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,919
that burned down the house growing weed

189
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,939
so have a smoke alarm inside the grow

190
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,750
that's my advice and have a smoke fire

191
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:38,910
extinguisher that word was hard to pull

192
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,110
out of my brain have a fire extinguisher

193
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,930
outside of the gross space if something

194
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,090
does I don't want it to ever please John

195
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,590
no fire but if some fire does happen in

196
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:49,029
your grow you don't want to run in there

197
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:50,560
and discover it and have the fire

198
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,579
extinguisher in there where the fire is

199
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
you want to be able to kick open the

200
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:55,209
door with that fire extinguisher in hand

201
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,829
and spray the [ __ ] out of it

202
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:58,719
it's gonna cost you your plants but you

203
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:01,839
want a house more than any of those

204
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,280
[ __ ] plants so check on your smoke

205
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,079
alarm and fire extinguisher check the

206
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,639
battery make sure that battery is good

207
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,939
make sure that smoke detector beeps like

208
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,740
it's supposed to make sure that your

209
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,509
your fire extinguisher has a nice heavy

210
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,960
charge on it make sure it's still got

211
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:15,339
some juice

212
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,349
there's a little gauge on there that'll

213
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:18,818
tell you and they come with a date they

214
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,259
only last so long till you have to go

215
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,720
get them recharged so check that stuff

216
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:24,910
out safety is important you guys if you

217
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,940
are using co2 get your Co to set up

218
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,439
inspected um or get it refilled if it

219
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:30,969
needs to be refilled start refilling it

220
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,860
on the first and fifteenth if it lasts

221
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,180
you two weeks but get check everything

222
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,669
make sure that your meter is working

223
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,699
well run it too high and see if it's got

224
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:41,109
a safety feature on it test that [ __ ] do

225
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,879
it while you're there so that if it does

226
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,280
[ __ ] up you know it's going to have a

227
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,159
safety turn off when you're gone test it

228
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:51,369
that is my advice what else can you do

229
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,139
on the first of the month um I said

230
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,269
earlier checking about on like light

231
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,470
leaks and using your checking for carbon

232
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:58,389
filter problems and needing to replace

233
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,280
your carbon filter here's something a

234
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,829
lot of people don't think about go

235
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,109
outside your grow and walk around go

236
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:07,269
check for smell go check for light leaks

237
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,060
go check for anything that doesn't look

238
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:11,439
ordinary go check for odd sounds go

239
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,509
check for anything that would make you

240
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,209
think hey there's a grow in here because

241
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:17,500
if you walk by go walk your dog go do

242
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:19,719
something random and just walk around

243
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,800
your house a few extra times go go look

244
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,150
like you're doing something go be

245
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,139
suspicious at your own house you can

246
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:24,939
walk around but what you're actually

247
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,680
doing is looking to see if you can hear

248
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,930
see or smell anything that is involved

249
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,120
with your grow and if you can hear see

250
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,379
or smell anything you need to correct it

251
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,788
maybe you can feel something maybe you

252
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,139
can feel the ground vibrating from a

253
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:37,240
blower you've got in the basement I

254
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,429
didn't know what you could have going on

255
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,740
but go check for light leaks go check

256
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,939
for smell leaks go check for any damage

257
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,528
you may have done when you were working

258
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,959
inside and didn't pay attention to the

259
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:48,730
outside because if you notice it then

260
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,528
somebody else will notice it because

261
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,209
people are [ __ ] nosy there's one

262
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:54,070
person in your neighborhood that wants

263
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,929
to catch you slipping for some reason

264
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,089
and don't give them the reason okay

265
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:59,799
they're either gonna smell it they're

266
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,149
gonna see it they're gonna do something

267
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,799
and they're gonna get nosy and they're

268
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:04,509
gonna get curious and if they can see it

269
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,399
or smell it then law enforcement may get

270
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:08,049
involved maybe the person that sees it

271
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,990
smells it hears it feels it maybe they

272
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:12,519
are a thief or a crook just be careful

273
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,589
you don't want to push yourself in any

274
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,559
position you don't need to be in so just

275
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:19,990
go out there and check it out um I said

276
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:22,028
earlier get a calendar and make notes of

277
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,889
all of these checks and start doing this

278
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:26,078
on the first and maybe on the 15th of

279
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:27,789
every month and I really think that a

280
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:31,139
few small steps like this

281
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:34,139
could greatly improve your garden also

282
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:37,929
it's a good idea to go in the grow room

283
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,490
during your light cycle if it's light oh

284
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:40,839
it's okay when it's light outside or

285
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,610
light wherever else go in your grow room

286
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,649
and turn off the lights and see if you

287
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,259
are getting any light inside of the room

288
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:48,490
coming from the outside see if you're

289
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,059
getting a light leak from under your

290
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,879
door

291
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:53,139
see if there's a hole in your ducting

292
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,879
sometimes the light will travel down

293
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:56,649
ducting and right back through your

294
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,269
light reflector and the sunshine will

295
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:59,919
work like your light and you'll be

296
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:02,620
getting sunshine in your plants during

297
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,179
your night cycle or just depends on how

298
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,549
your shits going but I'm talking about

299
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:10,750
check for light leaks during your cycles

300
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:12,819
in your grow if your see my lights are

301
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,039
on at night so the sunshine is on the

302
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,450
sunshine is up on my plants or asleep so

303
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,699
I really have to make sure no Sun gets

304
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,810
into my grow in my personal grow that

305
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,460
that's what I'm talking about I don't

306
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:23,109
know what you've got setup but make sure

307
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,170
no lights getting in during your dark

308
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,340
cycle also it may be a good idea to put

309
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:28,959
some green lights in there and just pop

310
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,790
in once or twice and see what the night

311
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,590
cycle feels like how humid is it how

312
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:34,539
funky is is there anything weird in

313
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,280
there just pay attention to what's going

314
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:38,439
on in your grow a few things like this

315
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,120
would greatly improve your cannabis you

316
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,440
may spot something that you did not know

317
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,789
about I had a friend that had some huge

318
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,220
problems he couldn't figure out what was

319
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:47,019
wrong with this plants he called me over

320
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,370
it was during his day cycle I said turn

321
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,289
off all your lights we looked and you

322
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,820
could see light just beaming in through

323
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,110
one window where the board wasn't over

324
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,240
properly and that was what was causing

325
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,970
all of his plants in one section to her

326
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,220
so something small could be something

327
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,019
huge could save you a lot of money could

328
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,420
give you some better product all right

329
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,620
I hope that was a quick rundown on stuff

330
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,909
you should do on the 1st of the month

331
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,289
also I skipped a couple of things

332
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:11,469
there's a small section here I skipped

333
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:14,409
calibrate your ppm meters calibrate your

334
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,940
EC meters calibrate all of your [ __ ] now

335
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:18,069
is a good time to calibrate it it's the

336
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,560
first of the month also do a water test

337
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,550
see what's coming out maybe there's

338
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,559
something in there that you weren't

339
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:24,969
aware of maybe you need to adjust to the

340
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,829
water that's coming out I like to do a

341
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,889
water test every now and then and write

342
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,810
down the PPM's in the EC and the the TDS

343
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,569
and see what's in my water just so I

344
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:37,419
know I'm just weird like that

345
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:38,680
also clean up the first is always a good

346
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:40,689
time to clean up there's a mess you've

347
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,500
been dodging clean up also it's the

348
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,690
first

349
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,649
pay your electric bill pay your rent pay

350
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,020
all of your bills and don't look

351
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:48,879
suspicious that will help you keep the

352
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:49,980
go the grow going alright you guys I

353
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,360
feel like it ran through the checklist

354
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,820
let's see what else did I want to talk

355
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,379
about today

356
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,150
keeping your garden clean and organized

357
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:00,730
and keeping all of your nutrients and

358
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:02,500
your pesticides all organized is a huge

359
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,779
part of garden cleanliness and

360
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,340
organization is a huge part to me about

361
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,870
having a successful garden I was talking

362
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,850
about writing everything down I write

363
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,679
down every feed I give my plants I write

364
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,990
down every spray I give my plants I

365
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,669
write down a lot of [ __ ] I have a Google

366
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,080
document where I write some things I

367
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:19,569
have a notebook where I write some

368
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,379
things my phone is filled with cannabis

369
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,680
Wizardry

370
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:25,509
what I'm getting at is the garden you

371
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,489
are growing is a reflection of yourself

372
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:29,679
as a person I think when I walk into

373
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,570
somebody's garden I can see the inside

374
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,009
of their mind I can see the chaos that

375
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,540
is in their mind I can see the order

376
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:36,460
that is in their mind I can see their

377
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,559
thought processes by the way they

378
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,379
organize their gardens their grow lights

379
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,119
their rows of plants how their nutrients

380
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,980
are taken care of I think a garden is a

381
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,960
reflection of yourself if you are

382
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,789
growing straight for money and for greed

383
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,440
and for [ __ ] purposes your garden will

384
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:52,120
show it if you're drawing from your

385
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,090
heart and breeding with love your garden

386
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,379
will show it if you were too chaotic and

387
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,910
too [ __ ] up in your life right now

388
00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:00,759
your garden will show it if you are

389
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:02,409
focused and centered and doing things

390
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,659
correctly your garden will really

391
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:06,490
probably reflect that as well if you

392
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,860
were a person like me most of the

393
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,230
gardens I've been to I can see this um I

394
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,730
have been to many personal private

395
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,379
gardens for years and years I was a

396
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,940
consultant here in a small town when the

397
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:18,009
medical marijuana boom took off and I

398
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,920
got to visit I've been in a hundred

399
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:23,500
private gardens in this town and I I can

400
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,240
see if you lined up ten people and then

401
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,950
let me walk into ten grow rooms and then

402
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,299
put them all like put the guys in a

403
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,220
lineup I hear oh yeah that guy goes to

404
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:31,959
grow room a that guy goes to grow room

405
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,399
pee I could probably assign the people

406
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,519
with a short interview and a little of

407
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,340
who has which grow because I think the

408
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,919
gardens reflect ourselves that very much

409
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,840
so take care of your garden because it

410
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,429
is a reflection of you the pride you put

411
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,720
in your garden shows it shows in your

412
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:50,199
finished product it shows in your

413
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:54,819
pictures I just shows we can see it also

414
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,919
your nutrient decisions strongly show me

415
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:58,298
what'd you have in mind for this plant

416
00:13:56,918 --> 00:14:00,100
it shows me if you're growing for just

417
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:01,358
money if you're growing for quality if

418
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,548
you're growing for patience if you're

419
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:06,220
growing for your nutrient selections

420
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:08,558
strongly show me where your heart and

421
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,418
mind are in your grow and yes I'm using

422
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:12,249
veg bloom at a commercial growth because

423
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:14,198
we are growing on a commercial level I'm

424
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:15,879
also using veg bloom in my private grow

425
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:18,099
and I'm also using botanic or I use

426
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,569
botanic air at home and my personal grow

427
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,308
because I think it tastes the best

428
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:23,558
that's my favorite flavor it gives my

429
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:25,448
herb something funky it's just that it's

430
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:27,728
a lot of chicken [ __ ] and seabird guano

431
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:29,198
and stuff like that and I think that see

432
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:30,459
product that's in there really makes my

433
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:31,719
blood taste good that's why I use

434
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,578
botanic carry because I've been using it

435
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,168
for a long time I've tried a lot of

436
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:38,438
other bottled nutrients in botanic your

437
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:40,958
gamy the flavor I like I don't spray

438
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:42,818
with ridiculous stuff I don't feed my

439
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,708
plants ridiculous stuff botanic hair is

440
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:46,719
mostly on the organic side it's got some

441
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,938
stuff in there that's not but most of

442
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,879
the products do I don't do the fully

443
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:53,259
organic stuff because I don't feel I

444
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,839
don't want to do that in my home grow

445
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,369
it's just I don't need it it's a bedroom

446
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,019
I don't feel I'm supposed to be doing

447
00:14:57,369 --> 00:15:02,048
that in a bedroom I think bottles are a

448
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:03,850
little cleaner and safer for this home

449
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:05,708
that I am in that's just my opinion if I

450
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,239
had a farm we'd be doing no-till all day

451
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,798
we'd have worms we'd have a warm farm

452
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,538
would be scraping up our own chicken

453
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:12,519
[ __ ] it would be a different story but

454
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:14,528
like I said I use veg bloom at the big

455
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,109
grow because it's a big grow and veg

456
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:18,970
bloom is a really clean product the

457
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:20,439
people are really cool and it burns so

458
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,489
smoothly when you use veggie bloom I

459
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:25,149
don't think it leaves a whole bunch of

460
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:26,798
crap behind so your garden is a

461
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,269
reflection of yourself the nutrients you

462
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:30,759
choose to use our reflection of yourself

463
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:33,428
and the pest management program that you

464
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,720
use are a reflection of yourself so

465
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:35,828
think about that when you're playing

466
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,629
with your gardens one more thing I

467
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:39,008
wanted to talk about I just kind of loop

468
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:42,129
it all around since I've been taking

469
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:43,329
care of ganja plants for longer than I

470
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,859
should admit because I've been growing

471
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:47,408
and [ __ ] with weed since way before

472
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:49,600
all this medical marijuana [ __ ] the more

473
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:52,298
I learn about cannabis and nutrients and

474
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,489
a nutria t'v cycle of cannabis plants

475
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:57,850
the more I'm inspired to take better

476
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:59,859
care of myself I realize more that what

477
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,678
I put in since you feed cannabis plants

478
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:04,629
so infrequently and when you feed them

479
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:05,199
you definitely see results I've noticed

480
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,269
that I

481
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,120
try to pay more attention to what I put

482
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:12,399
into me I try to take in a wider variety

483
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,419
of nutrients and more specific nutrients

484
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,519
I try to just pay a little bit more

485
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,469
attention since I paid so much attention

486
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,179
to the plants if I'm measuring out this

487
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,830
much nitrogen and this much phosphorous

488
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,389
and this much potassium and then a

489
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,310
little smidge of cal-mag and then put in

490
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:26,199
some kelp in there and then some

491
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:28,509
microbes also for my plants why wouldn't

492
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,250
I think about my own body like that why

493
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,840
wouldn't I love my plant like that why

494
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,149
wouldn't I love my branches and my roots

495
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,590
just as well so I think taking better

496
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:37,090
care of plants has made me take better

497
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,280
care of myself and it's made me learn a

498
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,990
lot more about my health it's made me

499
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,579
care a lot more about my health and it

500
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,950
honestly has made me think a lot more

501
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,389
about my hydration since water is the

502
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,379
only you can just feed these plants

503
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:49,149
water for their whole lives and they

504
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:50,919
would grow so it makes me think should I

505
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:53,019
need a lot more water I drink plenty of

506
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,370
water but I could drink a lot or you

507
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:57,279
probably could too every time you take a

508
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,960
dab drink a bottle of water three dads

509
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,149
bottle of water I don't know I'm not a

510
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,129
[ __ ] Scientologist but do your own

511
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:05,500
ratio there every time you take some

512
