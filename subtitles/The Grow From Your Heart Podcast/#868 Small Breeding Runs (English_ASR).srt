26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,240
have been asking about clones if I owe

27
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,078
you a clone I will ship those very soon

28
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,559
it has been negative degrees here you

29
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:23,599
don't want me shipping your clones in

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,519
negative temperatures they will not make

31
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,599
it most of the Clones will go out by the

32
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,438
time this episode airs and you're asking

33
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,158
when clones will be back in stock on iir

34
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,758
as soon as it warms up a little bit it

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
is stressful trying to ship clones and

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,640
manage clone orders in this weather so

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,079
give me until about the springtime when

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,118
it warms up a little bit across the

39
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:43,798
country we will put clones back on

40
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,239

68
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,719
question in all of this that says I

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,439
would like to conduct a small breeding

70
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,519
project of approximately 10 plants I've

71
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,639
have heard you say at times that you can

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920
use beer cups when breeding or feno

73
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:03,000
hunting can you talk about your process

74
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,639
say keep it going brother yes this is a

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,239
great uh this is a great project a great

76
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,479
idea this is a fun project for me to

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,280
talk about so this listener has heard me

78
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,759
talk about breeding projects that happen

79
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,479
in beer cups a lot of you people right

80
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,639
now are going what you can breed in beer

81
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,280
cups yes we don't need giant plants for

82
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,878
breeding we can do this in beer cups

83
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,360
also this listener said they wanted to

84
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:25,639
do about 10 plants um if I was going to

85
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,280
do beer cups part of why I do beer cups

86
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,598
is to do a lot more than 10 I can fit

87
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,158
I've got a tray that holds 24 plants I

88
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:33,318
put 24 in there I don't know what your

89
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,560
limit is I don't know what your plant

90
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:36,958
count is I don't do 24 anymore because

91
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,318
of plant counts and plant limits where I

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,719
am but I used to do 24 on the tray uh in

93
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:42,560
the commercial environment I would put

94
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,759
multiple trays of 24 to be honest with

95
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,759
you but I can fit 24 on a tray they can

96
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,798
fit under one light very easily that is

97
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,199
a very easy breeding project so in this

98
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,519
episode I'm going to focus on about 24

99
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,000
plants in a tray that's kind of what

100
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,840
we're going to talk about just cuz

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,560
that's how I would do this project I

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,959
don't encourage you to break the rules

103
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,479
violate the laws I'm not a lawyer I'm

104
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,920
not uh anybody that could tell you what

105
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,438
to do legally so enter at your own risk

106
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,399
follow the rules at your own risk you're

107
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,039
a [ __ ] adult do what you want I can't

108
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,000
encourage you to do illegal [ __ ] I'm not

109
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,359
doing illegal [ __ ] nobody here is doing

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,519
anything illegal let's follow the rules

111
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,120
and do this properly so where are we

112
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,680
we're going to talk about a small

113
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,959
breeding project uh this listener said

114
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,680
10 plans I've already touched that we're

115
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,959
going to do more than 10 in my idea um

116
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,879
so yeah breeding projects we're going to

117
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:27,638
jump right into this uh who what when

118
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:29,560
where why how how much are we going to

119
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,439
do this um let's say that you want to do

120
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,280
a a small breeding project why not this

121
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,079
is going to be a lot of fun this is a

122
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,758
way to do a breeding project very

123
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,519
quickly why do I choose a breeding

124
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,360
project in beer cups let's just start

125
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,439
right there uh you could use a much

126
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,919
larger pot you could do bigger pots and

127
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,519
have much more success with larger

128
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,000
plants yes but for a home grower for a

129
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,319
home breeder who just wants to make a

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,600
few seeds for themselves to play with uh

131
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,959
if you just need 30 50 maybe 100 seeds

132
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,840
of something this is a beautiful project

133
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,959
you can put so what I would do I've got

134
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,839
a tray it's a sterlite tray it's made to

135
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,359
put clothing or Goods to store it under

136
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,239
your bed it's real flat it's kind of

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
long and wide it's made to slide under

138
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,759
the bed so you can put your stuff in

139
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,079
there and stash all your goodies under

140
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,400
the bed and get more storage I said

141
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,399
under the bed enough times it feels

142
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,159
awkward now but it's an under the bed

143
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,799
storage bin um it's approximately I'm

144
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,039
holding up my hands I think that's about

145
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,720
2 feet by 16 in uh and it holds 24 beer

146
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,279
cups in it perfectly you can fit them in

147
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,560
there I think it's Rosa 4x6 is how it

148
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,959
fits and they just fit in there

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,360
perfectly so if you rattle it around

150
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,399
they won't fall over that's why I like

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,080
to fill the tray it keeps it full

152
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,918
nothing tips over so what I would do I

153
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,478
would cut 24 clones and I would put 24

154
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:42,240
clones in these little beer cups uh two

155
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,439
of those cuts would be the same male I

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,879
would do clones of the same exact male

157
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:48,839
so I've got 22 females and two cuts of

158
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,199
the same dude now all you've got to do

159
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,439
is veg those until they're four or five

160
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,759
maybe six or seven Ines tall at the most

161
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,120
and then flip them all at the same time

162
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,560
it doesn't take a lot of space it

163
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,319
doesn't take a lot of room it doesn't

164
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,079
take a lot of light doesn't take a lot

165
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,199
of soil water nutrients it really

166
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,478
doesn't take a lot of energy but if you

167
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,400
put 24 little plants in beer cups and

168
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,159
veg them up um maybe two GI Jo's tall

169
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,638
that's seven inches two GI Jo's I know

170
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,960
that's boy math but every boy knows what

171
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,038
I'm talking about two GI Jo's tall flip

172
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,918
them uh those plants will grow up to be

173
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,598
about 15 in tall you may need to put a

174
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:21,839
stick in there to keep them supported uh

175
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:23,279
if you don't have enough wind and light

176
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,519
going on depending on your environment

177
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,959
they may need some support but what will

178
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,399
happen is those plants will go into

179
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,918
flower on about 14 days the girls will

180
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,560
start telling you we're girls in about

181
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:37,478
14 days the two boy plants will verify

182
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,000
we are boys about 21 days in 22 25 days

183
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:41,240
in pollen will start coming out of your

184
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,720
boy plants you could simply leave them

185
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,639
all right there in the room and it will

186
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,160
pollinate or you could take one of those

187
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,720
boy plants and pick them up and dust

188
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
them around all those girl plants every

189
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,960
pistol in that room is going to get

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
pollinated by those two male plants that

191
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,159
will produce enough pollen I know it

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,839
sounds wild but uh it's really quick and

193
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,039
easy a short veg we need to veg them uh

194
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,439
like I said seven maybe 10 in tall at

195
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,079
the most that's going to get floppy in a

196
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,439
beer cup so keep them shorter it will be

197
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,198
easier to manage uh keep them short you

198
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,478
got a short veg time you're going to

199
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,919
flip them when they're s in tall so

200
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,758
we're already ahead of the game most

201
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,918
people aren't even done vegging yet most

202
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,240
people are going to transplant two times

203
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,918
before they flow you're already flipping

204
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,720
these plants so they're already into

205
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,120
Flower by the time you're pollinating I

206
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,160
haven't even transplanted to my next

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,199
bigger pot by the time you're done now

208
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm transplanting so uh short veg flip

209
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,879
them pollinate then I would wait a week

210
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,478
or so make sure that the pollination is

211
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,319
successful if you've still got one male

212
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,639
plant that you haven't cut down in there

213
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
take that dude and do another

214
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,240
pollination with him at this point you

215
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,560
could chop down your mail plants get rid

216
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,079
of those maybe leave the cups in there

217
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,560
uh just to keep that tray from tipping

218
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,199
over if are the plants from tipping over

219
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,120
in the tray if you've packed 24 in there

220
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,680
like I suggested uh but you could do as

221
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,680
many as you want I'm just saying that 24

222
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,079
is how I do it uh then once you've done

223
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,240
your second pollination what I recommend

224
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,519
at this point and this is where a lot of

225
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,439
people are going to think I'm freaking

226
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:06,240
crazy I would turn those lights back to

227
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:08,319
18 hours on and 6 hours off I would do

228
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,918
that until these plants are finished the

229
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,319
plants are not going to look pretty to

230
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,598
be honest with you they're going to look

231
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,039
like [ __ ] 186 will make the plants look

232
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,598
ugly but you're not growing for flowers

233
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,719
at this point every pistol every calx is

234
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,158
filled with a seed there's no bud to

235
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,759
smoke there's no flow you're not going

236
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:26,000
to have anything useful to smoke out of

237
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,560
this it is all going to be completely

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,959
seated when we cut down these plants

239
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,000
which we'll talk about in a minute it

240
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,240
will be fully completely seated so when

241
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,120
you're running 186 and these plants

242
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,360
start to look completely shitty they're

243
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,599
going to go into rev Edge you're going

244
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,399
to see some whirl leaves but that's not

245
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,440
a big deal we are going for healthy

246
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,440
happy fat seeds and that's what we're

247
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,320
going to get by going to 18 hours on and

248
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,959
6 hours off so 6 to 8 weeks later it

249
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,200
will be Harvest Time at that point uh

250
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,799
what we're going to do it'll be very

251
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,320
very simple uh there's going to be

252
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,199
nothing but seeds in these plants so

253
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,800
don't even try to conserve any of it for

254
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,680
smokable material what I recommend is a

255
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,559
separate container container for each

256
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,199
plant if you've got multiple uh plants

257
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,799
of the same strain you can use that

258
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,200
container for multiple plants of the

259
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,679
same strain but we don't want to mix up

260
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,600
the seeds here so I would get some sort

261
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,599
of a bin uh turkey pans are a great

262
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,839
suggestion right now uh recently

263
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,040
recently I did an episode about

264
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,839
affordable grow equipment turkey pans

265
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,559
little turkey pans from uh the grocery

266
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,000
store those would work beautifully right

267
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,759
now so get a turkey pan get a plant uh

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,078
cut the plant down hang the plant let it

269
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,039
dry until it's completely dry when it is

270
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:31,919
completely dry take take that plant and

271
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:33,919
your turkey pan and pull the stick out

272
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,958
of all the buds just hold the buds with

273
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,719
your finger and just pull the stick

274
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,078
right out out of that it's a real short

275
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,200
stick all the buds will fall off into

276
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,958
your turkey pan then just use rubber

277
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,480
gloves and just Grind All That flour

278
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,879
material up real good uh real well then

279
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,519
all your seeds are going to fall out of

280
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,320
there all your weeds going to fall out

281
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,600
then simply tip that turkey pan to the

282
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,680
side all your seeds are going to roll

283
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,519
down to the bottom it's all going to be

284
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,759
seeds you can if you really want to make

285
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,039
edibles or something out of that

286
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,480
leftover flour product you can most of

287
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,278
the time it's so beat up that if you

288
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,519
make edibles or concentrate it comes out

289
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,759
green because the removal process it

290
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,600
beats it up it gives it so many broken

291
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,399
edges and so much surface area and so

292
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,959
much chlorophyll is freed that your

293
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,240
Edibles and your concentrates come out

294
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:17,439
green and funky so um to put it on 186

295
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,039
let the seeds finish it'll take six to

296
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,560
eight weeks for them to finish then chop

297
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,000
them hang them upside down let them get

298
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,199
dry as [ __ ] is my unit of measurement

299
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,480
then pull the sticks off the the buds

300
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,600
off the sticks grind it up separate the

301
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,680
seeds now you've got your first new new

302
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,399
cross now depending on the size of the

303
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,078
plant the amount of pistols on the plant

304
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,759
when you did this how far into maturity

305
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,719
that female plant was when it received

306
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,360
pollen there are a lot of factors here

307
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,040
uh but you should receive somewhere

308
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,519
between 25 and 150 seeds per plant if

309
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,559
you do this properly and if you've got a

310
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,120
tray of 22 plants you do the math 25 to

311
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,359
100 seeds per plant you've got quite a

312
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,200
few new seeds to play with as a very

313
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,919
experienced grower and breeder and

314
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,920
person who has had their heartbroken I

315
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,439
recommend you carefully label all of

316
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:02,879
these plants and do your best to keep

317
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,160
all of these seeds if you're running

318
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,519
multiple strains do your best to keep

319
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,879
them separated and very carefully

320
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,078
labeled this is your new passion project

321
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,759
you just spent weeks doing this uh make

322
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,278
sure you keep everything carefully

323
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,838
labeled once you get the seeds out of

324
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,759
the buds put them in a jar or a baggie

325
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,560
and label that jar or that baggie uh

326
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,799
whatever cross to whatever cross made on

327
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:27,958
this date um then put those somewhere

328
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,199
that you know they're safe cool dry dark

329
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,000
environment um let's talk a little bit

330
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,278
about feeding these seeded plants you've

331
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,120
got little beer cups don't overwater

332
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,679
them don't overfeed them that could be a

333
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,519
problem that could cause you major

334
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,159
problems if you overfeed these cups um I

335
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,278
basically feed uh it is kind of a flour

336
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,759
mix but I stick with the base nutrient

337
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,919
for the grow bottle if you're feeding

338
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,480
bottled nutrients I stick with the grow

339
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,319
base because I want that extra bit of

340
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,720
nitrogen in there to give me those

341
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,720
healthy fat seeds I'll also increase the

342
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,839
cow mag a little bit when I'm making

343
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,959
seeds and here's something I do not say

344
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,399
a lot on podcast this is a golden nugget

345
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,838
of information that I kind of keep

346
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,519
secret something I don't share a lot no

347
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,160
need to gatekeep anymore um I'm doing

348
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,240
very well I want you guys to do as well

349
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,439
as I am um a little bit of amino acids

350
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,720
will go very well for your seeds amino

351
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,279
acids are the building blocks of life

352
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,000
why not feed the seeds amino acids give

353
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:25,278
them a strong healthy start um I feed as

354
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,159
soon as I start seeing seed development

355
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,600
I start feeding the amino acids uh one

356
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,278
thing I skipped I didn't even write this

357
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,440
down when I said seed development brain

358
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,759
went ding ding let's talk about this

359
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,639
what about how do we tell when these

360
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,319
seeds are ready I keep saying about 6 to

361
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,079
8 weeks and you will have seeds um a lot

362
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,800
of people are really uh we have a hard

363
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:44,559
enough time judging when to cut down our

364
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,799
[ __ ] nonseeded plants when do I cut

365
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,078
it when do I cut it is one of the

366
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,799
biggest questions I ever get um the

367
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,399
answer to that is use a magnifying glass

368
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,198
and check out your tricomes most of the

369
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,799
time at this point we've got a seated

370
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:57,599
plant when do I cut it down um you're

371
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,519
going to see seeds popping out of some

372
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,278
of your buds some of your buds the top

373
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,240
cxes are going to explode and a little

374
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,919
seed is going to pop out of there when

375
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,399
you start seeing those seeds it is

376
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,958
almost time to harvest there are a lot

377
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,958
of seeds in there what I recommend is

378
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,159
just grab a seed you can see them

379
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,958
popping out of the buds out of the cxes

380
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,719
grab a seed from somewhere anywhere on

381
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,518
the plant if you see one grab that bad

382
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,800
[ __ ] just pick it out you you might do

383
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,159
a little bit of damage to the plant but

384
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,639
there's so many seeds in there it's

385
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,159
going to be okay don't don't freak out

386
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,680
pull out a seed shake off all the husk

387
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,399
the hole all the material all the green

388
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,278
material get that off of your seed find

389
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,198
that seed get in the palm of your hand

390
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,559
get it clean look at it what does it

391
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:36,719
look like does it look like it's the

392
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,039
right color is it getting tiger stripes

393
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,360
is it dark is it green is it pale if

394
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,958
it's green if it's pale if it's

395
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,000
yellowish it's probably not ready if

396
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,559
it's starting to get a dark color a

397
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,519
little bit of a shine to it starting to

398
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,319
get some tiger stripes you're probably

399
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,759
looking at a seed that is ready or very

400
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,240
close to ready the ultimate test to find

401
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,680
out if that seed is ready um my fingers

402
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,360
are trained for this I've got drummer

403
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,519
fingers and Seed breeder fingers drummer

404
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,759
fingers are different if you played

405
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,480
congas and drums for years I realized

406
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,519
recently my fingers are different I got

407
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,240
hard fingers uh but grab those seeds and

408
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,440
give them a squeeze just squeeze it I

409
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,278
squeeze it between my thumb and my

410
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,959
forefinger if it uh if the seed hurts

411
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,278
your finger when you squeeze it that

412
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,399
seed's ready if the seed explodes that

413
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,838
shit's not ready um I squeeze them

414
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,159
pretty hard before they break and that's

415
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,920
how I know that they're ready grab a few

416
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:25,319
seeds grab two or three grab them from

417
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,879
multiple plants you'll know when they're

418
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,560
ready they'll be really [ __ ] hard

419
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,600
wait a little bit longer if you don't

420
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,359
think that they're ready uh the pros and

421
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,519
cons of waiting too long and going too

422
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,440
early if you go too early and cut down

423
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,679
your seeds will not be done that's

424
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,959
heartbreaking let them [ __ ] finish if

425
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,559
you wait too long uh those seeds could

426
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,559
have a hard time germinating they may

427
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,559
become a little bit too strong the outer

428
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,159
shell becomes a little bit tough you'll

429
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,198
have to soak them you'll have to scarify

430
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,879
them to get them to germinate don't

431
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,519
worry most of the time you guys take

432
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,039
your [ __ ] down way too early so uh start

433
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,639
squeezing those seeds see if they're

434
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:59,639
hard if they're hard enough then they're

435
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,480
probably ready if

436
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,000
if you see Little Sprouts coming out of

437
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,440
your soil your seeds are ready uh what

438
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,039
happens a lot of times is a seed will

439
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,360
fall out of your plants that are growing

440
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,278
and this is what's supposed to happen

441
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,480
this is [ __ ] nature doing its thing

442
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,159
the seed will grow strong enough to grow

443
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,399
out of your plant it'll fall right out

444
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,879
of the plant into your soil you'll water

445
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,559
it not knowing that it's there and it

446
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,198
will germinate and it will grow right up

447
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,719
out of your soil now you got your

448
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,399
original plant and you got a sprout

449
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,680
growing out of there that's a sign that

450
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,399
your seeds are ready if the seeds are

451
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,559
falling out like that they are

452
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,600
absolutely ready for Harvest let me

453
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,638
check my notes um you're going to get

454
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,319
between I wrote down 30 to 100 seeds a

455
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,879
minute ago I said 25 to 150 that depends

456
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:43,360
on the size of the plant the health of

457
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:44,759
the plant um you'll learn after you do a

458
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,759
couple of breeding projects that

459
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,919
different plants want to be pollinated

460
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,879
at different times and you'll also learn

461
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,318
that different male plants put out

462
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,000
pollen at different times there's a time

463
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,559
frame where you can kind of standardize

464
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
it um the the method I if you put the

465
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,559
boys and the girls in the same room with

466
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,600
at the same time it's going to work

467
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,559
nature it works that way if you put Let

468
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,519
me I always use these two plants as an

469
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,278
example I've got a strawberry fields

470
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,440
plant that is the mom that makes uh

471
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:14,639
Raphael uh strawberry burst uh what else

472
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,839
does that bad [ __ ] make it doesn't

473
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,159
matter it's a strawberry fields plant

474
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,000
from Crockett it's amazing it makes a

475
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,759
lot of good [ __ ] I've also got a

476
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,480
platinum Tangi plant that is the mom to

477
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,399
the Michelangelo the orange GM uh that

478
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,240
one makes a lot of good [ __ ] also they

479
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,399
are both amazing plants however they are

480
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,560
very different in a lot of different

481
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,679
characteristics uh the Strawberry Fields

482
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,278
plant grows real tall and real lanky and

483
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,679
gives me real long buds the Platinum

484
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:41,159
Tangi kind of shorter squatter smaller

485
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:42,838
tighter buds uh more Maple Leaf kind of

486
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:45,240
a leaf structure the strawberries got

487
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,839
those big tropical long leaves the

488
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,198
strawberry plant wants pollen much later

489
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,360
than the Platinum Tangi plant um ideally

490
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:57,879
I would pollinate the strawberry plant

491
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,000
around day 35 and the Tangi plant around

492
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:02,519
like day 25 five so they're like 10 days

493
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,078
apart on when they want pollen so you'll

494
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,759
learn these sort of things as you grow

495
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,438
you'll learn that I should put this plan

496
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,160
in here on this week and then wait a

497
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,839
week and then put this plan in here you

498
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,798
learn to get the mail plant a week ahead

499
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:14,918
or a week behind it just takes

500
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,639
experimenting and and it's like learning

501
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,079
a partner it's like taking people out on

502
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,600
dates you got to see what they like do

503
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,000
they do they like your jokes do they

504
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,000
hate your jokes are they into the cow

505
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,798
mag or do they hate cow mag do they want

506
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,720
Bloom boosters at week six or would they

507
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,160
rather you just give them uh just

508
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,480
straight go with whatever your basic

509
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,279
feed is I'm just trying to make [ __ ] up

510
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,679
as we go but you've got to develop a

511
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,678
relationship with these plants that's

512
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:36,160
the art of breeding that is uh there's a

513
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,798
lot of science behind breeding I could

514
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,480
write you Sops that will work but you're

515
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,798
going to have to get in there and learn

516
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,319
the plants to figure out how to optimize

517
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:47,000
them make as many seeds as possible uh

518
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:49,038
by timing it by learning the mail when

519
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,160
does this male dump the most pollen some

520
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:55,079
boys uh start dumping at like 23 24 some

521
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,600
boys day 32 like I said earlier some

522
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:00,000
girls want pollen at day 23 some want

523
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,639
pollen day 33 so you just got to learn

524
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,038
how to time all of that when to get the

525
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,000
females that the ripest when they're

526
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,798
peeking for pollen and get the boy when

527
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,798
he's dumping the most pollen try to time

528
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,079
that up uh that is an art and a skill

529
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,639
that you will develop over a few crops

530
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,480
so at this point you have made a bunch

531
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,200
of brand new seeds you've got a bunch of

532
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,079
brand new crosses hopefully stuff that's

533
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,759
never been made before sounds like you

534
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,918
started off with at least 10 maybe you

535
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,158
did 24 plants maybe you did a 100 who

536
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,400
knows but you have got a bunch of brand

537
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:28,520
new seeds that you grew from little tiny

538
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,759
pots it only took a little bit of space

539
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:32,679
uh you could do this in a 3X3 tent you

540
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:34,279
could do this in a little tiny closet

541
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,519
you could build a little makeshift room

542
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,158
for this cuz they're not going to get

543
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,000
very tall uh there's a tent that lays on

544
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,960
its side uh it's a really short tent

545
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,480
that lays on its side it's not very tall

546
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,480
it's a propagation tent you could breed

547
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,120
seeds in that propagation tent if you

548
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,720
followed this advice that I just gave

549
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:53,839
you so at this point hopefully you've

550
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,480
got a bunch of brand new seeds now the

551
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:58,199
excitement is growing those seeds you

552
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,240
get to see what you just created maybe

553
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,640
you've got 10 new crosses maybe you've

554
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,240
got 20 new crosses uh you've got

555
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,799
somewhere between what's 20 times 25

556
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,640
that many do the math fill that in put

557
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,200
that number here you got that many new

558
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,559
crosses to grow with if you did a 100

559
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,679
you got 2500 new seeds to play with um I

560
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,158
recommend when you use a new male plant

561
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,559
when you use any male plant to pollinate

562
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,640
multiple females and then run the

563
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:26,399
progeny from those projects because what

564
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,080
we get to see now is that male and so

565
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,559
the male and female are going to breed

566
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,558
and all and instances they're going to

567
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:32,879
cross you're going to get an outcome and

568
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:34,480
we're just going to make stuff up for

569
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,200
this part of the conversation let's say

570
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,640
that the male is chocolate cuz that's

571
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,279
easy to remember I've got a male that

572
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,320
produces chocolate that's just the trait

573
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,359
we're going with and then we've got

574
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,678
strawberry and lemon females we're just

575
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,158
going to go hypothetical because I can

576
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,559
remember those I get high and forget

577
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:52,559
[ __ ] let's just say that we pollinate

578
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:54,359
chocolate to Strawberry we're probably

579
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,519
going to get chocolate strawberry turps

580
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,639
right we're going to get combos you're

581
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,798
going to see stuff that looks like

582
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,960
chocolate stuff that looks like

583
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:02,599
strawberry and chocolate strawberry what

584
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,000
so we're going to find traits in there

585
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:06,959
but how do we know what consistently the

586
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,679
Father the chocolate is passing to that

587
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,600
cross I want to see what he did to Lemon

588
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,400
Let's see if we get chocolate lemon are

589
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,879
there lemon turs are there chocolate

590
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,720
turs are there chocolate lemon turps or

591
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,280
do both of these crosses completely have

592
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,798
dominant chocolate turps was the other

593
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,720
flavor allowed to shine and I'm not just

594
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:28,200
going with just flavor but other traits

595
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,400
maybe chocolate put um a funky Leaf

596
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,080
shape in everything do all of my crosses

597
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,400
show this weird Leaf shape or does it

598
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,519
only come through on strawberry so let's

599
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
see how this male plays with others

600
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:40,359
let's see how it mixes amongst other

601
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,960
plants that's really the fun part of

602
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,000
discovering what your male plant does in

603
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,880
your breeding uh Crossing it to one

604
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,759
plant that could be an anomaly you could

605
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,039
say it makes the frostiest plants ever

606
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,679
how do you know that came from the male

607
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,000
that could have came from the female you

608
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,159
could say it makes the most amazing

609
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,720
chocolate turps yeah in that cross let's

610
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,360
do it with five six 12 different crosses

611
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,919
and see what the commonalities and the

612
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:02,199
differ differences is differences is you

613
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,038
guys know what I'm saying I talk a lot

614
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,798
you're going to make some weird

615
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,200
differences is kind of weird stumbles

616
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,599
not even going to edit that [ __ ] you're

617
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,240
going to see commonalities and

618
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,240
differences and that's the fun part of

619
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,400
breeding uh then you get to take those

620
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,519
traits further and what's really crazy

621
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,159
is when uh you don't see certain traits

622
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,918
in your breeding until F3 and then

623
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,240
something that was in the original

624
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,559
Parent pops up and you're like there's

625
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,359
that trait again anyway now I'm rambling

626
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,960
and getting excited about breeding I

627
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,399
hope you are as excited about breeding

628
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,159
as I am ladies and gentlemen cuz I love

629
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,880
breeding and growing cannabis

630
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,278
uh my friend Buckeye 420 my dude thank

631
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,039
you for the great question this one was

632
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:37,278
a full podcast episode I do appreciate

633
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:39,038
it make you make sure you check your

634
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:41,440
inbox because you do have a coupon code

635
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,640
for a free pack of seeds at I direct.com

636
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,798
and I do encourage you and welcome you

637
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,919
and invite you to add my seeds to your

638
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,119
breeding project don't be shy a lot of

639
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,120
breeders out there have weird rules and

640
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,639
uh stick up their ass about breeding I

641
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,158
encourage you breed with my seeds you

642
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,759
bought them I made them with love so

643
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,080
