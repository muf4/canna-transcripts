I also hope you have a great safe New

40
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,600
Year let's talk about some things we can

41
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,849
do with this fresh new calendar year I

42
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,679
like to set goals at the beginning of a

43
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,658
year I feel like setting goals and

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,579
writing them down really keeps us

45
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,130
focused you can say some goals out loud

46
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,618
you can say hey Ross to Jeff in 2019 I

47
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,449
think I want to do this then I'm gonna

48
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:50,519
give you a fat ass dab and we're gonna

49
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,469
start talking and in four hours you'll

50
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,179
forget you even talked about a goal or

51
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,599
having any sort of goals for the new

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,759
year

53
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,669
so when you're going to set goals it is

54
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,579
my advice to write those goals down get

55
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,649
a pen get some paper and write down one

56
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,148
goal if you're really ambitious write

57
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,038
down three goals if you're a

58
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,500
goal-oriented person who likes to crush

59
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,419
a to-do list make a list for 12 things

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,250
and try to get one big thing done every

61
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:14,629
month

62
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,759
you're a person that's intimidated by

63
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,409
goals get one thing done this year as

64
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,030
long as you write down a goal and you

65
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:22,069
accomplish it you will feel good about

66
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,169
yourself once you accomplish a goal

67
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,629
what's the next step create a bigger

68
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:28,429
goal then what happens you crush that

69
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:29,840
goal and it continues then you start

70
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,069
adding to the to-do list you start

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,719
getting more confidence you start

72
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:34,219
getting more things done you start

73
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,930
learning more you start expanding as a

74
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:38,569
person life gets bigger and better and

75
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,300
it just expands as things go it goes

76
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,879
exponentially in that pattern so create

77
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,160
a goal small or large that is up to you

78
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,509
as long as we've got a goal and we write

79
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,030
it down you can write it down on paper

80
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:51,919
you can write it down on a Google Drive

81
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,689
you can write it down on a note in your

82
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,969
phone as long as you go and write down

83
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:58,280
that goal and review it occasionally and

84
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:00,770
look at it and think about what you have

85
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,659
done to get yourself to that goal now if

86
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,580
you want to be really detailed write

87
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:06,919
down three steps that it would take to

88
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,630
get yourself to that goal so let's say

89
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,789
your goal is to walk to the front door

90
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:12,919
what are the first three steps got to

91
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:14,840
stand up you gotta aim myself toward the

92
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,939
door then I got to take a bunch of steps

93
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,560
that may sound like a small goal but

94
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,239
once you get there you've accomplished

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,799
the goal you've made a clear path you've

96
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,959
gotten there you've accomplished the

97
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,030
goal now what's your next goal it feels

98
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,680
good you've gotten some [ __ ] done so

99
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,530
let's set some goals for the new year

100
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,409
let's start talking about garden goals

101
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,900
we can set a lot of the people listening

102
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:38,239
to this show keep saying to me in emails

103
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,950
or to their girlfriends in conversation

104
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,079
or to their Bros while they're in their

105
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:44,839
car smoking that they want to start a

106
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:47,019
grow why not make this year the year

107
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,060
that you start to grow write it down

108
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,950
make it a goal and make it happen I have

109
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,049
given you plenty of advice on how to get

110
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:56,839
it going it is time to get your [ __ ]

111
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,370
together and start that grow do it dude

112
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,930
what's stopping you I know there are a

113
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,759
few things that may be stopping several

114
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,379
of you but you keep saying you're gonna

115
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,719
do it you're starting to sound silly

116
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:07,639
hang up some lights put some seeds in

117
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:09,409
some dirt and finally get growing make

118
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,750
that your goal now if you're already

119
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:15,469
growing there are plenty of things we

120
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,279
can set as garden goals how about higher

121
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:19,430
potency

122
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,139
how about better yields how about better

123
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,180
scheduling how about setting a better

124
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:25,370
routine and a better cycle for the grow

125
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,959
how about the day you cut down plants

126
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,490
you've got plants prepared to go

127
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,159
into that room so that you never miss a

128
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,930
day how about improving your cleanliness

129
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,880
there are plenty of things we can

130
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,168
improve and plenty of goals we can set

131
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,879
in the grow room I don't know what

132
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:39,978
you're doing in your grow I don't know

133
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,418
what you're missing you do think about

134
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:43,250
where you're lacking in the grill

135
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:45,079
what is your weak point are you not a

136
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,610
good clone cutter are you not good at

137
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,379
transplanting do you not know how to

138
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,788
defoliate are you not good at popping

139
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,589
and twisting do you not know how to work

140
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:53,300
the canopy are you not really

141
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:55,250
comfortable mixing up nutrients and

142
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,889
getting the pH adjusted find your

143
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,810
weakness and master that this year make

144
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,879
that a goal maybe find a couple of

145
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,098
weaknesses and cover three or four of

146
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,110
them we've got 12 full months why not

147
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:07,788
make a goal if you've got a small goal

148
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,590
for every month and then a good goal for

149
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,240
every three months and then a huge goal

150
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:13,909
for the year you're really on pace to

151
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,680
increase your garden experience and your

152
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,210
potential and your learning base and

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,629
also if you just live your life like

154
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,549
that

155
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:22,098
with so many goals in so many different

156
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,629
areas your life will just be fulfilled

157
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:25,158
and you will be nourished and you'll be

158
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:27,620
enriched and you'll be a better person

159
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,728
inside and out because of it so pay

160
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,560
attention while you're in the grow

161
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:32,508
figure out where you're lacking what is

162
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,610
your weak spot make a note of that and

163
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:38,090
make it a conscious effort to improve on

164
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,889
that over the next 365 days and when we

165
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,810
meet next year to talk about this when

166
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,939
you say man I really did improve on that

167
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,819
you will have so much pride at how far

168
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:48,259
you have come in one short year now I'm

169
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:50,269
always talking about journaling and

170
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:52,370
keeping notes this is a good time to

171
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:54,228
take some notes start the brand new year

172
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,228
with the brand new grow journal and on

173
00:05:54,228 --> 00:06:00,228
page one write some goals on page one

174
00:05:57,228 --> 00:06:02,418
maybe one major goal maybe three small

175
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:04,519
goals whatever you want to do make sure

176
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:06,139
you write that down say hey Rasta Jeff

177
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,120
said to create a goal here's my goal

178
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,620
it's on paper it's written down now it's

179
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,538
a thing you wrote it down you've got

180
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,860
some accountability use that notebook

181
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,348
through the rest of the year to take

182
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,729
your notes in one year open that up to

183
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:18,740
page one and look at your goals and

184
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:20,810
think about it have I accomplished those

185
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,300
goals what have I done to get myself

186
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,519
closer to those goals how can I get to

187
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,379
that goal if I haven't already gotten

188
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,848
there now I mentioned earlier it's

189
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:31,098
always helpful when you're writing goals

190
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:33,199
to list steps of how you can achieve

191
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:35,329
that goal when your brain is thinking

192
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,009
about the goal you get inspired the

193
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,569
brain just starts firing and then you

194
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,098
can see the path if you think about it

195
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,769
hard enough you can actually visualize

196
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:42,149
how to

197
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:44,519
there so think about what your goal is

198
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:46,529
and then maybe write down three steps to

199
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,538
help you get there and check once in a

200
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:50,638
while am i doing these three steps or am

201
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:53,098
I still stuck am i at zero or have I

202
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,658
done step one have I done step two or if

203
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:56,128
I [ __ ] up and jumped on to step three

204
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:57,750
and miss steps one and two all together

205
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:59,580
and set myself up for failure in the

206
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,439
future just pay attention to what your

207
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:03,149
goals are pay attention to the steps to

208
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,000
get there and don't lose sight of your

209
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:07,469
goal now it is fair to change your goal

210
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,149
if you've learned something different if

211
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,280
you get a better idea you're always

212
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:13,529
learning you're always expanding don't

213
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,779
feel stuck to a goal if you learn more

214
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,429
and get a better idea a better thought

215
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:19,739
process just make sure it's well thought

216
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,810
out sometimes we don't know everything

217
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,000
we make a plan we set a goal and then we

218
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,800
realize oh that's not exactly what I

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,959
thought I was gonna do need to rethink

220
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,728
everything don't be afraid to abandon

221
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,379
ship and rethink it if that's the

222
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:33,029
appropriate move don't puss out and give

223
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,379
up just cuz you get scared but if you

224
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:36,059
realize you're aiming at the wrong

225
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:38,158
target you got to adjust aim for this

226
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,918
target over here always do that in the

227
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:42,478
grow and in life that's my advice so

228
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,038
what are your goals this year what are

229
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,408
your goals in life what are your goals

230
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,120
in your garden always have goals always

231
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:49,978
be moving forward and then you won't get

232
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,598
stuck once you get stuck in life once

233
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:53,818
you get stuck in the garden it is really

234
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,978
hard to get unstuck so it's best just to

235
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,319
keep moving forward never slow now never

236
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:00,300
stop never get stuck then you never have

237
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,370
to pull yourself out of it and the best

238
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,680
way to stay motivated is to set a goal

239
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,569
keep crushing those goals then you feel

240
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,699
that rewarding experience then you set a

241
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,379
higher goal then you stay motivated you

242
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,750
keep reaching those goals and it is a

243
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,879
positive cycle it keeps you set up for

244
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,639
success set yourself up for success you

245
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,348
guys in the garden and in your life this

246
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,360
is a grow podcast let's focus more on

247
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:23,038
growing cannabis what are a few goals we

248
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,379
can set in our garden I mentioned

249
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,180
earlier that we can increase yields

250
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,879
there are several ways to increase your

251
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,949
yield that starts in the veg phase you

252
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,899
can improve your pH I bet you can

253
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,360
probably improve the quality of your

254
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,158
feeding you can probably dial in the

255
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,430
amount of each nutrient a little more

256
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,708
closely per strain nutrient feedings are

257
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,899
very strange specific maybe you want to

258
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,399
learn your individual cultivars more

259
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,230
specifically and build a closer

260
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,028
relationship with each plant in your

261
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,610
grow those are a couple of ways to

262
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:55,769
increase yield during the veg phase

263
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,269
you can also work on cracking and

264
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,190
twisting the sticks you can work on

265
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:01,019
canopy control you can work on canopy

266
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,970
management those are a couple of other

267
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,919
ways throughout the veg phase you can

268
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,379
increase yields so learn a few things

269
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,659
like that set goals and learn things to

270
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,879
increase the yield also we want to

271
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:14,519
increase potency not everybody has

272
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:17,220
access to lab testing but I bet you and

273
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,629
your friends and/or customers can tell

274
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,519
the difference in the quality of the

275
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:22,649
product you started growing in the

276
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,000
product you're growing now they can tell

277
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:27,000
there's a difference in potency and

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,070
quality maybe you can set a goal to make

279
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,559
that even better and take a few steps to

280
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,329
get it there the number one thing I bet

281
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,119
would improve most of your potency

282
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:39,088
flavor and aroma across the board for

283
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,980
most growers is learning a better dry

284
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,709
and cure technique and I've put out in a

285
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,970
full episode of drying and curing if you

286
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,578
would like to listen to the drying and

287
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,829
curing episode it is episode 326

288
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:52,528
now another goal that I know almost

289
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:55,199
every grower could set and always reach

290
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:57,328
is keeping the grow room just a little

291
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,250
bit cleaner than we did last year just

292
00:09:57,328 --> 00:10:01,889
focus a little bit more on cleanliness

293
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,620
spend a little bit more time on cleaning

294
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:06,870
up after yourself it may add 10 minutes

295
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,269
to each day that's about an hour a week

296
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,459
we can all afford one more hour a week

297
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:13,500
to clean up after ourselves because in

298
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,239
the long run imagine how much time

299
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,559
you'll save if you don't have to go look

300
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,528
for stupid [ __ ] all the time

301
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,078
in a large grow walking from flower room

302
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:24,149
a to the bedroom number one could take

303
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,500
several minutes just to walk from one

304
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:27,028
room to the other because in a large

305
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,190
grill we've got a lot of space to cover

306
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:31,049
then you got to go find whatever you

307
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,670
lost then on the way back you're gonna

308
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:34,319
get distracted and have to do something

309
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:36,088
else then the task you were doing just

310
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,589
got abandoned then you got to remember

311
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:38,880
oh yeah I was over there doing that

312
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,860
that's why I've got scissors in my hand

313
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,059
and I'm standing in the wrong place then

314
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,100
you gotta go get your brain back on

315
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,778
track to what you were doing if you just

316
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,820
clean up and put the scissors where they

317
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:50,338
go put the measuring devices where they

318
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,050
go put the hoses where they go put the

319
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,060
goggles and gloves and spray equipment

320
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:56,099
where it goes and have it cleaned and

321
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:58,018
prepared for the next use you will save

322
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,540
yourself so much time in the garden

323
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,159
so maybe set a goal of being a little

324
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:03,860
more organized and working on

325
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,208
cleanliness in your garden this year

326
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,350
these are just a couple of practical

327
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,429
ideas I can think of

328
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,649
off the top of my head you guys

329
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:12,989
everybody wants more potency everybody

330
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:14,459
wants more overall product and I've been

331
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,649
to a lot of grows and I know that most

332
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,750
of us could work on a cleaner grow room

333
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,340
environment like I said earlier I don't

334
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,899
know where you're lacking in your garden

335
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,570
I don't know what your weak point is I'm

336
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:27,090
sure you do so identify that weakness

337
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,860
let your ego go accept that you've got a

338
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,420
weakness in the grow we all do there's

339
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,490
something that every one of us could

340
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:34,169
improve on I can improve on everything

341
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,669
we can all improve on everything in the

342
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:37,709
grow it's when you stop thinking you can

343
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:39,870
improve is when you start becoming a

344
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,840
shitty grower so accept your weakness

345
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:45,120
embrace your weakness then let's find

346
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,370
ways to improve on that weakness and

347
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,620
make you a rockstar grower in all

348
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,570
aspects all right you guys I think I've

349
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,429
ranted on long enough about goals and

350
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,530
setting goals and reaching goals and

351
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:58,139
trying to motivate everybody to have a

352
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,730
good positive start to the year since it

353
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,919
is the start of a new year there are

354
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,960
also some things we could do in the grow

355
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,419
to make the grow run more smoothly

356
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,800
throughout the rest of the year like I

357
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,509
mentioned earlier a little bit of

358
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,459
cleanliness and also a little bit of

359
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:14,250
maintenance will make our day-to-day

360
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,200
tasks go much more smoothly it will also

361
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,330
make some of our equipment last longer

362
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,879
we pay a lot of money for high quality

363
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,889
equipment in our grows it would be in

364
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,139
our best interest to take care of that

365
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:26,970
equipment if you have to keep buying a

366
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,470
brand new pH meter every couple of

367
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,210
months in your grow and you work for a

368
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,279
commercial grow that could have been

369
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,810
your Christmas bonus possibly think

370
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,459
about things like that and you'll start

371
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:37,739
taking better care of all of your

372
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,509
equipment I bet if you had to buy all of

373
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,370
the tools in your commercial grow you

374
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,409
would probably take a little better care

375
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,269
of it you probably wouldn't wonder where

376
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:47,519
you left those scissors you probably

377
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,409
wouldn't wonder where that pH pen is if

378
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,259
you had to buy it in a commercial grow I

379
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:54,089
bet you would know where it is now let's

380
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,189
talk about a few things we can do at the

381
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,170
start of the year and probably should do

382
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,660
at the start of every month that will

383
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:02,519
help the grow run smoothly something I

384
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:05,279
really recommend is that at the start of

385
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,250
every month we clean and calibrate the

386
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,230
pH meters you use that pH meter every

387
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,090
time you water the plants that things

388
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,100
should be cleaned and calibrated very

389
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:16,050
often you're dipping it into solutions

390
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,670
with a bunch of salty junk in there it's

391
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:19,439
gonna get build-up then it's getting

392
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:20,729
left somewhere who knows where the grow

393
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,180
techs are putting it hopefully they're

394
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,639
putting it

395
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,899
back in the solution that keeps it safe

396
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,250
maybe not maybe they're just setting it

397
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,199
on the counter maybe they're setting it

398
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,759
in dirty water we need to clean that

399
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,340
occasionally and make sure that it's

400
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,509
clean and calibrated why not the first

401
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,940
of every month

402
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:38,819
clean and calibrate your pH meter also

403
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,970
if you're using a TDS or an EC meter

404
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,760
clean that at the same time now is also

405
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,649
a good time to clean and replace your

406
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,480
air conditioning filters does your air

407
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:50,699
conditioner have a replaceable filter

408
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,920
does your HVAC system have filtration

409
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,140
that needs to be replaced now is a very

410
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:58,079
good time to replace all of those things

411
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:00,419
and write it down make yourself a note

412
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,250
hey I changed all of the air conditioner

413
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,219
filters or I cleaned all of the air

414
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,990
conditioner filters on January 1st now

415
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,610
you've got to know now when the HVAC

416
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,289
tech comes and says man this filters

417
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,029
dirty when is the last time you change

418
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:13,829
this you can just hang your head and say

419
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:16,259
bro I haven't changed that since January

420
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,150
first but right now you probably don't

421
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:19,950
know when the last time it was changed I

422
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,899
would rather have a date than a question

423
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,720
mark so write it down and change that

424
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,970
[ __ ] get it cleaned up also it may be a

425
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,519
good time to check on your carbon filter

426
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,259
is that carbon filter still working or

427
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,090
is it just a decoration at this point

428
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,980
you may want to bring somebody that

429
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,379
doesn't consume and smell a lot of

430
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,509
cannabis and have them walk out side

431
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:41,340
wherever that filter is being blown and

432
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:43,740
just give it a little sniff test can

433
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,750
they smell your grow I can't smell my

434
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,269
own garden I can't smell a lot of

435
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,669
commercial grows unless it is stanky and

436
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:52,500
pungent I don't even notice I'll Drive

437
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:54,120
up to places with other people in my car

438
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,950
and we'll be a half a block away from

439
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,379
some groves and my friends will start

440
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,370
going smells real good here and I'll say

441
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,570
what are you talking about is there a

442
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,549
restaurant or something they look like

443
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,110
dude you can't smell that grow no I'm

444
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:06,359
immune to it I've been around so much

445
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,100
cannabis that I've got to put my face in

446
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,440
it or it's got to be super dank from my

447
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,240
nose to even notice so if you're around

448
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,830
your girl all the time you might not

449
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,810
even notice some people don't even

450
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,520
notice they stink because they stink all

451
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:19,109
day when someone else comes around and

452
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,639
they go bro you smell like armpits and

453
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,560
onions they go oh [ __ ] I didn't even

454
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,240
know somebody had to tell him that's how

455
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,009
I feel about it grow you may not even

456
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,480
know that your grow is stinking up the

457
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,939
whole block until somebody comes and

458
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,470
tells you maybe have one of your friends

459
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,360
be the one to tell you instead of the

460
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,070
neighbors or a law enforcement so is

461
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,990
that carbon filter working

462
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,760
or has it become a decoration that is

463
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,620
just slowing down air flow at this point

464
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,379
check on that it may be time to replace

465
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,480
it again when you replace it get a piece

466
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:46,830
of duct tape write the date on that duct

467
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,870
tape and slap it somewhere on that

468
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,780
carbon filter so that you know January

469
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,519
1st I got a new carbon filter now if

470
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:56,309
you're running an RO machine or some

471
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,679
sort of water filter again it's a really

472
00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:00,929
good time to check and clean and replace

473
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,669
those filters you may think you're

474
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:03,959
filtering your water you may just be

475
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:06,000
running your water through a bunch of

476
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,280
dirty [ __ ] and feeding your plants the

477
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,409
water you started with and wasting a lot

478
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,569
of water the RO machine spits out a lot

479
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:14,579
of waste water if your filters are dirty

480
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,920
it's shooting out a lot of extra waste

481
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,660
water water is kind of precious water

482
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:20,579
sparkin expensive people are gonna say

483
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:22,740
water is not expensive run a commercial

484
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,420
grow run a hundred gallons of water down

485
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,039
the drain and tell me it's not expensive

486
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:27,899
at that point it makes a difference when

487
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,429
you see it in large quantities it almost

488
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,799
hurts your feelings to have to waste

489
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:34,049
that much water so water is precious

490
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,490
water is expensive water is life the

491
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:37,349
plants need water we need water

492
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,970
everything needs water so when you waste

493
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,580
a lot of water you're kind of wasting a

494
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,200
lot of life source so clean up all of

495
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,300
your water filtration that way we don't

496
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,740
waste a lot of water that is my point

497
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:49,079
it's gonna reduce your bills it's going

498
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,180
to reduce waste and it also may increase

499
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,740
the health of your plants you set those

500
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:54,539
filters up for a reason you're trying to

501
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,220
get something out and if the filters are

502
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:57,750
too dirty even work you're just putting

503
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,430
in that crap back into the water and

504
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,919
running it through the filter wasting

505
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:03,779
time wasting water wasting energy so

506
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,209
clean up your filtration if you were

507
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,799
using water filtration another thing

508
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:10,140
that probably needs to be cleaned is

509
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,578
your reservoir if you've got a small res

510
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,380
that you store your water in if you've

511
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:15,930
got a gigantic resin which you store

512
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,449
your water it probably needs a scrub in

513
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,610
I would dry it out drain it dry it let

514
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,289
it dry completely then I would get some

515
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,929
sort of a cleaning product I like to use

516
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:27,389
five-and-twenty I would mix about 15 to

517
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,009
20 milliliters of five-and-twenty in a

518
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,840
gallon of water and I would use that

519
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:33,359
like a cleaning solution I'd dip it into

520
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,549
a rag and just scrub the inside of my

521
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,559
reservoir wear gloves when you were

522
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:39,000
using the fisa and 20 please wear gloves

523
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,250
when you're using the Faiz and maybe

524
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,349
even use goggles I don't know the

525
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,700
recommended PPE for Faiz an but I would

526
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:47,039
certainly wear gloves and I would

527
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,970
probably put on goggles just to be safe

528
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,889
so clean the reservoir

529
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,960
then rinse it out you don't want any

530
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,220
fives n left in there you'll know if

531
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,200
it's left because it makes a lot of

532
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,210
bubbles and it has a very distinct smell

533
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,919
so get rid of the bubbles get rid of the

534
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,450
Phi's and rinse that out real good now

535
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,190
your reservoir is nice and clean and

536
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,798
disinfected now you can go back to

537
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,019
business here we go again get a piece of

538
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:10,619
duct tape write down the date right I

539
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:13,538
cleaned this reservoir on January 1st

540
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:15,158
2019 and stick that on there then every

541
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:16,390
time you see that if it's been a couple

542
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,650
of months it will start to bug you

543
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,970
you'll go man I haven't cleaned that in

544
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,380
a long time it's probably getting pretty

545
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,360
grody and you're right it's getting

546
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,650
grody in there there's funk building up

547
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,779
in there that will start affecting the

548
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,090
health of your plants so now that we

549
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:30,519
were cleaning the tank if you've got any

550
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:31,808
sort of hydro lines if you're in a

551
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,119
commercial environment and you were

552
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:36,069
running a feed system a drip system and

553
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,569
auto water system also known as a

554
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:39,490
fertigation system you guys that's

555
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:41,200
another word for the glossary it may be

556
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,419
a good time to clean out all of those

557
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,000
lines also a good time to clean the

558
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:47,919
pumps you can use that same thysen and

559
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,779
water solution run that through your

560
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,400
pumps you can soak the pumps right in it

561
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:53,200
I don't think it's too corrosive to

562
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,788
where it's going to damage your pump but

563
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,220
it will take off all the algae and all

564
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:59,529
the funk take that pump apart as far as

565
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,390
you can submerge that in the Faiz and

566
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,678
solution take it out give it a good

567
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,750
scrub and you may need to hit it with a

568
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,059
scrub brush and a toothbrush that's just

569
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,589
fine clean up your pump rinse it out

570
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:10,569
real well so there's no fives end

571
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:12,819
solution back left in there clean it out

572
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:14,529
set it aside let it dry clean out the

573
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,178
rest of the lines run that Faiz and

574
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:18,788
water through your hydro lines if you

575
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:20,019
can clean it out really well it is

576
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:22,538
always a good idea when you're building

577
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:24,099
a drip system to put a ball valve at the

578
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:25,450
end of it so that you can run water

579
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:27,759
right through there and is clean out

580
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,500
that whole system so if you haven't done

581
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,359
that that may be a good addition in the

582
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,849
future that may be a good idea for your

583
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,009
next Auto watering or assisted watering

584
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:37,808
project we want to clean out those lines

585
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:40,000
we don't want to let a bunch a funk

586
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:42,369
build up in there I've seen a lot of

587
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,980
nasty [ __ ] build up in the fertigation

588
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:46,750
lines in the long PVC tubes and the

589
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,419
black poly tubes and the skinny poly

590
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,890
tubes I've seen slimy moldy stinky [ __ ]

591
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:53,470
come out of there that you do not want

592
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,030
to feed your plants so clean that up a

593
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,798
little bit of Faiz and a little bit of

594
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:59,319
warm water will go a long way and

595
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,000
cleaning your hydro setup now one more

596
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,349
thing I want to talk about specifically

597
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,150
is our Bowl

598
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:06,519
how long have you been running your

599
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:08,820
bulbs in your veg and your flower area

600
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,990
is it time to swap out your bulbs

601
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:12,759
depending on the quality of the bulbs

602
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,009
you purchased depending on the white

603
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,750
cycle you chose to run depending on your

604
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:19,150
ballast there are so many different

605
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,859
factors that determine it but over time

606
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,809
your bulbs have slowly stopped putting

607
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:25,479
out as much light but they are still

608
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:27,639
consuming as much electricity so it is

609
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,650
always a good idea to consider a bulb

610
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,750
change every couple of harvests

611
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,280
depending again on your bulb strength

612
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,230
are you running a thousand a six or a

613
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,089
four hundred watt bulb did you buy cheap

614
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,250
bulbs or did you buy good expensive

615
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:41,079
bulbs if you bought those lesser

616
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,150
expensive bulbs you may want to swap

617
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,949
them every grow if you bought good

618
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,019
expensive bulbs you may want to run

619
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,210
those two or three grows before you swap

620
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:50,529
them out I understand that bulbs are

621
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,450
expensive you're gonna want to push

622
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,769
those bulbs as many grows as you can

623
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,929
just so that you can maximize your

624
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,700
output with the equipment you've got but

625
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:59,259
keep in mind you may be shooting a

626
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,660
hundred percent of the electricity into

627
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,730
that bulb and only getting 50% of the

628
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,140
lumens that you're expecting so you're

629
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,179
paying for a hundred percent of that

630
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,520
light to come out and only 50 percent of

631
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:12,100
it is coming out it probably costs

632
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:15,279
around $100 a month to run a

633
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:17,139
high-pressure sodium bulb for that $100

634
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,119
a month for the next two months which is

635
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,850
gonna be $200 worth of electricity

636
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,909
you're only going to put $100 worth of

637
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:27,639
electricity onto those plants so there's

638
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,130
already $100 worth of electricity that

639
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,500
you basically didn't do anything with it

640
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,000
got lost somewhere down the line it went

641
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,200
through the electrical wires and went

642
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,400
down through the red through the white

643
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,990
through the black and then it hit your

644
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,759
bulb and it just stopped it didn't come

645
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,419
out of the bulb you paid for it you

646
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,950
didn't get it

647
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:43,900
eventually you'll need to make a

648
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,580
business decision do you want to keep

649
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,250
paying for electricity to come down the

650
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:50,048
wires and just not happen it doesn't go

651
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,619
anywhere or do you want to replace that

652
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:54,940
bulb it may cost you 50 to 100 maybe 120

653
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:57,159
bucks for a really high-end high

654
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,960
pressure sodium bulb swap out the bulb

655
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,669
and actually get all the electricity

656
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,500
you're paying for you're paying for that

657
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:04,690
electricity I do know that that other

658
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,069
bulb cost you more money but you're

659
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,110
gonna spend the money on electricity

660
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:10,089
either way so if you think about the

661
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:13,359
math once that bulb diminishes to

662
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:15,099
approximately 70 60 definitely 50%

663
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,028
you're paying for a hundred percent of

664
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,829
the electricity

665
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:19,538
and you were getting 50% of the outcome

666
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:20,739
so you're spending 200 bucks and you're

667
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:23,108
getting a hundred bucks worth of light

668
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,909
you could go buy another bulb which will

669
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,710
probably cost you a hundred so now

670
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:28,509
you're spending 300 you've got 200 on

671
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,329
electricity and another hundred on the

672
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:32,710
bulb and you were getting 100% probably

673
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:35,199
a hundred and ten percent compared to

674
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,269
what you were getting 110 percent of the

675
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,159
output and your plants are really going

676
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:41,499
to show you a difference and if you can

677
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,599
wait till harvest time it will be worth

678
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:45,460
it if you do the mathematical equation

679
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:47,019
so it's a good time to check on your

680
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,088
bulbs it's a good time to consider

681
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:51,548
swapping your bulbs and here we go again

682
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,138
when you swap that bulb get some sort of

683
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:55,778
sticky note get some sort of duct tape

684
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:59,108
write down I changed this bulb on

685
00:22:55,778 --> 00:23:00,788
January 1st 2019 that way you know when

686
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:02,079
the bulbs are fresh then when they start

687
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:03,308
flickering or when they don't look as

688
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,598
bright as they used to be you could say

689
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:06,338
oh yeah that thing's been in there for

690
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:07,989
two months things been in there for

691
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:10,358
three months it's probably time to

692
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:13,358
invest some of my grow money back into

693
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:15,189
itself and replace that bulb often I

694
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:16,928
talked about using a string and a lumen

695
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,759
meter to determine when to replace your

696
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:20,649
bulbs I will try to go over that really

697
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,088
quickly get something that is a

698
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:23,918
consistent length you can use a tape

699
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:25,569
measure if you have one you can use a

700
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,179
piece of string if that is more handy

701
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:30,398
then you can purchase or borrow a lumen

702
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:32,499
meter they are quite expensive a lot of

703
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:33,968
the growth stores will loan you a lumen

704
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:36,098
meter if you've got a local friendly

705
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:37,808
shop they like to loan them to you that

706
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:39,729
way they know that you're gonna come buy

707
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:42,128
a bulb when it gets too low so get a

708
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:44,139
lumen meter get a brand new bulb fire

709
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:45,848
that bulb up give it a little bit to get

710
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:47,319
to its maximum shine it takes these grow

711
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:49,298
lights a few minutes to warm up to get

712
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:51,308
to their full potential give it maybe 30

713
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:54,098
or 40 minutes to get warm get it shining

714
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:56,829
measure a distance from that bulb maybe

715
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:58,778
12 16 18 inches away then set up your

716
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:00,489
lumen meter and measure the amount of

717
00:23:58,778 --> 00:24:01,298
lumens that you were receiving on the

718
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:04,119
meter right there

719
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:06,249
write it down on day one I was receiving

720
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:08,678
this mini meter or this mini lumens at

721
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:10,629
this distance away on this meter from

722
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,210
this bulb try to remember where you were

723
00:24:10,628 --> 00:24:14,918
like right in the center of the bulb 18

724
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,119
inches away write that down but try to

725
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,169
remember kind of where you were visually

726
00:24:16,118 --> 00:24:19,118
like you're gonna have to line that up

727
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:20,469
and do it again or make a mental note of

728
00:24:19,118 --> 00:24:22,028
where you were physically in the room

729
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:24,548
and how you were doing it because we're

730
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:26,588
gonna do that again about every 30 days

731
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,278
we're gonna do it again in 30 days and

732
00:24:26,588 --> 00:24:28,778
make a note

733
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,859
how many lumens are coming out then

734
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:31,750
we're gonna do it at 45

735
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:33,788
then we'll do it at 60 then let's do it

736
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,548
at 75 then let's do it at ninety days

737
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:39,429
and see how that bulb reduces an output

738
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:42,609
when it gets to like I said earlier 70

739
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:44,320
60 absolutely by 50% you want to swap it

740
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:46,658
out that is a really good way to

741
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,158
determine when to swap out your bulbs

742
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:49,960
and that is also a really good way to

743
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,179
see how much electricity you are

744
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,308
actually wasting that bulb says a

745
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:56,380
thousand watts but over time you know

746
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:57,819
it's only putting out 700 now so you're

747
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,649
getting 300 watts that are just going

748
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:01,538
out to nowhere and you're paying for it

749
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:03,278
if you don't have a bulb that can

750
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:05,888
actually put out the electricity you're

751
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:08,648
pumping into it to be quite honest with

752
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:10,928
you in a commercial grow environment the

753
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:13,599
bulbs and the flowering rooms are the

754
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:16,269
number one hardest thing for me to

755
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:19,329
convince an owner we need to spend money

756
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:21,009
on to replace I will tell an owner those

757
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:23,619
bulbs have been in there for six months

758
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:26,200
it is probably time to change them keep

759
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:28,028
in mind there's probably 50 1000 watt

760
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,038
double-ended bulbs in this room so it's

761
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:32,710
going to be quite an investment but I

762
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:34,720
say we need 50 new bulbs they usually

763
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,069
walk into the room they put their hand

764
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,808
over their eyes like it's a visor

765
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:40,028
they look up into the lights and they

766
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:42,069
say it still looks really bright to me

767
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:44,919
and they don't believe me that those

768
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:47,740
lights are only putting out 50% of the

769
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,049
electricity they are receiving then when

770
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,599
harvest time comes they complain that

771
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:55,000
the yields are not what they were two

772
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:57,668
months ago you know why because those

773
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,288
bulbs are not putting out the lumens we

774
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:02,049
think they're putting out and they

775
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:03,940
refuse to change the bulbs usually it

776
00:26:02,048 --> 00:26:06,519
only takes one or two harvests of low

777
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,320
productivity before they realize this

778
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:10,899
guy is right we need to spend the money

779
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:13,269
on brand-new bulbs and that grow also

780
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:15,788
think about this light is the number one

781
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:18,190
source of energy for our plants yes they

782
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:19,898
do want water yes they do want air yes

783
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,639
they do need some nutrients but the

784
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:23,619
light they receive is their number one

785
00:26:21,638 --> 00:26:26,439
source of life that is what makes them

786
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:28,479
thrive so why wouldn't we do our best to

787
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,308
give them the most light we can afford

788
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,649
to give them in the environment we've

789
00:26:30,308 --> 00:26:34,778
put them in and I don't mean go try to

790
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:37,000
stick a thousand watt bulb in a closet

791
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:38,829
I just mean why not maximize our

792
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,720
potential if you've got a closet put the

793
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:42,668
biggest bulb you can get in that closet

794
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,180
put a 315 in there if you think you can

795
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:45,730
handle it

796
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,400
but when that 315 bulb starts to dim out

797
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,170
starts reducing its output make sure you

798
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,420
replace it that way you can maximize the

799
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:54,580
potential of your gross space and your

800
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,180
grow light no matter the size of your

801
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,519
space

802
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,500
all right podcast ruled that is my New

803
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,389
Year's rant I do have one more thing I

804
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,769
would like to say I would like to thank

805

cannabis from a person who has

845

experience and passion with cannabis you

846
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:26,500

888
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:51,839
did use the patreon contributions to

889
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,730
replace the MacBook on which I record

890

00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:05,730
funding is going it also goes to replace

896
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,649
these microphone covers so that when

897
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,210
Mike comes over and dab and granny come

898
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:10,918
over and Jesse comes over they're not

899
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,720
all spitting into the same microphone

900
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,950
cover so it doesn't smell like Jesse

901
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,048
when granny's here and it doesn't smell

902
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,159
like granny when Jesse's here those are

903
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,168
the types of things that you're covering

904
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,149
also I put water bottles on the table

905
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:22,710
for each of the guests small things like

906
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:24,388
that are covered by patreon

907
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,340
contributions so that is hugely

908
00:30:24,388 --> 00:30:27,839
appreciated not only by myself but by

909
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:29,759
the people who don't have to smell other

910
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,099
folks breath on their microphone covers

911
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,230
