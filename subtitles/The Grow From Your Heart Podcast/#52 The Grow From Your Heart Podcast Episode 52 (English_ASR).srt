huge shout out to Angela for letting me

post that entire show without editing

291
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,839
anything that was really cool of her

292
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,838
some of what she said there was kind of

293
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,760
personal and could have been

294
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,519
embarrassing but she's a badass chick

295
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,679
she's a badass woman she deserves more

296
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,000
respect than being called a chick she's

297
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,479
a badass woman and she let me post the

298
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,958
entire conversation without a single

299
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,360
edit so that's really cool thank you I

300
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,239
hope you're listening to this episode

301
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,360
all right so that was the um Stitcher

302
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,759
and in or and iTunes comment S I had a

303
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,800
little bit of a brain fart there I

304
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,439
really appreciate you guys leaving

305
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,559
comments it shows me that you are

306
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,000
listening to the show and um if you hate

307
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:25,319
the show you can leave a comment because

308
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,240
I haven't gotten the shitty comment yet

309
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,920
and did people just not do that do you

310
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,320
just not you probably skipped it and

311
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,319
don't even want to listen if you you

312
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,240
hated it right you don't even go leave a

313
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,360
shitty review but it makes me feel good

314
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,039
that people are liking it and giving me

315
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,399
lots of good stars please leave me a

316
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,639
review you guys because what that does

317
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,240
is it boosts me up in the iTunes and in

318
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,680
the stitcher rankings and then more

319
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,600
people see the show and then the more

320
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,199
people see the show the more listen and

321
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,519
then the more people grow better

322
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,278
cannabis and the more people have a

323
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,480
better education about cannabis and then

324
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,480
we can dispel a lot of the stupid myths

325
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,920
and rumors and then we can legalize

326
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,200

who I am and honestly The Strain Chim

402
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,600

exist and a lot of the strands that we

409

421
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,240
potency of marijuana edibles the law is

422
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,839
being put into place by the Colorado

Department of Revenue the agency is

424
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,639
hoping to prevent problems that have put

425
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,639
Colorado's budding retail pot industry

426
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,959
under scrutiny and then there's a

427
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,680
picture of this African student uh and

428
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,359
they're trying to blame a lot of this on

429
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,879
him keep reading uh last year African

430
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,240
student an African an African student in

431
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,639
Wyoming Levi uh I'm just going to say

432
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,839
Levi Tamba CU I'm not sure how to

433
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,720
pronounce that uh Levi TBA died after

434
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,600
eating an entire marijuana infused

435
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,600
cookie and jumping off a hotel balcony

436
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,320
uh there have also been several cases of

437
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,040
children mistaking pot for candy that

438
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,800
means some changes for Edibles including

439
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,319
placing marijuana infused candy and

440
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,159
baked goods in childproof packaging each

441
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,800
individual square of chocolate must be

442
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:01,559
marked according to how potent it is so

443
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,758
you guys back in the day when you would

444
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,239
buy I can't even pick a brand because I

445
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,240
don't want to like single out of brand

446
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,039
back in the day when you would buy a

447
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,600
large edible of a candy bar it would be

448
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,759
the size of your normal candy bar that

449
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,839
you buy at the gas station or wherever

450
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,000
at the grocery store wherever you get

451
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,560
your candy bar right you would buy that

452
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,839
one candy bar and it would just look it

453
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,719
would be it would be in a wrapper that

454
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,320
was plainly marked this is a ganja candy

455
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,160
bar but then once you open it you can't

456
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,759
tell it all and now every single piece

457
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,559
they have made a mold that you pour your

458
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,560
chocolate into not you but the companies

459
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:31,239
they pour their chocolate into there

460
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:32,599
and it m it divides it for you into

461
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,799
little squares and they're showing a

462
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,639
picture of it the whole candy bar is 100

463
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,359
milligrams but now they've divided it

464
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,360
into 10 little squares and they're all

465
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,278
labeled 10 uh milligrams THC for each

466
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,318
little square so now it's it's a little

467
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,559
better because sometimes when you buy

468
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:50,000
Edibles uh you don't remember if what

469
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,719
you bought or you don't remember which

470
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,278
is which or sometimes uh the it's hard

471
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,120
to tell if this is a third or if this is

472
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,519
a quarter so now these guys have really

473
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,879
made it nice and easy for you I'll keep

474
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,240
reading the article it's says at The

475
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,759
Incredibles Edibles shop they Mark each

476
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,839
square of chocolate with the number 10

477
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,360
to indicate 10 Mig of THC the

478
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,199
psychoactive ingredient of marijuana 10

479
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,399
is the standard

480
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,318
serving uh in the past Chocolate didn't

481
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,559
have to indicate the amount of THC in

482
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:18,439
each bar some of them were in line with

483
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,518
what industry feels will improve I'm

484
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,199
going to start that sense again I'm

485
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,799
sorry some of them are in line with what

486
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,039
the industry feels will improve safety

487
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,719
out there others seem like Overkill but

488
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,559
we were happy to do it said incredible

489
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,120
spokesman Bob Asino uh some clerks

490
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,799
working at retail pot shops have been

491
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,159
recommending much more which could cause

492
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,039
some issues with those who had not had

493
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,078
much experience with Edibles now edible

494
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,559
packaging contains warnings to eat only

495
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:43,439
a small amount and then wait before

496
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,239
eating more so it says wait 45 minutes

497
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,839
so when you eat this wait 40 this is a

498
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,360
weirdly worded article so it says wait

499
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,920
45 minutes so when you eat this wait 45

500
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,120
minutes to see how it affects you and

501
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:57,278
then you can continue with another dose

502
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,399
if you really wanted to says Sweet Leaf

503
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,439
spokeswoman uh Elizabeth

504
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,799
D that's a long last name Elizabeth D I

505
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,160
won't butcher that for you so they're

506
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,119
showing a picture of the package and it

507
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,160
totally shows like a little it says to

508
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,318
educate and to medicate and there's like

509
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,640
a little clock on there like the one

510
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,959
that you'd see at the store that says be

511
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,079
back in 10 minutes instead it shows it

512
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,600
says take one square wait two hours so

513
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,038
they're trying to encourage you to take

514
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,279
one and wait two hours the problem is a

515
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,558
lot of people don't dude they think

516
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,838
they're badasses and they can just eat

517
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,519
it all but back into the article a

518
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,318
variety of the marijuana infused

519
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,720
products includes including drinks

520
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,399
cookies and cies come in single servings

521
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,798
we just want to educate people that 5

522
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,600
Mig is a good serving not too much not

523
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,879
over the top make it safe said Elizabeth

524
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,719
I can't read her last name I'm sorry

525
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,640
it's long uh this is the first step in

526
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,440
regulation for the Edibles industry this

527
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,320
is a good idea you guys but something I

528
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,120
wanted to bring up uh this is going to

529
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,879
crush a couple of companies I'm sure

530
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,839
because this came up quickly and it had

531
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,440
to happen I think it went into effect on

532
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,480
the first of this month and they didn't

533
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,080
get a lot of time people people had to

534
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,679
pull product that they have already made

535
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,639
already have packaged they had to pull

536
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,360
it all off the shelf and then they had

537
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,600
to repackage it or I don't know if they

538
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,000
were even allowed to repackage it

539
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,558
because if the pieces weren't properly

540
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,798
labeled they had to destroy those candy

541
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,240
bars so I'm certain that this put at

542
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:17,319
least one or two small businesses out of

543
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,400
business because of these new

544
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:21,639
regulations they keep pushing on

545
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,919
us I kind of agree with the whole

546
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,720
situation

547
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,400
because um well I work at the dispensary

548
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,798
and I hang out with people that work

549
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,280
there all day and we insist to people

550
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,759
just take this and they laugh like

551
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,798
they're going to be able like they're

552
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,279
Superman and they don't realize what

553
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:39,879
they're buying is proper like they're

554
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,558
used to buying brownies that their

555
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,039
cousin made or that their Stoner Uncle

556
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,480
made and they weren't that potent so

557
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,640
they're buying these medical Edibles and

558
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,880
they're just getting or they're wreck

559
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,799
edibles but I mean they're made by the

560
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,120
same people to make medical they're

561
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,440
buying these quality Edibles and they're

562
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:54,239
just getting [ __ ] up so I kind of like

563
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,159
the idea that we're marking them each

564
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,679
piece but it's hard for I'm sure it's

565
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:01,159
hard for a business to keep itself going

566
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,600
when every month there's a new

567
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,320
regulation they're like oh you guys put

568
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,439
all those stripes on the package now you

569
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,798
have to put the stripes plus a hologram

570
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,600
you know so that's going to crush

571
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,279
somebody all right let's get into

572
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,759
another news article because that one is

573
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,599
boring as [ __ ] this one is from the

574
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,879
Cannabis what's up to the Cannabis they

575
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,399
read a lot of their stuff this article

576
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,640
is by David magoya he's a writer for The

577
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,840
Denver Post the headline says Oregon's M

578
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,440
Bank pulls out of Colorado a week after

579
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,519
taking on pot accounts a lot of you are

580
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,120
going to say say what but I'll catch you

581
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,879
up to speed it says the Oregon Community

582
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,678
Bank that a week ago openly welcomed

583
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,640
Colorado marijuana industry customers

584
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,960
has changed its mind publicly saying it

585
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,080
doesn't have the infrastructure to

586
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,240
handle the overwhelming response for

587
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,879
service but people familiar with the

588
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,558
move say the retreat was pressed by

589
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,200
Federal Banking Regulators who stepped

590
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,839
in late last week to tell mbank

591
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,558
Executives that Crossing several states

592
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,359
to work with an with an industry that

593
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,918
remains illegal under federal law was

594
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,000
simply too risky following national

595
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,720
press the volume of inquiries in or

596
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,519
Washington and Colorado has been so

597
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,400
overwhelming that we don't currently

598
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,839
have the INF infrastructure to

599
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,440
adequately support all of these

600
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,798
customers and Bank CEO Jeff Baker said

601
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,519
Monday Colorado is the furthest from our

602
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,200
market area and the most difficult to

603
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:17,599
provide the quality customer service to

604
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,440
there are nearly 2200 pot retail

605
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,839
manufacturing and grow businesses in

606
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,080
Colorado according to the State

607
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,720
Licensing data the bank will continue to

608
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:26,759
serve legal marijuana businesses in

609
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,240
Oregon and Washington baker said

610
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,359
industry insiders said the pullback was

611
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,000
not unexpected we've become accustomed

612
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,879
to our banking Solutions not actually

613
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,359
working out said Michael Elliot

614
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,240
executive director of the marijuana

615
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,599
Industry Group after all uh after all

616
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,038
after they got all that press I was

617
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:44,678
wondering if they'd get increased

618
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:46,720
scrutiny and pressure as a result just

619
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,798
like all the other banks have part of

620
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,360
the issue baker said was M bank's lack

621
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,918
of Colorado uh M bank's lack of a

622
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,158
Colorado branch which would require

623
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,280
approval from the state banking

624
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,200
authorities it did not need approval to

625
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,519
accept deposits from Colorado businesses

626
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
so they're just searching for loopholes

627
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,519
to not want to do business with us all

628
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,599
right it says without Branch cash

629
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,720
deposits millions of dollars that often

630
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,240
must be treated uh with cleaners such as

631
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,400
fze to remove the pungent marijuana

632
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,720
smell would have to be made at a Federal

633
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,120
Reserve Bank such as one located in

634
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
downtown Denver from there deposits

635
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,000
would be electronically credited to M

636
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,720
bank's accounts then to its marijuana

637
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,359
business depositors founded in 1995 the

638
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,519
$165 million bank has three orgon

639
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,759
locations in and around Portland it

640
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,480
nearly closed in 2009 following a string

641
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,278
of problems that ranged from inadequate

642
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,558
board management to a balance a balance

643
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:40,359
sheet weigh God I can't even read I'm

644
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,359
sorry you guys that range from

645
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:44,558
inadequate board management to a balance

646
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,359
sheet weighed down by toxic and poorly

647
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:47,879
performing loans that was hard to say

648
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,038
dude I'm going to take a dab here after

649
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,799
this article trust me all right baker

650
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,119
said the five Colorado based marijuana

651
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:56,558
business accounts that were open will

652
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:59,000
most likely be closed I'm not 100% on

653
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,319
that but we're reviewing it another

654
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,480
another 60 inquiries from Colorado pot

655
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,278
shop owners will be sheld he said when

656
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,880
mbank went public with its desire to

657
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:10,119
bank the marijuana sector last week it's

658
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,799
brazenness raised industry eyebrows

659
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,439
banking Regulators such as the Federal

660
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:15,960
Deposit Insurance Corporation which

661
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,720
oversees mbank have have frowned on

662
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,038
institutions that are overt about

663
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,079
working with legal cannabis businesses

664
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:23,759
Colorado's legal pot businesses have

665
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,759
long lamented that their accounts are

666
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:29,519
closed as soon as uh okay as soon as

667
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,599
where they are banking becomes public

668
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,440
that was odd uh this is exactly the

669
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,319
reason why the marijuana industry cannot

670
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,798
say who they have a bank account with

671
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:39,038
and why the banks don't want it public

672
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,879
Elliot said Baker sidestepped the

673
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,319
question about whether the FDIC the

674
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,120
agency he said offered its tactic

675
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,079
approval to the idea only a week ago

676
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,158
that pushed mbank out of control out of

677
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:50,879
Colorado we are regulated by the

678
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,600
government and the expectation is that

679
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,880
we run our bank in a safe and sound

680
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:56,759
matter in the event we don't we Face

681
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,120
severe repercussions from our Regulators

682
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:01,278
baker said certainly regul ERS influence

683
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,038
our decisions but It ultimately is our

684
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:05,400
call so they were definitely co-worked

685
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,079
into it by the FDIC they don't want the

686
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,240
feds don't want cannabis money they

687
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:12,079
don't want us to be able to bank I

688
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,240
think all right I'll continue with the

689
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,079
article sorry I needed a drink others

690
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,759
familiar with the outcome of the FDIC

691
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,678
frowned at the public nature of M bank's

692
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,278
move making it unclear whether the plan

693
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,759
would have met approval had it not been

694
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:26,240
so uh well publicized The Regulators

695
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:27,879
have the gun and all the bullets said

696
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,440
One banking Insider who is familiar with

697
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,320
the FDI and its methods any of us who

698
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,440
have survived the financial crisis knows

699
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,119
exactly how this works if we're not team

700
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,278
players our life becomes

701
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,038
miserable Colorado has had several

702
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:42,640
efforts at banking at banking the

703
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:44,480
marijuana industry go a ride the most

704
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,278
recent a long delay in the opening of

705
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,880
the fourth Corner Credit Union the

706
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:49,480
world's first credit union created

707
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,679
specifically for the pot industry had

708
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,200
expected to open at the new year but it

709
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,960
has not yet been granted a master

710
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,519
account by the Federal Reserve Bank in

711
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,079
Kansas City so there are already two 2

712
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,918
months almost 3 months behind in getting

713
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,278
that open because the feds don't want us

714
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,559
to put our money in the banks so that we

715
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:07,480
can have it on us when they rate US

716
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:09,200
that's why they can take it all from us

717
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,919
all right I'll keep reading a move last

718
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,440
year by the Colorado legislature uh set

719
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,360
the stage for banking for a banking

720
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,919
Cooperative similar to a credit union

721
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:20,278
but has made no progress despite

722
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,799
numerous discussions that's because it

723
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:23,599
too would require the same master

724
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:26,440
account necessary to access the nation's

725
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,879
money system Colorado Springs State Bank

726
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,960
the last Colorado bank to open work with

727
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,600
the marijuana industry closed about 300

728
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
accounts in late 2011 that made concerns

729
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,678
of working with companies that violate

730
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,639
federal law baker said he'll likely

731
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,120
revisit the Colorado plan but it might

732
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,200
take some time the position of state and

733
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:46,278
federal Regulators is that they do not

734
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,399
OB to banking services being provided to

735
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,200
the Cannabis industry he said however

736
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:52,439
they absolutely expect the development

737
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,360
of strong programs time and experience

738
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,278
will allow programs to become stronger

739
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,439
uh it doesn't sound like they want to

740
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,038
work with us at all to tell you the

741
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,200
truth um these dispensaries are making a

742
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:07,319
lot of money and without having a bank

743
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,759
uh I see how difficult it can be because

744
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,558
other businesses don't want to be paid

745
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,759
in cash like whatever businesses are

746
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:15,240
attached to your dispensary I don't want

747
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,879
to if you have a you have to have a

748
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,798
security guard all day long so you have

749
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,159
to pay for security service the security

750
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,839
service does not want to be paid in cash

751
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,799
uh all of the dispensary customers paid

752
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:27,398
in cash so now the dispensary is sitting

753
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,038
on a [ __ ] ton of cash they have to turn

754
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:31,398
that into some sort of of currency that

755
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,158
they can pay the electricity they got to

756
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:34,918
pay payroll they've got to pay the

757
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,278
accountant they got to pay the lawyer

758
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,720
they've got to pay the employees they

759
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:40,759
got to pay the master grower they got to

760
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,159
buy nutrients you know so it's a pain in

761
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,440
the ass to deal with this guys I'm going

762
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,919

day um let's see this article is from

783
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:22,440
Ricardo Baka from the Cannabis once

784
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:25,240

here are 12 stats that Define the year

786
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,880
in marijuana so a couple a couple

787
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,880
episodes ago Spence and matd came on and

788
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,640
we talked about the year in review and

789
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,399
then in episode 50 we talked about live

790
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,720
resin kind of being one of the big dicks

791
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:40,678
of the year uh the Cannabis went and put

792
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,000
together their 12 stats of the Year I'll

793
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,200
read most of these I probably won't read

794
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,398
all 12 of them because I want to get to

795
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,120
the prizes you guys the first one says

796
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:49,879
number one

797
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,798
130.3 metric tons that's Colorado's

798
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:57,320
annual demand for marijuana equal to

799
00:26:52,798 --> 00:27:00,158
36.8 million es of cannabis flour so

800
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:04,359
every year can Colorado sells Andor

801
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:07,120
smokes 36.8 million es that's a lot of

802
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:10,959
es um if you're buying them at a shop

803
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:12,439
that's averaging you about $65 to $70 e

804
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,798
that's a lot of freaking money we're

805
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,798
bringing in it says makes you wonder how

806
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:21,440
many Colorado how many Colorado on use

807
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:23,519
regularly uh the answer to that is

808
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,640
485,000 that's the number of adults who

809
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,359
are 21 and older using marijuana

810
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,720
regularly which they account for at

811
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,240
least once a month

812
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,278
and it's about 9% of the state's

813
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,440
population and then it says and what

814
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,558
about those using more often than that

815
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,679
23% that's the amount of that's the

816
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,240
amount of Colorado's user population

817
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,640
that consumes cannabis nearly daily so

818
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,359
if you're in my club 23% of us we're in

819
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,840
the 23 club we smoke cannabis on a daily

820
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,038
basis uh but what about the out of state

821
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,158
tourists visiting Colorado that purchase

822
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:56,720
legal weed

823
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,760
90% that's the amount of recreational

824
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,360
pot sales out of state tourists are

825
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:03,398
responsible for at shops in Mountain

826
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,839
Town Resort communities so they're

827
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:09,439
saying places like bre and Vil uh 90% of

828
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:11,359
pot sales are from outof State tourists

829
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,159
in my neighborhood in our area what we

830
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,678
have observed I'm going to say about 70%

831
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,120
of the people that stop into the spot

832
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:22,000
dispensary are from out of state and I'm

833
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:24,959
going to say 50% of the people are from

834
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,278
Texas that's just what we have observed

835
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,480
uh being in the place a lot the uh next

836
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:31,919

annual demand are these tourists

838
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,360

839
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,278
Colorado's annual pot demand purchased

840
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,798
by outof state

841
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:44,398

849
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,519
of these cuz they're just ridiculous

850

million that's the amount of col the

892
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,080
amount Colorado has brought in Via taxes

893
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,359
licenses and fees on recreational and

894
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,439
medical Mar I'm not going to say

895
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:23,519
marijuana recreational and medical

896
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,639
cannabis from January to October so $6.1

897
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,759
million has been brought into the state

898
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:31,479
of Colorado just from taxes licenses and

899
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:34,038
fees nothing was sold no product passed

900
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,440
hands that way simply licensing and

901
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:40,480
taxing people 60.1

902
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,200
million oh my goodness all right what

903
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,880
about the cannabis infused Edibles the

904
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,639
cookies and gummies and brownies that

905
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,880
proved to be surprisingly popular in

906
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:49,798
this first year of recreational sales

907
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,360
and then the answer is 10 milligrams of

908
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:54,398
THC that's the state's standard single

909
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:56,879
serving size for marijuana edibles with

910
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,879
100 Mig maximum allowed in an

911
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:04,000
individually packaged product being sold

912
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:06,679
recreationally um 100 mgram incredible

913
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
bar is fine there's nothing you don't

914
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:08,960
need more than that if you're from out

915
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,159
of state and you're coming here and

916
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,038
you're going to buy a 100 milligram

917
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,278
edible you're good don't eat that whole

918
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:17,119
thing I see that that is a a decent a

919
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,679
decent amount 100 milligrams is a good

920
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,278
limit and you can buy multiple of those

921
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,320
because you're allowed up to uh if

922
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:22,720
you're out of state you're allowed up to

923
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:24,558
seven grams of cannabis you're allowed

924
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,319
to divide that into milligrams however

925
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,839
Mill many milligrams are in that candy

926
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,079
bar you can get that many

927
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:33,079
so um here's a neat fact it says and did

928
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,678
any of these Edibles end up making for a

929
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:37,000
crazy Halloween as some thought they

930
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,120
would and then the response is zero

931
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,759
that's the number of reports of THC

932
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,599
laced candy given to trick-or-treaters

933
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:44,278
on Halloween regardless of widespread

934
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:46,038
concern that legal marijuana would lead

935
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:47,558
to pot laced candies in children's

936
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:50,879
Halloween

937
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:53,000
Halls yeah nobody got ganja Edibles

938
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,399
because they're expensive and because if

939
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,919
you bought it you probably ate it

940
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,398
yourself and didn't want to give it to

941
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,519
some kid so those are 12 interesting

942
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,398
facts uh statistics I guess they are

943
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,079
from the state of Colorado for the first

944
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:09,239
year of legal cannabis and I've got one

945
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,918
more article this comes from uh part of

946
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,919
this happened in my hometown in the

947
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:18,120
lovely lovely town of peblo

948
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,240
Colorado um this is why I have said stop

949
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:23,638
shipping cannabis because this dude got

950
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,079
caught and he is going to get [ __ ] and

951
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:27,359
then he'll probably get [ __ ] after

952
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:29,319
that but I'm not going to go there um

953
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,558
the articles from the Cannabis and it

954
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:34,158
says police found

955

959
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:48,798
a picture of a table with uh it looks

960
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:49,959
like this dude has a bunch of eights and

961

he's got ounces and they're wrapped up

965
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,120
and then those ounces are all shoved

966
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,880
into bags and it looks like he's got 1

967
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:02,439
two three four of those ounces per bag

968
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,840
and then he's got 1 2 3 four five

969
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,159
they're like eight of them on the table

970
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,759
and whatever I just push made the thing

971

refresh but yeah he's got several pounds

972
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,800
there and then there's another picture

00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,399
some Aatma

978
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:22,280
concentrates so it looks like this dude

979
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,159
was trying to send the goods back to

980
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,639
Texas and let's read about what happened

981
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,000
to him this article is by Jesse Paul

982
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,280
from The Denver Post I found founded on

983
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,760
the Cannabis it says a Texas man was

984
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,800

985
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,200

987
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:42,480
products some of which was legally

988
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,918
purchased uh from poblo back home um and

989
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,559
I'm curious because they say

990
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,878
$63,000 is that Texas price or was that

991
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:50,679
the price at the dispensary when he

992
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:54,159
bought it or is that street price or is

993
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:55,358
that DEA markup price I'm curious um

994
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,519

995

998
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,800

possession of marijuano with intent to

1005
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,000
distribute here's where the article gets

1006
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,119
interesting to me uh police in Pablo

1007
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,079
began investigating investigating wolf

1008
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,920
early last month after United Parcel

1009
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,039
Service employees reported receiving a

1010
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,400
package that was suspicious the package

1011
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:33,679
was sent by wolf out of peblo to himself

1012
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,400
at an address in San Angelo Texas uh I

1013
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,919
want to know what makes a a package

1014
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,480
suspicious because uh they show a

1015
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,838
picture of this guy and this dude's got

1016
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,119
long hair and he looks like he'd be a

1017
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,199
Rowdy Texas Troublemaker sorry dude I

1021
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,159
like [ __ ] trouble I wonder if that

1022
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,079
was all it took to make him suspicious

1023
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,399
that and the fact that he sent the uh

1024
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,760
package to himself in Texas uh he's like

1025
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,280
I'm Justin wolf and I want to send this

1026
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,119
to Justin wolf that might have been it

1027
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,000
but I'll keep reading it says inside

1028
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,800
police found several double vacuum

1029
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,559

1030

1032
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,760
had cannabis Edibles cough syrup skin

1033
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,838
patches and wax concentrate that had

1034
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,000
been legally purchased from two separate

1035
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,239
dispensaries in poblo

1036
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,639
Colorado Police estimate the marijuana

1039
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:31,400
say they drafted a warrant on Tuesday

1040
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,720
for wolf's arrest and contacted police

1041
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,960
in Texas who arrested him I actually

1042
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:39,439
read this article somewhere else um they

1043
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,800
said that they already have a team in

1044
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,079
Texas that works on this so they the way

1045
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,599

1047
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:49,318

legalization efforts in your own place

1063
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:17,838

time and that money legalizing cannabis

1065

had like a moment of guilt in my heart

1292
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,519
for it and I sat at the table and I was

1293
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,358
like you just dropped one of your

1294
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:43,800
favorite rigs dude and

1295
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,838
then what do you do there's broken glass

1296
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,359
on the table you can be mad for a minute

1297
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:48,639
you can be brokenhearted but then you

1298
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:50,039
you got to grab the broom and the dust

1299
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:51,879
pan and sweep up the [ __ ] broken

1300
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,519
glass and you got to throw that glass in

1301
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,599
the trash and you got to move on right

1302
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,000
that's all I could do because it's

1303
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,318
broken uh I can't glue it back together

1304
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,318
duct tape is not going to work that

1305
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:05,558
shit's done so I had a Moment of Zen as

1306
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:07,400
I was sweeping up this broken glass I

1307
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:09,319
thought there's so many things that

1308
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,000
happen in your life that suck and they

1309
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:13,759
hurt or maybe they're good but you can't

1310
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,039
cling to things because you could drop

1311
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,720
that glass at any minute and that [ __ ]

1312
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,679
could break dude and you can't put it

1313
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,318
back together and sometimes you just got

1314
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:22,960
to sweep some [ __ ] up throw it in the

1315
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:25,519
trash can and [ __ ] walk away and just

1316
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,599
move on so uh when you have some [ __ ]

1317
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:27,838
happen to you just try to learn

1318
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:30,720
something think about it like that

1319
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,880
because I've been stuck on something and

1320
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,598
breaking that

1321
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,599
rig was definitely symbolic in some way

1322
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:37,880
to me and I learned something from it I

1323
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,000
just wanted to share that with you guys

1324
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,358
I broke a rig and I learned a huge Life

1325
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,880
Lesson from it that had nothing to do

1326
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,519
with the rig itself I just this Moment

1327
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:48,519
of Zen came over me and taught me a huge

1328
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,440
life lesson wanted to share that I hope

1329
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,440
you enjoyed it I hope you learned

1330
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,559
something from it also if there's

1331
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,400
something that you're [ __ ] stuck on

1332
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:55,680
that you're clinging to just let it go

1333
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,559
dude I know it's easier said than done

1334
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,000
but I dropped a three $100 rig and I

1335
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,599
swept it up and threw it away there's

1336
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,639
nothing we can do about it just

1337
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,160
sometimes you got to sweep some [ __ ] up

1338
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:05,920
and move on I didn't get cut from the

1339
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,558
rig and I had fun hitting it when I hit

1340
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,800
it so that's all I could do with that

1341
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,599
