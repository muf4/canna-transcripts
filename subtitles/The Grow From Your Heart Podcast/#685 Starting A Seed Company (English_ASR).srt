00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,719
batch of irie genetics congratulations

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,319
brother welcome to the club if you have

63
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,239
any questions about those genetics when

64
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,000
you're growing them i do expect more

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319
emails i will answer all of those

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,719
questions it does say i wanted to get

67
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,119
some a rise to search for a mother plant

68
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,439
and a father plant to breed with however

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,000
a rise was unavailable so i picked up

70
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,479
morning dew that is a great uh cross to

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
pick up unfortunately the rise sells

72
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,759
well i guess fortunately for me

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,680
unfortunately for you the arise sells

74
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,439
out quite quickly that strain has been

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
very well advertised it has gotten very

76
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,840
popular uh that one is all over the

77
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,759
internet so it does sell out quite

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,239
quickly i cannot make enough of that

79
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,158
i've made f2s i'm working on the f3s

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,200
which i will release eventually but i

81
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,639
cannot keep the arise in stock so uh i'm

82
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,759
glad you understand that i'm glad you

83
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,000
went with the morning dude that is a

84
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,598
great backup plan a good decision it

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,919
goes on to say i'll be doing a phenol

86
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,479
hunt and the winner will be breeding

87
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,639
with jinx proof's nine pound hammer

88
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,518
that's going to be an amazing cross

89
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,958
i'm already running strain idea strain

90
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879

91
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,479
thing that happened was like morning dew

92
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,919
nine pound hammer let's start naming

93
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,518
this [ __ ] for some reason that's the

94
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,919
first thing my brain wants to go to it's

95
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,480

99
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,000

103
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,200

knowledge i feel like i was given this

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,080
gift of like gift of gab and the ability

110
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,000
to just retain and uh regurgitate

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,400

116
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,199
spontaneously combust or something so

117
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,359

119
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,919
it says my goal is to practice breeding

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,479
to develop a medicine that works for my

121
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:24,240
wife's chronic pain and nausea which is

122
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,560
a result from an infection uh of um a

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,918
flesh-eating bacteria he did put the

124
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,280
the damn greek words for the

125
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,399
flesh-eating bacteria here but i'm not

126
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,359
even going to try to stumble through

127
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,679
those words uh it goes on to say oh also

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,360
big respect for stepping up to try to

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,519
create medicine for your wife that is

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,600
true love right there creating medicine

131
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,120
for one person that you love dearly to

132
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,639
treat them because you're watching them

133
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,720
suffer you want the quality of both of

134
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,960
your lives to be better big respect for

135
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,360
taking initiative and for having that

136
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,959
passion that that is often what inspires

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,439
a breeder something like this is what

138
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,120
inspires a cannabis grower a breeder an

139
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,519
advocate an activist

140
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,840
this is what gets people on our team so

141
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,439
thank you big respect it says uh third

142
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,279
and i hope your wife is okay also and if

143
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,839
i can do anything let me know

144
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,839
it says 13 surgeries later she lives a

145
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,159
somewhat normal life but the pain and

146
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,399
nausea keep her relying on opiates and

147
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,639
other scary pharmaceuticals

148
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,359
man that is 13 surgeries i couldn't

149
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,960
imagine that surgeries make me uh just

150
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,879
small stuff like i had a tooth pulled

151
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,959
and i had a [ __ ] panic attack all day

152
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,038
for that so surgeries and things are not

153
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,638
up my alley uh she your wife is a

154
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,879
soldier bro big respect to her she is

155
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,079
definitely in the irie army and

156
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,159
something weird

157
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,439
if i take pills i get nauseous i don't

158
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,639
like like uh even ibuprofen or vicodin

159
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,719
or something like that i can't take

160
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
pills they make me want to throw up so

161
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,720
it's amazing how our bodies are so

162
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,039
different that your wife is using these

163
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,360
things to combat the nausea and those

164
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,439
things make me throw up immediately

165
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
it's amazing how our bodies work

166
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,038
there is a point to this it says i would

167
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,079
like to find a strain that helps reduce

168
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,719
the amount of pharmaceutical

169
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,800
pharmaceuticals needed daily yes

170
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,440
that's such a beautiful thing i had the

171
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,000
honor and the privilege of uh being a

172
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,639
major part in the first dispensary here

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,720
in pueblo colorado i was uh one of the

174
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,400
fir i was like the first bud tender to

175
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,919
have a reputation to be i'm not i'm just

176
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,879
saying i was one of the first bud

177
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,719
tenders to develop a bud tender client

178
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,038
blood tender patient relationship with

179
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,400
my clientele here in this area i was

180
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,159
very blessed to be in an area that we

181
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,120
had medical marijuana we established a

182
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,960
dispensary i got to meet sick people i

183
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,319
got to see what it was like when

184
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,680
somebody would come in some of my

185
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,120
favorites of the little old ladies that

186
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,639
were brand new to cannabis the younger

187
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,399
kids they're experimenting they're going

188
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,079
to smoke weed and see what they like and

189
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,439
their hip and their they talk fast and

190
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,879
learn quick but the little old ladies

191
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,199
that would come in and they're like you

192
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,639
know since i tried smoking sometimes i

193
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,000
enjoy this and it's helping with some of

194
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,680
this i would ask them what are you

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
smoking for where is your like what is

196
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,280
your ailment is it your back is it your

197
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,120
neck is it your back and your neck is it

198
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,638
your knees it's your stomach and i would

199
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
give them samples of products to take

200
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,840
home smoke those products and come back

201
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,199
and tell me the results they had with

202
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,959
smoking that product and they'd be like

203
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,879
when i smoked the chocolate chunk i

204
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,560
slept really good and the maui wowie

205
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,560
made my head spin too much and the sour

206
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,839
diesel is too damn stinky like those

207
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
were the kind of reports we'd get from

208
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,879
them but developing that relationship

209
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,038
and learning what would help these

210
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,279
people it was the most rewarding

211
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,318
experience that is uh that drove me

212
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,918
deeper and deeper into growing into

213
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,160
wanting to dial in my medicine and

214
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,598
defining specific strains for people one

215
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,960
of the things i really noticed was

216
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,319
happening when i was working with these

217
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,079
older people is that they would tell me

218
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,000
they were able to eliminate some of the

219
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,758
medicines they were taking if they were

220
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
taking three medicines for pain and two

221
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,919
to help them sleep the right cannabis

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,519
would solve all five of those pills

223
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,279
problems then they don't have to take

224
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,879
the pill that's making them constipated

225
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,000
because of these three pills and then

226
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,360
they don't have to take the pill that's

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,038
messing up their vision because of this

228
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,400
one pill they don't have to take their

229
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:47,519
liver pill because all these other

230
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,279
things are [ __ ] up their liver and

231
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,878
their kidneys like they would just stop

232
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,079
taking so many pharmaceuticals and it

233
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,240
was amazing to see cannabis able to fill

234
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,560
that role just fix their bodies in such

235
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,720
a magical way anyway i'm rambling but

236
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,478
yes it is a beautiful goal to try to

237
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,160
minimize the amount of pharmaceuticals

238
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,000
that anybody is putting in their body so

239
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,199
great goal great passion let me stay on

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,598
focus here

241
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,520

243
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,198

so much that i would like to pursue the

250
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,199
idea of opening my own seed company that

251
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,639
is quite the endeavor that'll be quite

252
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,719
the task i hope you were in it but we'll

253

254
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,800
says uh keeping good genetics around and

255
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200
helping others that need this medicine

256
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,319
is where my head is except i have no

257
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
idea how to continue breeding wise then

258
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
it says i'm learning and i will get

259
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,240
better and the business side and

260
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,240
marketing scare me how might one go

261
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,759
about setting up a seed company legally

262
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,278
in a medical state all right here's

263
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,480
where the main part of the question

264
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:59,360
comes in how might one go about setting

265
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,839
up a seed company in a legal state that

266
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,080
may have recreational past in the near

267
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,560
future sorry for the long message keep

268
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,360
up the great work from danny potts so

269
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,000
our friend wants to start a seed company

270
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,278
in a medical state that possibly will go

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,879
recreational in the very near future um

272
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,958
our friend straight up said that they

273
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,200
are intimidated or afraid of the

274
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,359
marketing and business side that is not

275
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,600
their forte honestly that was not my

276
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,519
specialty either when i started a seed

277
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,959
company so that is something i had to

278
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,039
learn so my advice if you're really

279
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,639
going to do it uh maybe take a small

280
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,120
business school maybe get some business

281
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,639
advisors uh do that stuff early because

282
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,560
i made

283
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,519
so many mistakes as a small business as

284
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,159
a person starting a business but

285
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,480
i did not know i was starting a seed

286
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,240
company when i started this

287
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,320
i know you asked how this started and

288
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,240
for some advice the best way i could do

289
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,720
that is kind of start off by telling you

290
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,959
how i fell into this let me just kind of

291
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,879
segue into how i fell into owning a seed

292
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,879
company then we'll talk about developing

293
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,320
your seed company and some of the things

294
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,679
that came with me starting mine that's

295
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,240
just the best way to make this episode

296
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,639
happen so one two three here we go i

297
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,720
started making seeds because i was

298
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,399
dissatisfied with what i was purchasing

299
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,040
online i was paying a lot of money for

300
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,399
seeds uh they would come and half of

301
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,639
them would be crushed because the

302
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,839
packaging was terrible sometimes customs

303
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,240
would [ __ ] take my seats they

304
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,079
wouldn't even make it to my to my door

305
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,839
um a lot of times i would grow them and

306
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,439
they would be intersex or they wouldn't

307
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,480
even be what they were labeled i would

308
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,839
order these seeds that said they were

309
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,120
going to smell like gasoline and be

310
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,399
covered in trichomes and they would

311
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
smell like [ __ ]

312
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,480
roses and have no trichomes and i was

313
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,240
like that's not really cool of you so i

314
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,320
started breeding i found a few things

315
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,839
that i did like things that did kind of

316
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,440
have some quality to it and then i just

317
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,800
i wanted to make more seeds and see what

318
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,360
i could do and i started breeding for

319
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,039
myself i made seeds i found seeds that i

320
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,959
liked i found plants that i liked i bred

321
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,879
them together i just kept playing around

322
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:56,639
i was just kind of making seeds for

323
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:58,559
myself then i made a lot of seeds then i

324
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,799
started posting pictures to social media

325
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,078
a friend introduced me to instagram

326
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,359
they're like bro you should put some of

327
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,278
the pictures of that killer wheat on

328
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,720
instagram you'd get a good following and

329
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:07,919
i was like i'm not really into that sort

330
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,759
of [ __ ] they're like you're missing out

331
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,278
if you don't do it so i thought i better

332
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,039
post some pictures

333
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,600
started posting pictures of my plants

334
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,599
and my dried buds and flowers to social

335
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,200
media and people started saying bro your

336
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,639
plants are amazing where can we get

337
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,560
seeds and i was like i don't really sell

338
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,480
seeds i don't really sell seeds

339
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,559
and people were like well you need to

340
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
sell us seeds i didn't make that many

341
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,838
seeds i was just making enough for me to

342
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
play with i would give them and

343
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,079
allegedly possibly um well let's just

344
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,759
said give them to my friends all over

345
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,199
the nation and all over the places

346
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,480
people would have my seeds and they were

347
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,600
growing them and they were having great

348
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,440
results

349
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,959
and so they were asking for more seeds

350
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,320
and so i made

351
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,078
the seeds that i had made for myself i

352
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,200
just went back and made larger batches

353
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,120
and started giving them out to my

354
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,600
friends then i put them in a bunch of

355
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,000
bags and i labeled them with my email

356
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,440
address and just what the cross was and

357
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
a couple of hints of what i thought they

358
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,720
would grow like and i went to the very

359
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,320
first high times cannabis cup in denver

360
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,399
colorado the first one they held in

361
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,839
denver i went there and i passed out

362
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,519
probably 500 free packs of seeds just

363
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,760
thinking i was going to give them out to

364
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,879
people because i had a lot of seeds and

365
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,399
nothing to do with them i was just

366
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,320
giving them out i thought it was kind of

367
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,000
fun it was just just a gift to the world

368
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,278
i made a lot of seeds i got what i need

369
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,958
out of it

370
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,519
i have a lot i'm not going to grow them

371
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,000
here are some seeds for the people

372
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,759
shortly thereafter my inbox started

373
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,679
blowing up my friends that i'd been

374
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,919
giving seeds to were posting pictures of

375
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,638
their progress people were impressed by

376
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,639
that so now third party third layer

377
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,000
people i guess were seeing the seeds

378
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,919
that i had made and they said bro where

379
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,919
did you get those and my friend said

380
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,519
this guy ross to jeff and i wasn't even

381
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,479
ross to jeff i was just jeff on the

382
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,759
[ __ ]

383
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,120
jeff there's just [ __ ] jeff on the

384
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,559
internet growing weed

385
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,039
so like my friend ross to jeff made

386
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,719
these seeds and then [ __ ] um they all

387
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,240
those people contacted me then all those

388
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
people that i gave seeds to with that

389
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,480
cannabis cup they started growing and

390
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,320
they started having good results

391
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,480
they started contacting me asking for

392
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,000
more seeds then the same thing happened

393
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,959
with their social media people they

394
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,720
started posting [ __ ] then social media

395
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,559
really made it blow up i was posting

396
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,879
quality photos my friends were growing

397
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,679
quality products posting quality photos

398
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,278
giving out probably 500

399
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,278
they were somewhere between five and ten

400
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,799
packs was like five and ten seven packs

401
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,799
of seeds maybe twelve packs of seeds

402
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,958
randomly in a package i'd walk around

403
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,799
the cannabis cup and if i saw somebody

404
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,319
holding like anything that hinted to me

405
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,319
they were going to go home and grow weed

406
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,320
especially if they had clones or grow

407
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,760
nutrients or a grow light i just hand

408
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,879
them a package of seeds now you've got

409
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,240
everything you need go home and grow

410
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,159
some weed

411
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,399
passing out all those seeds really did

412
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,240
very well for me to establish a name in

413
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,559
the industry so i guess i kind of

414
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,360
accidentally started my seed company i

415
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,518
started it out of pure passion this was

416
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,759
the seeds were made this is why i

417
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,320
believe it is successful a big part of

418
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,039
why i believe it is successful it was an

419
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,199
art that i made for myself it wasn't

420
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,360
something i was doing to make money it

421
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,359
wasn't a product i was trying to pay the

422
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,199
bills with it was something that i was

423
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,959
frustrated with what i was buying i

424
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,278
wanted to make a quality product for

425
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,719
myself that was tailor-made for myself

426
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,039
my favorite thing about growing from

427
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,639
seed is i can find the phenotype that if

428
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,078
i'm growing in a commercial grow we'll

429
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,680
find the phenotype for the commercial

430
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,198
grow if i'm going to grow in a grow tent

431
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,679
we'll find the phenotype for the grow

432
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,759
tent that's in a seed pack you can find

433
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,838
variation and find what you'd like so i

434
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,439
started breeding with those uh to find

435
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,279
what i loved and started making stuff

436
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,120
that i thought was great for me that

437
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,639
worked for my grow environment and my

438
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,360
situation

439
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,159
luckily fortunately my situation my

440
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,399
environment was also a large part of

441
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,639
regular the cannabis uh medical

442
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,240
marijuana the regular grower it was

443
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,320
their environment their situation as

444
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,680
well they had a small home grow they

445
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,120
needed plants that would finish in a

446
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,958
certain amount of time they were highly

447
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,799
potent they gave them huge yields that

448
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,479
had a variety of flavors available on

449
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,879
the menu that's what they were looking

450
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,039
for just like me so it just so happened

451
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,278
that i was making a product that fit the

452
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:04,399
market very well there was a need and a

453
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,159
demand for my product so i kind of fell

454
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,320
into it it was right time right place

455
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,919
lots of passion i feel like if i would

456
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,360
have thought hey man i need to pay the

457
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,879
rent what are we gonna do let's invent a

458
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,879
seed company it would have failed i

459
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,439
would have done it wrong i did this

460
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:21,278
organically i just i just did it and it

461
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,639
happened so um a lot of my experience my

462
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,240
information here is going to be from

463
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,720
experience most of my knowledge is from

464
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,639
experience i honestly wish i would have

465
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,160
had more business knowledge but since

466
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,759
you're starting from scratch i can say

467
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,759
get yourself a business advisor

468
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,320
accountant and lawyer from the beginning

469
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,839
to get all of your paperwork in line so

470
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,199
that's how i got started let me make

471
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,120
sure i covered all of my how i got

472
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,958
started notes here

473
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,799
i was going to events and giving out

474
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,719
lots of seeds

475
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,559
every event that was possible to go to

476
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,639
cannabis cups we used to have the

477
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:54,719
cannabis cups here we'd have the secret

478
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,399
cup we had the 710 cup we would have uh

479
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,399
the secret sash

480
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,720
we would have there were so many events

481
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,198
it was when cannabis first got medically

482
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,120
legal and then recreationally legal here

483
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,120
we were doing events once a month at

484
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,879
least and i would go pass out seeds and

485
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,560
then eventually it came to trading seeds

486
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,759
and then eventually it became to vending

487
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,119
seeds

488
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,680
i used to be what i would call the

489
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,360
backpack backpack warrior i would fill

490
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,278
my backpack up with a bunch of seeds and

491
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,800
just go to the events and sling seeds

492
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,078
out of my backpack and then one time i

493
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,278
got kicked out of the cannabis cup

494
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,359
because they're like dude you can't do

495
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,198
that pay for a booth and i realized

496
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,278
that's absolutely correct i should be a

497
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,078
damn grown-up and pay for a booth right

498
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:34,639
after that a very well-known seed uh

499
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,799
vendor invited me to be a part of their

500
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,639
booth at an event i realized that i

501
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,120
could really do well at those events i

502
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,480
didn't need um anybody to hold my hand

503
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,919
and help me out that i could just get my

504
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
own booth and then the next event i

505
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,439
rented my own booth and things went

506
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,120
crazy from there i got

507
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,720
all the things it takes to build a trade

508
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,639
show booth we got the banner in the back

509
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,720
we got the tablecloth all the stuff to

510
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,799
make a booth look professional and from

511
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,720
there it was basically game on built a

512
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,479
website did all that [ __ ]

513
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,399
but uh going to all those events and

514
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,240
passing [ __ ] out and meeting the people

515
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,400
and then continuing to go to the events

516
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,880
and put my face out in the community and

517
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,720
shaking their hands and being there that

518
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
helps a lot with the brand and that's a

519
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,120
lot of how it got going just being there

520
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,720
uh being part of the crew just showing

521
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,798
up smoking with everybody and having

522
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
seeds and being the guy that's kind of

523
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,879
how it all happened so i do have a bunch

524
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,640
of notes here that we could get into

525
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,319
i wanted to get the organic part out of

526
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,839
the way so i have a couple of questions

527
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,319
you've got a couple of options you want

528
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,319
to start a seed business do you want to

529
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,960
start do you want to sell your seeds in

530
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,200
the retail shops only or do you want to

531
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,960
sell them online i don't think

532
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,558
that doing both is a really good idea

533
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,919
and an option i know there's one company

534
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,160
that does sell their seeds in their

535
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,160
retail store and you can buy them online

536
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,519
there are a lot of legal uh loopholes

537
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,120
and things around that but you should

538
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,038
probably pick one do you want to sell

539
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,798
them in your stores or do you want to

540
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,720
sell them online that's the first thing

541
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,879
to think about if you sell them in the

542
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,600
store you have a lot of licensing to go

543
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,919
around a lot of overhead to cover a lot

544
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,480
of legalities to think about

545
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,080
there is a a lot of advantages you've

546
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,919
got a storefront people will just go

547
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,639
there and buy your seeds that is very

548
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,960
easy but they've got to be regulated

549
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,280
seeds there's a lot of rules around that

550
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,880
um then also people have to go there to

551
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,119
buy your seeds if you sell your seeds

552
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,360
online they can be sold people could be

553
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,879
buying my seeds right now from vendors

554
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,959
while i'm here recording while i'm

555
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,240
editing this show i may be making a sale

556
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,319
i don't even know about it because the

557
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,440
seeds are online they're being sold all

558
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,639
over the place and the vendors are

559
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,080
handling that for me i don't have to

560
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,919
touch them anymore

561
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,918
all that stuff is done the seeds are

562
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,000
being sold that way online

563
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,160
so you can set up a website or you can

564
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,240
set up your own seed brand and then just

565
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,919
send the seeds to vendors and let them

566
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,599
go that way how do you want to do it do

567
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,200
you want the brick and mortar storefront

568
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,480
or do you want the online presence it

569
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
sounds kind of like you want to do the

570
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,558
store which is going to be a lot more

571
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,120
work a lot of legalities it kind of

572
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,440
sounds like i keep saying this but now

573
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,519
is the time to get some business

574
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,880

575
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,599

learn a little bit about small business

577
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,079
or team up with a small business advisor

578
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,759
also you're going to need a lawyer

579
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,319

there are websites that can help you do

596
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,960
that but make sure that you get a lawyer

597
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,798
and an accountant and a small business

598
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,880
advisor or something like that to help

599
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,960
you out so you can start off properly i

600
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,640
said it earlier i wish that i had had

601
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,640
some help when i got started i didn't do

602
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
everything correctly i took a couple of

603
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,000
years to kind of fix some things that i

604
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,440
didn't do right at the start not a big

605
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,679
deal it's just business [ __ ] that had to

606
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,120
be resolved but uh paperwork and

607
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,280
headaches could have been resolved had i

608
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,759
done it correctly the first time so

609
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,119
if you've already got a commercial grow

610
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,720
or anything you already know all this

611
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,239
stuff i'm not sure if you've got a

612
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,960
dispensary you know you want to start

613
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,720
anyway make sure you get advice a lawyer

614
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,000
and an accountant those things all help

615
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
you out and then make sure that they're

616
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,159
not friends uh you don't want your

617
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,720
lawyer and your accountant to be buddies

618
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,080
um and then if the business advisor you

619
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,279
don't want them teaming up against you

620
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,199
make sure that your money is being

621
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,879
watched by everybody make sure they're

622
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,319
all after each other because when they

623
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,720
team up on you that's when [ __ ] can go

624
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,879
wrong so lawyer up get yourself an

625
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,600
account and get that business advisor

626
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,679
then you're going to have to build a

627
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,000
reputation that's one of the hardest

628
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,919
parts about creating a seed company sure

629
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,960
you made a bunch of seeds now what what

630
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,720
are you going to do with them why does

631
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,240
anybody want those seeds what comes out

632
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,480
of those seeds have you built a

633
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,079
reputation you're going to have to give

634
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,200
away seeds people are going to have to

635
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,038
grow them they're going to have to see

636
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,558
what comes from them you're going to

637
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,720
have to grow them that's the first step

638
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:05,279
make seeds grow them find something you

639
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,759
know is worth putting to market then put

640
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,119
it to market have it tested all over the

641
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,558
place we'll talk about testers in a

642
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,038
little bit have it tested in so many

643
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,720
different environment situations

644
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,359
then if you feel like it's ready to go

645
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
to market put it out there but

646
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,719
you're gonna have to build a reputation

647
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,919
why does anybody want to buy your seeds

648
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,000
what do you offer what do you bring to

649
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,520
the table that's not already there of

650
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
course if you've got that storefront

651
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,038
people are coming in to buy product

652
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,799
already maybe seeds are an upsell maybe

653
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,240
they just happen to be looking for seeds

654
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,319
maybe you're the only shop on the block

655
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
with seeds that always helps but what is

656
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,678
going to drive people to your brand how

657
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,679
do you build a reputation how do you

658
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,840
build the demand and then once you've

659
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,679
built a reputation and built a demand

660
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,439
how do you continue those people to keep

661
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,080
coming back for your seeds how do you

662
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,840
how do you create sustainability you've

663
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,199
always got to be creating new stuff

664
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,918
which means you've always got to have

665
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,919
stuff out testing as a breeder the stuff

666

producing new crosses

687
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,720
you've got to be testing them and

688
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,120
getting them out and you've got to have

689
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,880
a reliable product it only takes one bad

690
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,798
batch of seeds to ruin a breeder's

691
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,240
reputation i've seen it happen to you

692
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,759
guys if you pay attention to the seed

693
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,839
game you've seen people that were around

694
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,000
for a long time put out one or two bad

695
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,000
batches of seeds then they disappeared

696
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,599
their reputation is shot they're at the

697
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,200
events they used to have a line around

698
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,719
the block for their booth now there's

699
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,400
just a few people coming up because they

700
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,038
ruin their reputation by putting out a

701
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,559
few bad one or two bad batches of seeds

702
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,319

703
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,000

trying to discourage you i'm asking you

723
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,038

to buy your seeds

726

why do you stand out from the plethora

727
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,599
of other breeders why not to sound

728
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,599
egotistical why does somebody want to

729
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,439
buy your seeds over my seeds i've been

730

738
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,400
criticizing them asking a real business

739
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,079

768
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,440
let's talk about just kind of a basic

769
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,119
day of a small business owner you get up

770
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,320
you do your normal morning routine i

771
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,759
don't know what you do get some food in

772
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,200
you probably poop get some coffee i

773
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,200
don't drink coffee but whatever gets

774
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,200
started right then there is garden work

775
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,640
to do the first thing that i do is take

776
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,720
care of the garden the plants need

777
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,799
attention if it's the home grow if it's

778
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,480
a commercial grow always knock out the

779
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,158
plant work first thing

780
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,000
if i gotta go to a commercial grow

781
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,679
sometimes i hit two commercial grows in

782
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,919
a day go make sure that all the plants

783
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,759
are good teach the staff what to do then

784
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,840
get back to my personal grow take care

785
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,278
of the personal grow the plants are done

786
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,599
sometimes there's not much to do to the

787
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,759
plants sometimes there are hours and

788
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,278
hours of work to do to the plants maybe

789
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,960
you have to do transplanting maybe you

790
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,558
have to cut clones you have to keep the

791
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,079
plants alive you have to breed them you

792
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:07,200
have to do all the plant work you have

793
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,558
to harvest them you have to get the

794
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,000
seeds out of them

795
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,278
that's a lot of work to be done with the

796
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,359
plants then

797
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,038
then after that try to take a little bit

798
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,119
of a break take a shower get cleaned up

799
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,759
get all the the work off of me then we

800
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,759
do emails there are a lot of emails to

801
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,599
be handled there are business emails

802
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,079
there are customer service emails

803
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,240
businesses with vendors i have so many

804
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,240
emails i honestly cannot keep up and

805
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,400
it's giving me anxiety just freaking

806
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,400
thinking about it right now so that is a

807
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,320
full-time job within its own just just

808
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,000
answering emails then on top of that

809
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,839
there is social media if you try to stay

810
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,839
relevant on social media that could take

811
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,278
up a good portion of your day i try to

812
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,278
stay away from that because i can really

813
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,119
get sucked in i'm sure you notice when i

814
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,960
do get sucked in there's four or five

815
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,558
pictures for like 30 minutes just

816
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,480

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,798
of things that you have to take care of

861
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,759
then um

862
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,599
testers testers are a big part of being

863
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,240
a successful seed company you've got to

864
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,398
develop a relationship with your testers

865
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,558
if i make a new cross

866
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,158
i know the parents of that cross i know

867
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,558
the grandparents of that cross and

868
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,159
possibly the great grandparents on both

869
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,519
sides i should be able to grow that

870
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,039
plant like a champion uh i'm a a

871
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,599
professional grower with a lot of

872
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,359
experience and i know all of the details

873
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,439
of that plant i've got the [ __ ] cheat

874
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,079
code for those seeds i better be able to

875
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,000
grow it like a pro what i do is send

876
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,678
those seeds out to my test crew big

877
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,519
shout out to the test team you guys know

878
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,759
who you are they're the people who run

879
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,679
the seeds in their specific grow

880
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,640
environments and show me what i really

881
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,320
made

882
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,240
they're the people that are gonna see

883
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,000
what it grows like under this kind of

884
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,798
light with this humidity with this type

885
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,480
of nutrient in a tent in a basement in a

886
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,480
warehouse they're gonna see that sort of

887
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,880
stuff for me you've got to develop a

888
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,360
relationship with your test crew which

889
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,679
again puts you back sitting at the desk

890
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,519
answering emails doing facetime calls

891
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,759
checking the social media checking in

892
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,278
with all of the testers the testers are

893
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,079
a big part of the team without the

894
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,359
testers i would not have success uh i

895
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:22,879
would be years behind without the

896
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,278
testers i couldn't do all the testing

897
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,520
that they do for me um

898
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,839
probably a thousand seeds went out to be

899
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,960
tested in the past week so the testers

900
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,240
are a big part of the team um if you're

901
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,720

day um and we've only gotten to the

914

people i want to hang out with and talk

917
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000

918
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,679
dinner and take a break so uh being a

919
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
seed breeder and owning a seed company

920
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,679
what i'm getting at is a full-time job

921
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,079
it's a full commitment so unless you are

922
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,320
in it to win it and fully dedicated i

923
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,720
really wouldn't suggest getting into

924
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,720
that unless you can commit to it

925
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,558
another thing we should talk about is

926
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,360
building a fan base we've talked about

927
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,119
this earlier a little bit uh becoming uh

928
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,879
relevant why do people want to buy your

929
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,119
seeds then once you've got them how do

930
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,320
you retain them if you can develop a

931
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,479
solid fan base of just a solid number i

932
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:41,200
have approximately 200 patreon

933
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,960
supporters and there's about 500 to a

934
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,880
thousand people that really support me

935
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,278
very strongly there's like a a close

936
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,520
group of 250 people of anything i put

937
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,440
out if it's a grinder a t-shirt a pack

938
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,679
of seeds they'll grab it right away then

939
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,399
there's like a group of about 500 people

940
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,038
the fringe that buy a lot of stuff then

941
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:01,278
there's like a thousand people that buy

942
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,960
enough and if you can just build

943
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,880
a nice little following like that that

944
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,759
will help sustain you don't work don't

945
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,080
worry about going major too fast slowly

946
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,759
build and have a loyal following try to

947
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,759
try to make some friends that that are

948
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,359
in your fan base and you're i hate even

949
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:16,558
calling them fan base or following but

950
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,079

954
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,038

00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,759
make you successful without them you

980
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,600
would not exist without my fan base

981
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,200
without the people watching this

982
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,038
without the people watching the podcast

983
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,038
i would just be some psychopath with two

984
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,879
cameras a microphone and way too many

985
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,720
[ __ ] toys this would be weird without

986
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,120
the people buying the seeds i would not

987
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,200
be successful i would not eat dinner i'd

988
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,119
be skinnier i wouldn't have a nice shirt

989
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,278
i look like [ __ ] life wouldn't be what

990
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,558
it is so you've got to show love to the

991
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,880
people that show you love when you

992

993
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,679

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,079
the people

995
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,600
that make you who you are so remember

996
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,759
that the day you get started with this

997
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,000
idea of making a seed company you are

998
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,440
already working on your reputation as

999
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,440
that seed company the people that

1000
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,440
already know you are putting your

1001
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,159
character and your reputation into your

1002
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,798
seed company so start strong start off

1003
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,600
correctly don't cut corners

1004
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:59,759
make quality products uh be fair with

1005
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,398
your customers have quality customer

1006
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,240
service did i mention that i spend about

1007
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,239
uh at least an hour or two every day

1008
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,440
answering customer service emails a lot

1009
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,278
of people are gonna say no he doesn't

1010
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,519
because he doesn't reply to me i've got

1011
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,440
about 30 000 emails that i try to answer

1012
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,599
and it's overwhelming because every time

1013
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,519
you answer them they reply and you have

1014
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,599
more emails i love you guys and i'm not

1015
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,919

1016
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,599
operation i do the podcast the seed

1017
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,759
company i've got a daughter i've got

1018
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,359
friends like i got [ __ ] going on trying

1019
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,119
to keep up with it all

1020
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,038
thank you for keeping me overloaded

1021
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,918
anyway the main part of this question

1022
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:35,679
was um how might one go about setting up

1023
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,159
a seed company legally and a medical

1024
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,640
state uh that is a great question the

1025
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,559
first advice lawyer up get that account

1026
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,240
get that business advisor make sure they

1027
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,319
are on your team guiding you so that you

1028
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,200
don't make any legal mistakes and get

1029
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,599
yourself in trouble then breed high

1030
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,759
quality highly tested products that's

1031
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,759
what your goal is breed the product that

1032
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,919
you are proud to put out to your

1033
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,000
consumer if you're not proud to put it

1034
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,159
out if you wouldn't be happy buying it

1035
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,720
don't put it out to your consumer build

1036
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,278
a loyal fan base connect with them and

1037
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,119
then stay relevant then think about the

1038
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,398
future i don't know the future of seed

1039
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,480
breeding in the future of seed

1040
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,638
purchasing in the future of cannabis try

1041
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,679
to project that and try to stay on top

1042
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,919
of it

1043
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,679
something that i've done i try not to

1044
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,679
[ __ ] with the hype there are enough

1045
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,358
people out there doing the hype [ __ ] i

1046
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,519
try to dodge that and do my own thing

1047
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,199
again that is why i think it works

1048
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,358
because i'm not doing what everybody

1049
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,759
else is doing what everybody else wants

1050
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,159
i'm doing what is working for me what i

1051
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,079
love and then my art is showing that i'm

1052
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,800
putting passion into it and that makes

1053
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,639
it desirable and successful so bottom

1054
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,359
line bro grow from your heart and breed

1055
