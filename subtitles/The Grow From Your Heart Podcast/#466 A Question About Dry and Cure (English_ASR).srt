right boys and girls I did say that I

40
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,679
was going to read some emails this

41
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,390
episode actually came to me from social

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,310
media I do not know that this person

43
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,540
wants their identity revealed so we're

44
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,240
just going to jump right into this

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,890
message it goes like this I just wanted

46
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,169
to reach out and let you know that I

47
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,360
really appreciate the info and insights

48
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,780
that you provide on the podcast a that

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,160
is a great way to start you were very

50
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,349
welcome thank you for the great

51
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,870
compliments it goes on to say I just

52
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:22,840
listen to episode 465 and you hit the

53
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,330
nail on the head with the CHS topic you

54
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,700
guys I got so many responses and so many

55
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,410
emails on the CHS topic I am going to do

56
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,479
a recap and a revision on that soon I

57
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:33,699
will have to because my YouTube channel

58
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,988
is just exploding with comments but this

59
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:37,060
is the first one that I printed before

60
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,560
they all flooded in so this is the one

61
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,590
we were going to focus on really quickly

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,840
it goes like this I found out that

63
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,939
without a patient diagnosis our doctors

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,640
cannot get paid from the insurance

65
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:50,229
companies for your visit so what he's

66
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,208
saying is when you go to the doctor and

67
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:54,099
they examine you if they can't write

68
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:55,569
down a word of something that is wrong

69
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,819
with you and have a title for it

70
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:00,129
they're not going to get paid so because

71
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,799
there is no test or even any studies to

72
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:05,109
back the CHS theory it is often used as

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,510
an easy diagnosis that is hard to argue

74
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,130
against as the patient yes

75
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:10,659
we're patients most of us are not

76
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,370
doctors we go to the doctor they say

77
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:14,109
that's probably what you've got and they

78
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,300
write it down now that you can get paid

79
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,340
you've got a diagnosis and they can move

80
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,980
on to the next patient unfortunately

81
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,049
many doctors are forced to see too many

82
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:25,060
patients in too little time I'm sure

83
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,980
that it's not the doctors goal and idea

84
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,449
to do it that way it is just a practice

85
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,729
of business and that is how the hospital

86
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:33,069
and how any sort of medical place is run

87
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:35,139
it is now a business you are a patient

88
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:37,060
but you are mainly a customer so you're

89
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:38,619
absolutely correct they do need a

90
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,390
diagnosis they need to get you out of

91
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,430
there and it is very hard to argue that

92
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:44,469
as a patient so there is more to this

93
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,659
email it says I ended up finding out

94
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:48,219
that I get migraines after two years of

95
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,379
studies and tests with most doctors

96
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:52,719
trying to blame my medical cannabis use

97
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:54,280
as soon as I mentioned it I am one of

98
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,229
the very few people that suffer from

99
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,900
migraines with nausea and vomiting

100
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:00,909
issues then they wrap up the message by

101
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,469
saying sorry for the rant take a fat dab

102
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:05,289
and give your mom a hug then they sign

103
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:06,909
it with great work as always I

104
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:08,858
appreciate the great compliments I am

105
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:11,319
for sure going to take a fat dab I will

106
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:12,820
give my mom a hug for you now let's

107
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,478
touch on this a little bit this person

108
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,918
gets migraines and also gets nausea and

109
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,750
vomiting and the doctors were

110
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,879
immediately attributing it to his

111
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,990
cannabis use or their cannabis use they

112
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,879
did not mention their gender

113
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,319
I should stop assigning genders to

114
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,569
people I could be wrong and I could be

115
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,519
offensive however

116
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,430
this person went to the doctor and they

117
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,199
kept getting told that they have CH s

118
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,569
this person believes that since the

119
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,060
doctor could not find a reasonable

120
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:42,060
explanation for their symptoms they

121
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,470
simply wrote it off as CH s and that can

122
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,360
be really dangerous and really

123
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,160
frustrating because after more tests and

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,170
more research and of course more money

125
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,939
being spent this person found out that

126
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,280
they actually have migraines that cause

127
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,160
nausea and vomiting it probably does not

128
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,679
have anything to do with CH s or

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,270
cannabis hyperemesis syndrome there's

130
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,090
something that happens when anybody is

131
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:05,849
trying to diagnose a problem or do some

132
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:07,589
sort of investigation or maybe a repair

133
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,420
and you're on a path and you're just

134
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:11,069
thinking what could the problem be and

135
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,870
you've got these doctors have very

136
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,849
limited time they need to focus on you

137
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,590
for 10 or 12 minutes and get out of the

138
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,240
room and get on to the next patient so

139
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:20,579
they can just keep writing receipts and

140
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,250
I should do a disclaimer there are many

141
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:25,379
great doctors who do great service

142
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,689
unfortunately many of the emergency room

143
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,790
doctors many of the affordable doctors

144
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:32,040
are forced to work under less than

145
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,390
desirable conditions but they'd like to

146
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,990
have a job they've got to pay for

147
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,060
medical school

148
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,710
they've got [ __ ] needs they need

149
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,449
groceries and rent so they're forced to

150
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,549
work in whatever type of environment

151
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,079
they can find employment and so they do

152
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,699
that that is what they're doing it

153
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,289
probably isn't their choice they're

154
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,120
seeing too many patients a day they're

155
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,730
seeing patients for too short of a time

156
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,709
they've got a very short timeframe to

157
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:55,140
come up with the diagnosis and when you

158
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:58,079
say well I also smoke cannabis that

159
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,430
little bell goes off possibly CHS they

160
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,810
look at all the other things on the map

161
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,449
and they go yeah nothing makes sense I'm

162
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,879
just gonna write down CHS next it's like

163
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,420
the all all of the above on the test it

164
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,949
just works

165
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,710
it's an answer you can get away with it

166
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:12,709
move forward and in this case for the

167
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:14,729
doctor unfortunately there is no

168
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:16,199
repercussion there's no circumstance

169
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,759
there's no consequence

170
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,860
you just write that down and move

171
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,899
forward unfortunately the patient has to

172
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,550
deal with that for their life or until

173
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:24,929
they do get it figured out now

174
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,079
fortunately or I guess unfortunately

175
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,879
either way fortunately this person was

176
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,500
able to find a doctor that could figure

177
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,509
out what really was wrong with them and

178
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,389
they've been diagnosed with nausea and

179
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,129
vomiting associated with migraines so

180
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,050
until they found the right doctor they

181
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,339
were just going to be getting told the

182
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,930
wrong diagnosis

183
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,939
just to be blown off and just to get

184
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,379
that insurance money so that was a great

185
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,939
message that came in right after the

186
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:49,500
episode came out so I wanted to grab

187
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,329
that one print it out and read that here

188
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,980
on the show thank you for sharing your

189
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,990
experience I hope you have found

190
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,490
something to alleviate the pain the

191
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,769
nausea and the vomiting from those

192
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,240
migraines migraines are terrible I have

193
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:02,159
a traumatic brain injury for a little

194
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,530
while I was very light sensitive and

195
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,810
very noise sensitive and very everything

196
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,789
sensitive due to a brain injury so I

197
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,500
know what it is like to have a migraine

198
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,910
I understand those symptoms and I

199
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,560
definitely hope you've got that under

200
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,870
control hey thank you for the great

201
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,089
message and thank you for supporting my

202
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,340
theory a little bit with the CHS that it

203
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:22,379
is kind of just a label for lazy doctors

204
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,869
to write down so they could say they

205
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,459
found a diagnosis alright I spent more

206
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,410
time on that one then I wanted to so I'm

207
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,209
going to quickly move to the next email

208
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,680

209
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:33,870

219
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,199
goes a lot like this Russ to Jeff your

220
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,879
podcast is awesome thank you so much for

221
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,310
taking time to deliver such a

222
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,569
high-quality growing podcast man I

223
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,970
really like the way this is starting

224
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:04,980
thank you bro I always look forward to

225
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,500
listening to your podcast because the

226
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,600
sound quality is superb and you have the

227
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,029
perfect radio voice and that is a huge

228
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,920
compliment I do put a lot of effort into

229
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:16,379
making sure that the sound of the show

230
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,350
is top-notch I was kind of an audio nerd

231
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,579
I was a musician I am a musician I was

232
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,770
into that way before I became a

233
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:25,019
podcaster or got into podcasting

234
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,490
so I appreciate knowing and hearing that

235
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:27,719
it sounds good and then hearing that I

236
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,370
have a radio voice really is

237
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,680
embarrassing because I don't like my

238
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,360
voice at all it took me 50 episodes to

239
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,980
get comfortable hearing myself now it is

240
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,060
just normal but I appreciate that

241
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,980
because I don't like it so I'm glad

242
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,869
people do and it is funny when people

243
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,430
like you've got that smooth radio voice

244
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,230
especially when dude said it's really

245
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,089
awkward but thank you I do appreciate

246
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:48,300
that we're gonna keep moving it goes

247
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,310
like this I've learned so much from your

248
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,349
podcast and I have applied as much as I

249
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:54,329
could to my second ever grow

250
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,259
I think the bud turned out really good

251
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,850
with your help

252
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:58,500
and your genetics and he says I was

253
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,730
growing Rocksteady so I'm glad the rock

254
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,100
said he worked well for you

255
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,200
that was a huge contributing factor to

256
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,790
the quality of your outcome goes on to

257
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,620
say however I wanted to ask you a

258
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:10,139
question regarding curing because I have

259
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,210
read many forums online with conflicting

260
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,679
information and it says PS I know you

261
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,629
don't recommend reading forums

262
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,389
I just wanted some quick info related to

263
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:19,919
the issue I will explain below now Brian

264
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:21,509
is very accurate most of the time I

265
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,289
don't recommend getting your information

266
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:28,080
from the online forums there is a ton of

267
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:30,929
[ __ ] and false information on the

268
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,820
internet but there is also a ton of

269
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:34,529
quality information if you are smart

270
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,360
enough to sift through it if you were

271
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,250
smart enough to do some comparisons if

272
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,990
you can read five articles and say this

273
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,370
one sounds like [ __ ] these two makes

274
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,950
sense this is the one I should probably

275
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,840
go with and then just disregard one of

276
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,850
them probably you should be able to

277
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,560
figure out which articles are [ __ ]

278
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,180
and which makes some sense once you get

279
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,369
a little bit of experience and you have

280
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:56,189
a basic understanding but until then

281
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,779
those forums can be really confusing and

282
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,940
really misleading and they can really

283
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,459
cause you more problems than they can do

284
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,280
you good so quite often I say to avoid

285
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,889
the forum's unless you are able to sift

286
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,139
through the [ __ ] on your own those

287
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:13,049
forums that were feeding people [ __ ]

288
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,299
are a big part of why I do this podcast

289
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:16,919
I just saw a group in Facebook where a

290
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,599
person was telling somebody to harvest

291
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,789
their plants based on the ripeness or

292
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,800
the brownness of the hairs on their

293
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:24,539
plants the pistils that were saying now

294
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,399
that the pistils are brown it is time to

295
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:27,659
harvest and we're not smoking pistols

296
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,059
the pistols don't have [ __ ] to do with

297
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,860
it we want ripe trichomes so let's not

298
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,479
pay any attention to the pistols so

299
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,370
you're right sometimes the forums and

300
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,539
the Internet can be [ __ ] but also

301
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,980
who's to say that I know what I'm

302
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:39,689
talking about I'm sure I've come on here

303
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,149
and said at least three wrong things

304
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,710
before so who knows we just got to be

305
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,360
very careful to filter out the

306
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,280
information try to get your information

307
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,440
from a qualified source I would like to

308
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,569
believe that is me I'm going to continue

309
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,940
with this email because this copper Kim

310
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,940
from Green Dot labs has got me rambling

311
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,060
let's get back into it it says does the

312
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,430
curing process stop at 54% when you were

313
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,829
curing in jars the blood that I grew

314
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,799
started at 70% and he's talking about

315
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,980
70% moisture content humidity in the

316
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,500
jars and I was

317
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,350
gradually trying to bring it down to 55%

318
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,110
through burping but it got away from me

319
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:20,560
one day and as a result the humidity in

320
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:23,199
the various jars ranged from 52 to 55

321
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,239
percent relative humidity so he was

322
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:28,359
burping the jar slowly his intention was

323
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,370
to start off at 70 and then you seal the

324
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,169
jar and while the jar is in there the

325
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,730
moisture kind of gathers into the jet

326
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:35,139
comes out of the buds and it sweats out

327
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,778
of the buds the moisture and the air

328
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:38,919
ends up in the jar there's a process to

329
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:42,070
that that we'll talk about in a moment

330
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,198
you open the jar the moisture is able to

331
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,879
release the jar the air and the moisture

332
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:47,379
come out of the jar that will also bring

333
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,879
out chlorophyll in that process that

334
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:50,860
chlorophyll has now been turned into a

335
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,409
gas and it is releasing that from that

336
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,000
jar then you seal the jar back up now

337
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:57,159
there's a little less moisture in the

338
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,589
jar because we've just let a portion of

339
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,909
it out we seal it up and now we give the

340
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:03,699
opportunity for more of that moisture

341
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:05,399
within the bud to kind of escape it

342
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:07,929
sweats out of the bud and becomes

343
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,850
atmospheric into the jar we open the jar

344
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:12,009
and it escapes along with that process

345
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,440
we're turning chlorophyll from a

346
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:16,389
chlorophyll pigment into a gas that is

347
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,610
basically what is happening that gas

348
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:21,039
allows that chlorophyll to leave the

349
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,139
plant then we open the jar it leaves the

350
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,389
jar we're gonna do that multiple times

351
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:29,680
each time we want to reduce the humidity

352
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:31,899
in that jar very little 1/3 maybe 5% so

353
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,489
we can do it over a period of time now

354
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,620
it sounds like Bryan got carried away

355
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,778
and maybe possibly left the jar open for

356
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,149
too long or something went wrong and he

357
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:43,299
has got some cannabis in the jars or the

358
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:45,759
relative humidity are ranging from 52 to

359
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:48,129
55 percent now we'll get back into the

360
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,860
email it says I have since brought the

361
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:53,198
bud back up to 58 to 59 percent relative

362
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,818
humidity by using cannabis leaves and

363
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:56,799
you guys if you get your herb to dry it

364
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:58,629
is okay to pull a couple of leaves out

365
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,479
of the garden and drop those right into

366
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:03,370
your tearing jar and seal it up but be

367
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,589
very careful because you will be amazed

368
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,360
at how much moisture is in that bud or

369
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:10,060
in that leaf and how quickly it goes

370
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,649
into that bud and just pay attention so

371
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:13,539
you don't mold it up please it will

372
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:16,240
happen very quickly check on that jar

373
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:18,399
very often very soon more frequently

374
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,079
than you think you need to the reason I

375
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,000
recommend to use a cannabis leaf is

376
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,479
because it is the same Brix level it's

377
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,610
the same

378
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,379
plant it's the same flavor it's not

379
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,240
going to make any funky aromas or

380
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:29,889
flavors in your finished product it is

381
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,139
the same thing you're putting the same

382
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:33,970
kind of plant in the same kind of plant

383
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:37,000
many people will recommend other things

384
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,399
people recommend fruit people recommend

385
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,519
maybe like a q-tip with moisture on it

386
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,350
many people will use a humidity pack

387
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,990
from different brands I don't recommend

388
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,240
any of that cannabis leaf is probably

389
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,190
free and probably available so let's use

390
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,289
that and not [ __ ] up the flavors and

391
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,630
aromas of our product let's keep going

392
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:57,370
Bryan has put leaves into the jar he's

393
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:59,078
got the humidity back up where he wants

394
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,328
it and now here's where the question

395
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:03,819
comes in it says I have read in many

396
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:07,028
forums that the cure is over once the

397
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,028
humidity drops below 54% and you cannot

398
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:12,909
reinitiate the curing process you can

399
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:16,299
remoisturize the bud obviously but as

400
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:20,230
the curing state entirely over once the

401
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:23,198
relative humidity drops lower than 54%

402
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,839
that is a really good question

403
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,849
I am NOT able to give you a solid

404
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,920
scientific answer I'm going to be

405
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,959
completely honest and transparent that

406
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,599
that is a science question that is a

407
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:37,268
little bit past what I am qualified for

408
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,550
I can speak from experience and I can

409
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:41,709
give you bro science so here's what I

410
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:45,039
know when we are curing our plants our

411
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:47,948
goal is to seal the buds in a container

412
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:50,289
and that will create a gas inside of

413
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:52,689
that container the light the oxygen and

414
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:55,480
the moisture work together to create a

415
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,459
gas that gas will begin to eat the

416
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,120
chlorophyll and turn that chlorophyll

417
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:03,729
into a gas itself then once we open the

418
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,730
jar like I talked about earlier that gas

419
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:09,009
is released from the jar now that will

420
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,819
continue like you said until we get to

421
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:15,220
about 54 percent relative humidity seems

422
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:18,338
to be correct now this is the part where

423
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,528
I lack scientific education I and my

424
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:22,690
experience have noticed that once I let

425
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:25,328
the buds get past that dry point the

426
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:28,029
chlorophyll does not it is not able to

427
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:30,278
be removed any further once that amount

428
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:32,889
of moisture is gone I feel like that

429
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:35,289
moisture is required to create the

430
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,889
chemical reaction that creates the

431
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:37,509
breakdown

432
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,519
of the chlorophyll that allows it to

433
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:42,309
become a gas to allow it to remove

434
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,919
itself from the plant into the jar into

435
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:47,319
the atmosphere so once it gets too dry

436
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:49,659
you will not be able to remove more

437
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,690
chlorophyll and more pigments in my

438
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:54,819
experience and opinion the buds may

439
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,410
still taste a little grassy they may

440
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,230
have a little bit of harshness to them

441
00:15:56,409 --> 00:16:01,539
depending on how long you let them stay

442
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,100
moist if this took long enough you may

443
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:05,588
have gotten all of that chlorophyll out

444
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,870
of there you may have a nice sweet cure

445
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,149
I don't know the timeframe in which you

446
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,799
let it slip once it got too low it

447
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:13,899
sounds like you did a good job so you

448
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,689
should have at least a decent product

449
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:19,179
now there is another aspect of drying

450
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,360
and curing to think about first we want

451
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:24,189
to hear to remove chlorophyll that is

452
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,990
that cat that natural reaction that I

453
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,269
was talking about a moment ago when we

454
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,278
seal the product in a jar the gases and

455
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:32,169
the moisture all start working together

456
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:33,730
it creates an environment that breaks

457
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:36,399
down the chlorophyll it allows the

458
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,769
chlorophyll to become a gas that green

459
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,679
pigment that doesn't taste good has now

460
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:43,448
become air it is in the air when we open

461
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,919
the jar we let that out now you don't

462
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:46,870
have to smoke it it is floating around

463
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:48,549
in the room and such minut particles we

464
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,649
don't notice it but we don't have to

465
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,569
smoke it that is the good part that is

466
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:55,028
part of our goal the other part is

467
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:57,940
trichome ripeness and trichome

468
00:16:55,028 --> 00:17:00,789
preservation and terpene preservation

469
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,610
depending on other environmental factors

470
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:05,949
and when the product was harvested you

471
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:09,189
may still be ripening your trichomes

472
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:11,679
during that curing process also so your

473
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:14,110
main question was is the curing state

474
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,589
entirely over once the relative humidity

475
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:19,568
has dropped lower than 54% you may not

476
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:22,119
be pulling the chlorophyll out but you

477
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:23,740
are still slow drying that bud it is

478
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,509
getting drier just naturally it is

479
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,818
losing a little bit of moisture content

480
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:30,548
it still may be breaking down and you

481
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:33,220
are absolutely getting trichome ripeness

482
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:35,379
and cannabinoid conversions are still

483
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,048
happening so something is happening

484
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,299
inside of that jar still I would take

485
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:42,759
some buds out now and smoke them I would

486
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:44,589
leave some in there for a week and smoke

487
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,940
those maybe just one just a bowl maybe a

488
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:47,678
joint I don't know how you consume maybe

489
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,269
a vaporizer bucket I don't know what

490
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,300
you're putting in the vaporizer

491
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:54,639
but just consume have one sesh of a bowl

492
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,200
today and then a bowl in a week and then

493
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,270
a bowl in two weeks and then if you can

494
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,950
conserve it a bowl in a month and then

495
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:02,470
if you're [ __ ] crazy a bowl in two

496
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,058
months and try to compare see what the

497
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,400
differences are try to notice all the

498
00:18:04,058 --> 00:18:08,230
subtleties many people don't have the

499
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,450
palate or don't care to develop the

500
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,150
palate to taste all of the subtleties in

501
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,920
a cannabis plant many people won't clean

502
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,140
the pipe and even give it an effort like

503
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,490
it all tastes like weed to me I am NOT

504
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,830
one of those people I can taste

505
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,740
subtleties and many different flavors in

506
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:26,259
cannabis so I like a nice clean pipe I

507
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,750
would appreciate smoking a bowl of the

508
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:30,579
same herb that has been kind of dried

509
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,929
and cured and then pretty dried and

510
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:33,428
cured and then really driving true to

511
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:35,080
them this one's been going for a while I

512
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:36,400
would appreciate hitting a bowl of all

513
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,928
of those and being like here that no one

514
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,580
tastes pretty good and makes some notes

515
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:41,500
and then try to remember a week later be

516
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:44,109
like oh man that it does taste better I

517
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,299
would write down like gassy gray P

518
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:47,799
smooth burns my throat I would breathe

519
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:49,029
some of it through my nose just to see

520
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,980
what it feels like through the nose I

521
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:53,319
would just breathe different ways they

522
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,029
serve beer in different shaped beer

523
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,678
glasses like if you buy certain kinds of

524
00:18:55,029 --> 00:19:00,039
beer they serve it in different glasses

525
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,559
at the bar because the air creates a

526
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:04,389
different flavor for those beers when

527
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,160
you're smoking cannabis or concentrates

528
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,080
make your mouth in different funny

529
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,519
shapes and blow the air around blow the

530
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,259
smoke around in different shapes in your

531
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,929
mouth and you'll taste different flavors

532
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:15,700
and aromas pack a bowl of weed and don't

533
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:19,450
light it and just draw through the pipe

534
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,160
and taste it dry no flame to see what it

535
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,410
tastes like you get that fresh herb

536
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,800
grassy dank flavor tastes pretty nice

537
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:28,450
then light it up breathe it in get that

538
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,460
smoke all in your lungs and then blow it

539
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,380
out like you normally do pay attention

540
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,600
to the flavor going in as soon as it

541
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:37,600
goes in stop breathing not for no like

542
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:39,129
die hold it right there when that air

543
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,459
stops your tongue will catch the flavor

544
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,200
then blow it out you'll taste it going

545
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,390
out also so you got an in flavor you got

546
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,710
a stopped flavor you got out flavor it's

547
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,020
gonna taste like something as soon as it

548
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,400
gets out then if you're patient just

549
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:53,470
wait just let your tongue relax

550
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,110
a couple seconds later you're gonna get

551
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,579
bunch of different subtle flavors those

552
00:19:56,109 --> 00:20:00,639
are the flavors I really look for that

553
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:03,220
right after that exhale and then relax

554
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,559
your face whoo and

555
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,298
I'll breathe in through my nose and then

556
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:08,889
out through my mouth and then maybe in

557
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:10,329
through my mouth and I'm just getting

558
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,590
different flavors I'm activating

559
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:12,849
different flavors different parts of my

560
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:14,168
tongue different parts of my palate

561
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:16,298
different Terps are working together and

562
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:18,159
I am noticing many subtle different

563
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:20,200
flavors that probably many people didn't

564
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,720
take the time or didn't know they had

565
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,220
the ability to even detect so that's a

566
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,808
good way to kind of hone your palate and

567
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,819
that is something I would appreciate so

568
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,379
I'm gonna wrap back around the question

569
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,819
I just did get off on her weird rant

570
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,250
about how to smoke and smell and taste

571
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:35,200
correctly but not all is lost you can

572
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,210
smoothen up the flavor of that smoke you

573
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,490
can increase the potency there are still

574
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,380
cannabinoid conversions and things are

575
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,960
still happening inside of that jar so

576
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,750
the short answer is no not all is lost

577
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,909
the process is not done pull some out

578
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,859
smoke it pull some out later smoke it

579
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:51,669
and take notes and then let me know how

580
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:54,279
it goes

581
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:55,929
you wrap this one up to say sorry for

582
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:57,879
