degrees outside and I am sweaty - I took

21
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,010
a dab of this orange skittles ambrosia

22
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,030
and my body temperature just went up

23
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:56,759
super fast

24
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,289
I felt it started like my toes my feet

got sweaty and then my armpits got

26
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,588
sweaty and then my forehead got a little

00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:06,090
sweaty yeah it might just keep saying I

28
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:07,260

Canada enters the world of legalization

41
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,349
welcome to the club welcome to the club

42
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,868
Canada in some ways bro they kind of did

43
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:38,728
it better than us they're definitely

44
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:40,259
going bigger they're going bigger that

45
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:42,599
is for sure some of their rules are

46
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,049
better some of their laws are better

47
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:49,978
some of their opportunities are better

48
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:53,159
well they had a lot of other people

49
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,929
blazed the trail for him true trad there

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,479
were several delegations that came to

51
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,610
Colorado over the years I'm leading up

52
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,618
to this looking at different rules we

53
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,179
had implemented other states that

54
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:04,649
implemented and seeing how they played

55
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,810
out in practice before they went ahead

56
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,128
with their law I think they're doing it

57
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,409
right most of what they're doing makes

58
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,030
sense to me let's talk more about what

59
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,379
we've been dabbing on bro we can went

60
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,390
kind of quickly over they did sort

61
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,210
that was a tease folks we've still got a

62
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:20,549
pile a hash to talk about ah so we

63
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,010
started off with some I think we started

64
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,620
with just sticking together so I took

65
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,269
some of the I'll talking to the

66
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,860
microphone I took some of the fat so

67
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,900
batter that I talked about that garlic

68
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,260
scented one and I dunked that into the

69
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,849
star dog terpenes that gave me I had

70
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:37,500
punch that was intense

71
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,349
that was my first dab in like a week and

72
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,270
a half well welcome back that that's how

73
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:45,719
we started the day then we followed that

74
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,360
up with the mochi gelato another

75
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,250
apothecary Farms product the smell

76
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,400
coming off that one just out of the jar

77
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,020
is something that speaks to my soul I

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,330
described it much differently than Mike

79
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,909
did I kind of said that it smelled like

80
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,340
the aroma of Girl Scout cookies plus

81
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:04,409
like a toasted marshmallow sort of aroma

82
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,520
Mike had a much more unique description

83
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:09,840
I thought it was uh it reminds me of if

84
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,070
you've ever had to like change the

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,689
string on your weed whacker

86
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:16,680
like the head of your weed whacker that

87
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:19,139
oil and green plant kind of smell mixed

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,730
together but not real fuelie it just

89
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,489
doesn't sound pleasant to me that takes

90
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,560
an odd odor

91
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:28,050
but it's really Pleasant and hash I

92
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,650
don't know alright I really like as long

93
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,560
as you like it or I guess as long as you

94
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,689
have some sort of opinion I guess [ __ ]

95
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,430
the hashes been delicious today and then

96
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:42,060
we followed that up with the orange

97
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,890
skittles ambrosia skittles with a Z via

98
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,539
this one when they showed me the jar I

99
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,889
was like and I have coming back and he's

100
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,349
like do you want this jar and I was like

101
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:52,769
I want that jar it just coats your teeth

102
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:55,439
oh yeah like my teeth and lips are just

103
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,240
sticky from it it makes your lipstick it

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,069
makes your teeth sticky but I think it

105
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,310
tastes so I talked about the Clementine

106
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:05,340
a lot the clementines got a sweet sugary

107
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,099
orange kind of a thing this is just

108
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,500
straight oranges not the sweet part this

109
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:13,049
is just the straight citrusy punch where

110
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,150
you going like okay [ __ ] cooked I

111
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,500
just you're holding the jar and you're

112
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,850
talking about it and I just want to

113
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,439
smell it but I leaned in and tried to

114
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,189
sniff the mic I saw you do something I'm

115
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,240
glad but yeah my bait desk just tried to

116
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,149
get the scent of that hash off the

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,590
microphone well

118
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,060
it's loud enough to where you just might

119
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:29,409
do it but you might want to check the

120
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,910
headphones is where it's gonna come

121
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:36,040
through here man take a smell of it that

122
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,470
is the orange y'all should see this

123
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:44,319
chart it's just like a pile of crystals

124
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:46,510
that's a four gram jar and it is it

125
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,939
looks like the it's not the color but is

126
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:51,250
the size of the row on the top of some

127
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:52,959
sushi is what it looks like it has got

128
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,120
that nice shiny texture and it's about

129
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,680
the same size of some eggs you'd see on

130
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,629
top of sushi maybe a little bit bigger

131
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,370
than that and I probably just ruined a

132
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,199
bunch of people's appetite by comparing

133
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,810
it to the stuff on top of sushi but it's

134
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,520
it's beautiful I think it I'm really

135
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,740
glad I went up there for that it was of

136
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,418
course apothecary or ambrosia days and

137
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,060
apothecary I had to go up there and

138
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:16,240
participate so those are my grabs the

139
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,430
orange skittles the mochi gelato and the

140
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,220
star dog ambrosia of course Nara is

141
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,500
always one of my favorites it's a grits

142
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,449
trim it's a four gram jar and it is just

143
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,199
two giant crystals and a little bit of

144
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:29,139
sauce in there

145
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,310
I prefer there's a little more sauce in

146
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:32,740
there than I would prefer so I've been

147
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,839
dunking other dabs into it it's really

148
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,949
nice ending using those troops yeah it's

149
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,388
really nice it's a really nice little

150
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,750
accent for other things I think the

151
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,509
Terps

152
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,529
give it a little bit of a turbo boost

153
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,240
all right so we went from not talking

154
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:45,609
about what we were smoking to way

155
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,769
talking about what we were smoking let's

156
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:53,110
uh let's talk about Canadia

157
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:54,250
oh all right before we get into the

158
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,160
Canada stuff might told me a really

159
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,269
funny story as we were setting up today

160
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,189
let's talk about this poor dude in

161
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:03,069
Canada that tried to hold an anti in

162
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:05,348
cannabis rally so the listeners of the

163
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:09,639
show will know that I follow the anti

164
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:11,978
cannabis community pretty closely yeah

165
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,860
this popped across my screen this week

166
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:17,668
it was another anti cannabis page like

167
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,379
lamenting that this is the way of things

168
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:22,149
and this dude up in Canada is just

169
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:25,990
really really teed off about

170
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:28,179
legalization and he was gonna host an

171
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,769
anti cannabis march on the 17th

172
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,918
Wednesday

173
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:36,250
is sort of a counter show a force to the

174
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,870
legalization of in Canada in he's

175
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,899
canceling his event

176
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,410
because of a lack of interest nobody

177
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:46,870
wanted to come nobody's interested

178
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,720
that's all and I just had to chuckle

179
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,120
they've the anti canvas communities

180
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,080
spent a lot of time over the last maybe

181
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:59,560
four years of really trying to make it

182
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,349
seem like there's this growing just wave

183
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,060
of people who have had enough with

184
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:07,419
legalization and her coming out to fight

185
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,759
it and it's really just like fourteen

186
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:13,149
people that each run three Facebook

187
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,849
pages and then Kevin Sabet and like the

188
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:19,750
five guys he pays that's it they're just

189
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:21,879
hate typing all day long yep no and it

190
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,529
just seems like there's a bunch of

191
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,529
groups out there when there's really

192
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:28,329
like a handful of people so not nobody

193
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:31,538
but those fourteen folks showed up to

194
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:33,099
protest in Canada well no the you have

195
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:35,709
those fourteen folks are spread out all

196
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,479
over the US and none of them felt like

197
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:39,430
traveling to Canada to help with this

198
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,680
protest so the dude got no interest

199
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,209
that's awesome and sorry

200
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
put a thing up saying the events

201
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:46,418
canceled no one's interested you guys

202
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,150
suck

203
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:51,159
it's a shame no one else's isn't fired

204
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:53,168
up about legalization and how it's gonna

205
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,669
destroy the country people are fired up

206
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:56,560
about legalization but I think they're

207
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:59,680
on the other side I think they're so

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,509
they're that's I've been fighting the

209
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,060
urge to do a post on my page about this

210
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:05,199
because I'm waiting for the shots of the

211
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,970
crowds of people that come out to

212
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,860
celebrate tomorrow

213
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,200
yeah dude I've been thinking about

214
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,330
January first fourteen and you have a

215
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,098
said about that I was cooking my

216
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:16,449
breakfast does like Canada it gets to do

217
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:19,810
that tomorrow that's gonna be pretty

218
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:21,668
cool I realized that my receipt from the

219
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,228
first day legalization is still packed

220
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,769
and looks like [ __ ] I need to get that

221
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:27,848
box out I really need to do that now I

222
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:30,689
haven't talked about this a lot but

223
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:33,218
because I was the first person to buy

224
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,559
recreational cannabis in Pueblo Colorado

225
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,169
when cannabis became legal here

226
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,269
recreationally and I still have the two

227
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:42,158
bags of weed that I bought still have

228
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,629
them you still have the herb yep I still

229
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,189
have them in the original packaging I

230
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:47,230
may have the receipt stapled to one of

231
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,750
the bags or next to it they're near each

232
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,580
other when I got home and it settled in

233
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,409
like how much I [ __ ] paid for that

234
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,450
it's like I have to smoke this [ __ ] it's

235
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:57,129
the most expensive weed ever paid for it

236
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,080
I realized I bought I bought weed on

237
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:00,820
camera I was on the news buying weed

238
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,290
they showed me buy the weed and pay for

239
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,450
it on the news and then I shook the

240
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:05,769
guy's hand and then they hit cut and

241
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,330
then we walked outside and they

242
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,740
interviewed me outside and I said my

243
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,389
name and they put my name on the screen

244
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,240
I was like I just bought weed from a guy

245
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:15,309
on TV but my full name out there but I

246
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,649
was the first person to buy recreational

247
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:19,449
cannabis in Colorado so people get to

248
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:20,799
experience that all over the place

249
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,990
Tomorrow People be the first one in

250
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,219
there their nation and there I'm not

251
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,200
sure how they break it down what are

252
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,940
they involved in yeah I think that's the

253
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,410
word I'm looking for in Canada you'd be

254
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,850
the first person in your province and

255
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:32,019
then you're even smaller and then even

256
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,610
smaller you know to me to get more

257
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:35,079
opportunities to be the first person in

258
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,620
your whatever at least in your

259
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,800
dispensary when Canada's gonna have kind

260
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,710
of a unique go of it no one's legalized

261
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:47,709
like they're about to and so a lot of

262
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:50,920
what we're gonna go over is their first

263
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,810
attempt at doing this right and then the

264
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,519
people involved know that there are a

265
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:57,129
lot of rural changes coming over the

266
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,230
next year three so these are not final

267
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,659
yeah everything actually a lot of the

268
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,279
articles I read say that they're pushing

269
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:04,929
to change the rules they just needed to

270
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,089
get some rules in place to be on time

271
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,489
yeah on Wednesday the rule will be this

272
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,050
but in the next year too we expect it to

273
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,120
change to this so we keep saying

274
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:14,229
tomorrow or yesterday this episode will

275
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,120
either come out on Wednesday or Thursday

276
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,529
I have not decided when I will put this

277
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,389
out it depends on how the rest of my

278
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,459
evening and recording progress goes I

279
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,529
may record another show that's not

280
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,430
relevant but what we are talking about

281
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:31,269
is October 17th 2018 Canada will

282
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:33,669
legalize adult use cannabis yep it will

283
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:35,529
be mostly legalized some municipalities

284
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:37,870
like in the state in Colorado will be

285
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:41,350
able to ban the use and sales but for

286
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:44,560
the most part it is legal one of the

287
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,210
coolest parts is I'm kind of skipping

288
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,889
ahead let's just stick to my notes here

289
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm excited about one part it keeps

290
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:53,110
getting my attention they will allow

291
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,790
flowers they will allow dried and cured

292
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,039
flowers you'll be able to use topicals

293
00:10:54,789 --> 00:11:00,159
and it said oils will be available but

294
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,500
concentrates are not available yet and

295
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,699
edibles are not available yet they have

296
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,409
a year to figure that out

297
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,079
so you can get your top

298
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:08,649
you can get your flowers but no no dabs

299
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:10,958
yet

300
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:14,859
I know edibles yet but they're in the

301
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,719
works of that they said about a year

302
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:19,749
it's available in dispensaries there

303
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,278
will be dispensaries available well

304
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:24,308
depending on where you live in Canada

305
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:27,599
there's been dispensaries for a while

306
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:31,328
under neither the medical program or

307
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:34,239
there's a system of illegal dispensaries

308
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:37,988
that operate like every other

309
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:39,639
dispensaries or front but no licensure

310
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:42,099
or any of that stuff there's a comedy

311
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,889
club that has one of those gray area

312
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:46,929
dispensaries above it and they allow you

313
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:48,249
to smoke in the comedy club so you go up

314
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:50,139
and buy your herb and you go down at

315
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:54,668
smoke and watch a comedy show I'm gonna

316
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:56,948
have to visit yes yes so another thing

317
00:11:54,668 --> 00:12:00,220
that really impresses me is the online

318
00:11:56,948 --> 00:12:02,258
ordering and delivery of cannabis you

319
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,449
can order online and have your in some

320
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:06,068
places that'll be the only legal outlet

321
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:09,038
it's gonna be coming through the mail

322
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:10,778
217 yes completely legal to order your

323
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:12,818
herb through the mail to send your

324
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:15,609
friends stuff through the mail in Canada

325
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:16,988
that is so neat to me I like that so the

326
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,519
California guys could just be growing

327
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:19,689
some of that California stuff me like

328
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,058
Ross and Jeff you want to try some of

329
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:23,318
these flowers I grew and just sent me a

330
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:24,399
pound of it and I could try it then I

331
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:25,778
could send them out a pound or whatever

332
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,048
I grew and then we could try each other

333
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:30,489
stuff who means legal in Canada's come

334
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,838
on legal they're doing it right that's

335
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:34,239
one of the things I really like is the

336
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,889
the mail and online stuff that they're

337
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:40,179
doing also it's going to be affordable

338
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:41,350
you're gonna like the price of cannabis

339
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:44,318
and then we'll talk about how much it

340
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:47,379
costs here ah cannabis will be about

341
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:49,538
seven dollars a gram in Canada I in

342
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:52,119
Canadian dollars and that is five US

343
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:54,009
dollars so five dollars a gram it's not

344
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:55,509
from what I've seen and heard and read

345
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,619
I've got friends in Canada and I do some

346
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,139
work with a couple of companies in

347
00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:01,329
Canada it's not the quality of what

348
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:02,558
we've got here but it's close and I'm

349
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:04,149
sure there are some places they're

350
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:05,828
getting close to what some of our places

351
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:07,389
are doing you can't say that there are

352
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:09,428
no good growers in a place that always

353
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:13,209
sounds stupid when you do that it cracks

354
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:16,869
me up how that's swung back and forth

355
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:19,389
over the last 20 years oh yeah Canada

356
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:22,240
was way better than the US it growing

357
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:24,460
up until the point mid legalization

358
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,950
years where the u.s. stole the show

359
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,320
and now Canada's working for a comeback

360
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,820
they may just do it yeah they just may

361
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,950
do it so it's affordable it's very

362
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,560
affordable here in Colorado right now

363
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,150
it's about ten bucks a gram you can find

364
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,979
eight diagrams you can also find

365
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,679
seventeen dollar grams depending on

366
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,720
where you're shopping and what what

367
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,609
quality you're looking for or how much

368
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,170
advertising a place is done it's not

369
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,850
always about the quality unfortunately

370
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:50,469
sometimes the more expensive but is not

371
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,960
the best quality that's not always the

372
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,090
case some of the shops in Denver the

373
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,460
places I recommend they've got closer to

374
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,780
$15 grams but it's worth it I think it's

375
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,580
the stuff you're really looking for

376
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,799
right

377
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,710
photogenic frosty looking [ __ ] so it's

378
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,000
affordable of the ages they did it a

379
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,490
little differently they have a little

380
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,649
more trust in Canadian citizens Canada

381
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,080
is allowing ages 19 and up to

382
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:15,819
participate and can in cannabis in some

383
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,770
places I think it's as low as 82 that's

384
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,800
what I've got here in Quebec you can be

385
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:23,049
18 so that's pretty cool I hear you got

386
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,299
to be 21 I'm pretty sure the the

387
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:27,129
brackets I saw with the Quebec there

388
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:29,019
there's at least a group in Quebec

389
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:31,509
looking to push that to 21 here in the

390
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:34,480
next year too but at the start it'll be

391
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:36,759
18 that's got to be so frustrating to

392
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,200
start off at one age and then see people

393
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,700
going oh next year I get smoked and then

394
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,170
they change the rules on them there's

395
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,570
yeah there's definitely a group of

396
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:46,539
people that aren't old enough to enjoy

397
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,510
it this week when it goes legal but

398
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:52,750
we'll be in a year or two if they don't

399
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:54,429
change that law yeah it will be it'll be

400
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,990
rough for them if they change that law

401
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:57,399
in the middle of there but and

402
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,350
unfortunately they're gonna be the only

403
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,559
ones out there voting to keep it that

404
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,879
way

405
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,219
because they're the only ones that care

406
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,590
so that's a small demographic how did

407
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,090
Canada's been explicit about why they

408
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:10,389
have the age set there they're really

409
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:13,690
targeting the black market in Canada

410
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:16,149
it's been way too prevalent prevalent

411
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,370
for way too long in there that's they

412
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:21,100
know that the 18 to 24 year old

413
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:23,759
demographic are the largest can they're

414
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:27,100
like a third of the marijuana consuming

415
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,529
population is 24 year olds and so

416
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,750
they're targeting that whole bracket

417
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,069
with legalization at least in a couple

418
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,230
of parts of the country that's pretty

419
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:37,180
cool that is definitely a good a good

420
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,190
idea I agree with that it makes a lot of

421
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:41,409
sense there that's the black-market age

422
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,850
that's what it that's wouldn't you buy

423
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,500
from your black-market friends and then

424
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,940
that's when people become black market

425
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,289
dealers is that age because they have

426
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,670
the black market friends it's how it

427
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:49,120
kind of how it works they go hand in

428
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,519
hand

429
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,509
all those kids need some guys got so it

430
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,439
works out yeah they're gonna eliminate

431
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:57,789
that that's that's pretty cool

432
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,260
possession limits you're allowed to

433
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:03,969
possess 30 grams that's not bad nope not

434
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:05,500
bad at all it's two and that's just like

435
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:13,090
out that's out in the world it's one

436
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:14,470
point six grams over an ounce thank you

437
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,330
I'm glad you caught my call back there

438
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,529
so you can carry an ounce of weed with

439
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,300
you which if you're going out for the

440
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:22,000
night or the weekend or whatever that's

441
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:23,109
plenty over right and if you're going

442
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,549
out for the weekend don't take a whole

443
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,230
ounce with you just take a couple of

444
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:27,159
eighths with you in the in one container

445
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,840
so that you don't look like you're

446
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,399
selling it take a quarter so you don't

447
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,360
go smoke all your weed with everybody is

448
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,649
you'll get it you'll have too many

449
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,800
drinks and you'll smoke too many bowls

450
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:37,899
you let smoke or another board or set it

451
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,000
down on the table for a hockey team is

452
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:42,129
draining them back to just a gram left

453
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,570
in your baggie yeah yeah don't take all

454
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:45,549
your wheat up you'll smoke all your

455
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,920
wheat that's one thing I learned let's

456
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:51,009
see you were allowed to smoke where you

457
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:55,059
were allowed to consume cigarettes which

458
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:56,230
is basically yeah there are some places

459
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,789
that are gonna make their own specific

460
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,769
rules on that of course because that's

461
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:01,539
just how some municipalities go that's

462
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,399
how what they like to do some places are

463
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:06,309
uptight you're not allowed to smoke in

464
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,109
city parks or on city beaches but they

465
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,299
have said they will allow you to smoke

466
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,769
in their national parks at their

467
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:13,659
campgrounds so it's your campground

468
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:16,059
around the fire you are allowed to light

469
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,250
up here in Colorado you cannot smoke in

470
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:20,859
a national park so of you if you were at

471
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,750
the Pueblo Reservoir whatever reservoir

472
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:24,129
you were in you cannot take your

473
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,049
cannabis with you and if you get caught

474
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,430
you were on federal land with cannabis

475
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:29,470
you could get in trouble

476
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,820
honestly most of the Park Rangers are

477
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,740
pretty cool there are people there

478
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:34,029
humans too a lot of the time they're

479
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,799
pretty cool like hey bro you can't have

480
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:37,629
that here but there's always that one

481
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:39,009
guy it wants to like I always talk about

482
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,380
that one guy that wants to [ __ ] up

483
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:43,089
people's day and be a hero so be careful

484
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,129
of that guy there the

485
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:47,168
the US Park Service is having an issue

486
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:49,449
with funding so they're looking for any

487
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:51,370
anything good to squeeze an extra walk

488
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,569
and they're happy with the stuff he's

489
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:54,099
not supposed to have is definitely a way

490
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:56,019
to do that yeah he might dreadlock

491
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:58,689
that's out there in my hiking shoes in

492
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:02,169
my backpack researched let's check this

493
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,370
guy yeah so you can have your stuff

494
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:05,470
there when you're camping you can't have

495
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:07,138
that stuff in Colorado in a national

496
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,579
park is what I'm saying does it be clear

497
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:11,740
duty the National Organization is

498
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:14,319
there's no difference between like state

499
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,909
and federal there's little rule policy

500
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,730
changes but it's not like it's illegal

501
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:21,580
on this side of the line so far the

502
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,669
rules say for home grows you can grow

503
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:27,939
four plants four plants per home not per

504
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:29,288
person or per whatever its per house is

505
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,009
what I read so far from what I

506
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:35,109
understand you can have four plants

507
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:36,669
landlords can ban you from growing

508
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:38,349
that's up to the landlord some

509
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:41,499
municipalities are going to ban that

510
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:43,048
also of course that you already have I

511
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:44,950
believe yes yes

512
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:46,778
some places that have a lot of

513
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,600
dispensary presence have banned that

514
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:51,999
which I see is kind of a capitalizing

515
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,490
monopoly sort of a thing but different

516
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:59,499
parts of Canada have had major homegrown

517
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:01,899
issues for decades I reach erred the

518
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:04,089
Union recently a my my cannabis page

519
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:06,398
because a big chunk of that is like

520
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:08,230
early 2000s black market Canada

521
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:10,569
production when you said Canada and

522
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,769
black market I paused because I went do

523
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:13,628
I want to go that route and start

524
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:15,819
talking about the Union so it looks like

525
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:17,618
we are well it's it's if you haven't

526
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:19,658
seen it's a beautiful documentary that

527
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:21,548
gives you a nice little snapshot of the

528
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:24,850
black market in Canada and like the

529
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:26,819
early 2000s and it's that experience

530
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:29,048
that has the country where they are now

531
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,480
how come the part that stands out most

532
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:33,278
to them the most from that movie to me

533
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,929
is when they had a power outage for

534
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:36,398
several days and the guys are showing

535
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:37,899
their grows they're like I don't know

536
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:39,548
way I haven't had power for like four

537
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:41,589
days and they're still going I hope

538
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:42,849
everything comes on already and if it's

539
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:44,528
back you better you watching these guys

540
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,998
is that a different documentary I was

541
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:47,589
watching these Canadian growers freak

542
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:49,480
out haven't had power for so many days

543
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:50,678
and they're talking about their grows no

544
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,298
important it is that it comes through

545
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,710
because they put all this money into it

546
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:54,908
and they're like so far in I understand

547
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,348
that feeling

548
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:57,999
but I was just like oh man they've had

549
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:59,829
they had like four feet of snow outside

550
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:01,598
and hadn't had power for days and I was

551
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:03,759
like that crop dude is so close to being

552
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:06,098
done they were shining flashlights on it

553
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,358
and [ __ ] just to keep it just needs a

554
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:10,358
little bit of light every day it'll be

555
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:11,949
all righty Oh what documentary is that

556
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:13,808
what movie is that I can't remember off

557
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,009
the name I have off the top of my head

558
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:16,808
but I've seen there's somebody out there

559
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:18,368
is watch and send me a tweet it's @g fyh

560
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:19,868
podcast so you know what movie my brain

561
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:21,878
is is trying to remember I've got a

562
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:23,918
traumatic brain injury so it's in there

563
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:26,048
it's just not labeled accurately anymore

564
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,759
the contents fell out of the folder and

565
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:30,148
now I'm just reading a file and I'm like

566
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,159
you know here's a part about a movie

567
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:36,278
the one thing that is gonna drive people

568
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,799
nuts about Canada's legalization is the

569
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:40,108
little nuance rules like I know they're

570
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,278
a bunch of people that are annoyed that

571
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:43,028
concentrates and edibles they're holding

572
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:46,589
off for a year

573
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:49,388
and that's largely because of the anti

574
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:51,939
cannabis groups too big talking points

575
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:55,628
that have taken holder that edibles are

576
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,489
scary and bad for kids and concentrates

577
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:59,769
are super potent and we've never had

578
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:03,069
anything this potent before it's up to

579
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:04,778
99 percent THC now they rant about it

580
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:06,668
all the time it's total [ __ ] nonsense

581
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:09,308
the THC pill that's been legal since the

582
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:11,769
70s is 100 percent THC I wish I could

583
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:12,788
just explain that's just salt I wish I

584
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:16,358
could explain to them that if you give

585
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:18,148
me a concentrate that is 50% THC and a

586
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,288
concentrate that's 100 percent THC

587
00:21:18,148 --> 00:21:22,538
probably gonna take two dabs of the

588
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:25,598
hundred and four dabs of the 50 I'm

589
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:30,548
gonna get the same high I'm just gonna

590
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:33,158
consume less dabs of the other one the

591
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:35,528
only thing the anti cannabis community

592
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,049
understands about concentrates is that

593
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:41,378
they look scary and the numbers sounds

594
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:42,848
scary yeah in the end of it they love

595
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:44,949
talking about the blowtorch but they

596
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:47,499
always [ __ ] it up they go this stuff's

597
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,298
it's it's not weed it's you don't have

598
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:51,788
to light weed with a blowtorch they

599
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:53,979
right they think that we're setting the

600
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:56,138
hash on fire with the blowtorch

601
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,690
yeah they don't at all understand that

602
00:21:56,138 --> 00:22:01,898
we're heating a surface to vaporize a

603
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:05,109
concentrate and that it's just a

604
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:07,748
complicated tool involved way of hitting

605
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:08,819
a vape pen the hippie rant in me is like

606
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:10,528
they don't want you to

607
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:12,689
stand that man that makes it acceptable

608
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:14,490
man just if they took a moment to

609
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,259
explain it and they're like man so what

610
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,940
we're doing is vaporizing now the

611
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:19,889
newscaster never does that they go then

612
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,630
they eat the hash with a blowtorch and

613
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:23,579
smoke it like a crack rock just because

614
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,769
that sells more it's more clicks it

615
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:27,028
doesn't sound like the simple

616
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,970
explanation doesn't get any attention

617
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:31,500
you gotta create fear there's only one

618
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,288
or two of them that are capable of

619
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,210
higher-level thinking of that nature the

620
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:37,710
rest of them it's just seriously you'll

621
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,079
if you follow these people for more than

622
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,058
a week or two you start watching them

623
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,548
get confused by [ __ ] that like everybody

624
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:48,888
should know like one of them tried to

625
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:51,179
hand out her own print out literature

626
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:54,269
outside of the cannabis conference they

627
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,559
do every year here at PCC and she

628
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,200
couldn't understand why there was a

629
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:01,168
process she had to go through before she

630
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,350
handed out literature on campus oh yeah

631
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:06,330
it's it's a lady yeah it's and she's

632
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:08,219
like well I went here like four years

633
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:09,960
ago and the person she's talking to in

634
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,288
the videos why the [ __ ] don't you

635
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,879
understand what I'm saying

636
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:16,319
yeah I'm claim to have attended here and

637
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:18,808
graduated from here but you don't know

638
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,250
basic rules about this spaces like first

639
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:24,690
of all you don't go here you need to

640

of like come join our cult that campus

645
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:39,778
could be liable on that cold is this

646
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,980
because I didn't white supremacists used

647
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:42,058
to do it all the time see I wasn't gonna

648
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,639
pick a group I didn't want to give

649

667
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:35,660
things in Colorado I was watching how

668
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:39,750
little things change after legalization

669
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:44,880
like you don't see people buying weed in

670
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:48,240
the park is often true the glass that

671
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,780
you see in head shops changes rapidly oh

672
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,549
yeah um some products on the market

673
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:55,349
evolve very very quickly

674
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:57,990
I remember them when there was like one

675
00:24:55,349 --> 00:25:00,389
company doing hash like we've got on the

676

table and now their site for tea oh yeah

677
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:07,259
and it's only been months six eight

678
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:08,700
months evolves so quickly years ago we

679
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:09,569
thought clear shatter was the most

680
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,779
amazing [ __ ]

681
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:14,429
yep when that dude holding the ice buck

682
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:18,029
from the hood of his car was the most

683
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:20,700
famous to manage the gram yeah but like

684
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:23,549
clothing the different parts of the

685
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,960
community like places where that like

686
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:27,629
the comedy club where you can go and

687
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,090
enjoy cannabis right you will see other

688
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:33,270
little places like that pop up and

689
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:34,859
there's several anyway let me mention

690
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:38,069
that kind of technically that is not

691
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:41,369
legal at this time the ones that are up

692
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:43,980
and running now the smart ones are

693
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:46,199
already lobbying local government to hey

694
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,289
there's a need for this we have a

695
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,059
customer base that loves us there's

696
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:54,180
clearly a need for this in our community

697
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:56,519
license it regulated tell us where to be

698
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,950
tell us when we can be open tell us how

699
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,980
we can be tell us what other stuff we

700
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,539
can do there and we're down I can't help

701
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,480
but think there was just a bar that got

702
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:09,480
in trouble for ax throwing oh yeah I saw

703
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,460
that um where they the local people

704
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,440
regulators from some segments that

705
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,539
covers the bar industry shut up and they

706
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,269
had like dudes and flip-flops throwing

707
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:19,859
axes at liquor bottles I don't think it

708
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:21,660
wasn't liquor bottles but that was one

709
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:24,269
of the violations is they were throwing

710
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,920
them empty liquor bottles and they're

711
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:27,839
like you can't have broken glass and

712
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,550
flip-flops and flying [ __ ] axes at

713
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,689
the same time with drunks what part of

714
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:34,289
Florida was this

715
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:36,570
I don't even remember but I mean when

716
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:38,279
you've got that in the world and you're

717
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:41,399
just talking about like I want to do

718
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:45,119
like good coffee some cheesecakes and

719
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:49,530
weed with some booths and maybe some

720
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:54,109
soft music like why is that so hard to

721
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:56,490
figure out rules for the children Mike I

722
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:59,429
almost said something I probably would

723
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:02,130
have laughed at later but you got kids

724
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:04,680
now well like if we can do guns and we

725
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,660
can do [ __ ] prescription drugs and we

726
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,310
can do cars and we can do [ __ ] air

727
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,430
travel we can figure out how to sell

728
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:15,029
weed and be objects for each other the

729
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:18,799
dangerous list doesn't include weed like

730
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:23,160
lawn equipment Tide Pods [ __ ]

731
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,409
snowblowers quicksand dry drivings like

732
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,509
the most dangerous activity humans

733
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:31,140
engage in regularly and we don't have

734
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:34,920
any sort of awareness of that and then

735
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:37,410
you see people talking about consumption

736
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,150
spaces or cannabis cafes look at some of

737
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:42,509
the articles I was reading about Canada

738
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,920
if you don't own your own property like

739
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:47,039
you're not a homeowner you rent an

740
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:49,050
apartment depending on the part of

741
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,930
Canada you're in and your landlords

742
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:54,299
preference there may be no legal space

743
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:57,060
anywhere within miles and miles of you

744
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:58,769
for you to consume cannabis yeah and so

745
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,259
you're just like a tourist in Denver

746
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:02,519
with a hotel that says no smoking

747
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:03,900
there's no legal place for you to

748
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,099
consume it's like you can see through

749
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,540
the computer and you can see my notes

750
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,839
because that's my hex bullet point that

751
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:12,599
was pretty good but when you sit down

752
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:15,509
and talk about regulating these kinds of

753
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:19,019
spaces people bring up the crazy [ __ ]

754
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:22,319
and I feel like such an [ __ ] when I'm

755
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:24,389
like but everywhere in the civilized

756
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:28,409
world already has an infrastructure in

757
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:31,020
place for adults to leave their home or

758
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:33,390
place of residence go to an outside

759
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:36,990
location a secondary location where they

760
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:39,690
don't live get very intoxicated and then

761
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:42,240
return home safely yeah and we've

762
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,529
designed this system in every part of

763
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,720
them

764
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:48,079
every part of Canada all over Europe to

765
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,980
get people from their house to the bar

766
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:54,109

00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,799
Full Monty and all my other Canadian

813
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,480
friends and I got to get in an uber

814
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,220
there was a place that had good food and

815
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,130
drinks in our area that allowed us to

816
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,450
consume cannabis there we don't record

817
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,770
at least half of these shows I was gonna

818
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,120
say I'd record there and we'd have more

819
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:40,099
people meet us there and it would be

820
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:41,779
like a thing people Oh people would come

821
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:43,039
and go on to the podcast other kimba's

822
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:44,899
consumers would be like hey can I have a

823
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:49,759
seat here on the show yeah bro sit on in

824
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:51,560
it did I have to be so great but when

825
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,670
you talk about this stuff especially

826
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:55,799
here in the States

827
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:58,529
you have to overcome several [ __ ]

828
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:01,619
hurdles that are just insurmountable it

829
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:03,480
seems like and one of them is half the

830
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,729
population pretends like we don't have a

831
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:10,380
way to you know go out get drunk and get

832
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:12,299
home in one piece right they just you

833
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,310
you run into all this nonsense about how

834
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:16,769
everybody just enjoys the flavor of

835
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:17,909
alcoholic beverages it's like well we'll

836
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:19,859
just have one glass with dinner like

837
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,000
that's the social consumption norm and

838
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:23,809
it's like well then why the [ __ ] do they

839
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,250
have it at little league soccer games

840
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:27,480
there's literally booze everywhere we

841
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,779
can't just have like three or four

842
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,680
places around the city to go and I'm

843
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:36,299
maybe Bowl maybe watch a movie or see

844
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,130
throwback you would be way more likely

845
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,319
to get me to go bowling if I could go

846
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:42,180
bowling for bong hits if I could go roll

847
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:45,899
a strike and every time I got a strike I

848
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:47,940
wanted AB I would shoot to 60s I would

849
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,050
be a I would be a sharpshooter bro you

850
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,809
wouldn't want to [ __ ] with me at the

851
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:53,250
bowling alley I've got balls if they

852
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,549
just set it aside at night and they were

853
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:58,470
like Wednesday nights is it's cannabis

854
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:01,529
consumption that you have to be over the

855
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,990
legal age in this area to come in you

856
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:04,410
get an ID heart at the door bring your

857
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,670
owner

858
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:11,250
knock yourself out like I'd go at least

859
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,779
twice a month hell yeah bro yeah what

860
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,970
else could we do what would either be

861
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:16,349
the movie theater if I could just take a

862
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,509
dab in the middle there's always that

863
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:20,219
point about 45 to an hour and a movie

864
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:22,230
you probably started going I could use a

865
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,970
cigarette that's when my brain goes hey

866
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,069
you're gonna take it bad or what dude

867
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,569
like if I could just walk up to the

868
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:31,259
little it's got to be silent you don't

869
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:32,609
hear the torch in there like in 22 dudes

870
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:34,650
watching dazed and confused with the

871
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:37,979
torch going now but if I can walk up to

872
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:40,050
a little email station and stick it well

873
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,519
then go back to my seat bride be more

874
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:43,500
likely to go watch a movie if Walmart

875
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,879
had a dad station no let's not say

876
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,519
Walmart people don't want us to shop at

877
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,780
Walmart if my local family owned and

878
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:55,680
operated organically locally sourced

879
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:57,960
gluten-free vegan I say the butcher yeah

880
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,900
right I'm just trying to be silly and

881
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,000
socially conscious at the same time but

882
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,769
there's a dozen different businesses

883
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,569
that would increase their customer flow

884
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:10,759
if the skating rinks allowed it

885
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,319
there was a restaurant up in Denver that

886
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:13,909
wanted to do they were gonna do the

887
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,428
second-story they had a second-story

888
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:18,710
seating area that was just overflow and

889
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:21,350
they were just gonna permanently mark it

890
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:23,538
off as the cannabis section and people

891
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:26,178
freaked the [ __ ] out we had a friend

892
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:28,009
throw a birthday party at probably that

893
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:30,860
restaurant because they had an upstairs

894
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:32,298
section that was an overflow and when I

895
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:35,028
walked in they were open for a while

896
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:36,319
before I said there were rigs and it was

897
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:38,119
all of our stuff we brought everybody

898
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,759
brought a rig and a torch and there were

899
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:42,768
rigs so fancy dinner plates and wine

900
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:45,019
glasses and wine bottles and bread and

901
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:46,460
dads and we were between each course you

902
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:47,659

903
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,940

904
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:51,889

910
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:02,778

913
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,679
I was stoned and I cooked it and I just

914

did something magical it's like uh I can

915
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,710
make a hell of a grilled cheese sandwich

916
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:14,568
and I can watch my mom make a week and

917

921
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:22,878
little bit [ __ ] better than mine I

922
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,669
don't know what she does it just comes

923
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,898
out of its coz my mama made it and just

924
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:28,128
that little sprinkle it's like that's

925
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,989
what it's like when I get stoned and

926
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:32,299
make my food it's like puttin mama magic

927
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:34,189
in it's that little extra touch so you

928
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,089
get stoned with the waitstaff and then

929
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,679
go down there and they make a nice

930
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:37,940
stoned ass meal and then you're gettin

931
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,079
stoned and eatin - there's nothing wrong

932
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,030
with it there's no problem and then

933
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:43,159
you're eating so you're not lit when you

934
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,450
leave you hang out yeah and what about

935
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:48,800
the other people that are drinking wine

936
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:50,509
downstairs what's the difference I we

937
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,310
used to go to in college there was a

938
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,839
place where I can't remember the price

939
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:56,029
but it was a lot it was like for 60 or

940
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:58,309
70 bucks you'd sit down and get like

941
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,980
nine different tumblers of whiskey look

942
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:04,309
I never ordered that nine but they were

943
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,500
it was all little sample sizes but still

944
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:07,608
and they had like a little map but it

945
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,260
was like this was from here and this is

946
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:11,088
from here and this is from here and like

947
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,040
the thing I like there was their burger

948
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:14,358
but a number of my friends were really

949
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:18,588
into that [ __ ] the expensive booze

950
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:21,348
thing and if they can have that like are

951
00:35:18,588 --> 00:35:22,009
we really asking that much and honest I

952
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:24,320
think Canada's

953
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,660
either way before we do Canada's got it

954
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,160
right Canada has got they've got some

955
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:29,899
ugly hurdles they're gonna have to go

956
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,639
over the next few years for sure yeah

957
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,289
but they're on the way on the

958
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,519
business-business path they're doing it

959
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:35,599
right on the consumption path I think

960
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:37,099
they're gonna do it right they're gonna

961
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,509
have import and export with other

962
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:43,369
countries only for two very specific

963
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:45,560
it's not recreational import/export it's

964
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:48,650
for medical research and for something

965
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:50,210
else okay but they're starting with

966
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:56,119
import/export everybody else is on

967
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:57,800
lockdown the the one or two rules that I

968
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:02,349
see that they're really gonna end up

969
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:07,460
fighting over our consumption spaces and

970
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:09,380
Dave's limit I think that the edibles in

971
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,880
concentrates they're just gonna end up

972
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,829
hammering out packaging rules like we

973
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,750
did here oh yeah that'll take two years

974
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:15,920
they say one year but they'll get on it

975
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,389
in about six months and they'll make it

976
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,400
happen in a year and a half after that

977
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:21,579
and they're their biggest hurdle is

978
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,950
probably gonna be the existing market

979
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:28,340
they've got a multi-tiered black market

980
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:30,980
gray market white market system in place

981
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:34,010
already and a lot of that's locked out

982
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:36,530
of the legal industry that looking to

983
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,480
create now my favorite thing I learned

984
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,810
from this episode was the idea of

985
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,240
allowing 19 and 18 year old citizens to

986
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:45,679
purchase and possess cannabis to further

987
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,139
eradicate the black market I think

988
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,849
that's a really good strategy when you

989
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,619
explain to me why what kind of dawned on

990
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:53,929
me is you started saying was like oh man

991
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:55,429
because that's when I was buying and

992
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:57,199
selling the most black market cannabis

993
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:59,539
was between the ages of probably I

994
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,889
shouldn't admit like 17 to 24 ish was

995
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:03,320
when I was really banging out the black

996
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:06,139
market product so yeah that's you could

997
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,950
probably change people's lives you keep

998
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:09,139
people out of trouble

999
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:11,359
keep people from taking that path and

1000
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:12,500
also falling into trouble because their

1001
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,430
friend took that path and they bought it

1002
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:18,139
from them the the the real destruction

1003
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:21,759
that kind of flows out from the black

1004
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:28,569
market is the market part it's the

1005
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:31,610
amount of employees threats secrets

1006
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,930
shenanigans it takes to produce and

1007
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,099
distribute billions and billions of

1008
00:37:32,929 --> 00:37:36,108
dollars of the cannabis it's just

1009
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,608
[ __ ] nuts

1010
00:37:36,108 --> 00:37:40,130
and if you look at the size of the

1011
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:41,420
marketplace it's huge and then you start

1012
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,519
doing the math and you're like alright

1013
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:46,369
so like a big GRU home grows like 2

1014
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:50,269
million a year divided by 35 billion how

1015
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:52,338
many house is that ok it gets crazy fast

1016
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:55,519
and then you figure about you know how

1017
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:58,159
many little dealers and [ __ ] all of that

1018
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,289
market is is gonna start changing and we

1019
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:05,179
watched it here in Colorado where you

1020
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:06,829
had 10 friends that all solder and kind

1021
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:08,419
of worked in the community where when

1022
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:11,089
somebody was low they would buy from the

1023
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,440
others and when somebody grew a strain

1024
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:16,429
that was really good that other

1025
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,019
consumers like they trade and one by one

1026
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:20,210
all of those people started dropping out

1027
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:22,280
of the game yep in converting into full

1028
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:25,130
legal or leaving to someplace where the

1029
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,829
black market was still thriving but we

1030
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,599
completely eradicated the distribution

1031
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:31,160
end of black market in Colorado yeah

1032
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,039
they all got jobs it grows our

1033
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:36,980
dispensaries or as trimmers or whatever

1034
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:38,389
else you see people talk about oh all

1035
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,730
they have to do is on you know just

1036
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:42,769
don't charge the taxes and it's there's

1037
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:45,740
still no [ __ ] profit in it right like

1038
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:49,849
you can't make a living with three

1039
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:51,229
lights in a basement in $5 grams and

1040
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:53,088
it's not worth it anymore

1041
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:56,690
there's so much competition there's yeah

1042
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:58,909
there's literally no profit in it you're

1043
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:02,450
barely making what it took to produce

1044
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:05,298
back on it and if you're only doing that

1045
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:08,179
at an at-home scale there's literally no

1046
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:09,980
[ __ ] money in it you've got to do

1047
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,868
100% of the work yourself there's no

1048
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,119
wiggle room and your profit margins for

1049
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:16,338
helpers or waterers or tremor Arizer

1050
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,119
it's miserable that's the one by one

1051
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:19,519
they all drop out

1052
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,450
shrim all that [ __ ] yourself again yep I

1053
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:25,489
don't miss those days

1054
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:27,348
oh and for a dollar profit a gram when

1055
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:30,669
it was twenty a gram all day long to

1056
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:33,260
everybody it was worth it oh yeah but

1057
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:36,619
that's all your profit that's gone now

1058
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:39,049
pounds went from four thousand to thirty

1059
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:41,420
five to thirty two they stayed at

1060
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:44,298
thirty-two for a couple of years they

1061
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,338
started getting like 27 and then they

1062
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,858
were twenty-five for quite a while and

1063
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:49,739
then the next summer

1064
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:52,590
fifteen hundred you

1065
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:55,799
oh [ __ ] my weeds not worth anything $100

1066
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:58,140
an ounce if I'm lucky and now in

1067
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,140
Colorado you can get a pound of weed for

1068
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:03,900
1,200 maybe 900 dollars if you want at

1069
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:06,239
low shelf not beautiful stuff but it's

1070
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,680
available and a lot of heavy time of the

1071
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,868
year in which market you're pushing in

1072
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,849
give it a month from here you're gonna

1073
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:14,400
see thousand-dollar pounds all over the

1074
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:16,650
place a month we had two nasty cold

1075
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,849
freezes at the start October but people

1076
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,260
are gonna be early harvesting which

1077
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:23,670
means their crop didn't finish right

1078
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:26,880
when you add that into places that have

1079
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:30,659
acreage in the legal market when that

1080
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,460
hits the rack market the whole industry

1081
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:34,259
just holds their breath for four months

1082
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,630

1140
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:37,000

that they don't have stoner friends it

1142

1143
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,839
dabs and ramble and hang out so they got

1144
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:42,699
to kind of come hang out at the table

1145

intensive girl lessons so a bit amazing

1147
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:48,429
this is thank you bro this has been kind

1148
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:49,989
of like those lessons aren't stressful

1149
00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:52,299
but they are not like I don't get to

1150
00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:53,949
just hang out take dabs during those I'm

1151
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,080
like trying to stay focused and there's

1152
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:57,849
some editing and so those are different

1153
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,289
so this was kind of chill more like like

1154
00:42:57,849 --> 00:43:00,670

1155
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:02,679

1164
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:23,079
solution where I can join the podcast

1165
