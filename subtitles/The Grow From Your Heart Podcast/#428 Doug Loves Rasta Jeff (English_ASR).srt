10
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,160
tradition that we start this podcast off

11
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:29,009
by talking about what I'm smoking today

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,259
I've been taking dabs of Malibu pier

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,390
Kush full-spectrum extract from our

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,750
friends at apothecary farms the potency

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,920
label says this product contains 85% THC

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,500
and 98% total cannabinoids this

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,090
concentrate has me super stoned most of

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,920
the time I buy a product that makes me

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,960
kind of high more of an upbeat kind of a

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,719
brain mixing kind of a thing this

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,370
concentrate has got me on slow motion

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,259
and I am chilled out I'm sitting back in

23
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,119
the chair I feel like I'm talking super

24
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:58,890
slow I feel like if I tried to play

25
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,079

51
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:53,789
I've got a lot of fun stuff to talk

52
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,828
about in this episode let's start with

53
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,329
my favorite part if you have been

54
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:00,089
listening to this podcast for a while

55
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:02,008
you know that I am a huge fan of comedy

56
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,590
I love stand-up comedy I love going to

57
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,930
see live comedy shows I have built

58
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,300
friendships with several well-known

59
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,370
people make all them famous comedians I

60
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,560
have also established and developed a

61
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,020
relationship with my favorite club calm

62
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,598
works in Denver they are one of the top

63
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,150
three probably the top two comedy clubs

64
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,579
on the planet in my opinion only rivaled

65
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,709
by the Comedy Store in LA and that is

66
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,530
just because all of the famous comedians

67
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,719
live in Hollywood and/or the LA area so

68
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,879
they are more available however Comedy

69
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,310
Works is my favorite comedy club on the

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,199
planet I love going to see live comedy I

71
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,030
love hanging out at Comedy Works they

72
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,679
treat me like a rock star that is a

73
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,360
great club it is designed beautifully

74
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,550
for comedy I like a small room for a

75
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,890
comedy show there's a thing that happens

76
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,420
when you see comedy in a large venue the

77
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:49,708
comedian will tell his joke he'll say

78
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:51,719
his punchline so he'd be like and that's

79
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,700
when I punched him in the dick and so

80
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,799
the crowd will laugh and the laughter

81
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,750
will go from the front to the back all

82
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:00,420
the way to the back up to the balcony

83
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,879
then somehow that laughter sweeps back

84
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:05,189
to the comedian it goes back across the

85
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,598
balcony from the back of the room back

86
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:07,919
up to the front of room front of the

87
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:09,750
room the people in the front laughs they

88
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,369
applied a little bit and then people do

89
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,810
that thing there's a sign that you give

90
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,280
when you're done laughing you go ha ha

91
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:19,379
ha the comedian has to wait for that to

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,269
be able to tell his next if it's just a

93
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:23,159
tag line or if it's a whole nother bit

94
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,170
so there's a lot of patience and a lot

95
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,590
of time between jokes and between

96
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,509
sentences in a big comedy venue one of

97
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,759
the things I really enjoy about Comedy

98
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,889
Works is how intimate the place is the

99
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,169
ceiling is very low the seats are close

100
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,539
together I think the club holds less

101
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,608
than 300 total people so when you're in

102
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,169
there the vibe is tight everybody is

103
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:45,689
locked in everybody is paying attention

104
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,458
they actually put your phones in a bag

105
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:49,318
that you cannot open it's got like a

106
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,459
little like that shoplifting thing at

107
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:52,530
the mall you got to run it through a

108
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,299
little thing to get your the tag off

109
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,400
your clothes you put your bat your phone

110
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,959
in a little bag that has a tag like that

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,849
on it so your phone is locked up during

112
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,319
the show if you want to use your phone

113
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,060
you can walk out to the lobby they will

114
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:04,649
undo your phone and you can use it but I

115
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,930
love that everybody has their phones

116
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,670
locked up in these bags so when you're

117
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,709
in the show room it is nice and tight so

118
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:12,539
in comedy works what I love about it as

119
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,939
they tell a joke and the laughter hits

120
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,738
the audience the laughter explodes then

121
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,209
the comedian can throw in his next line

122
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,888
so if he says like so I kicked him in

123
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,910
the dick and then if the crowd laughs

124
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:22,259
and he goes and then he dropped his

125
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,460
change or whatever I don't know what the

126
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,870
joke is but you if you throw it there's

127
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:25,659
always that one more line that you want

128
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,209
to throw just to make

129
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,980
chuckle again those don't get lost in a

130
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:32,169
small comedy club so I really enjoy that

131
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,330
atmosphere that environment of a tiny

132
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,640
comedy club so what I'm rambling about

133
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:39,039
is I really enjoy the atmosphere and

134
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,370
environment of the Downtown Comedy Works

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,250
in Denver so on Sunday I was headed to

136
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:48,000
see Doug Benson record his live taping

137
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,800
of his podcast called Doug loves movies

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,680
Doug Benson has a podcast that is kind

139
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,870
of a movie game show a movie trivia game

140
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,610
show type of a thing he does a show

141
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,000
where he hosts the show and he brings

142
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,310
three guests usually actors comedians or

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,769
somebody local that people will know and

144
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,769
he invites them onstage to participate

145
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:10,539
in games there is a prize bag each

146
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:13,029
person who is a guest on the show is

147
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,770
expected to bring a small prize they

148
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:16,419
don't expect anything serious quite

149
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,949
often the people don't know they need to

150
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,080
bring a prize until they're on their way

151
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,479
to the show so they stop at some weird

152
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,859
gift shop or sometimes Target or

153
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,750
whatever is closed and they just get

154
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,490
random [ __ ] and put it in the bag it is

155
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,110
just more fun than anything else so

156
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,480
there's usually a prize bag played for

157
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,550
then there are nametags people in the

158
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,350
audience will design nametags the

159
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,540
nametags are usually they're supposed to

160
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,150
be designed after movie poster spoofs

161
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,069
where you insert your name a lot of

162
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:43,839
people get really creative just for a

163
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:46,300
good example in the past I have used

164
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,069
Rasta Jeff strikes back as my name tag

165
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,079
movie poster and I just put my name

166
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:52,360
right there over or my face right there

167
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,430
over Luke Skywalker's face so it's got

168
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,379
my smiling face with my backwards hat my

169
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,209
dreadlocks hanging down but I look like

170
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,219
Luke Skywalker I've got my lightsaber

171
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:02,349
going I'm ready to [ __ ] some [ __ ] up so

172

it is Rasta Jeff strikes back is my name

173
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,210
tag also many of the people in the

174
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,970
audience get very creative many of

175
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:12,879
Doug's guests are cannabis consumers

176
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,250
also they love candy so a lot of people

177
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,889
will attach candy or cannabis related

178
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,168
products to their name tag to encourage

179
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,329
their name tag to be selected let's talk

180
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:24,339
about that now the contestants come out

181
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:25,990
they talk about their prize bag they put

182
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:28,359
their prizes in the prize bag then they

183
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,400
select a name tag they are playing for

184
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,500
somebody in the audience so if they win

185
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,629
the games the person whose name tag they

186
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,339
selected will win the prize bag that way

187
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:38,350
the celebrity or the comedian or this

188
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:39,750
guest doesn't walk away with the prizes

189
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,189
because that's just cheesy

190
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,870
they're actually playing for somebody in

191
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,550
the audience that encourages the

192
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,829
audience to bring nametags it is a

193
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,110
really fun interactive kind of a culty

194
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:50,879
sort of a podcast sort of event doug has

195
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,500
a really tight following there are some

196
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,750
really inside jokes that are really

197
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,579
funny if you go to a Doug loves movies

198
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,899
taping and you're not sure what's going

199
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:00,419
on there will be some really funny

200
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,979
random audience interaction if you say

201
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,660
certain words Doug will reply with

202
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,490
certain things sometimes if you say

203
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,290
certain words the audience will reply

204
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,240
with certain things there are certain

205
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,160
cues at the start of the show that Doug

206
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,139
expects you to actually reply

207
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,900
sometimes people improvise on those and

208
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,750
it makes it even funnier anyway that is

209
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,549
the gist of the Doug Benson live taping

210
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,100
he comes out he brings out three guests

211
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,600
they select they show their prizes they

212
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,520
select nametags then there is a game

213
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,200
portion of the show they play games that

214
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,579
is the main part of the show that's

215
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,069
where all the madness and the comedy

216
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,529
ensues so I was headed to Denver on

217
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:36,899
Sunday which was Mother's Day to go see

218
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:38,459
the traditional annual Mother's Day

219
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:41,069
taping of Doug loves movies at the

220
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:43,109
Downtown comedy works I was about an

221
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,329
hour into my two-hour drive on my way to

222
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,639
comedy works and my phone vibrated and I

223
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:51,029
noticed that I had a message on Twitter

224
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,219
from our friend Doug Benson so I picked

225
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:55,559
up my phone gave it a quick look and it

226
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,800
said are you ready to be a guest on a

227
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,600
full episode I was a little bit confused

228
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,579
I didn't want to jump to conclusions I

229
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,530
didn't want to get too excited so I set

230
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,359
my phone down and continued driving for

231
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,279
a few moments until traffic got really

232
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,139
clear I could get into the right lane I

233
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,369
could hand my phone over to the person

234
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:13,139
in the passenger seat and say hey does

235
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,360
that say what I think it says and when

236
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,279
she read it she said he's asking if you

237
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,810
want to be on the show I thought to

238
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,609
myself that can't be what that says

239
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,740
everything in me said don't get too

240
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,540
excited that is not what that says so I

241
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,160
messaged him back I said you mean like

242
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,500
on the panel and he said yeah dude I

243
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,650
want you to be on the show so I got to

244
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,529
be a full guest on the Doug loves movies

245
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:36,538
podcast at my favorite comedy club on

246
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,848
the planet I really don't think I

247
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:40,860
believed it until I was on the stage and

248
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,658
sitting to my right was Doug Benson to

249
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,460
my left was a comedian known as Taylor

250
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:46,830
Tomlinson and then to her left was a

251
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,139
comedian called Jeff Tate and as soon as

252
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,200
everybody started talking I was like hey

253
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,620
I'm on the Doug loves movies podcast

254
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,778
suddenly I felt really comfortable and I

255
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,339
really at home so let's talk more about

256
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:59,470
how the day when I drove up to Denver I

257
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:00,820
got a good parking spot of course I got

258
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,350
kind of lit in the parking lot because I

259
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,600
had to calm myself down before I headed

260
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,430
up to Comedy Works I walked up to Comedy

261
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,409
Works I got myself situated in there

262
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:10,028
I had Miss Amy with me I brought her

263
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:12,219
with me as my date so I had to be sure

264
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:13,689
to find her a good comfortable seat and

265
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,519
make sure that she was well taken care

266
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,440
of while I was on stage I couldn't just

267
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,088
abandon her I had to make sure she was

268
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,380
comfortable and that they knew she was

269
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,390
my girl and they were taking good care

270
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:24,009
of her so I got her all set up with my

271
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:26,350
friends at the club and then they took

272
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:29,200
me to the greenroom where I ran into

273
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,550
Jeff Tate and eventually Doug Benson we

274
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,350
went out and smoked a little bit cuz

275
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:33,849
that's what we do when I went back to

276
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,519
the green room I ran into Taylor

277
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,800
Tomlinson and her fiance we had a long

278
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,870
funny conversation eventually Doug

279
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,549
Benson and his girlfriend and Jeff Tate

280
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,460
all stumbled into the greenroom we hung

281
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:47,049
out for a few right before a Showtime we

282
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,509
all stepped out of the backdoor Comedy

283
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:51,159
Works Taylor Tomlinson did not consume

284
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:53,019
any cannabis I should probably be clear

285
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,449
about that she did not join us it was a

286
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,220
Jeff Tate Doug Benson and myself all out

287
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,629
back smoking a little reefer I'm not

288
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,830
snitching on anybody there everybody

289
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,879
knows those guys are pot heads that's

290
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,139
why I want to make sure nobody thinks

291
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,669
Taylor was back there she was not

292
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,620
smoking with us I just want to be clear

293
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:07,028
I don't know her stance or position but

294
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,799
she did not consume I don't want to get

295
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:10,899
her in any trouble so we all went got

296
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,669
stoned then Doug goes and starts the

297
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:15,009
show Doug does a few minutes of his own

298
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:16,929
time I would guess Doug did about 10 or

299
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:18,458
15 maybe 20 minutes he goes out and gets

300
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:20,079
the crowd warmed up he does a few

301
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,789
advertisements talks about shows he's

302
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,730
got coming up talks about the sponsors

303
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:26,559
then he brings out the guests he brought

304
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,899
out Taylor Tomlinson he introduced me as

305
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,299
Rasta Jeff and of course Jeff Tate and

306
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:33,100
it felt really fun to walk out and just

307
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,509
sit on the stool and a few people knew

308
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,759
who I was quite a few people seemed to

309
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:39,278
know who I was and it was really fun

310
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:40,990
just to be on the stage with Doug Benson

311
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,309
who is kind of my he's my friend we only

312
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,709
hang out once or twice a year but he

313
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,909
knows who I am obviously and it was

314
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,889
really comfortable just to be chillin

315
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:49,899
next to him Jeff Tate is one of my

316
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:51,189
favorite guests on that podcast I

317
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,169

eyes that have a better reputation for

328
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,480
taking the games than him so it was

329
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,240
really fun to be on the show with Jeff

330
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,550
Tate Taylor Tomlinson was really sweet

331
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,810
and really fun and really nice and

332
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:20,458
really inviting when I was in the

333
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:22,469
greenroom with her it didn't feel like I

334
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,879
was in the greenroom with some famous

335
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,199
comedian it felt like I was just hanging

336
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,149
out with some people that I had just met

337
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:28,559
we're all just chilling out having a

338
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:30,149
good time doing a little show together

339
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,888
so that was a great time I got

340
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,028
comfortable on the stage we all

341
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:35,068
introduced ourselves

342
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:37,139
Doug gave me a moment to talk about my

343
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:39,689
podcast I got to talk about my seeds

344
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,698
earlier I mentioned the prize bag since

345
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,190
it is Colorado I was able to put two

346
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:45,958
packs of seeds into the prize bag so I

347
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,120
threw a 10 pack of a rise in to that

348
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,189
prize bag and I also threw in a 10 pack

349
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,350
of sonic boom I don't know that the guy

350
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,120
who won will ever grow those but I got

351
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,278
to talk about them on the show so it was

352
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,659
well worth it so there was a lot of fun

353
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,639
conversation at the start of the show

354
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:02,159
some jokes about my dreadlocks Taylor

355
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,480
Tomlinson called me the stoner Tarzan

356
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,039
which I thought was great

357
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,199
a lot of people laughed at that one she

358
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,719
said it was a compliment she is just

359
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:12,149
adorable so everything she says I take

360
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,920
as a compliment then after a few jokes

361
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,708
after a few minutes we got to the game

362
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,818
portion of the show I have been

363
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,250
listening to the Doug loves movies

364
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:22,679
podcast for several years I have

365
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,198
attended probably 10 or 15 live tapings

366
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,019
of that show but I do not watch a lot of

367
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:31,289
movies so I was really questioning my

368
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,839
ability to do well in the movie based

369
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:35,730
trivia games I don't want to brag too

370
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,010
much here on my show but I did pretty

371
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,350
damn well for not knowing a whole lot

372
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,939
about movies I know I've already talked

373
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,528
a whole lot about the episode but I hope

374
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:49,050

how well I did on the games but also see

385
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,250
how much fun I had I had the time of my

386
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,750
life on that podcast I really did not

387
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,059
expect to be a guest on the show I

388
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,068
didn't find out until my way to Denver

389
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,269
so it was really fun I was unprepared

390
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:22,860
but I think that was bad

391
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:24,149
cuz I just walked in I was okay I'm here

392
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,620
and they're like cool go back there and

393
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:26,879
I went on the into the green room and

394
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,009
they're like cool let's go on stage and

395
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,539
it all just happened super smooth like I

396
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,279
said earlier I don't think I realized it

397
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:34,139
was even happening until I was on the

398
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,939
stage and it was happening and then I

399
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,830
don't think it hit me that it had

400
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,380
happened until Monday when the episode

401
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,420
came out I was like oh wow I was on that

402
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:44,039
podcast and I got to listen to it a lot

403
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,360
of it I really didn't remember once it

404
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:47,250
started happening I was like oh I do

405
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,810
remember that but it was such a blur I

406
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,850
had so much fun there was so much

407
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:52,289
adrenaline so much excitement and so

408
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,570
much laughter that I couldn't even pay

409
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:56,519
attention so I owe a big huge thank you

410
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,800
to Doug Benson for letting me be on his

411
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,480
Doug loves movies podcast also I owe a

412
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,519
big huge shout out to all of my friends

413
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,779
at Comedy Works they have always treated

414
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,909
me like a rock star they've always

415
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,409
treated me like a VIP but once I was a

416
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:09,600
guest on the show and I was actually

417
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:11,459
backstage I was treated like a celebrity

418
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,769
and that was awesome so big thanks to

419
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,500
all my friends there then after the show

420
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:18,149
there was an amazing little smoke let's

421
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,580
say allegedly there may have been a

422
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:23,730
smoke session in the alley behind Comedy

423
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:26,970
Works with Doug Benson Jeff Tate myself

424
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,860
and probably 90% of the crowd we all

425
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,360
congregated out behind comedy works out

426
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,850
by the dumpster there because that seems

427
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,250
to be the classy place and we smoked

428
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,259
down and took pictures and it was kind

429
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,870
of awkward because a lot of people asked

430
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,879
me to sign autographs I'm not used to

431
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,529
that yet but it is really fun it feels

432
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,360
kind of silly it feels kind of strange

433
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:47,730
but honestly it is super exciting I

434
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,769
means a lot to me that people were

435
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,269
excited to shake my hand and take a

436
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,829
picture with me and people were like

437
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:54,629
dude you're funny I didn't even realize

438
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,740
I was saying anything funny on stage I

439
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,779
was just trying not to say anything

440
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,610
stupid so for everybody to be

441
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,049
complimenting me and be super excited to

442
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,370
meet me and take a picture with me and

443
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:03,990
the weirdest part of signing autographs

444
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,519
I'm still not I don't think I'll ever

445
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,750
get used to that I'm always down to take

446
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,399
a picture and shake your hand but

447
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,649
signing autographs feels really weird

448
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,149
I'll do it but that is new to me I don't

449
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,459
know if that will ever feel like a

450
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:16,230
natural thing so I had a great time

451
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,420
being a guest on the Doug loves movies

452
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,100
podcast I got to meet a lot of great

453
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:22,559
people after the show something I

454
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,639
laughed at as soon as Amy and I walked

455
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,679
up to the comedy club

456
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,689
there was a couple standing in front

457
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,370
smoking a cigarette and they saw me and

458
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,780
the guy looked at me and he said hey

459
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,940
dude are you a guest on the show tonight

460
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,419
and I don't think I was supposed to tell

461
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,589
anybody that I was a guest but

462
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:37,299
that point I didn't know what to say I

463
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,680
go I don't think I'm supposed to talk

464
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:40,000
about that and he laughed and he

465
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:42,370
introduced himself and we had a fun

466
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,409
conversation him his wife and Amy and

467
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,970
myself hung out for a few minutes I just

468
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:47,860
hanging out for a few in front of the

469
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,149
comedy club I was a little bit early and

470
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,320
he was early so he was smoking a

471
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,970
cigarette and I was just chilling out

472
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,620
kind of catching the breeze and enjoying

473
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,060
the sunshine before I went in but I

474
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,009
thought it was really funny that he knew

475
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:59,289
who I was and he asked if I was going to

476
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:00,909
be on the show and I think Doug tries to

477
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:02,379
keep it a secret so I wasn't sure if I

478
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:04,000
was supposed to say yeah I'm on the show

479
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,259
I really wasn't sure how to react so I

480
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,120
said I don't know how I'm supposed to

481
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:08,948
react to that dude and I think he knew

482
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,528
by my reaction but I didn't snitch on

483
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:13,088
myself so that was fun so the smoked out

484
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:14,828
after it was a great time the podcast

485
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,750
was a great time meeting everybody was a

486
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:18,458
really great time I wasn't ready for

487
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,528
that I did not realize that I was going

so I made sure to show her that she was

505
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:52,269
getting all kinds of love even though I

506
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,769
was up on stage playing rockstar for a

507
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:55,389

514
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,140
had just smoked with Doug Benson and

515
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:10,058

together this event this event started

00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,830
off as a kind of a carbon copy of the

592
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,120
original dude grows cup but we realized

593
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:39,038
that we had to change up a few things

594
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,048
and it took a lot more effort than we

595
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,759
anticipated and it is becoming a really

596
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:45,429
great event because we had to try harder

597
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:47,798
it made it become an even better event

598
