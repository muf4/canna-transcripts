where are we going from there we are

138
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,280
going to talk about the main topic of

139
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,959
this podcast i got two messages

140
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,878
both of them were on patreon both of

141
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,519
them were within a couple of days of

142
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,120
each other

143
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,399
and they were both about the same thing

144
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,280
so i'm going to read both of the

145
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,039
messages

146
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,478
i'm sure the point will be obvious by

147
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600
then and then we will talk a little bit

148
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,000
about how to do

149
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,759
the tricks they are asking for all right

150
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,240
so the first message in today's episode

151
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,080
goes

152
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,840
a lot like this it came from girls grow

153
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,959
too and it goes just

154
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,399
like this it says hey ross to jeff i've

155
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,239

156

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,680
can't be gone for more than four days

170
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,319
because i do know that

171
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,840
uh by the end of that fourth day i no

172
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,439
longer have plans which means i no

173
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,478
longer have a business which means i no

174
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,918
longer

175
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,839
oh let's not go that route let's not

176
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,279
think about that but you are absolutely

177
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,079
correct within three or four days of

178
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,758
leaving

179
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,519
i have to come back and water the plants

180
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,400
that means i get a fish weekend i can

181
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,319
leave friday

182
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,159
gotta be back sunday night maybe i can

183
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,519
push it thursday friday saturday sunday

184
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
if i'm lucky

185
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,959
but you are absolutely correct it's hard

186
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,638
to get away because of the growth does

187
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,279
keep us locked down it does need to be

188
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,879
watered

189
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,399
so it says sure i could plan a trip and

190
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,319
stop the grow and all that but it would

191
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,599
be a pain in the in the ass and a huge

192
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,918
production loss yes

193
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,639
absolutely shutting down for any amount

194
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:42,719
of time

195
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,240
can be a huge pain in the ass and a huge

196
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,919
production loss

197
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,680
first of all what would i do with my

198
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,120
mother plants if i were to shut down i

199
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,038
need those genetics you need your

200
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,120
genetics we've done pheno hunts we've

201
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,879
selected plants they work well in our

202
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,000
grow well for our body well for our

203
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,680
customers

204
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,439
well for our medical needs now we're

205
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,240
gonna get rid of that that's [ __ ] we

206
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,759
can't do that

207
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,360
and then production loss yeah i'm going

208
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,479
to need medicine when i get back from my

209
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
vacation so

210
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,519
plus i need extra medicine to take on

211
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,519
vacation so you're right

212
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,439
it is a huge pain in the ass so it says

213
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,159
what are your thoughts on some sort of

214
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,560
auto

215
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,160
watering system yes an auto watering

216
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,240
system would be a great idea

217
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
i do work in commercial cultivation

218
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
facilities and when i take over the

219
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,159
commercial

220
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
grows the first thing i do is get rid of

221
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,759
the bug and mildew problems

222
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,600
the next thing that i do is i go in and

223
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
i build an auto watering system so that

224
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
we aren't paying people

225
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,239
to hand water plants all day it can suck

226
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,000
up the entire day

227
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,240
in a commercial grow watering hundreds

228
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,839
of plants or we can spend two or three

229
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,680
days building an auto watering system

230
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,719
and then for the rest of that facility

231
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,720
you press a button

232
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,240
and all of the plants get watered so yes

233
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,639
an auto watering system

234
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,079
is amazing it says i have severe trust

235
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,079
issues so i trust

236
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,000
literally no one to do any of the work

237
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,318
in my grow except for me i understand

238
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
that

239
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,720
trust me i have my own personal grow

240
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,319
where nobody touches anything but me

241
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,160
and then i'm in charge of commercial

242
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,879
growth quite often where i have to trust

243
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,199
people

244
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,879
to control that grow while i'm gone

245
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,759
sometimes i go away for a week for a

246
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,839
weekend

247
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,680
and i've gotta just trust the crew there

248
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,918
that is a little bit nerve-racking a

249
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,079
little bit sketchy i know how you feel

250
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,439
it wraps up with uh thank you ross to

251
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,478
jeff i love seeing white mike on the

252
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,719

255
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
message

256
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,080
i'm going to talk a little bit about

257
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,439
building an auto watering system

258
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,439
i'll make sure that mike gets a high

259
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,120
five and a fist bump for you before we

260
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,478
get to that let's read one more message

261
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,560
this one comes from

262
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,079
coach steve and it says i don't have a

263
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
question but i would like to hear

264
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,399
your uh details on an auto watering

265
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,160
system components timing

266
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,079
i'm a handy dude so i've got a general

267
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,680
idea but your insight could help me

268
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,719
get this right the first time i like

269
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,079
that you're trying to get it right the

270
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,280
first time because

271
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,159
when you're building an auto watering

272
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,399
system you absolutely could make a huge

273
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,000
auto watered mess you could just auto

274
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,638
water the floor you could auto water the

275
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ceiling

276
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,519
depends on how things go you could

277
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,720
totally [ __ ] this up so i'm glad you're

278
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,918
trying to pay attention and get it right

279
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,599
the first time

280
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,279
wraps up with i just finished my last

281
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,719
run of organics and soil

282
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:09,758
and i'm ready for a ferrari coco and

283
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,280
synthetics has me all excited so much

284
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,479
love and respect to you

285
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,598
from coach steve all right coach steven

286
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,199
girls grow too

287
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,360
this is a great question a great thing

288
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,720
to get me ranting on here on the podcast

289
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,479
so i'm going to take a quick sip of some

290
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,960
water and then we're going to talk about

291
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,038
building

292
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,000
an auto watering system for our plants

293
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,560
so that we can sneak

294
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
away for a couple of days or maybe use

295
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,559
the auto watering system to

296
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
more consistently water the plants also

297
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,319
water those plants every day so that we

298
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,000
can dedicate more time and energy

299
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,000
and focus on other things like

300
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,639
defoliation popping twisting

301
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
sweeping vacuuming cleaning all the

302
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,519
random [ __ ] that has to happen in the

303
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
house and in the growth it kind of gets

304
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,080
overlooked

305
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,440
because we're more focused on the super

306
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
important parts of the grow

307
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,640
i'm going to take a sip and then we're

308
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,838
going to talk about building this auto

309
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,838
watering system

310
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,560
all right all right all right thanks for

311
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,479
being patient with me while i hydrate i

312
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,278
either edited that out or you watched me

313
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,120
take a drink

314
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,759
big thanks now let's talk about building

315
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,320
an auto watering system

316
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,039
building a system for auto watering will

317
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,360
vary

318
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,958
based on how many plants you have how

319
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,959
much water you're trying to use

320
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,039
and how big your grow space is that's

321
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,599
going to be the main deciding factor on

322
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,079
building

323
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,920
an auto watering system for a small grow

324
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,120
for a small personal grow they do

325
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,639
sell pre-fabricated auto watering

326
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,120
systems it comes with a pump

327
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,838
it comes with all of the tubing you will

328
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,600
need to get that water to your grow area

329
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,680
then it comes with little extenders to

330
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,519
get the water to the plants

331
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:50,719
if you have a small grow that will work

332
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,519
however i always recommend even with

333
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,278
the homemade or the purchased kit for an

334
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,720
auto watering system i will always

335
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:01,200
recommend having a backup pump on hand

336
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,639
those pumps are designed to move water

337
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,839
most of them aren't designed to move

338
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,879
water with nutrients

339
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,160
in them so we're in it so

340
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,439
those pumps are going to burn out

341
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,879
they're going to get hot they're going

342
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,440
to get used a lot and they're going to

343
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,879
cook one day when you least expect it

344
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
and it's probably going to be at the

345
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,000
worst time so no matter what auto

346
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,399
watering

347
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,759
system you choose to build buy purchase

348
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,839
work with complete

349
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,278
i highly recommend a backup pump

350
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,360
whatever pump you get

351
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,720
get another one just like it if the

352
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
package comes with the pump

353
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,000
buy another one that's just like it or

354
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,039
better so that you've got a backup

355
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,278
if you're going to build one with the

356
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,399
monday pump that i talk about get two of

357
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,919
the monday pumps

358
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,000
so let's talk about building a watering

359
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,879
system the main thing you're going to

360
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,639
need the main

361
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,559
things you're going to need are a

362
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,559
reservoir how much water

363
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,000
will your plants need for the duration

364
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,719
of time you tend

365
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,559
intend to be gone from your garden how

366
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,079
often do you water the plants

367
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:59,278
i water about every three days i water

368
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:02,000
about five gallons of water per light

369
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,519
every three days so now i know that if

370
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,720
i'm going to be gone for a week that'll

371
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,799
be two waterings

372
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,560
i'm going to need approximately 10

373
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,120
gallons of water so i'll need a

374
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,838
reservoir that will hold a minimum of 10

375
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,440
gallons

376
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,440
i'd like to be gone for a little longer

377
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,519
i'd like to buy myself a day or two

378
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,360
on each end of that just so i can uh

379
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,799
maybe i'm maybe my flight gets delayed

380
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,600
maybe something terrible happens and i'm

381
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,199
gone longer

382
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,639
so i'm gonna try to go for like a 12 to

383
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,879
14 day reservoir

384
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,958
which means i'm going to need probably

385
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,039
three maybe four waterings in there

386
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,799
probably 20 gallons this is where you

387
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,679
got to decide what size reservoir you

388
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,639
want to get

389
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,439
i like a rubbermaid trash can or a brute

390
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,600
trash can

391
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,000
i get the 30 gallon i think it's a 32 or

392
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,240
a 30. i'll get the big trash can and

393
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
they sell wheels for it at the hardware

394
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,440
store

395
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
right next to the trash cans will be

396
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,160
wheels that snap

397
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,159
onto the bottom of your trash can the

398
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,838
trash can sits on it you turn the can

399
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,838
now the wheels are secured onto the

400
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,279
trash can i would take some duct tape

401
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,040
and tape that [ __ ] on there just so you

402
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,399
never have any accidents but

403
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,399
tape the wheels to there now you've got

404
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,039
a reservoir on wheels you can roll that

405
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,559
to your

406
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,799
water supply i don't know where your

407
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,559
water supply is maybe it's far away

408
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,319
maybe it's right next to your grill but

409
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,319
now you've got a reservoir on wheels

410
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,079
that you can roll to the water supply

411
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,519
roll it right back to where you need it

412
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,120
another thing i'm going to recommend i'm

413
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,278
going to back up a step

414
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
at the local hardware store if you're

415
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,399
growing in your home

416
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,600
you've probably got a shower or a sink

417
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,039
how do you get water

418
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
to that big reservoir you don't have a

419
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,838
spout you don't have a hose something

420
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,240
i've discovered that is

421
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,079
very friendly very easy to install very

422
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,839
useful for many different reasons i use

423
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,638
it for a lot of different things

424
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,040
they sell a device that is used to wash

425
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,519
your

426
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,480
dog at the hardware store so your shower

427
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,320
comes out of the wall

428
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,399
it's got the normal shower spout and

429
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,040
then the head screws onto that spout

430
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,000
to install this new hose you unscrew the

431
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,078
shower head

432
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,039
put in a coupler and screw the shower

433
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:52,719
head back on

434
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,559
now your shower is just like it was

435
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,000
except it's about three maybe four or

436
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,439
five inches longer

437
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,720
if you're a tall guy like me now it's

438
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,240
closer to your head that kind of sucks

439
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,959
but you'll deal with that it'll be worth

440
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,680
it

441
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,278
so you add this device that adds a

442
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,120
coupler and an extender

443
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,799
in that extender is a little piece that

444
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,039
you screw in another hose

445
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,958
and that hose has a long hose with like

446
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
a shower head on it with an on and off

447
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,119
spout

448
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,639
so now you've got a shower head that you

449
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,240
can move around in your

450
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,000
bathroom wherever you need to get it to

451
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,680
you can use that hose to fill

452
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,039
up your buckets you can use that hose to

453
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,039
fill up your reservoir

454
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,958
you can use that hose to clean off

455
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,559
things that you can can't move around as

456
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,000
well you can get that hose to the things

457
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,719
instead of getting the things to the

458
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,720
shower

459
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,759
if that helps you maybe you're a smart

460
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,278
ass and you've already got one of the

461
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,319
showers with the heads that comes off

462
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:37,679
and you're using that

463
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,680
i don't want to shower with the same

464
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,638
head i stuck in the 5 gallon bucket so i

465
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,638
bought the dog

466
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,399
cleaning shower kit and it works

467
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,360
beautifully for filling reservoirs

468
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,120
filling buckets

469
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,480
and cleaning [ __ ] make sure you use the

470
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,078
plumbing tape when you do it

471
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,519
uh take off the shower head put a piece

472
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,359
of plumbing tape on the threads

473
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,639
put that new attachment on put some

474
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,919
plumbing tape on the shower head put

475
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,278
this shower head back on

476
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,198
you're almost ready to go now you've got

477
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,278
a middle piece that receives

478
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,719
that extra hose piece you can just pop

479
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,078
it off put it back on it will

480
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,600
i honestly just leave it there it's

481
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,958
dangling down all the time i can fill a

482
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,639
bucket fill a reservoir

483
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,159
just about any time it's got its own off

484
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,759
and on switch to which i really like

485
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,559
that's a long ramble for that piece of

486
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,838
equipment

487
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,439
get that little [ __ ] then get your

488
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,000
trash can get your trash can on wheels

489
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,600
feel the trash

490
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,198
can up now here's where we're going to

491
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,639
start building an auto

492
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:25,278
watering system this is how i do it

493
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,320
this is going to be kind of vague kind

494
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,879
of generic

495
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,320
but i'm not there i don't know what your

496
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,559
grow space looks like i don't know your

497
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,399
budget i don't know your skill level

498
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,399
uh this is just going to be a vague idea

499
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,078
for everybody so that we can get a good

500
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,958
start at building an auto watering

501
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,120
system

502
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,638
so it's going to start with a reservoir

503
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,078
like i've said before how often do you

504
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,000
want to water those plants

505
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,838
how many waterings do you want to get

506
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,919
out of this water and reservoir

507
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,279
get the appropriate size res i like the

508
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,360
trash can on wheels

509
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,519
so i've got the trash can on wheels i

510
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,240
fill it up i put my nutrients in there

511
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,919
i adjust the ph and i adjust the i make

512
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,600
sure the ec is where i want it

513
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,399
i've got everything right in my water

514
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,879
now another really good idea is to have

515
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,759
a stir pump in the bottom of your

516
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,320
reservoir

517
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,919
imagine that nutrients are that nutrient

518
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
and that water is sitting in solution

519
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,679
for

520
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,120
5 10 14 days all the heavy [ __ ] is going

521
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,479
right to the bottom all the light stuff

522
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,919
is going right to the top

523
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
so when your plants get fed next time

524
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,000
they're gonna get fed all the heavy

525
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,519
elements

526
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,039
whatever's heaviest calcium and

527
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,240
magnesium are the heavy ones they're

528
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,838
going to fall to the bottom

529
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,120
your plants are going to get all of that

530
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,560
on this feed and then the next

531
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,399
subsequent feedings is going to taper

532
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,879
off until they just get plain water

533
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,480
and the lighter elements so put that

534
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,759
stir pump in the bottom of your

535
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,360
reservoir plug it in

536
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,399
have it constantly stirring your

537
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,879
nutrients constantly stirring if you can

538
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,919
if not have it come on when you trigger

539
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,919
the timer

540
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,838
to pump the water which we'll talk about

541
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,759
in the future i would recommend

542
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,600
having that water moving constantly you

543
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,759
don't want it getting stagnant and stale

544
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,120
i will get funky and you're gonna feed

545
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,560
your plants just the bottom

546
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,159
the thick part of the kool-aid you gotta

547
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,958
stir the kool-aid so all the drinks

548
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,519
taste good

549
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,278
so uh you've got your now you got your

550
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360
your fill method with your dog

551
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,958
washing uh hose attachment you've got

552
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,519
your reservoir on wheels

553
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,879
we've got a monde pump to start uh in

554
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,240
there which is going to be the base and

555
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,838
now we've got a stir pump in there

556
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,320
stirring up our nutrients now the next

557
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,680
thing

558
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,879
we're going to work with the monday pump

559
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,559
i'm talking about i like to buy the

560
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,078
monday pumps

561
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,919
i cannot remember exactly how many

562
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,278
gallons per water or what the horsepower

563
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,039
is on that [ __ ] thing

564
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,639
uh find the pump that is appropriate for

565
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,240
you too much water

566
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,839
movement is better than not enough

567
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,120
because you've got to push this water

568
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,480
through a bunch of tubing and it's got

569
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,600
to get through some emitters

570
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,800
if you don't have enough pressure when

571
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,159
it gets to the emitters they just

572
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,879
trickle and dribble we want it to kind

573
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,519
of emit

574
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,120
and spray and make a nice pattern so get

575
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,320
a pump that is a little bit bigger than

576
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,919
what you think you're going to use i

577
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
like the monde pump

578
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,159
it's usually just about less than a foot

579
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,198
tall just weighs a few pounds it's got a

580
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,198
long cord on it

581
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,319
so you're going to get the mondi pump

582
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,039
and then you need

583
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,079
tubing to go from the pump and the

584
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,240
reservoir

585
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,679
to your garden area i don't know where

586
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,799
your reservoir is going to be stored i

587
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,078
don't know where your pump will be

588
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:05,759
stored you'll probably need to be

589
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,119
near electricity because you're going to

590
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,838
have to plug in a timer

591
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,038
and a couple of plugs for this so put

592
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,838
your reservoir

593
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,359
in a good spot then uh have it near a

594
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,720
plug you're going to need to plug in at

595
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,318
least that stir pump

596
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,400
and then you're gonna have a timer with

597
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,000
another pump on it and that timer will

598
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,038
be set to water at the intervals in

599
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,558
which you tell it

600
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,558
maybe you've got one of those amazon

601
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,720
smart plugs that you can tell pump

602
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,160
from far away maybe you've got something

603
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,160
there are a lot of ways to set this up

604
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,558
you can set it up on a smart b unit

605
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,320
with a moisture sensor in your pot when

606
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,000
that moisture sensor says hey this is

607
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,000
too dry it will trigger the smart b

608
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,279
unit to actually water your plants there

609
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,798
are a lot of ways to set up the

610
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,480
triggering of the watering

611
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,558
a real easy way to do it is to put on a

612
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,960
timer and tell it every morning at nine

613
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:49,200
o'clock

614
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,558
water for 45 seconds or two minutes or

615
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,000
however long it takes

616
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,319
they'll come on the water then it'll

617
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,798
shut off there are timers you can buy to

618
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,558
do

619
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,558
just about any sort of program you want

620
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,960
you can tell every wednesday come on

621
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,079
every wednesday and friday come on set

622
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
the timer how you want it so you're

623
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,720
gonna need a timer

624
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,159
so you got your main pump that goes

625
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,640
inside of the reservoir

626
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
then you've got flex tubing that comes

627
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,320
from your main pump

628
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,159
that goes up and out of the trash can or

629
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,720
whatever reservoir you've used

630
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,480
back down i run it across the floor if

631
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,600
i'm using tables i run it along the edge

632
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
of the tables

633
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,719
in most personal growers you're just

634
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,160
going to do the floor or

635
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,679
however your tables or your plants are

636
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,120
raised anyway i'm coming out of the

637
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,480
trash can down to the floor then i've

638
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,839
got a line that goes across the middle

639
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,960
of the floor

640
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,399
then it separates into i make a loop out

641
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,440
of it let me explain what i mean by

642
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,519
making a loop

643
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,640
i don't want one straight line going

644
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,879
down the room

645
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,320
with lines coming off of that to water

646
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,320
the plants because

647
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,159
the pressure toward the end will start

648
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,678
losing pressure and all the plants at

649
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,558
the front will get the most water the

650
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,640
water will come out

651
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,918
it'll take the path of least resistance

652
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,559
so i make a loop

653
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,000
and the loop will equalize the pressure

654
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,119
my line comes off of my

655
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,160
pump i've got a i use thick flex hosing

656
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,759
i think it's uh

657
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,840
three quarters of an inch maybe a half

658
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,119
inch in diameter but i'm watering a lot

659
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,639
more plants than you so

660
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,479
get the diameter of tubing you think

661
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,919
will be necessary to move the amount of

662
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,279
water you need to move i don't know how

663
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,600
big your grow is

664
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,440
get the flex tube go from the monday

665
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,480
pump out of the reservoir

666
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,880
across the grow room floor then i will

667
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,798
cut it and make a t intersection at this

668
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,120
point so there's a cap that goes on it

669
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,558
and it is a t now my main line is coming

670
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,599
out of the reservoir and going straight

671
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,639
across the floor

672
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,038
to a t now i will build a square

673
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,360
i've got just a perfect square of tubing

674
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,759
that lies right in the middle of my room

675
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,599
and then that perfect square just loops

676
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,000
back to itself so you got a t that comes

677
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,399
out

678
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,919
and a square i can't describe it anymore

679
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,400
simply my hose comes off

680
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,080
straight then it branches out to a t and

681
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
then it goes up and then it comes back

682
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,519
in

683
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,280
so you got a straight line with the

684
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,720
square at the end of it the reason for

685
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,639
the square i've said this a moment ago

686
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,240
is to equalize that pressure

687
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,080
this way we're going to get this same

688
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,720
amount of water flow through every

689
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,079
emitter

690
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,919
that way you don't get a couple of

691
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,359
emitters that spray real hard and a few

692
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,679
at the end that are not spraying very

693
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,839
well

694
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,720
i like the equalization by building the

695
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,639
square it works

696
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,640
very well for me and i've seen it work

697
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,038
better than just the one straight line

698
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,080
so you've got your square that goes

699
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:15,519
along the floor

700
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,199
measure it to where you're not going to

701
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,519
have to run a bunch of spaghetti string

702
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,440
to

703
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,119
every plant that's too long but every

704
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,720
plant will need at least one or two

705
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,678
spaghetti emitters that we'll talk about

706
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,480
in a minute

707
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,200
so you've got your uh your pump and your

708
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,880
reservoir

709
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,558
you've got your main line that runs out

710
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,200
across the floor to get closer to the

711
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:32,879
plants

712
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,720
you've got your big square laid out on

713
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,240
the floor the plants are now arranged

714
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,038
around that square

715
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,880
this is where i use they send there are

716
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,240
so many options for these products

717
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,679
i'm not sure where you're going if

718
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
you're going to shop at a local hardware

719
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,360
store

720
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,440
if you're going to shop at the big

721
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,639
orange box or the big blue box store

722
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,480
i'm not sure if you're going to order it

723
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,640
online there's a great online website to

724
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,000
order all of your hydroponics parts

725
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,280
but i like to use uh there's a little

726
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,519
tool that you poke a hole

727
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,639
in the main tube with you just puncture

728
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,279
it and then

729
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,280
there are spaghetti emitters that are

730
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,038
already pre-assembled that i like to buy

731
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,200
they've got a barb on one end

732
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,079
and a long skinny tube and then at the

733
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,038
other end

734
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,079
there is a an emitter it is it hooks to

735
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,839
the

736
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,519
one end hooks to the tubing and then

737
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,678
it's kind of shaped like a question mark

738
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,440
or a half moon and what happens is the

739
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,159
water goes up the question mark to the

740
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,558
top

741
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,799
and then no the water comes out of the

742
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,480
bottom and it sprays the top half of the

743
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,319
question mark and as it sprays the top

744
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,319
half of the question mark it makes the

745
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,960
water spread into an umbrella-like

746
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,599
pattern

747
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,000
which gives our plants a nice wet even

748
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,359
consistency on the whole top of the pot

749
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,200
so i'm going to try to explain that

750
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,959
again we've got the bondi pump

751
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,798
then we've got main tubing that runs

752
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,679
across the floor goes to where the

753
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,599
plants are

754
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,960
goes into a loop system i make a big

755
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,119
square then

756
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,120
from that big square i will puncture

757
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,719
holes with the tool that is sold

758
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,000
if you go to the hardware store it'll be

759
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,679
in this department you'll be able to

760
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,679
find the puncture tool

761
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,120
then after you've punctured the holes

762
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,798
they sell little barbs

763
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,798
that go into those punctures they fit

764
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,079
perfectly into that puncture you pop

765
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,279
that little barb in there it's kind of a

766
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,319
pain in the ass your fingers are going

767
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,000
to be sore

768
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,359
then attached to that barb is what i

769
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,119
call spaghetti line

770
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,119
this is the actual emitter line that

771
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,719
runs to the plant then on the other end

772
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,359
of that is the emitter

773
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,159
the water the emitter connects to the

774
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,000
tubing

775
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,919
and then it's got kind of that c it's a

776
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,759
c shape and it sprays out of the bottom

777
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,120
and when it hits the top of the sea it's

778
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,599
got a little cup up there that makes the

779
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,519
water spray back down in a pattern

780
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,519
also on that emitter there are several

781
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,679
different types you can find and buy

782
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,200
a lot of them have a stake that will fit

783
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,880
directly into the pot

784
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,880
it's just a metal barb that you push

785
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,520
right down into the pot i like the metal

786
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,400
stakes

787
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,639
uh just like a just a simple metal like

788
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,720
a

789
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,000
real thin aluminum [ __ ] just a piece

790
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,400
of metal you don't need the

791
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,400
big thick plastic pieces they don't need

792
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,159
to be super strong it's actually easier

793
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,159
and less damage to the plant easier to

794
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,840
get it in if you use that skinny

795
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,280
just [ __ ] little thin shitty piece of

796
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,720
aluminum it looks like it's about the

797
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,599
diameter of a piece of a stick of

798
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,038
incense

799
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,119
you can slide that really easily into

800
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,720
your pot it's a thick uh [ __ ] a thick

801
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,839
paper clip basically

802
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,480
so the emitter sits on that slides down

803
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,000
into the

804
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,960
end of the pot and now it's just held in

805
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
place uh by the soil and by that stick

806
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,240
so the basic you've got your

807
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,839
uh your reservoir with your mondi pump

808
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,038
then you've got your flex tubing that

809
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,038
runs to the plants

810
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,240
then you've got a t to build yourself a

811
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,038
square you're gonna need a t

812
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,798
and four corners you can use pvc pipe

813
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,240
for the big square but i prefer the flex

814
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,400
tubing because you're gonna kick it

815
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,159
you're gonna bump it the pvc will break

816
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,240
the flex tubing is much more durable

817
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,559
much more forgiving

818
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,000
so you've got your tubing on the floor

819
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,359
then you're going to use the puncture

820
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,119
tool to make holes

821
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,639
then you'll stick the barb in there then

822
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,199
you'll run the spaghetti line

823
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,038
to your plant you can put one or two

824
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,880
emitters in your plant depending on

825
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,119
how much water you want to get to that

826
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,320
plant sometimes i'll have plants with

827
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,918
one or two emitters

828
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,839
and then i'll have a big-ass plant right

829
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,278
in the middle with like four emitters

830
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,879
just because i didn't plan well and that

831
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,119
one plant needs more water

832
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,080
so i gotta put more water in there now

833
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,158
that is the very

834
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,000
basics of setting up a watering system

835
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
pump to tubing

836
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,119
to a cube or a square to equalize the

837
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,599
pressure

838
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,918
to your emitters to the plants that is

839
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,759
the basic setup there are many options

840
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,360
for parts and materials for this but

841
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,839
you've got to get what works best for

842
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,558
you

843
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,480
honestly during the pandemic parts and

844
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,839
materials are limited so get what is at

845
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,038
the store

846
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,720
i understand you're going to want to buy

847
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,158
stuff and have it shipped do that if

848
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,038
that's the way to go but try to buy

849
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,559
what's there

850
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,759
so that's it's in your hands you know

851
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,720
what you're working with you see all of

852
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,720
the parts

853
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,480
now once you've got it built and i know

854
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,679
that was a very brief description on how

855
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,720
to build it but i don't know what you're

856
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,120
going to do you're going to have to kind

857
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,519
of

858
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,519
engineer the details to work for your

859
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,879
grow here's what i can talk about though

860
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,440
once you've got it built

861
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,039
you're going to have to test it i said

862
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,759
before it's really easy to auto water

863
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,599
the floor

864
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,200
it's really easy to over auto water it's

865
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,959
really easy to under auto water

866
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,480
so you're gonna have to get this tested

867
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,640
and dial it in

868
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,480
um a good way to do it pay attention

869
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,120
before you even build the auto watering

870
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,440
system

871
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,319
how much water does each plant get and

872
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,759
how often

873
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:11,278
that shouldn't be too hard to figure out

874
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,480
when you're watering your plants today

875
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:13,759
or tomorrow before you build the

876
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,679
watering system

877
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,519
water the plant see how much it takes

878
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,679
just before runoff

879
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,440
maybe fill up a one gallon container

880
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,080
pour half of it in there see if you get

881
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,679
runoff

882
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,599
pour three quarters in there see if you

883
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,960
get runoff pour the whole thing in there

884
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,639
see if you get runoff

885
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,240
see how much of that gallon it takes

886
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,159
until you get some runoff

887
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,359
inside of your pot i'm having a weird

888
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,960
microphone issue thing just started

889
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,719
moving ah there we go that's where it is

890
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,079
all right anyway i'm back on track uh

891
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,240
see how much water it takes to get that

892
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,879
plant to run off document that

893
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,880
then the next thing we need to do is set

894
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,520
up the growth the auto watering system

895
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,039
fill it up with water then you're going

896
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,720
to have to put those emitters

897
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,158
somewhere i'm not sure how you're going

898
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,120
to test this put them all in the plants

899
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,360
if the plants aren't

900
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,199
already soaked get one of the emitters

901
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,359
and put it in your picture

902
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,798
press go on that timer or just plug in

903
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,959
the pump so that the

904
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:04,960
pump starts spitting out the water see

905
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,840
how long it takes to fill up that gallon

906
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,120
of water

907
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,199
that's how long you're gonna want to

908
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,038
leave or however much water if it takes

909
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,400
three gal or three quarters of a gallon

910
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,798
let it fill up to three quarters of a

911
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
gallon time it see how long that takes

912
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,798
that is how long you're going to want to

913
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,359
leave the timer on to water your plants

914
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:21,038
right

915
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,359
if your plants need three quarters of a

916
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,599
gallon you put that emitter in a gallon

917
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,599
of

918
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,119
an empty gallon turn it on and see how

919
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,639
long it takes to fill that up now we

920
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,798
know how long it takes for your emitters

921
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,320
to spit out three quarters of a gallon

922
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,079
go and put an emitter in every single

923
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,918
plant have them all set up and ready to

924
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,798
go have the reservoir mixed up

925
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,480
ph balance the ec is correct uh then

926
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,558
when the plants are thirsty again

927
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,240
i would do it manually the first time i

928
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,480
would go in there and plug in that pump

929
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,798
hit go on the timer and watch maybe it

930
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,720
takes a minute and 42 seconds maybe it

931
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,519
takes two minutes and 17 seconds but

932
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,519
watch it

933
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,759
when the amount of time that you timed

934
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,639
it is up unplug it then go investigate

935
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:58,079
the plants

936
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,400
are they watered enough are they

937
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,879
saturated are all of the plants equally

938
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,320
watered

939
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,320
are you happy with the work now it's

940
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,240
time to make adjustments

941
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,359
do we need to water longer do we need to

942
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,440
water shorter

943
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,199
now the thing to figure out is how long

944
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,278
before my next water

945
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,960
so you know that the plants need three

946
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,759
quarters of a gallon of water

947
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,558
every 72 hours right so you set it up to

948
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,119
water for

949
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,480
two minutes and 17 seconds every 72

950
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,639
hours and they will get the most

951
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,399
consistent most even waterings

952
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,000
those plants have ever had and they will

953
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,239
show you their gratitude

954
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,359
they will start they will start jumping

955
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,359
on that schedule

956
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,558
and you'll go oh the plants need water

957
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,199
and then you'll hear the pump click on

958
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,200
and you'll go

959
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,120
man we're so in sync everybody's right

960
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,759
on rhythm it is a beautiful thing to set

961
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,678
up so

962
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,839
you've got to test it you've got to dial

963
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,798
it in don't build this system and then

964
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,119
leave town

965
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,200
build this system run it for one or two

966
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,038
weeks while you're there watching it

967
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,360
then leave town it's going to need

968
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,158
maintenance if you're feeding big thick

969
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,479
chunky

970
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,159
uh veg bloom powdered nutrients you're

971
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,839
going to need a filter in

972
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,000
your setup at some point so you've got

973
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,918
your pump uh and then you've got

974
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,839
a little bit of flex tube going up they

975
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,520
make a filter that goes in the way that

976
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,278
will catch all of the solids that

977
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,038
haven't been dissolved properly

978
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,480
because those things are going to clog

979
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,158
up your emitters

980
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,839
you're going to need to clean the pump

981
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,399
you will need to clean the filter

982
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,199
you will need to clean the emitters what

983
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:20,959
i would do

984
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,038
when i ran the commercial facility every

985
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,798
couple of days i'd get a

986
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,640
brand new baggie of the emitters or i

987
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,720
would get the freshly cleaned emitters

988
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,399
and walk the room and if i see one

989
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,319
that's not spraying properly

990
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,000
i can unscrew it and screw another one

991
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,519
in while the plants are getting watered

992
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,798
and not mess anything up too badly i

993
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,000
would get wet and make a little spray

994
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,839
but it's a commercial grow

995
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,038
i'm at work that's how it's gonna go so

996
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,879
i just walk the rows

997
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,480
and replace the emitters as i go and i'd

998
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,600
have a bucket full of deads and a bucket

999
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,120
full of freshies

1000
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,158
that bucket full of dead emitters would

1001
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,359
get thrown into a container of h2o2

1002
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,559
and then when somebody's got time

1003
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,199
they'll go through and use a little

1004
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:54,960
pokey

1005
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,558
and poke all the sediment out of all of

1006
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,480
those emitters and then we just keep

1007
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,000
recycling them and recycling until

1008
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,558
eventually they do break when we poke

1009
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,919
them out

1010
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,480
because they get brittle from all the

1011
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,480
use but um maintenance make sure you

1012
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,159
clean the filter make sure you clean

1013
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,919
the pump and make sure you do clean

1014
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,520
those emitters because they will get

1015
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,000
funky over time

1016
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,519
you're going to need to be mindful of

1017
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
the nutrients you feed

1018
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,038
through your auto watering system not

1019
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,798
all things are going to be good

1020
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,440
for your emitters and for your pump i've

1021
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:26,558
noticed that some of the carbo load

1022
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,159
carbonaria will absolutely clog the [ __ ]

1023
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,440
out of those emitters it's gooey it's

1024
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,960
funky it's sticky

1025
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,480
so get that out of there if you're gonna

1026
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,079
run that maybe run a little bit of clean

1027
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,200
water through the lines right after just

1028
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,038
to rinse them out

1029
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,558
also between grows make sure you're

1030
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,558
cleaning all of your new equipment

1031
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,079
you've got a whole new setup of stuff to

1032
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,398
clean out between grows

1033
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,759
flush it out with some clean water maybe

1034
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,278
run a cleaning product through there

1035
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,798
then make sure you clean it out really

1036
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,240
well before you feed the plants with

1037
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:51,599
that system again but it's going to

1038
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,960
require more upkeep

1039
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,199
this is another step that you're going

1040
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,000
to have to clean let me look down at my

1041
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,120
notes because

1042
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,398
i haven't looked at the notes in a long

1043
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,119
time i want to make sure i got all the

1044
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,038
stuff

1045
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,038
barbed emitters lines and emitters a

1046
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,200
timer you're going to need a timer

1047
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,798
the timer is going to be critical learn

1048
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,440
how to set that timer i mentioned it

1049
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:09,519
before

1050
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,558
maybe the plants want two minutes and 17

1051
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,558
seconds worth of water

1052
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,720
every 72 hours you're going to need a

1053
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,440
timer they will do that for you

1054
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,038
or one of those amazon smart plugs maybe

1055
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,159
you've got a camera in the grow room

1056
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,079
this would be ideal

1057
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,000
you've got some sort of a monitor that

1058
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,599
tells you the vpd in the room

1059
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,079
uh maybe a monitor that tells you the

1060
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,359
moisture level of the medium coco soil

1061
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,918
whatever you're working with

1062
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,839
and a camera and an amazon smart plug

1063
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,679
then you can get a notification

1064
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,199
hey you should water you can look at the

1065
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,360
video you can say

1066
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,558
yep it's right it's time to water and

1067
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,839
then you can press a button on your

1068
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,839
amazon smart plug

1069
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,759
and those plants will get their required

1070
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,000
watering and you can watch it all happen

1071
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:50,079
it is such a glorious feeling being away

1072
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,919
from the grow and watching [ __ ] happen i

1073
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:54,960
love watching the commercial grow go

1074
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,600
when nobody is there all right so then

1075
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,120
um make sure that you are adjusting ph

1076
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:00,959
before you leave and make sure that that

1077
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,959
ph is staying where you like it

1078
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,798
uh maybe experiment maybe before you go

1079
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,399
out of town mix up the nutrients

1080
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,240
practice with this a bunch of times but

1081
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:09,759
keep checking the ph and see how it

1082
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,519
swings because maybe

1083
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,599
it'll rise maybe it'll fall while you're

1084
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,240
gone water is going to evaporate

1085
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,000
uh water is going to be used the ph may

1086
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,798
swing you may have to adjust your

1087
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,839
ph a point or two higher or lower than

1088
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:23,759
you normally would

1089
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,439
to compensate for what's going to happen

1090
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,640
over the next week while you're gone

1091
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
that's something people don't think

1092
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,559
about

1093
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,320
um adjust that ph mix up your newts get

1094
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,158
your ph in there your ec

1095
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,319
right keep those nutrients moving have

1096
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,519
that uh that pump down in the bottom of

1097
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,879
the reservoir

1098
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,839
that pump can be attached to the timer

1099
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,000
that triggers the feeding um that will

1100
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,678
start stirring it while it's feeding i

1101
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,200
would rather it be stirring all the time

1102
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,440
but i understand that's another pump

1103
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,038
another plug that's more [ __ ]

1104
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,720
maybe plugging both of the pumps into

1105
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,839
the same timer will be beneficial would

1106
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,600
work better for you

1107
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,359
but still make sure you're stirring your

1108
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,439
stuff

1109
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,678
set your timer give it a couple of test

1110
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,480
runs dial in what needs to be dialed in

1111
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,320
and then

1112
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,759
let it rock and go on vacation with

1113
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,319
confidence and hopefully

1114
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,359
uh nothing goes wrong i've seen maybe i

1115
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,960
shouldn't tell you about the [ __ ] that

1116
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:14,319
i've seen wrong i've seen emitters blow

1117
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,759
clean out of the lines

1118
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:17,200
i've seen the pumps completely come

1119
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,079
undone in the water shoot straight up

1120
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,480
into the air

1121
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:23,199
i've seen the pumps freeze i've driven

1122
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,960
uh 45 minutes in the snow on a holiday

1123
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,798
because i watched the pump freeze up as

1124
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,319
it started and i knew that a whole

1125
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:29,519
section of plants that a commercial grow

1126
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,558
wasn't going to get watered so i had to

1127
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,480
go rescue that

1128
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,480
that's a fun story car broke down in the

1129
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,079
snowstorm during that one

1130
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,759
that's how you know i'm a goddamn girl

1131
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,439

1136
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,038
the home growers i want to thank you

1137
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,960
guys for listening this was a fun

1138
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,200
episode i had a good time doing this one

1139
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,720
i hope i gave you the info which you

1140
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,679
were looking for i know that this was

1141
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,000
kind of vague

1142
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,440
not a lot of super in-depth details but

1143
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,960
you're going to have to build this

1144
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,600
project on your own

1145
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,840
uh pump tubing emitters there are

1146
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:09,759
pre-fabricated

1147
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,519
setups available online maybe you can

1148
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,879
use those as a guide to give you a

1149
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,558
sort of a guideline of what you need to

1150
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,399
do what you do and don't want

1151
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,000
but i hope i gave you the info that you

1152
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,439
need i want to thank you again for

1153
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,038
listening if you've got any questions

1154
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,880
corrections comments or concerns

1155
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,038
you know that my email address is grow

1156
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,919
from your heart at hotmail.com don't be

1157
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:27,440
