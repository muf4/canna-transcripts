cultivation and everything A to Z I've

132
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,479
listened to several different podcasts

133
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,209
on the subject and yours is hands-down

134
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,189
absolutely the cream of the crop thanks

135
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,930
for keeping Monday's constant being from

136
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,879
a misinformed state it makes it a bit

137
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,110
more difficult to learn hands-on with

138
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,659
that being said I'll live vicariously

139

plants alright so st. skinny says to

166
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,449
grow other kinds of plants and he wishes

167
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,879
that someone would have taught him this

168
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:29,560
early on in his grow career he says even

169
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,449
just growing some small peppers or herbs

170
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,189
and containers on your porch can give

171
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,079
you an opportunity to try some things

172
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:36,699
you may not be willing to try on a plant

173
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,159
you're counting on to produce your

174
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:40,750
medicine an example maybe you've been

175
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,070
wanting to try manifold training or

176
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,660
mainlining or some other training

177
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:45,310
technique but you're afraid to break or

178
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,930
kill your plant you can try it with

179
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,089
another plant just remember that not

180
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,230
every plant grows the same way so in

181
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:52,060
most cases you want to stick with

182
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,490
something that grows similarly to

183
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,439
cannabis an example echinacea grows

184
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,300
nothing like cannabis but rosemary lemon

185
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,399
balm and many other plants have the

186
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,500
similar structure and a similar response

187
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,929
to topping not to mention these two

188
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,389
particular plants are also said to have

189
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,220
pest repellent properties they may not

190
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,930
grow or respond exactly like cannabis

191
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,450
would but it's a great place to start

192
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,519
and may end up rewarding your efforts in

193
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,740
the long run so that's a great idea you

194
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,599
guys you don't have to stick to growing

195
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,100
only cannabis a lot of you are already

196
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,020
growing other stuff outdoors in your

197
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,490
outdoor garden but why not just set up a

198
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:26,680
small container garden on your porch

199
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,629
maybe use a small bit of space in the

200
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,459
backyard or you can just do containers

201
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,870
wherever you can set them up wherever

202
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:33,819
you can fit a few containers that

203
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,470
animals like dogs and cats aren't gonna

204
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,110
get to and try to eat your small plants

205
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,960
but

206
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,210
some Tomatoes it looks like he said some

207
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,098
rosemary some lemon balm things like

208
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,359
that any types of herbs or small plants

209
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:46,339
would be fun to grow and you can

210
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,840
experiment with them if you kill a

211
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,489
tomato plant it's not gonna be as

212
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,079
detrimental as if you kill your endure

213
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,908
ganja plant it's not gonna break your

214
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,378
heart as much maybe it will maybe you uh

215
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:56,750
maybe you're that type of person but

216
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:57,650
it's not gonna risk your cannabis garden

217
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,500
and you're gonna be able to take more

218
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:02,299
risks because you're not putting so much

219
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,158
electricity in space and energy and

220
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,598
effort into these outdoor tests or

221
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,098
plants as you are that indoor cannabis

222
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,598
garden where you're feeding it the

223
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:10,699
expensive nutrients and running the

224
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:12,439
expensive lights so don't be afraid to

225
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,538
experiment with some small outdoor

226
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,009
plants that are not cannabis and it will

227
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:17,689
also teach you about growing you'll just

228
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,908
get a better appreciation for growing in

229
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:21,379
general you'll appreciate the art of

230
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:23,449
growing the nature of growing the

231
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:24,949
process the cycle you'll develop you'll

232
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,900
you will develop a better relationship

233
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,449
with nature the plants yourself your

234
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:31,128
cannabis plants the bugs it'll all just

235
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,870
feel better it'll just be more growing

236
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:34,759
and growing feels good it's connecting

237
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,439
to the earth to the nature to what we

238
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,759
should be doing as humans it gets you

239
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,278
away from the computer for a little bit

240
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,259
I gets you away from your social media

241
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:43,939
gets you out of the car it's just a

242
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,379
place to be Zen and it's good for you

243
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,389
it's good for the environment and you're

244
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:49,509
learning something so great idea dude

245
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:53,028
the email also has more he says on

246
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:54,979
another yet related note since the

247
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:56,718
episode about synthetics versus organics

248
00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:58,609
wasn't too long ago which at this point

249
00:07:56,718 --> 00:08:00,829
it was kind of a while ago I apologize I

250
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,569
get a lot of emails he says I thought

251
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:04,939
I'd mention a few products that may make

252
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,098
trying organics easier for some of the

253
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:08,959
people wanting to give it a shot the one

254
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:11,060
I have experience with is a three-part

255
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,038
pre-mixed organic dry nutrient from

256
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,918
roots organics called the uprising line

257
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,348
which consists of uprising Gro uprising

258
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,378
foundation and uprising blue they're

259
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:24,378
each different blends of kelp and other

260
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:26,139
meals green sand rock dust guano's and

261
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,550
all other sorts of funky goodness

262
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:30,079
down to earth also makes mixes that are

263
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,848
similar and cheaper but I haven't tried

264
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,620
any of these myself just because when I

265
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:36,078
was buying amendments the place I was

266
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,820
shopping did not carry them as far as

267
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:39,379
the uprising this spring I planted a

268
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,899
variety of veggies and herbs with the

269
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:44,028
uprising line some castings and pro mix

270
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,429
this was my organics test to see if I

271
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:48,769
would try this mix with my MJ plants I

272
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:49,109
couldn't believe how fast those darn

273
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,909
thing

274
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,800
grew after a couple months I felt

275
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:54,539
comfortable trying it out with one of my

276
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,338
MJ plants and I was impressed with the

277
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,958
results so it sounds like he just gave

278
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,779
us some advice on some products we can

279
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:02,549
buy to grow organically for the folks

280
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,588
that want to go organic because we did

281
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:06,389
an organic episode we talked about how

282
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,220
it could be messy and it could be more

283
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:10,980
work but it looks like this guy's found

284
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,019
three a three part solution that will

285
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,269
make organic growing very easy

286
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,850
he said he mixed it with what did he mix

287
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:20,310
it with some pro mix and some worm

288
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,019
castings using the uprising line so I am

289
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,458
not paid to endorse the uprising line I

290
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,078
don't think st. skinny is paid to

291
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,179
endorse anything either he's simply

292
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:28,769
sharing an experience with us it's

293
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,528
probably an easy line to get a hold of

294
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,509
also uh roots organics is a fairly

295
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:34,889
popular brand and I'm sure that most of

296
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:37,110
your growth stores are going to have the

297
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:39,750
uprising products and if not I'm sure

298
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,850
they're very easy to get so there's more

299
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,860
to the email he says sorry for making it

300
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,079
such a long email I took a double dab of

301
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,759
some bomb-ass critical cush BHO that's

302
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,639
got me all sorts of goofy in the best

303
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,559
possible way keep doing what you do my

304
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,899

305
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,448

00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,940

apologize for such a good email that was

309
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,740
a lot of good advice you gave us

310
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:06,299
recommendation on organic nutrients that

311
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,278
we can use that are probably available

312
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,719
and affordable to most growers and he

313
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,370
also gave us a way that we could

314
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,800
practice growing without ruining our

315
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,459
precious cannabis plants so I appreciate

316
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,490

338
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,689
I've got one more thing I want to talk

339
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,820
about before I started wrapping up this

340
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,080
podcast somebody asked me a question a

341
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,090
few days ago and I'm not gonna get into

342
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,620
the question but I asked them why why do

343
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,810
you want to do that to your plants and

344
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,340
they kind of gave me a short explanation

345
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:25,439
of why they thought they might want to

346
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,000
do it then I had to explain to them why

347
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,500
would they were doing wasn't a good idea

348
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,090
which is that's a perfectly normal

349
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,200
situation you should say hey I'm

350
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,180
thinking about doing something ask

351
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,300
somebody with more experience get some

352
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,349
advice see what's going on and my advice

353
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:39,299
every time you're thinking about doing

354
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,670
something to your cannabis plants think

355
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:44,129
to yourself why am I doing this what is

356
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:45,990
my intention I want to walk in there and

357
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:46,830
do this weird thing to my plant that I

358
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,960
saw on the Internet

359
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,720
why what's your goal what are you going

360
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,830
to do what are you trying to learn

361
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,990
whatever you're gonna do to that plant

362
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,340
today you're not gonna sear it unless

363
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,049
you take scissors to it and cut a piece

364
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,240
off you're gonna see that immediately

365
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,919
and that's irreversible if you [ __ ] up

366
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,509
doing that you're [ __ ] you got to

367
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,339
watch it fix itself and grow up from

368
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:07,230
there most other things

369
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,460
feeding sprays they're gonna take a

370
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,050
little bit of time to show you the

371
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,519
results so if you feed it something

372
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:13,740
weird today you're not gonna see that

373
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,049
for maybe two three maybe five or seven

374
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,549
days if you spray something you might

375
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:19,829
see it immediately you might not see it

376
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:21,089
for two three five seven days you're

377
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,100
gonna have to pay attention so think

378
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,620
about why am i doing what I'm going to

379
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,730
do to my plants if you read something on

380
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,710
the internet and it sounds like a good

381
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,240
idea or if some dude at the gross store

382
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,310
told you some some [ __ ] and it sounds

383
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,549
like a good idea go think long and hard

384
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:36,899
about why go sit in your grow room

385
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:38,969
silently by yourself and stare at the

386
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,769
plants and think why would I want to do

387
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,379
this to my plants now don't be afraid if

388
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:46,860
it's if it makes sense if it's illogical

389
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:48,450
if it's got a future try it out that's

390
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,600
how I became a good grower I took some

391
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,830
risks I read but I also did my own

392
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,389
research and thought long and hard

393
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,240
before I did something to my precious

394
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,860
crop so what Saints Kinney told us

395
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,450
earlier to try some stuff on some other

396
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,980
plants that kind of ties in with what

397
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,020
I'm saying practice on other plants if

398
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,539
you've got the opportunity but still

399
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,340
think about it think about it before you

400
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:09,329
do anything because a lot of things

401
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,220
you're gonna do to your plants are

402
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,560
irreversible and you put a lot of time a

403
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,540
lot of love a lot of energy and a lot of

404
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,619
money into these plants and a lot of you

405
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,089
are doing it illegally

406
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,889
you're risking your [ __ ] life for it

407
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:23,399
so think about it before you ruin stuff

408
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:25,379
but again don't be afraid to get in

409
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,730
there and try something new

410
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,649
so if you're gonna do something weird

411
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,539
you're gonna if you get this weird idea

412
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:33,929
if you and your buddy you're like bro

413
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:35,730
what if we do this slow down if you're

414
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:38,279
already smoking a joint go eat a couple

415
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,690
of burritos chill out for a minute think

416
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,459
the idea through again if you haven't

417
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,170
smoked a joint yet go for a walk and

418
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,879
smoke a joint then go sit down and think

419
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:46,469
the idea through again just think about

420
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,480
what you're doing have a reason for it

421
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,550
have a reason why you're gonna do that

422
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,170
today what's gonna happen in three days

423
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:53,609
from what you did what's gonna happen in

424
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:56,129
five days what's gonna happen in two

425
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,289
weeks how is this gonna affect your grow

426
00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:00,269

trying to do something stupid are you

430
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,810
trying to do something that's gonna

431
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,220
improve the crop think about it from

432
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:10,679
your heart don't think about it from

433
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,149
your wallet think about it logically all

434
