[Music]

31
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,540
it's a Sunday we're hanging out on a

32
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:28,549
Sunday evening it's hot as [ __ ] in

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,550
Colorado today already what's going on

34
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:33,319
it got super warm today and I took a lot

35
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,728
of dabs

36
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:38,609
I've been smoking this Apothecary

37
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:41,478
extract lemon Jeffrey live batter and

38
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:43,739
I'm [ __ ]

39
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:46,618
can we say [ __ ] yes I am [ __ ]

40
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,868
because my my my mental growth has been

41
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:50,039
slowed

42
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:51,478
[ __ ] right now that is true I can

43
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:54,149
use the word appropriately at this point

44
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,739
in time it was delicious you said lemon

45
00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:00,090
candy and that was it exactly it was

46
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:02,728
like the yellow I just brain fart at the

47
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,950
type of candy any lemon candy lemon

48
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:07,170
heads bro lemon heads but not like super

49
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,019
strong it was just that nice it's almost

50
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,670
got a lemon head okay that's what

51
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:16,200
because it doesn't have that harsh yeah

52
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:17,609
it's also got kind of a lemon sorbet

53
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,199
like a ice cream sort of a thing

54
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,540
happened into it a sherbet sort of the

55
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,719
thing goes just a nice sweet lemon candy

56
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:27,179
and not maybe want to do stuff it made

57
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,348
me want to [ __ ] sit in a chair

58
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,349
[Music]

59
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,829
certain products effects certain people

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,090
differently based on our biology it's

61
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:37,320
such a neat thing it's one of my

62
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,549
favorite parts about cannabis is that we

63
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,769
are able to medicate ourselves

64
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:42,840
appropriately goodbye the products we

65
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,450
want my least favorite thing about that

66
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,739
though is the opposite this lemon

67
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:48,569
Jeffrey is not going to be available

68
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,120
forever there was only so much of this

69
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,469
kazoos and I was only able to buy so

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,879
much at this time and I'm sure that the

71
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:54,989
next time I go to this dispensary this

72
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,269
[ __ ] will be gone because I've been

73
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,280
hyping it up on Facebook everybody I've

74
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,230
smoked with smoked it with is driven to

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,080
the dispensary to buy some it's gonna be

76
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:05,939
gone that's frustrating it's uh you see

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,280
it in other industries a little bit like

78
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,780
they'll do a limited run shoe or a limit

79
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,848
album where it's special for whatever

80
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,610
reason but in the cannabis world man

81
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:17,199
beautiful stuff get one off this that's

82
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,310
just regular business how it goes you

83
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,169
show up at the dispensary and you're

84
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,370
like Oh lemon Jeffrey batter let me get

85
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,958
three grams of that and you go home and

86
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,370

87
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,319
gonna stop by there Tuesday after work

88
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,819
and you go Tuesday there's another spot

89
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,049
fill that spot where the lemon Jeffrey

90
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:31,179
is filled with another product you're

91
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,560
like oh where did it go when I was

92
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,840
working the counter if someone said I

93
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,479
really like that I'd always make a point

94
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,239
to be like well we have 12 left just do

95
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,979
you know you're buying one which means

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,719
when you leave the store that will be 11

97
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:45,250
sitting here and you're welcome to come

98
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,689
back and buy as many of those as you'd

99
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,759
like but when they're gone they're gone

100
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:51,519
and when you come back after they're

101
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,019
gone there's a lot of times it's the

102
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,329
damn employees buying up all the good

103
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:56,709
[ __ ] - oh when it comes in you've got to

104
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,599
put it on the shelf so you're the first

105
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,390
one that sees what's amazing and what's

106
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,738
okay yep and then you get you sell it

107
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,059
and then the people come back and buy it

108
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,349
from you again they're like dude I

109
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,360
bought two grams of that I need like

110
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:09,488
seven more grams or give me my limit

111
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,739
that's always my favorite let me get my

112
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,090
limit and that yeah back in the day

113
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,560
there was a dispensary Mike and I would

114
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:21,340
travel up to they had vortex wax uh and

115
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:24,310
this take extra people with us like

116
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,769
here's your 250 yeah you get the limit

117
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,019
in this just say what I say they thought

118
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:30,939
I was dead Durbin poison and vortex like

119
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,168
all the time they consistently had those

120
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:34,029
two strains and I loved him they were

121
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:35,409
delicious and I'm sure they thought I

122
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:37,809
was flipping it but I was buying it and

123
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,430
smoking every bit of it myself no we

124
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,139
were just the first group of people they

125
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,209
ran into that was consuming at that

126
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:46,120
level I was driving it was in Denver and

127
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:47,439
I was driving 125 miles and sometimes

128
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,668
it'd be winter time and it would take me

129
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,469
two and a half hours to get to that

130
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:52,120
dispensary and you can't do that more

131
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,070
than once or twice a month when you're

132
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,810
working and have a life you know I'm

133
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:58,329
back and forth to Denver all the time if

134
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,579
I can cut a trip out or try to double up

135
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:02,469
what I'm doing in Denver for a trip I do

136
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:03,788
yes I used to go in there try to buy my

137
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,610
limit and then eventually they're like

138
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:09,189
seven grams only

139
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,840
so then I took Mike and Kevin then went

140
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:12,098
and got my mom a medical marijuana card

141
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,359
and took her to all the dispensaries

142
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:15,250
with me it's like come on mom you gotta

143
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,379
go help me buy a bunch of hash before

144
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,329
that we were this was before dabs were

145
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:20,529
so readily available now hash is just

146
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:23,889
abundant you can go everywhere and get

147
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:25,478
hash we and how long you think it takes

148
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,639
to get out to Three Rivers it's about 15

149
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:29,709
minutes out that way right rivers is out

150

00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:36,278
more than 20 minutes from it

153
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,499
there are ten dispensaries in Pueblo

154
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:39,879
West the spot I didn't want to choose it

155

00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:03,639
rack here in a couple months it's funny

165
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:07,149
that it has taken place so long to come

166
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,879
along to the shops in town yep since

167
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:11,439
Mike and I actually had we were partners

168
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:12,908
with another guy there was a guy who

169
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,520
didn't really want to be known too much

170
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:17,949
who had a dispensary he hired me as a

171
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,389
manager one day I he said what do I need

172
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:20,379
to do to make this place better and I

173
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,610
looked him straight in the face and I

174
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,439
said the best thing you could do would

175
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,120
just be to go the [ __ ] away he was a

176
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,310
great guy you guys don't get me wrong I

177
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,199
love Tom and he's a good dude he is not

178
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,908
somebody you need running a business you

179
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,459
need Tom outside of the business growing

180
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:36,218
weed but that it that there were so many

181
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,629
moving parts to that because like he

182
00:06:36,218 --> 00:06:39,218
wanted to go live his dream on the

183
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,439
mountaintop and what he did that it

184
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:42,968
became perfection he's just a good old

185
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,499
southern boy and when they got hot in

186
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:46,449
the building he would prop the back door

187
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:47,800
open of the dispensary we've got two

188
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,139
security guards up front with guns

189
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,240
checking IDs we've got security between

190
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,649
myself in the front door but the back

191
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,569
doors propped wide open with a brick and

192
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:58,389
I'm like Tom this this defeats all of

193
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:00,039
our purpose here or walks over the walk

194
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,439
through the bedroom pull it turn it on

195
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,149
overhead fans

196
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,860
he goes through it turns on three fans

197
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:07,209
we got to tell the lobby all right you

198
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,870
guys gotta hold up for seven minutes

199
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:12,639
while these fans slow down

200
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,889
work our scales again but we had that

201
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,838
shop that was about ten years ago now if

202
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:19,389
you think about it it wasn't quite that

203
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:22,598
far back but nine eight or nine I think

204
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:25,149
we're it's seven now okay damn it feels

205
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,459
like a lot longer because we've got kids

206
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:31,060
well it's only been seven years but

207
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:34,990
that's like 35,000 pots

208
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,120
how many harvests is that so much Mike

209
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,720
and I had that building running like a

210
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,730
fine-tuned machine that was a super

211
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,130
machine we were making a lot of money in

212
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,900
that dispensary and they came to shut us

213
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,399
down and now they finally have figured

214
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,659
out how to do the rules they showed us

215
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,638
no because they weren't properly zoned

216
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,790
and hadn't made rules for us yet it was

217
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,930
the only reason they could give us they

218
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,970
that shop got shut down officially

219
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,800
because we were violating zoning rules

220
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,960
that they would officially pass like two

221
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,449
months later you guys we're super super

222

the level of misinformation is is

279
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,720
greater than ever and it seems like

280
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,139
people's willingness to double-check

281
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,060
[ __ ] is lower than ever yes we have so

282
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,559
many opportunities to check [ __ ] we

293
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,490

295
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,870
cousin told me

296
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,269
it's what my advisers told me anyway

297
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,590
it's true big like true huge it's it's

298
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,769
what I heard it's what people are

299
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,210
talking about it it's what I

300
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,460
it's absolutely nuts just take two

301
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,830
seconds in and google it I got now an

302
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,500
argument one day over does America have

303
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,930
a national language

304
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,539
now I don't want to rehash any of that

305
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:57,129
mess and or but I mean it's a Google

306
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:59,199
thing like this is just something that

307
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:02,980
you can check there doesn't need to be a

308
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,870
debate you just check it just people

309
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,550
just don't like taking that extra Siri

310
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,049
will tell you you don't even have to

311
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:10,599
know how to type now you can hold down a

312
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:12,699
button and say all of your questions

313
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,040
into a device and either a lesson or

314
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,680
Siri will tell you yeah you don't even

315
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,240
have to think anymore um but for some

316
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,709
reason people just hate doing that even

317
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,870
there when they're real passionate about

318
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,980
stuff

319
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,990
basically the reason pueblos for

320
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,300
sensible cannabis laws exists is because

321
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,389
there's a group down here that's anti

322
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:34,139
cannabis everything and they were

323
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:35,980
getting a lot of press and

324
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,629
kind of making a little name for

325
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,769
themselves a couple years ago and I was

326
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:43,779
like well why don't I start a troll page

327
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,549
and so they're plepler for positive

328
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:48,549
impact so I started pueblos for sensible

329
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:50,379
cannabis laws it just started debunking

330
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:51,819
there they would put up a post and I

331
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:55,139
would just go through it line by line

332
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,149
and explain why that was total [ __ ] and

333
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,490
then take the two minutes it takes to

334
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:03,389
Google and pull the actual information

335
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,000
down my favorite part is the way that

336
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,379
they reply to you

337
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,700
they block Mike that's all the [ __ ]

338
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:10,500
can do they just block him every time

339
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,060
and if anybody supports Mike that person

340
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,740
gets blocked too and right when I

341
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,379
started doing this somebody told them

342
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,180
that if they share my post more people

343
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:22,049
like my page will be seen by more people

344
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:24,329
and so they screenshot instead it's

345
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:26,669
somewhere there's an anti pot kook with

346
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,149
like thousands of screenshots of

347
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:31,528
everything that I posted this page good

348
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:33,929
but that's kind of where that Facebook

349
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:35,519
page started in one of the things that

350
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:38,370
you'll notice if you try to check out

351
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,028
any anti cannabis stuff online is their

352
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,500
total inability to give

353
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:45,389
they'll cite a study they'll say so you

354
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,009
know a new study said this but they

355
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,720
won't tell you which new study or who

356
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:51,240
conducted it or where it was published

357
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,550
because even when they're citing an

358
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,769
actual number

359
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:59,338
it typically doesn't mean what they're

360
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:00,870
saying it means I mean even nationally

361
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,820
it's I can't it was did they get in

362
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,379
trouble for a campaign that they

363
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,350
couldn't support their facts that they

364
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:09,570
were posting they did get they didn't

365
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,310
necessarily get in trouble but they they

366
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:15,450
created a lot of really I

367
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:18,769
mean I honestly think it helped more

368
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:21,959
than it hurt they blanketed this city in

369
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:25,259
big mailers leading up to the election

370
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:28,189
every day you would get a new anti pot

371
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:30,778
nonsense mailer with your junk mail and

372
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,690
the closer we got to the election the

373
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:36,059
more insane the the argument became and

374
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,010
so even people that were like wow did

375
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:39,838
you read this honey this is you know

376
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:41,309
maybe we should be thanked this

377
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,930
ninety-nine attend pot growers eat

378
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:45,059
babies for breakfast yeah but by the

379
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:47,159
time the election showed up people were

380
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:49,078
even when they were started out on the

381
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,509
anti pot side they were sick of getting

382
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,429
these in their mail every day and the

383
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:56,759
people that were reading them were

384
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:58,199
finding just I mean even a quick glance

385
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,419
at him by the end it was like this is

386
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,459
clearly ludicrous like nine out of ten

387
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,838
doctors aren't out advocating against

388
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,758
legalization like we would have noticed

389
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,139
that there's a lot of doctors like that

390
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,250
seems like a parade amount worth of yeah

391
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,230
there was a women's March and it was on

392
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,730
TV we saw it right yeah that [ __ ] didn't

393
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,159
happen when a whole bunch of people are

394
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,690
pissed about something

395
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,309
people tend to notice we've kind of

396
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,050
given them too much publicity so [ __ ]

397
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:25,689
that group check out Mike's group yep

398
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:27,429
and so that's what I mean that page is

399
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,230
all about and just double check your

400
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,689
stuff people this it's more important

401
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,720
now than ever that the cannabis

402
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,759
community get on the ball and not I mean

403
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,949
I get it most people don't have an extra

404
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,600
20 minutes a day to be like oh okay I'm

405
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:43,508
gonna double check that figure out what

406
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,509
what exactly is going on here and then

407
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:48,009
post the actual information online so I

408
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:49,568
do all that work for you you just have

409
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:51,250
to come read it and share it there you

410
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:52,838
go and share it that's all you gonna do

411
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,919
when you get information from Mike share

412
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,839
it click share clicking share is the way

413
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,088
you counter bad information is by

414
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,100
spreading good information yeah like

415
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,199
that's the truth what we do the show is

416
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,300
just good grow information so that more

417
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,799
people grow better weed some people just

418
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:10,359
don't want to know the truth they don't

419
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,708
want to be walk wrong they've said

420
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,940
something and they don't want to change

421
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,948
their opinion even after they're

422
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,260
educated some people you just can't fix

423
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:18,909
but that's just some people so my big

424
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:21,578
laugh of the week did you catch the

425
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:23,828
story about the federal study marijuana

426
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:25,568
how shitty it is oh it's got mold in it

427
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:27,429
and [ __ ] I glanced over that one

428
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:29,259
basically what they're doing is taking

429
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,578
the plant growing it out and there's

430
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:32,409
stuff and the whole [ __ ] thing at a

431
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:35,739
woodchip or freeze drying it and calling

432
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:37,350
it study product it's just what the [ __ ]

433
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,089
it's just

434
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,159
what so what do you think the government

435
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,260
would pay a master grower to come read

436
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,000
and I didn't mean to just call myself a

437
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,620
master I know the title in the industry

438
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
that's why this was the laughs of the

439
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,789
week cuz cuz when I saw that article I

440
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,528
chuckling I was like they need to be

441
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:56,110
listening to the show yeah come on down

442
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:57,879
listen I want to go apply for the job

443
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,379
I'd go work at that [ __ ] farm in

444
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,669
Mississippi and grow the dankest buds

445
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:02,350

449
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:14,559

450
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,659
out there's intense and if you watch

451
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,419
some of the Sanjay Gupta footage from

452
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:20,240
his weed special where they go out and

453
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:23,879
film at the farm

454
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,500
they've got all the parts yeah they just

455
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,730
don't have a pot grower there's just

456
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,190
yeah they don't have a pot growers

457
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,840
they've got a researcher and who knows

458
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,970
what kind of genetics they've got - oh

459
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,680
they got some Mexican bang seed that is

460
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,420
just a herm and they don't know what the

461
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,639
[ __ ] they're doing at all no they don't

462
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,699
know they know phenotype selection no

463
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,549
fee no hunting nope man they really

464
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,290
don't know what's going on and it it

465
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:48,689
honest-to-god looks like they're taking

466
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:50,219
the plant they might be drying it before

467
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,410
it goes into the wood chipper but it's

468
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,310
going through a wood chipper shredded

469
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:58,500
stock seed materials honest material no

470
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:00,719
joke honest at the end of every two or

471
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,460
three days I run a wood chipper at the

472
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,740
big grow to get rid of all the sticks

473
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,450
and stalks and dead leaves and it just

474
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,519
turns it into [ __ ] there's nothing there

475
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,709
that could be tested or useful at the

476
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,139
end of all that what the hell there you

477
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:15,350
had the freeze drying it and then drying

478
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,350
it

479
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,769
yeah

480
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,269
we make live resin I'm not sure exactly

481
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:23,269
what happens when you freeze dry it

482
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:28,139
yeah I don't do that to my cannabis

483
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,940
please no but the stuff coming out of

484

spend I mean half a week in front of a

628
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,210

678
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:17,829

680
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:22,569

683
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,480
business all day long but

684
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:32,259
sometimes it's hard to have your friends

685
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,000
do work for you because when they [ __ ]

it up you can't like not pay them cuz

687
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,058
they're your friends and you don't want

688
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:39,220
to [ __ ] up your friendship so I I've

689
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:41,710
chosen to just go to large businesses

691

came over because we wanted to talk

761
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,759
about some rules and some laws that are

762
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:11,500
happening in Colorado there are new

763
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:16,089
proposed laws its SB 1220 that is the

764
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:19,569
trying to limit the planet count to 16

765
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:21,720
plants per household unless you were in

766
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:24,849
an agricultural area

767
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,500
zone a glance special so if you're at

768
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:28,808
anything that's zoned residential which

769
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,089
is the majority of housing in Colorado

770
00:27:28,808 --> 00:27:32,109
period

771
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:33,970
so if you're a medical marijuana patient

772
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:36,879
and you've got a plant count for 24

773
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:38,980
count for 24 plants doesn't matter 18

774
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,620
plants doesn't matter 18 that's it

775
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,990
that's all you can have sorry 16 is

776
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:46,989
denied it's 16 is the new proposed

777
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,308
statewide limit in this bill already

778
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,349
made it through that the House of

779
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:53,769
Representatives in Colorado it started

780
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:56,529
out as a 12 plant limit I'm after like

781
00:27:53,769 --> 00:28:00,548
nine and a half hours of testimony they

782
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:02,859
upped it to 16 and dropped the penalties

783
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:04,259
for breaking these rules from felony to

784
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:08,288
misdemeanor

785
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:10,029
and then the bill made it through

786
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:12,640
another committee it is now sitting in

787
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:14,470
front of the Colorado Senate so it could

788
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,730
get changed some more in the Senate

789
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:20,529
before it heads to the governor and the

790
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,169
governor is excited he wants this little

791
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:26,558
bit bad right Wow he's a beer guy right

792
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:30,759
that's not the only reason

793
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:32,308
extended plant counts became the

794
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:36,339
scapegoat

795
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:37,869
for marijuana regulation about I'm gonna

796
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,069
interrupt you just a little bit here but

797
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:40,839
I apologize for it I just want to

798
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:42,788
explain everybody what an extended plant

799
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:45,009
count is okay in the state of Colorado

800
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:46,779
we are allowed to grow six plants as an

801
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:48,009
adult as an adult 21 or over you're

802
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:50,019
allowed to grow six plants of

803
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:52,720
recreational cannabis if you get a

804
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:54,279
medical marijuana card the original rule

805
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,038
was that you were allowed to grow six

806
00:28:54,279 --> 00:29:00,009
plants this was the default limit is six

807
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:02,169
plants right if you have a debilitating

808
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:04,450
condition that the doctor feels you

809
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:06,100
require more cannabis or your delivery

810
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,900
system requires more cannabis to treat

811
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:09,548
the conditions you were treating for

812
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,960
they can write you what's called an

813
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,519
extended plant count which would it

814
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,990
allow you to grow more plants to produce

815
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,389
the amount of medicine that you need to

816
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,700
take care of yourself that's an extended

817
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,860
plant count these extended plant counts

818
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,470
are now being scrutinized and they're

819
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:25,990
being kind of vetoed by other well

820
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:28,210
there's a whole lot of history and other

821
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:30,759
rules and stuff going on that kind of

822
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:34,210
led to the practice but in Colorado

823
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:37,000
extended plant counts basically 99 was

824
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,410
that the biggest card that that

825
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,690
anybody's written in the last several

826
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,308
years before that there were a couple of

827
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,870
doctors that were doing five hundred

828
00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:44,940
holy [ __ ]

829
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:47,558
and

830
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,680
for the most I mean the the numbers of

831
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:53,139
people with cards that are over twenty

832
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,330
four was I mean it was like twenty five

833
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,070
people across the state tiny amount of

834
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:58,299
people my number has dwindled down and

835
00:29:57,069 --> 00:30:00,009
I've got a good relationship with my

836
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:01,750
doctor back in the day I could walk in

837
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:03,460
and get a good number and now my number

838
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:07,960
is not as impressive as it used to be

839
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:11,500
the two two years before this last visit

840
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,640
my my to visit or so the last visit and

841
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,940
then the one before that the one before

842
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,830
that their earliest - when I walked in

843
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,558
he was like you want your normal count

844
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:23,889
yep gave me the extended plant count I

845
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:25,928
had before didn't bat an eyelash right

846
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:28,570
not an issue his dogs farted in the

847
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:29,860
office a couple times yep but anybody

848
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:31,450
that's gone to that doctor knows who I'm

849
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:32,558
talking about - oh my god half the

850
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,910
people in Pueblo and Springs have been

851
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:35,259
to this doctor he brings his [ __ ]

852
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,870
dogs and they fart in the office and it

853
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:40,929
smells like death yes most definitely

854
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:42,099
but I mean it wasn't a news just like

855
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:43,929
here's your extended plant count how

856
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:47,169
does a nice life I'm I'll see you in a

857
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:49,509
year unless you have an issue before you

858
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,940
know your cards are right when I went in

859
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:54,039
this last time it was I do six card six

860
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,600
count cards period yeah and of

861
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:59,349
conversation they're they're paranoid

862
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:02,319
now I want to lose their licenses like

863
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:03,909
the reason they're doing this is like I

864
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,710
was starting to say extended plant

865
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:09,279
counts and caregivers became the

866
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:11,519
scapegoat a couple years back when cops

867
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,049
started showing up to

868
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,869
grows where it was just like a an

869
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:18,720
outside horse fenced area with 50 plants

870
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:21,219
in the backyard and

871
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,220
from time to time they would show up to

872
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:27,069
one that was real egregious with

873
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:31,120
paperwork that had paperwork saying that

874
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:32,980
the the overall plant count is legal and

875
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,839
the cops started going to the press

876
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,839
saying you know we're running into car

877
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:41,689
ELLs who are using the extended plant

878
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:44,720
count and caregiver rules in Colorado is

879
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:47,210
cover to produce huge amounts of illegal

880
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,509
marijuana and then they would point to

881
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:52,370
busts of cartel home grows where they

882
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,950
had two thousand three thousand five

883
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:57,019
thousand plants

884
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:59,480
it's the one has nothing to do with the

885
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:01,190
other right the illegal growers are

886
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,819
illegal growers they've always been

887
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:06,830
illegal growers that's how like forty to

888
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:09,109
sixty percent of a sixty billion dollar

889
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:10,509
national market gets produced in

890
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:12,829
basements and

891
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:16,278
they were attempting to blame all of

892
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:19,898
that on our caregivers and because of

893
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:22,880
the Chris Berkowitz story

894
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:24,369
several years ago caregivers do not do

895
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,929
interviews I

896
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:29,629
not so much the last six months or so

897
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:31,278
but for the last several years I would

898
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,990
get a couple of calls a month from

899
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,808
reporters every time the new caregiver

900
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,130
bill would go through the legislature

901
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:38,869
trying to give me to set him up with a

902
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,490
caregiver who's your caregiver we know

903
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:42,709
you've got a caregiver we know you know

904
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,319
caregivers please put us into contact

905
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,298
with these people and the answer was no

906
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,129
like I'd reach out to care everybody I

907
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,288
know that's a caregiver that reporter

908
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,760
asked we developed a relationship with

909
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:54,440
that reporter and she would call me

910
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:56,089
first and say hey will you be on camera

911
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,558
and I would say nope and then she would

912
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:59,319
call you and be like have your caregiver

913
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,609
come and I'd be like

914
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,829
thanks my good cover buddy thank you

915
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:04,969
good work

916
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:07,668
caregivers don't do interviews because

917
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,710
when caregivers do interviews the the

918
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:12,288
local law enforcement wherever they live

919
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,569
shows up and gives them how because the

920
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:17,058
interviewer only wants to know about how

921
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:19,009
much you can produce and how you're able

922
00:33:17,058 --> 00:33:21,168
to survive and make a living if you

923
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:22,119
clearly spending 50 hours a week doing

924
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:25,130
that

925
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:26,689
and the cops take one look at that know

926
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,270
like we should rate him he's clearly

927
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,190
illegal and they show up they make your

928
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:32,750
life how they trash the place and even

929
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,880
if you're lucky and you've got all your

930
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,890
paperwork

931
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,830
your whole situation still destroyed

932
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,320
right yeah in minimum you've got a huge

933
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:45,139
legal hassle a couple of days

934
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,909
some clean [ __ ] and then several days

935
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,220
cleaning up the mess they made turn your

936
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:51,400
[ __ ] apart and they shot your dog right

937
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,720
and your dog's been shot so

938
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:57,220
caregivers just don't do interviews and

939
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:00,309
part part of that has led to

940
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:04,009
very few people stand up

941
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:05,319
and say I'm a caregiver if you pass this

942
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:08,449
new rule you're proposing

943
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:10,969
three of my patients are going to die

944
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:12,889
right and for a lot of caregivers that's

945
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:15,069
the situation they're treating someone

946
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:18,619
with cancer or epilepsy

947
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:21,039
and if they're no longer able to do what

948
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:24,069
they've been doing legally for years

949
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:26,509
their patients are screwed

950
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,919
the the rules that they're proposing

951
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:33,260
will end caregiving period in Colorado

952
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:36,469
with 16 plants only half in bloom at one

953
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:39,500
time is it enough to provide for more

954
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:41,000
than one or two people period barely

955
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,619
enough to provide for one person if

956
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,960
you're talking about oils and things of

957
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:46,849
that nature right like Doug wouldn't

958
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,039
survive on these numbers no I would have

959
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:50,869
to it would be I'll have to decide whose

960
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,239
caregiver I would want to be if I even

961
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:55,159
chose to continue you could you could

962
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,199
probably take care of Doug if you

963
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,929
dropped everyone else including yourself

964
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,089
yeah yeah I would be able to I would be

965
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:04,759
able to grow for myself and Doug would

966
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:07,850
be about it I don't think you'd be able

967
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:11,150
to cover ball see you I know I know I

968
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:13,250
could because I know how to produce

969
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,500
weight with small numbers in small

970
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,940
spaces but the average person is gonna

971
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,130
struggle doing it well see and that's

972
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,710
where that's part of the art the the

973
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,210
argument that gets lost in a lot of the

974
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:27,179
testimony is

975
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:30,150
when you hear okay there's a caregiver

976
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:32,788
living in a residential house with a 99

977
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:36,510
plant count and that's their six

978
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:38,099
patients combined add up to 99 or their

979
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:42,528
five patients of themselves sorry

980
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:46,289
combined add up to 99 people picture 99

981
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:48,119
Volkswagen bus size price right in full

982
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:50,250
harvest and what they don't realize is

983
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:53,910
that immediately off the top you cut

984
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:58,019
that 99 in half and so now you've got 44

985
00:35:53,909 --> 00:36:00,679
in bloom 45 in veg or 45 and one and 44

986
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:00,679
in the other and

987
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:05,548
I'm sorry 55 yeah I was gonna let you

988
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,260
guys take a drink so I just let it slide

989
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:09,150
so you keep a light did something weird

990
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,809
on the panel like I'm not crazy you

991
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:14,369
think it went usually it lights up two

992
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:16,798
dots when I'm talking and it went up to

993
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:18,059
like five and so my brain did the stoner

994
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:20,579
thing that was like did you do something

995
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:22,890
weird I kind of lost my train of thought

996
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:26,160
while I was trying to do math plus

997
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:27,960
little Jeffery jabs you cut your plant

998
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,699
count in half is all you're allowed to

999
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,710
flower out and then if you're a

1000
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:34,318
caregiver caring for five people and

1001
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,909
yourself those five people's conditions

1002
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:38,730
are gonna require different strains

1003
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:41,608
right which require different mother

1004
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:44,490
plants and all of a sudden you're in a

1005
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:47,548
situation where you're harvesting nine

1006
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:50,939
plants at a time seven plants at a time

1007
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:53,460
maybe twelve well think about this one

1008
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,829
way that medical users produce quick

1009
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,519
amounts of medicine is to put a four by

1010
00:36:55,829 --> 00:37:01,380
four tray with 64 rockwool cubes and a

1011
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,588
tiny tiny plant and veg it for like two

1012
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,990
weeks and flip it flower for 60 days and

1013
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:09,119
then each one of those produces five to

1014
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:10,679
ten grams that's not a lot that's

1015
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,260
approximately a pound of weed as your

1016
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:15,899
goal there

1017
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:18,089
as far as Bryan but you've got to do 64

1018
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,950
plants to make that even a viable option

1019
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:21,900
and you're not gonna pull as much weight

1020
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:24,989
as an experienced grower is gonna do

1021
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:27,599
like I could pull two pounds with four

1022
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:29,909
plants under one line if I do it my

1023
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,220
method it's just all about how your

1024
00:37:29,909 --> 00:37:33,989
timing works out and it just sucks if

1025
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:35,159
people that are doing this like a small

1026
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:36,750
hydro center we're gonna have to change

1027
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:38,279
everything because of but a bunch of

1028
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,929
stupid [ __ ] rules when when you

1029
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,100
listen to the testimony of the people

1030
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:45,119
that are really in support of this bill

1031
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:46,829
they say things like every plant equals

1032
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,880
a pound of marijuana

1033
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:52,190
I wish or two or three I wish and it's

1034
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,050
like well

1035
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,610
maybe outdoors like if you did some

1036
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,740
stuff and had some talent and a couple

1037
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:02,610
other things but like five of those are

1038
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:04,889
illegal if so you're looking at a couple

1039
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:08,640
ounces for like a really nice big plant

1040
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:10,799
indoors not a couple pounds right and so

1041
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,940
the whole conversation that's taking

1042
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:17,580
place at the state level here is twisted

1043
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:19,200
you can hop online and people like it's

1044
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:22,139
this is legislation that's taking place

1045
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:25,379
it's broadcast it's recorded it's posted

1046
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:28,049
you can listen to the testimony

1047
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,849
I mean it's disturbing there's during

1048
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,880
this bill when it was in its first

1049
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:35,369
hearing a little girl girl and her

1050
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,740
father testify it's kind of cute before

1051
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:40,109
when the committee's like whoever wants

1052
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:41,819
to go first the dad's like please let my

1053
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,309
daughter go first and then judge her

1054
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:47,700
independently from me because like I'm

1055
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:49,230
military and I'm can be harsh and I

1056
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:51,079
don't want you to misjudge my daughter

1057
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,369
because I'm a douche

1058
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,759
but the the wrap-up of the doctor's

1059
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:58,559
testimony is this rule forces my family

1060
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,890
to choose between who lives me or my

1061
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,809
debt and like I'm a dad and so that hit

1062
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:07,109
me like right in the gut like oh and

1063
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:09,599
then like two minutes later while the

1064
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:12,720
dads testifying one of the committee

1065
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:16,019
members is like wait a second you guys

1066
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,909
live on AG land and he's like yeah you

1067
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:19,230
know we're we're here to testify that

1068
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:21,809
there are a lot of people in Colorado

1069
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:23,219
like us that this is gonna harm and the

1070
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:25,559
committee member goes but it won't harm

1071
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:27,629
you too so we don't really have to

1072
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:28,889
choose which one of you dies like that's

1073
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,960
not really a choice you guys are gonna

1074
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:33,569
have to make like other families sure

1075
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,159
but not you too personally and when the

1076
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:37,350
dads like no you know we live on

1077
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:40,139
agricultural land where homesteaders we

1078
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:41,489
do our own meat veggies we grow and

1079
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:42,629
produce everything ourselves I just

1080
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:44,459
didn't give a [ __ ] about him at that

1081
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,380
point it was like now we can ignore

1082
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,510
everything you two have said oh you know

1083
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,380
different zip code than me [ __ ] you yep

1084
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,720
because yeah because that's it exactly

1085
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:56,140
you'd the land you happen to reside on

1086
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:58,539
is zoned agricultural and so these rules

1087
00:39:56,139 --> 00:40:01,420
won't necessarily affect you until you

1088
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:04,619
try to move so since we are allowed to

1089
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:07,180
grow six plants as a recreational smoker

1090
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:09,099
and how much is a recreational smoker

1091
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:10,960
allowed to possess cannabis wise I do

1092
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:12,670
not know that room we'll see that's the

1093
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,460
thing there's this weird open-ended

1094
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,349
loophole where

1095
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,869
recreational wise you're allowed to keep

1096
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:21,880
your whole harvest one of the questions

1097
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:23,349
we left with Maui yeah okay is what you

1098
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,789
can do with the eggs if I get pulled

1099
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:27,130
over how much can I have in my car a

1100
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:28,869
mouse okay just if you're right honest

1101
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,490
and not to even taunt anybody you guys

1102
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:31,869
if you get caught with weed in Colorado

1103
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:34,209
and you don't have like a [ __ ] pound

1104
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:35,769
exposed you can have your weed like

1105
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:38,320
whatever you've got they don't they

1106
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:40,150
don't care like you just don't be a

1107
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,990
[ __ ] about you have to be doing the

1108
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:45,309
like crack your window to DUI checkpoint

1109
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:48,159
constitutional I'm gonna ruin this cops

1110
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:50,469
45 minutes kind of thing or like the

1111
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,940
eyes are glazed have you been eating

1112
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:53,980
doughnuts like you have to be really

1113
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,650
[ __ ] stupid for the cop to care about

1114
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:59,980
your two and a half bags of weed I had a

1115
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:01,420
cop walk up to my car and I I am good at

1116
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,650
getting pulled over we've done an

1117
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,380
episode about how to get pulled over

1118
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:07,630
properly I brawl down my window all the

1119
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,829
way before that copper anywhere near my

1120
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,500
car and had both hands up on the

1121
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:13,329
steering wheel and he was probably 15

1122
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,170
feet away from me and he goes so do you

1123
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:19,150
have any marijuana in there

1124
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:21,099
yes probably I didn't know for sure but

1125
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,660
I was like yeah probably cuz I probably

1126
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:24,460
I had my personal bag of weed in there

1127
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:26,049
you know I work at it grow like that's

1128
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,880
right right into your states there's

1129
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,300
enough marijuana ground into the carpet

1130
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,099
in my floor the

1131
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,539
answer was what smells pretty strong in

1132
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:36,549
there and and then I just grabbed my

1133
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:38,110
badge had my marijuana Enforcement

1134
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,970
Division badge attached to my shirt and

1135
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:42,280
I just go uh sir I work in a grow and I

1136
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:44,230

1137
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,580
relaxed he goes oh my daughter works in

1138
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,260

1139
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:49,119
not I was going ninety two he clocked me

1140
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,440
at ninety two and a 75 and didn't give

1141
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,329
me a ticket because I told him I had

1142
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,639
weed in the car no when you start off

1143
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:57,309
friendly and honest that the interaction

1144
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:59,259
goes a different way completely and in

1145
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:02,210
Colorado like that oh my god I've got

1146
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:06,130
weed on me now that none of that needs

1147
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:09,920
to happens for a couple of seconds it's

1148
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:11,599
I'm from that school when I have more

1149
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,400
weed than I care to admit that was in

1150
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,480
the car and I shouldn't have and I've

1151
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,720
been pulled over and gotten away with

1152
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,159
that I used to see the red and blues hit

1153
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:20,569
the turn signal to let him know that I

1154
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:25,029
was gonna stop as soon as it was safe

1155
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:25,030
and then do the inventory yeah

1156
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:30,260

1207
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,550
they didn't care they just pulled him

1208
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,710
over down here and Pueblo it's a little

1209
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:11,660
like

1210
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,889
Patrol him no they just pulled him over

1211
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:13,879
because one of his brake lights was out

1212
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:15,710
and they just it was 6:00 in the morning

1213
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,820
we're on our way to work early in the

1214
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,170
morning and they just pulled him over to

1215
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,000
him hey you got a brake light out you

1216
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:22,789
know I used to get hassled a bunch when

1217
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,039
I was a teenager further north but not

1218
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:26,360
since I moved here yeah oh you could

1219
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,480
kind of do whatever you want this town

1220
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,220
yep a lot of what you want a lot of it

1221
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,110
yeah

1222
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:34,639
let's talk a little bit about 45-minutes

1223
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,890
let's talk a little bit about the city

1224
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,109
of Chania Pueblo there's one tiny little

1225
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:40,519
caveat to these state rules they don't

1226
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:42,860
want to add I mean let's hear it they

1227
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:44,980
built in a loophole to kind of make it's

1228
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:47,450
mildly more palatable

1229
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:50,050
it's [ __ ] not going to win a second

1230
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:52,609
but the little loophole they built in is

1231
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:56,870
several cities and counties have already

1232
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:59,769
passed homegrown limits and so if a home

1233
00:44:56,869 --> 00:45:02,329
if an area has already passed a limit I

1234
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:04,639
can't remember if the state bill says it

1235
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:07,279
automatically supersedes or that area is

1236
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,349
allowed to decide if it wants to have

1237
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,390
their previous rules supersede the state

1238
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:15,889
rule

1239
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:19,089
and so your area if it wants to can pass

1240
00:45:15,889 --> 00:45:23,599
a much higher plant count limit

1241
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:25,190
or which is much more likely like Denver

1242
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,500
and several other places have already

1243
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:29,990
done they've already passed a 12 plant

1244
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,900
limit and they want to keep it even

1245
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:34,849
though the state limits gonna be 18 and

1246
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,820
so there's that one little kind of

1247
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:41,650
loophole spot but there's I guarantee no

1248
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:45,590
area in Colorado is gonna go after that

1249
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:47,329
it would make you to I mean it's just to

1250
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:50,300
be the only county in Colorado that

1251
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:51,769
allows 40 right everybody everybody will

1252
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,380
move their slop you'll pack up the day

1253
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:57,619
they say that immediate right now if you

1254
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:00,740
if I five if I owned a Glenn in Colorado

1255
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:03,559
I'd be all over Craigslist right now so

1256
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:07,909
I think that everybody lives in Colorado

1257
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:10,400
that is over 21 if you have got 5 by 5

1258
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:13,549
square extra feet in your house and your

1259
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,769
life in your backyard wherever grow six

1260
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:18,320
plants of cannabis do the best you can

1261
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:21,019
grow six plants get six loans from

1262
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,600
somebody from a dispensary get some

1263
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:25,969
seeds grow that [ __ ] everybody even if

1264
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,900
you do not consume cannabis even if you

1265
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:29,639
don't care about Animus there is a

1266
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,139
medical marijuana patient out there that

1267
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:33,179
is about to get [ __ ] out of their

1268
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:35,009
caregiver it's not gonna have plants to

1269
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:37,048
grow they're grown for them a caregivers

1270
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:39,690

1271
00:46:37,048 --> 00:46:41,579
to their patient that their and their

1272
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,139
patient relies on them and trust them I

1273
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:44,940
know that when Mike gets cannabis from

1274
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:46,348
his caregiver he knows it wasn't sprayed

1275
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,548
with anything funky it wasn't fed

1276
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:49,890
anything funky it was trimmed properly

1277
00:46:47,548 --> 00:46:51,268
it's not moldy anything that may have

1278

away it was not passed off as usable

1280
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:56,758
product those people are going to not be

1281
00:46:55,108 --> 00:46:59,219
allowed to help the people that need the

1282
00:46:56,759 --> 00:47:02,159

1288
00:47:10,409 --> 00:47:14,818
it'll make you slow the [ __ ] down it's a

1289
00:47:12,778 --> 00:47:17,000
super reactive plant it's not like

1290
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:19,440
having a pet hamster like

1291
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,329
it's giving you something fun and new

1292
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,309
every day and then you get to take this

1293
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:25,740
medical marijuana product to a sick

1294
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:28,579
person and make them so happy and when

1295
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:33,058
they smoke it you get to watch

1296
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:35,548
I've got a friend who has he's not well

1297
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:36,809
in his head and sometimes he has bad

1298
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:38,369
days and he'd be like dude bring me

1299
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:39,809
something different and I'll show up and

1300
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:41,130
you can see it on his face he's got rate

1301
00:47:39,809 --> 00:47:42,660
he's got road rage he looks like he just

1302
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,039
he doesn't drive it he looks like he

1303
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,750
just was in traffic for seven hours

1304
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,028
trying to [ __ ] fight Denver traffic

1305
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,289
going north in the southbound lane and

1306
00:47:48,028 --> 00:47:51,690
then I'll [ __ ] take a couple of dabs

1307
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:53,819
with him and he relaxes and he goes man

1308
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:56,608
thanks thank you I'm gonna go do stuff

1309
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:58,099
now come back later and if we weren't

1310
00:47:56,608 --> 00:48:00,929
able to do that for people

1311
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:03,109
but when you get to see that happen you

1312
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:06,868
understand why and how important this is

1313
00:48:03,108 --> 00:48:09,469
if you listen to the reasons rules like

1314
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:12,838
this or getting proposed and pushed

1315
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:14,538
they I mean during the testimony for

1316
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:17,278
this one in particular

1317
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:18,869
one of the legislature members actually

1318
00:48:17,278 --> 00:48:21,150
that's a torch by the way listeners yeah

1319
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:23,210
shine it's my dad torch one of the

1320
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:26,068
legislators actually stops the guy

1321
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:28,019
testifying this like wait any plants

1322
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:29,429
because the guys like if you have more

1323
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:30,929
than one or two house plants in your

1324
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:34,798
home you're probably generating talks

1325
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:36,929
mold and dirt because that's basically

1326
00:48:34,798 --> 00:48:39,838
when they they go after caregivers

1327
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:41,608
in-home grows they list every problem

1328
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,328
that you typically see with the most

1329
00:48:41,608 --> 00:48:48,469
egregious black-market production

1330
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:50,910
house is gutted power stolen

1331
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:54,419
fertilizers and pesticides dumped on the

1332
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:55,980
back lawn I'm diesel fuel spew spilled

1333
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,230
on the neighborhood children just a

1334
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:00,179
traveller Trap House grow that is not a

1335
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,639
medical marijuana caregiver grow that's

1336
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:04,828
a Trap House grow

1337
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:06,868
there's no mold in my caregivers grow

1338
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:11,068
there's no stolen power feeding my

1339
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:13,559
caregivers grow all of this is a legal

1340
00:49:11,068 --> 00:49:16,199
behavior symptom and they're trying to

1341
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:19,980
attribute it to anyone attempting to

1342
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:21,480
grow any kind of house plan even if it

1343
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,769
wasn't cannabis that you were trying to

1344
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,349
grow in your house and so one of the

1345
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:27,900
Legislature's legislators is like wait a

1346
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:30,329
second I've got like two dozen house

1347
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,889
plants and you can kind of see her we're

1348
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:33,510
doing the trying to count him in her

1349
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:35,699
head like well I fill up the picture and

1350
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:37,170
I do this room in that room it's just

1351
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:39,960
like I've got a bunch of houseplants do

1352
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:41,278
you mean my house is full of mold and he

1353
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,838
was like well that really depends how

1354
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:45,358
you take care of them and you could kind

1355
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:48,389
of see the mood change when it was like

1356
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:51,150
Oh bro you dropped the [ __ ] for just

1357
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:53,730
a second and you let reality slip out

1358
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:55,980
for just a second

1359
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:58,740
it's all about how you're doing if

1360
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,449
you're willing to do it right you don't

1361
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:02,250
have stolen power you don't have mold

1362
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:03,358
you don't have poison spray on your

1363
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:05,489
plants you don't have neighbors

1364
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,710
complaining about the smell you don't

1365
00:50:05,489 --> 00:50:09,118
have teenagers and thugs from Florida

1366
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:10,650
breaking in either's no traffic coming

1367
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,269
and going there's nobody parked in front

1368
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,260
of the house with the music plan no

1369
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:14,880
we've never had to threaten your

1370
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,230
neighbor did not say anything about

1371
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,440
something they saw that shouldn't be

1372
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:22,099
right because it's not a black market

1373
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,480
production facility

1374
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:26,220
that's that's trap house behavior and

1375
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,650
they think they're gonna solve all this

1376
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:30,989
by bypass in a plant count and it's like

1377
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,269
alright so you can't catch them stealing

1378
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:35,639
power you can't catch them destroying

1379
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:37,619
rental houses you can't catch them

1380
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:39,269
selling the product on the Internet you

1381
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:41,548
can't catch them driving it across state

1382
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:43,318
lines you can't catch them depositing

1383
00:50:41,548 --> 00:50:45,298
the money in the bank they're not

1384
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:47,599
following the rules for any of that

1385
00:50:45,298 --> 00:50:51,170
behavior and think you're gonna solve

1386
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:54,049
all this with the planet count rule the

1387
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:56,480
only people this will affect are the

1388
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:59,330
people who are desperately doing

1389
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,010
everything they can to follow yep yep

1390
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:03,440
and those are the people these rules

1391
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:04,820
were passed for everybody else is it

1392
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,940
even worth having a medical card now

1393
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:12,650
totally okay I've had the medical card

1394
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:14,450
for two reasons the entire time I've

1395
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:16,220
been allowed to have one one because I'm

1396
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:18,679
injured and I use cannabis to treat my

1397
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:20,719
pain and two because it provides me

1398
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:23,629
significant additional legal protections

1399
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:26,569
all right I like it because I can shop

1400
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:28,369
and I mean that's a huge benefit to but

1401
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:31,519
I don't shop that much but anytime

1402
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:33,139
anywhere I can stop and shop yeah I saw

1403
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:34,489
that this apothecary lemon Jeff was on

1404
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:37,690
sale and I was able to get that without

1405
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:40,309
the card I would have been [ __ ] yep

1406
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:41,869
I've been stranded in springs before I

1407
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:44,269
had a fight car break down at Springs on

1408
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:47,119
two different occasions in both times I

1409
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:48,650
was like a card in the wallet yeah yeah

1410
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,659
Colorado Springs does not have any

1411
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,450
recreational cannabis stores no medical

1412
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:55,579
only and when I go visit my mom with in

1413
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:59,029
Denver at the place half a block from

1414
00:51:55,579 --> 00:52:00,739
her house is meds not only okay and so

1415
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:02,720
when I pull up to her in her house and

1416
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:03,939
I'm like man today was stressful didn't

1417
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,549
bring anything

1418
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:09,800
not a problem yep just walk shop yeah

1419
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,230
sure shops are so much cheaper to it so

1420
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:16,039
those extra legal protections that I

1421
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:17,840
really like I actually like some of the

1422
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:18,980
things that do in rack over what some of

1423
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,530
the things they're doing medical the

1424
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,969
testing the testing is exactly what I

1425
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:24,560
was kind of hinting it I would bring

1426
00:52:22,969 --> 00:52:26,989
that back into there bringing those

1427
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,610
rules in in the line with each other I'd

1428
00:52:26,989 --> 00:52:30,469
love to see a lab test on this lemon

1429
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:32,360
Jeffrey but there is not one not just a

1430
00:52:30,469 --> 00:52:34,879
disclaimer that when it shows up it'll

1431
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,650
be very by 15 percent of [ __ ] is

1432
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,960
that yeah you guys in Colorado they are

1433
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:41,809
allowed to be 15 percent plus or minus

1434
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,789
on the THC content that is whack that is

1435
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:45,409
completely wack yeah there's a new rule

1436
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:47,389
that passed recently everything says

1437
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:50,289
plus or minus 15 so you're not sure if

1438
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:53,389
you just bought a 10 or a 25 and

1439
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:55,579
cannabis usually ranges from about 20

1440
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:59,299
and right now it's somewhere between 17

1441
00:52:55,579 --> 00:53:01,829
and 25 30 is really high so a 15 percent

1442
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,850
variance you could get zero if you know

1443
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:05,190
what I mean you could have 2%

1444
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:06,869
cannabinoids in there if you read 15% on

1445
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:09,840
a label that could be a zero or that

1446
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:12,389
could be a 30 and that kind of swings a

1447
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:16,400
problem because roll up a joint and I'm

1448
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:18,509
a noob and I can't judge potency by

1449
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,889
characteristics that the art on the

1450
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:21,890
label right you know

1451
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:29,280
yeah when you light that up who knows

1452
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,240
where you're going if it's zero you're

1453
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,060
gonna get to the end of it and be

1454
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:36,449
confused if it's thirty I love smoking

1455
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:38,309
joints at concerts I can smoke all of

1456
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:40,529
your weed at a concert and not get high

1457
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:41,789
cuz I'm a dabber and people just look at

1458
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,650
me like what is wrong with the

1459
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:46,289
Terminator over there he smoked all the

1460
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:48,329
weed it's really funny I need dad to get

1461
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:50,429
where I need to be I like shows where

1462
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:52,340
there's a lot of joints moving because

1463
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:54,960
you never know what's coming through

1464
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:57,260
the last time I was in line at Red Rocks

1465
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,699
the kid next to me

1466
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,860
there was a guy running up and down the

1467
00:53:59,699 --> 00:54:04,469
the entrance selling loose joints out of

1468
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:06,630
an Altoids tin and the second time he

1469
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:09,179
shouldered between me and the guy next

1470
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:11,130
to me the guy next to me chuckle it was

1471
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:13,379
like skinny little [ __ ] and I thought

1472
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:14,550
he was talking about the guy and I kind

1473
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,760
of chuckled because it was this really

1474
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:19,860
skinny white kid in a polo shirt

1475
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:22,230
in khaki shorts and I was like accurate

1476
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:24,090
description and then he pulls out a

1477
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:27,000
joint that's thick around is my thumb

1478
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:30,210
and like half as long as my forearm and

1479
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,000
he was like this is a real joint but I'd

1480
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:35,039
charged more than $5 and I just start

1481
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,769
chuckling he lights it up amazing weed

1482
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,840
yeah as soon as that goes out maybe 15

1483
00:54:37,769 --> 00:54:41,219
minutes later someone else that was

1484
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,740
right in our vicinity that got a hit a

1485
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:45,659
couple of times was like I got next

1486
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:47,759
pulls out an okay size joint it looks

1487
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:49,440
like it's well ruled lights it up and

1488
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,870
before I can get to me I'm like oh I'm

1489
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,190
good bro

1490
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:54,509
like I'm gonna pretend like I'm too high

1491
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,579
for a minute and just passed this

1492
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:58,950
quietly to my left and let someone else

1493
00:54:56,579 --> 00:55:01,529
hit this mess I can smell it from here

1494
00:54:58,949 --> 00:55:07,730
it smells like it's all dog hair I was

1495
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:09,950
uh it was at Red Rocks in 96 seeing fish

1496
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:11,389
and uh I don't know how you remember

1497
00:55:09,949 --> 00:55:13,039
things like that was it the point of

1498
00:55:11,389 --> 00:55:14,989
seeing fish that you'll never be able to

1499
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,369
remember you know see that's that's

1500
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:18,949
what's weird is I used to I've seen more

1501
00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:21,170
fish shows not on drugs that I have on

1502
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:22,669
drugs I think the I do I like to do

1503
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:24,380
drugs when there's nothing else to do I

1504
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:26,059
like to remember Phish concerts my some

1505
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,710
of my favorite things that make sense

1506
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:29,000
it's like being when you're would you

1507
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,990
take out when you're super drunk at the

1508
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,920
bar out and drink a new marble and

1509
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:32,479
you're super drunk at the bar and you

1510
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,440
get that super hot girl come home with

1511
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,849
you and you wake up next to her and

1512
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,280
you're like I wonder if that was any fun

1513
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:39,200
that's like you know what I mean like

1514
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,089
god am i that was probably a good time I

1515
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:42,679
don't even know what happened like so

1516
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:44,630
that's that's why I kind of I don't do a

1517
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:46,868
lot of drugs at fish shows I have don't

1518
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:50,809
get me wrong the story I'm about to tell

1519
00:55:46,869 --> 00:55:52,039
tributes to this um so we pulled out

1520
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:53,509
some joints me and my buddy Greg we

1521
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:54,889
pulled out some J was for 20 and we're

1522
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,420
in line at the fish shun we pulled out

1523
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:58,608
some joints to smoke and the guy next to

1524
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,409
me goes trade you some acid for a joint

1525
00:55:58,608 --> 00:56:02,029
and we're like well [ __ ] yeah we'll do

1526
00:56:00,409 --> 00:56:03,769
that me and Greg each gave this guy a

1527
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:07,329
joint and he gave us one hit he goes one

1528
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:11,239
should be cool for you guys we split it

1529
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:12,369
was one of the best trips of my wife red

1530
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:14,539
rocks

1531
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:17,030
during so they do a song called Space

1532
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:18,789
Odyssey 2001 during that song red rocks

1533
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:22,250
lift it up

1534
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:24,139
and then it pivoted around the drummer

1535
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:26,510
and myself it was like spinning around

1536
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:29,690
the drummer was the axis but somehow I

1537
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:32,000
was also and it was spinning and we

1538
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:34,190
lifted off for a little while and then

1539
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,809
you know how red rocks when you're

1540
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,190
looking at the stage it's orange there's

1541
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:39,469
just orange with lights and there's the

1542
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:41,599
big speaker stacks on each side they

1543
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:44,449
just turned into a big orange blur with

1544
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,460
nine squares on either side I couldn't

1545
00:56:44,449 --> 00:56:47,659
tell what anything was and my buddy Greg

1546
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,920
tapped me on the shoulder news you

1547
00:56:47,659 --> 00:56:51,139
should drink some of this water you're

1548
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,838
[ __ ] tripping and that's like you are

1549
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:55,009
so correct right now buddy and I drink

1550
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:56,389
some of that water and ate a rice

1551
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:58,099
krispies treat and sat down for a few

1552
00:56:56,389 --> 00:56:59,480
minutes and everything kind of came back

1553
00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:01,130
together because they went into it side

1554
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,300
down with disease and it's ice and

1555
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,829
that's some of my favorite music and it

1556
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,240
brought me back but they pulled out a

1557
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:07,130
joint and this dude's I got read you

1558
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:08,899
asked him for that and we had no idea

1559
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:11,630
what we [ __ ] cut ourselves in due to

1560
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:14,990
that acid we trip for like 15 hours off

1561
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:16,700
a half a hit each I one of my friends in

1562
00:57:14,989 --> 00:57:18,318
college when not whenever Red Rocks

1563
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:21,219
would come up here and member mumble

1564
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:21,219
don't eat the brownies

1565
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:25,400
I'm not sure if she still goes but there

1566
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:27,319
used to be a chocolate-covered mushroom

1567
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,900
lady in every now and then they were in

1568
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:31,670
brownies and I guess someone else handed

1569
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,519
him one and he had a really fun

1570
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:36,769
afternoon two Red Rocks tomorrow yeah

1571
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:38,719
yeah when you go to book shows be

1572
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:40,070
careful you guys so really quickly we

1573
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:41,889
said we were gonna talk about Pueblo and

1574
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:44,059
we've totally skipped Pueblo

1575
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:45,529
we bore the [ __ ] out of people when we

1576
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:47,599
talk about Pueblo so I try not to do too

1577
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:49,070
localized stuff we were basically all

1578
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,659
Colorado this episode but we're gonna

1579
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:53,120
talk about Pueblo we live in the city of

1580
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:54,589
Pueblo Pueblo County is just on the

1581
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,900
outskirts of where we are so it affects

1582
00:57:54,590 --> 00:58:00,070
us heavily let's talk about Pueblo

1583
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:02,119
County and their plant counts okay so

1584
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:04,610
separate rules for the city and county

1585
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:07,489
the county passed a plant count limit of

1586
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:10,550
18 a while ago okay 18 plants in Pueblo

1587
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:12,709
County yep so and that's any that's I

1588
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:14,360
think that's period piece of property if

1589
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:18,019
you're not a licensed marijuana business

1590
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:22,660
okay I'm relatively sure that includes

1591
00:58:18,019 --> 00:58:25,130
AG land and then in the city they

1592
00:58:22,659 --> 00:58:27,500
actually fought tooth and nail for this

1593
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:29,140
when it was going through they wanted a

1594
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:32,090
limit of nine

1595
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:34,239
and I was able to convince the people

1596
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:36,650
that were writing these rules that

1597
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:39,079
passing a plant cap limit would cause

1598
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,639
problems and headaches because it's the

1599
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:42,529
city getting in between patients and

1600
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,619
doctors but there were several other

1601
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:48,380
clever ways of limiting the size and

1602
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:51,889
scope of a grow and I got them to do a

1603
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:54,260
square foot limit um I wanted a lot more

1604
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:56,779
than a hundred feet hundred square feet

1605
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:59,450
cuz it's really not that much space it's

1606
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:01,760
a ten inside the city you're limited to

1607
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:04,869
a hundred square feet of gross space in

1608
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:08,300
any one home I mean you can apply

1609
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:10,369
if you've got like in a garage that's

1610
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:12,950
got a foundation for walls and a roof

1611
00:59:10,369 --> 00:59:16,159
you can go to the city and apply for a

1612
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:19,219
variance allowing you to do like 150

1613
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:21,739
feet I think it is in that outbuilding

1614
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:23,869
okay but you have to jump through an

1615
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:25,759
extra little hoop or two to do that now

1616
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:27,920
what if you've got what if your room

1617
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,000
that you're trying to grow you get 100

1618
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,490
square feet what if your room you're

1619
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,018
trying to grow in is 10 feet by 11 feet

1620
00:59:31,489 --> 00:59:35,028
do I need to

1621
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:36,308
tape off that one you you don't have to

1622
00:59:35,028 --> 00:59:38,018
modify

1623
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:40,130
existing

1624
00:59:38,018 --> 00:59:43,148
structures to make it work but that's

1625
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:45,140
all the space you're allowed to use okay

1626
00:59:43,148 --> 00:59:48,438
honestly I haven't heard of a single

1627
00:59:45,139 --> 00:59:52,458
person in the city that's gotten busted

1628
00:59:48,438 --> 00:59:55,489
we're a small like you were you know you

1629
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:56,688
were using 110 square feet right nothing

1630
00:59:55,489 --> 00:59:59,838
like that the people that have had

1631
00:59:56,688 --> 01:00:01,458
trouble with law enforcement here and in

1632
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:04,159
the City and County right now it's

1633
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:06,678
zoning rules that you're violating if so

1634
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:08,479
you get a municipal court ticket like

1635
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:10,838
you painted in a wildly inappropriate

1636
01:00:08,478 --> 01:00:12,398
slogan across the front of your house

1637
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:14,599
or something

1638
01:00:12,398 --> 01:00:16,389
it's not like a felony or a misdemeanor

1639
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:20,239
or anything it's just a civil infraction

1640
01:00:16,389 --> 01:00:21,828
okay and that's part of the reason a lot

1641
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:23,599
of local government people that have

1642
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:25,759
passed rules like this are pushing for a

1643
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:28,219
statewide rule because the stay arrived

1644
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:29,748
rule they were pushing for felony um and

1645
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:31,519
ended up so far it's gonna be a

1646
01:00:29,748 --> 01:00:34,308
misdemeanor if you break these rules now

1647
01:00:31,518 --> 01:00:35,958
so a bit heavier stick to threaten

1648
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:39,559
people with if they break the plant cap

1649
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:40,879
rules but in the city the only people

1650
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:43,599
that have been busted were way above

1651
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,429
what their limits were

1652
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,989
so the city you can have as many plants

1653
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:49,749
as you like you just have to keep them

1654
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:52,398
in that ten-by-ten area

1655
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:53,238
how you go about that like I'm sure

1656
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:55,958
there's some people that have gotten

1657
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:55,958
real creative

1658
01:00:56,528 --> 01:01:01,159
right yeah yeah or how many plants you

1659
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:03,648
can cram into that or how many lights

1660
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:05,358
you can cram into that yep and I'm sure

1661
01:01:03,648 --> 01:01:06,518
there's some dude who's built a cube of

1662
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:09,108
kavita's

1663
01:01:06,518 --> 01:01:11,268
thinking layers you got to do shelves

1664
01:01:09,108 --> 01:01:13,369
shelving like small plants on a little

1665
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:15,048
six-inch shelf taller on it that's a

1666
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:16,818
hundred square foot period if you're

1667
01:01:15,048 --> 01:01:19,579
talking about having a veg space in a

1668
01:01:16,818 --> 01:01:22,759
bloom space yeah now you've got a 4 by 4

1669
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:25,219
and a 6 by 6 or 2 5 by 5's right things

1670
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:27,798
get ugly quick you know a 10 by 5 and 2

1671
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:32,499
5 by 5's this way to go yep yep mom's

1672
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:32,498
veg flower boom blow it out

1673
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:38,568
if this state rule passes Pueblo City &amp;

1674
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:41,568
County would have the option of keeping

1675
01:01:38,568 --> 01:01:44,630
those limits or adopting the statewide

1676
01:01:41,568 --> 01:01:46,250
just vague limit of 18

1677
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:48,108
and so that would be up to each little

1678
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:51,219
local jurisdiction when all is said and

1679
01:01:48,108 --> 01:01:53,900
done if this passes the good news is is

1680
01:01:51,219 --> 01:01:54,789
basically every year for the last seven

1681
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,800
years

1682
01:01:54,789 --> 01:02:00,619
the legislature has had at least one

1683
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,210
effort going after caregivers I mean

1684
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:04,869
every single one of them has failed

1685
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:07,309
every single one

1686
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:08,630
they've attacked this problem a couple

1687
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:10,309
different ways over the last two years

1688
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:13,280
the like we mentioned they're going

1689
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:15,500
after the doctors and so there's not

1690
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:19,900
gonna be anyone in the state that has a

1691
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:24,280
99 plant count card here come

1692
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:24,280
[ __ ] probably September yes

1693
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,960
caregivers are

1694
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:32,440
the registry is now main statewide

1695
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:36,429
caregiver registry is now mandatory

1696
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:39,769
you gotta hop online and register

1697
01:02:36,429 --> 01:02:42,589
right now if you're a caregiver and

1698
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:44,119
you're following your plant limit your

1699
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:46,250
only rules you've got to follow our

1700
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:47,890
basic building code your electrical has

1701
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:50,239
to be up to code

1702
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:51,739
you know you can't be stealing power you

1703
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:53,858
can't feed dump and stuff in the law and

1704
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:57,500
that kind of thing but

1705
01:02:53,858 --> 01:02:59,269
if they pass these rules a lot of the

1706
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:01,280
people who are currently legally allowed

1707
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:02,659
to grow larger amounts and and for the

1708
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,240
most part these are the people that are

1709
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:07,819
giving away

1710
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:09,889
huge amounts of CBD oil the right to

1711
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:12,950
poor families with kids with the face

1712
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:15,588
syndrome one of the things a lot of the

1713
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:17,389
kids with that are being treated with

1714
01:03:15,588 --> 01:03:19,088
cannabis their illnesses bankrupt

1715
01:03:17,389 --> 01:03:22,250
families quickly

1716
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:24,460
things like epilepsy devaís syndrome

1717
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:28,219
cancer leukemia

1718
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:30,588
autism these are not cheap to treat

1719
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:32,750
these are not the appointments needed to

1720
01:03:30,588 --> 01:03:35,329
diagnose an arch right moving to

1721
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:38,690
Colorado isn't cheap leave finding a new

1722
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:40,730
job relocating all of the things these

1723
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:43,460
families go through to get here are all

1724
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:44,920
incredibly expensive and when they get

1725
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,329
here

1726
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:49,338
several of them have been really lucky

1727
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:50,348
to find caregivers who are willing to

1728
01:03:49,338 --> 01:03:53,088
produce

1729
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:55,070
grow large numbers of plants which is

1730
01:03:53,088 --> 01:03:56,989
risky just because it's a valuable

1731
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:58,210
commodity I'm depending when you're

1732
01:03:56,989 --> 01:04:01,729
standing with it

1733
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:04,220
grow large numbers of plants refine it

1734
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:07,369
down into a consistent noticeable

1735
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:08,868
product that like an oil or a pill and

1736
01:04:07,369 --> 01:04:11,420
then they give it to these families at

1737
01:04:08,869 --> 01:04:12,680
little to no cost oftentimes the people

1738
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:15,460
with the really big counts because

1739
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:19,519
there's like five of them in the state

1740
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:21,769
they're bulletproof as far as law is any

1741
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:24,440
sort of jury of their peers is concerned

1742
01:04:21,769 --> 01:04:27,409
because of how they operate in a care

1743
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:29,179
for but with these new rules they're

1744
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:32,420
legal right to operate like they have

1745
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:34,548
been for years is gone which means it

1746
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:37,880
doesn't matter where they're treating it

1747
01:04:34,548 --> 01:04:39,710
doesn't matter right if 12 12 of their

1748
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,180
peers agrees that they should be able to

1749
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,079
do this to save that kid's life it

1750
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:44,179
doesn't matter they're breaking the

1751
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:46,130
rules they're falling now there's these

1752
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:48,469
kids that have to have seizures you got

1753
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:50,119
a watch watch them twitch it's terrible

1754
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:51,469
yep all right Mike we've been going for

1755

1780
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:54,019

that I cannot field I will find the

1783
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:58,969
proper channels we'll get those people

1784
01:05:56,809 --> 01:06:01,760
on the show we will talk about it I love

1785
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:02,959
listener generated content it's the best

1786
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,059
because that way I know I'm hitting my

1787
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,039
target I'm getting the listeners get the

1788
01:06:05,059 --> 01:06:09,400
info that they need I love doing that

1789
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:11,800
and those tend to be the

1790
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,260
where we really really get informative

1791
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:15,820
yes it inspires me it gives me something

1792
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,590
to dig for it's something to kind of

1793
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:18,789
strive for and learn about well I mean

1794
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,260
it's kind of like the wouldn't you get

1795
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:22,750
pulled over with weed in Colorado things

1796
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:25,180
like it's hard for us to remember what

1797
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:27,429
we wanted to know when we were at that

1798
01:06:25,179 --> 01:06:28,929
stage of the game right right I forget

1799
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:30,369
that sometimes we forget that not

1800
01:06:28,929 --> 01:06:33,339

1801
