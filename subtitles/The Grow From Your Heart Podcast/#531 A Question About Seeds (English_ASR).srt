you know I like to start this podcast

21
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:53,349
off by talking about what I'm smoking

22
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:55,808
today I've been taking dad's of banana

23
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,239
orange cookies full spectrum extract

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:00,789
from Green Dot labs this is a big 4 gram

25
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,308
jar on the package it says it is a blend

26
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:05,769
of banana cush and orange cookies the

27
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:07,989
flavor is described as banana orange

28
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:10,090
smoothie I'm going to say that is

29
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:12,699
perfectly accurate is like a banana

30
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,049
orange smoothie with a hint of pepper at

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,420
the end of it I think that is coming

32
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:19,120
from the cookies ah there is the orange

33
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,769
cookies in here that peppery dark

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,870
undertone at the end comes from the

35
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:25,509
cookies the orange banana smoothie is

36
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,670
dominant and I really enjoy it I'll show

37
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,790

all right what else do we need to talk

107
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,539
about I am also in the process I like to

108
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:58,329
give you guys garden updates I've got a

109
00:03:55,539 --> 00:04:01,299
quick garden update for you I am in the

110
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,709
process of reversing a male know excuse

111
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,030
me I messed that up let me say that

112
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,330
correctly I am in the process of

113
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,729
reversing a female golden goat plant to

114
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,459
create female pollen which will only

115
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:15,699
contain female chromosomes so I can make

116
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,680
more feminized seeds from the golden

117
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:19,870
goat cross yes of course I will be

118
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,250
making more feminized golden goat I'll

119
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,019
make more Lemon Geoffrey

120
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,430
there will be more orange gasm in there

121
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:26,680
and there will be a couple of new things

122
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,509
and a couple of things that have been

123
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,290
made and were put out and were very

124
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,029
sought-after

125
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,040
and I did not have enough to release it

126
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:34,869
I made testers this time I'm going to

127
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,419
make a production batch of a couple of

128
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,220
very popular things so we're using the

129
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:41,259
golden goat reversed female to create

130
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,000
the pollen I also mentioned that I've

131
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,680
got the lemon Geoffrey coming up the

132
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,019
orange gasm coming up and of course the

133
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,090
feminized goal and go amongst that mix I

134
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:50,829
am going to add a Strawberry Fields

135
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:53,319
plant so we can make more of the red

136
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:55,149
pill and I will also add a blue berry

137
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,719
cookies plant to make more of the blue

138
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:58,839
pill both of those names were tentative

139
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,030
stress-test

140
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,219
names they will be changed those strains

141
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:04,418
will not be marketed as the blue pill

142
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,220
nor the red pill they will have a

143
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:07,930
different name when they come out you

144
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,400
guys will know it I've got the names in

145
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,959
my head I have not announced them I have

146
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,549
not made anything official I like to do

147
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,799
a lot of research and make sure I didn't

148
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,870
steal any names before I label a strain

149
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,819
but I've got names for those they will

150
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,680
be remade when they are available the

151
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,000
new names the permanent names will be

152
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,550
announced and the packages will be

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,100
available of course at seeds here now

154
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,139
dot-com so I'm working on reversing that

155
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,689
goat it has been sprayed its first time

156
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,728
I generally like to spray one time

157
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:35,410
before I go to flower then I wait and

158
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:38,288
put it into flower about seven to ten

159
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,580
days after that

160
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:41,110
sprayed the day which it goes into

161
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:43,568
flower then it will get sprayed again

162
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,968
every three days until I see pollen

163
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:47,919
sacks forming depending on the strain I

164
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:50,019
may continue to spray this is a golden

165
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,338
goat it needs continuous sprays after it

166
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:54,128
shows pollen sacks

167
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:56,050
I've been around day most plants will

168
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,610
show me pollen give me pollen a little

169
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,468
bit earlier the golden goat is kind of

170
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,619
stubborn it makes me wait until about a

171
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:04,478
30 day 32 I will have pollen production

172
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:06,550
shortly after that I will have the

173
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,550
females pollinated I will put them in

174
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,680
there when I see that the male plants

175
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,360
are developing well on the golden goat

176
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,908
that's how I time that up when I see oh

177
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,889
this female is now making balls they're

178
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,688
gonna start opening I see those real

179
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,829
male plants forming it's time to put the

180
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:22,599
girls in there that's the way that I

181
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:24,968
time that don't put the girls in there

182
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,158
until you know that reversal is actually

183
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,569
reversing then the that reversal will

184
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:30,278
keep going it's gonna take a minute to

185
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,080
turn it's gonna change sexes then it's

186
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:33,308
gonna make pollen and then by the time

187
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,868
you get those females in there and get

188
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,159
them flowering about 14 days in

189
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:38,409
everything will work out it is beautiful

190
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:40,478
so it's all about timing but that's

191
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:41,829
where I am I have begun the process of

192
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,079
reversing the golden goat it has

193
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:46,240
received its first spray it is not yet

194
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,098
into the flower room but it is getting

195
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,559
ready so that will get reversed will

196
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:52,058
pollinate some elite cuts I like I said

197
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:53,889
will remake some things and there are

198
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:56,379
also a couple of things you guys don't

199
00:06:53,889 --> 00:07:00,509
even probably know I've got in there so

200
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:03,129
new stuff may be coming here in 2020 or

201
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:05,080
2022 cranking through this year you guys

202
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:07,778
it feels like this this has been a long

203
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,098
february or a real long [Â __Â ] i don't

204
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:10,269
know it's been a long tuesday or

205
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:12,490
something like that is what it's felt

206
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:13,569
like quarantine is messing us up i hope

207
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,908
you guys are going outside getting some

208
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,439
exercise doing something i take off your

209
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:19,538
sweatpants and put on your jeans make

210
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,159
sure they still fit see how many uh belt

211
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:22,058
holes you've extended your waist make

212
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:24,129
sure you're doing alright with your

213
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:25,330
health and with yourself check in on

214
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:27,129
somebody if you haven't called your mama

215
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:28,688
you haven't called somebody cool call

216
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,919
him check in on him it's not it's not

217
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,569
weird to call somebody to check on them

218
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,128
during quarantine time take care of each

219
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:35,199
other take care of ourselves all right

220
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:38,050
that's enough quarantine talk that's

221
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,848
enough plant update talk oh the leds you

222
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,519
guys i talked about growing under led's

223
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:44,740
I continue to be impressed by the LEDs

224
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,269
the plants want to eat a little bit more

225
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,249
but I like that that means I'm getting

226
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:50,168
more growth probably getting more

227
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,760
production the roots are probably

228
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,889
expanding quite rapidly

229
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,870
I am feeding them more I have recently

230
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,430
started giving them dark I give the

231
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,829
seedlings and the brand new clones get

232
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,240
24 hours of light I have recently given

233
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,919
them I've started giving them 3 hours

234
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,230
I'm going to give them 4 hours of

235
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,330
darkness here on Monday that will be

236
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,890
it's probably the day that this episode

237
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:11,349
comes out so they'll be clicked into

238
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,779
four hours of darkness and 20 hours of

239
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,310
light they are going to be some of the

240
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:16,539
clones in that room will be flowered

241
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,189
some of the clones in that room are

242
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,319
intended to be mother plants so once

243
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:21,819
they get separated out of that room the

244
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,409
light cycle will get changed again and

245
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,930
then the plants will get arranged into

246
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,510
their final spots they'll get cloned

247
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,370
then once we determined sex then we will

248
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,200
trellis them and there's some steps to

249
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,979
go but I'm impressed with the LEDs

250
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,440
that's my point

251
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,050
I love the LEDs I am seeing amazing

252
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,150
growth I don't think it's as hot as the

253
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:42,219
six hundred watt light that I replaced

254
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:44,470
that could be two three hundred and

255
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,529
twenty watt Canon LEDs in place of a six

256
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,330
hundred and a 600 HP s and it doesn't

257
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,529
feel as warm in that room of course

258
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,690
we're not to the middle of the summer

259
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,879
yet that's when we will really know I

260
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,920
know how hot it got been we'll compare

261
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,350
then but that is my rambling update on

262
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,059
the grow room we've got LEDs going the

263
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,409
plants in there look great I've got Jack

264
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,699
the Ripper's seedlings I don't know if

265
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,230
I've revealed that before I've talked

266
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,730
that I've got seedlings in there they

267
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,680
are Jack the Ripper from sub cool

268
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,990
they're from TGA genetics they are Jack

269
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,639
the Ripper's they look fairly uniform

270
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,680
there's one that grew it looks like it

271
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,470
topped itself it grew two main tops ah

272
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,629
that one's interesting but the other

273
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,490
four they all look fairly similar if I

274
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:22,929
were to pull off that extra side branch

275
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,240
that makes it have two tops that other

276
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:27,189
one would match the others very well so

277
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,200
quite uniform except for that one weirdo

278
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,080
that's kind of what you expect there

279
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Jack the Ripper's they [Â __Â ] love love

280
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,670
love the LEDs they're in three gallon

281
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,529
pots soilless mix they've been getting

282
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:40,779
fed new millennium and bedroom and

283
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,220
recharge and they seem to love it you

284
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:44,350
guys that's what I got for you on that

285
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,870
okay I did say we were going to read

286
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,399
some emails I've got two emails lined up

287
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,990
we may pull out a third depending on how

288
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,379
long this episode goes depending on how

289
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,779
rambly I continue to be the first email

290
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:57,759
in this episode comes from our friend

291
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:59,110
Papa Roni and it goes like this it says

292
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,240
hey Rasta Geoff I've been listening to

293
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,919
your podcast for a few months and I love

294
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,860
it thank you bro I love hearing comments

295
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,809
and compliments like that and thank you

296
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,580
for listening I say this all the time

297
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:10,349
but it's really true if you guys weren't

298
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,000
listening it were just me talking this

299
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,430
would be a problem this would be [Â __Â ]

300
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,049
weird so you guys make this a thing I

301
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:17,429
would just be a psychopath or something

302
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,259
if I decide her and spoke into the mic

303
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:20,789
and stared at myself like this hey Jeff

304
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,529
they'd just be [Â __Â ] really weird so

305
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:24,389
I'm glad I've got a good audience I'm

306
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,639
glad you guys are so supportive and I've

307
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,899
been really loving and enjoying the

308
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,299
interaction that I've been getting

309
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,590
through social media through email just

310
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,059
during this quarantine we've all been

311
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,440
keeping each other company so thank you

312
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,599
I do appreciate that

313
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,880
so this says I am way overdue for

314
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,379
finally becoming a patreon country

315
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,149
patron it says patron but it means

316
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:43,710
patron I was gonna say patreon

317
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:46,649
contributors but it just says from

318
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,780
becoming a patreon but I am here finally

319
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,879
man don't worry about taking a long time

320
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,709
to join us on patreon it takes a minute

321
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,120
some people don't know it exists and

322
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,160
you've got to put in a credit card

323
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,049
number on the Internet that's sketchy I

324
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,639
understand and dude not everybody's got

325
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:01,829
a few bucks and I'm not I don't expect

326
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,179

377
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:42,360
to those patreon questions a little bit

378
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,310
more frequently and sooner

379
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,750
so the patreon may be a way to get your

380
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:47,669
question moved up to the top of the

381
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,169
ladder or have a really good question if

382
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:50,969
your questions interesting I will read

383
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:52,620
it on the show I try to help everybody

384
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,209

385
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,828
probably a hundred emails in there I'm

386
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:58,979
gonna read them all it just may take a

387
00:12:55,828 --> 00:13:00,448
long time let's refocus and put me back

388
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,009
on the rails here you guys I'm going

389
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:05,039
away fast today and I got a lot of [Â __Â ]

390
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:06,629
to say this one comes from I don't know

391
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,948
if they want their name said but this

392
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:09,480
one comes from a friend down there in

393
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:11,609
Albuquerque shout out to my friends in

394
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,509
the 505 I'll go crazy in the house I

395
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,399
hope you're doing well

396
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:16,500
but you guys aren't going to Alba crazy

397
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,078
during the quarantine but the message

398
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,578
goes a little bit like at this it says

399
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:21,809
good morning my friend good morning to

400
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:23,849
you as well I hope you're listening in

401
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:26,039
the morning it says I write you with a

402
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,009
curious problem about some product I was

403
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,958
given I recently flowered five blue OG

404
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,789
Kush origin allegedly from we're not

405
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,429
gonna say who they came from allegedly

406
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:37,259
from this place in California my friend

407
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:39,088
had many other seeds and strains from

408
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,949
various other breeders my friend

409
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:43,439
happened upon the stash of flour and

410
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:46,948
seeds after the feds broke up the grow

411
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:49,409
in California so you found some flowers

412
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:51,269
and seeds from a raided grow in

413
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:53,490
California these plants were left

414
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:55,709
unattended and eventually seeded yes

415
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,669
that if where they just let's see I want

416
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,859
to read more I want to read that again

417
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,599
friend other seeds and strains what

418
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,579
happened to stash of flour and the feds

419
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,589
broke up the grow so there was stuff

420
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:06,599
that was left unattended ah there were a

421
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,059
number of strains in the room that

422
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,800
seated up my question to you is a number

423
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:12,539
of these female plants harmed out to

424
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,458
create oh if a number of these plants

425
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,379
earned out to create seed throughout the

426
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:18,179
whole greenhouse there were thousands of

427
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:19,889
viable seeds and they were labeled

428
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,229
accordingly to the plant they came out

429
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:24,750
of blue genetics allegedly tout

430
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,659
stability but all fiy knows were wildly

431
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:31,078
vastly different my question is are

432
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,049
these seeds blue og backcross or when

433
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,269
they herm

434
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:37,000
as the pollen get bad enough that I have

435
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:38,950
a bunch of crazy random crosses that now

436
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,620
need to be stabilized okay that's a

437
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,629
really good question I took your advice

438
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,909
and I'm waiting around or two to start

439
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:48,338
breeding I'm keeping some amazing fruity

440
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:50,230
gas and purple Finas alive until I can

441
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:52,899
afford a small tint to either stress the

442
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,360
female form or b.x seeds or to pop a

443
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:57,250
male so I can collect pollen any advice

444
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,110
or expert knowledge would be appreciated

445
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,480
I don't want to tell people this is OG

446
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,789
Kush if it was really crossed with candy

447
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,680
land or some Clementine or Lucinda

448
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,059
Williams and I still want to stabilize

449
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,088
this strain in the future and possibly

450
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:12,399
start breeding once since no one wants

451
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:14,680
to take initiative in Albuquerque to

452
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,019
breed bro there are a couple of people

453
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:18,849
doing really wonderful breeding projects

454
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,289
down there in Albuquerque if you do a

455
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,389
little bit of research you can find them

456
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:23,649
on social media very easily shout out to

457
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,600
my friends down there doing breeding

458
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,129
projects in Albuquerque I go down there

459
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,870
and do some consulting for some other

460
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:30,399
grows I'm not involved in any of the

461
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,230
breeding projects down there but I do

462
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,879
know what's going on going on down there

463
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,709
and the cannabis scene in Albuquerque

464
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:36,820
very interesting stuff happening right

465
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,989
now especially with the quarantine

466
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,060
they're gonna run out of herb if they

467
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,129
don't step it up ah but there are

468
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:44,199
breeders in Albuquerque so uh but still

469
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:46,450
don't be afraid to do it this is a

470
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,160
really interesting question um you said

471
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,020
you're gonna try to find a male out of

472
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,929
here you won't find a true male I don't

473
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,519
think if this was a grow a commercial

474
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,699
cultivation that was raided and taken

475
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,799
down

476
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,780
I'm going to assume and this is just me

477
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:01,250
making an ass of you and me that all of

478
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,649
the plants in this cultivation were

479
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,330
females they probably did not want males

480
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:07,459
around in a commercial cultivation

481
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,900
they're trying to make money if they got

482
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,490
raided they're going after money they

483
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,529
probably weren't breeding was probably a

484
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,299
big setup on so you got a bunch of

485
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,929
plants that seeded out they were all

486
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:19,399
females they seed it so there are a

487
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,559
couple of ways that this could have

488
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,389
happened they probably I'm gonna guess

489
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:26,239
they harmed out or they did a thing uh

490
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:28,879
where when the plants go too long they

491
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,519
make seeds and I'm not sure if those

492
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,689
seeds are going to produce

493
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,639
hermaphroditic seeds or if those seeds

494
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,800
are going are hermaphroditic progeny

495
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,809
with intersex trades or if they're going

496
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,879
to produce feminized seeds you said

497
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:42,349
you're looking for a male I don't know

498
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,899
that that's gonna come up if they came

499
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:47,360
from female plants there will be no male

500
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:49,279
genetics in that gene pool so you should

501
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,919
not find any males if you find a male

502
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,429
plant it is actually a hermaphrodite it

503
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,259
is going to express male parts but also

504
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:59,620
it will have female parts but there was

505
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:04,970
no male pollen in this room hopefully

506
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:06,920
allegedly I'm assuming so so you've got

507
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,259
a couple of good questions in here are

508
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,850
these blue og backcross or when they

509
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:12,740
termed as the pollen get bad enough that

510
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,539
you have a bunch of crazy random crosses

511
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,059
we don't know where the pollen came from

512
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:19,279
we don't know if that one of the plants

513
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:20,659
freaked out and harmed and made pollen

514
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,339
we don't know if two different strains

515
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,290
in that room freaked out made pollen we

516
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,599
don't know if every room or every plant

517
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:28,909
in that room turned into a hermaphrodite

518
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,609
and made pollen and pollinated that room

519
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,500
the pollen from plant a and B could have

520
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:36,740
landed on plants C so now you've got

521
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,630
seeds that are a B and C so it's really

522
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,450
hard to identify exactly what you've got

523
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,310
out of that room um then a bunch of

524
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,950
crazy random crosses yes you've got a

525
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:47,210
bunch of crazy random crosses um if

526
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,130
there is something in there that you

527
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,049
find what you can do is grow them

528
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,730
yourself your if this is a personal

529
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,470
breeding project you can grow them

530
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,779
yourself don't don't let me slow you

531
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,000
down don't put these to market these are

532
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:01,309
not for anybody else these are for you

533
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,170
this story is a cool story for you to

534
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,269
tell behind some seeds but these seeds

535
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:08,180
aren't for anybody else they're going to

536
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:09,109
be mutants or mafart i'ts and question

537
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,910
marks coming out of

538
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:13,309
seeds you don't know what's there you

539
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,290
can't ask for money for seeds with

540
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:16,519
question marks you've got to have you

541
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,259
got to know parents of parents of

542
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:19,670
parents and how they were bred and where

543
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:21,650
they were bred if you're gonna ask for

544
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:24,350
money for seeds ah that's just like

545
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,850
throwing up just like saying it make me

546
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:27,049
some food and we'll open a food truck

547
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:28,699
and I just go to the fridge and I get

548
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,930
seven random ingredients and put them in

549
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,090
a blender and I go there you go it's

550
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,740
what I can get you hope I got ice cream

551
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:35,689
and peanut butter and not like pickles

552
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,980
and peanut butter and you know so you

553
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,019
got to know what's going into there and

554
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,339
so I'm rambling cuz I'm high as [Â __Â ] now

555
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:42,259
we're talking about ice cream but jeez

556
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:45,679
let me get back on track you don't know

557
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:47,569
what made those crosses and if it hummed

558
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,580
out then you've got hermetics also

559
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:51,559
you're gonna carry on that erm trait so

560
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:53,869
if you grow them out see what you've got

561
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,309
and you said you're gonna find a male in

562
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:56,809
there there's not gonna be a true male

563
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:59,349
you're gonna have and don't stress the

564
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:01,940
female form or BX you're going to make

565
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:04,549
hermaphrodites by doing all of this

566
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,320
stress find something that is a solid

567
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,819
female that has the traits you like if

568
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,490
you really insist on working with these

569
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:12,589
to further generations find a female it

570
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,349
expresses full female traits that has

571
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:17,240
all the other traits you like aroma

572
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:19,459
potency color structure whatever you're

573
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,430
looking for find that in one of those

574
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,170
plants from seed then stress test the

575
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,420
[Â __Â ] out of it put it in many different

576
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,279
environments see if it I'm Afra nights

577
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,840
on you in there then here's another

578
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:31,819
trick this is what I do with a plant

579
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,269
before I breed with it give it a stress

580
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:34,159
test

581
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:36,079
put it on 12:12 for about three weeks

582
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,850
once you see bud sets forming you got

583
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,559
nice fat pistols you got dandelions

584
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,980
going up the branches [Â __Â ] with the

585
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,200
timer

586
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,329
put it back on eighteen six run it for

587
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,220
about two weeks see what it does is it

588
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:48,289
freaked out immediately does it act okay

589
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,819
does it not freak out at all then put

590
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:51,769
that timer back on twelve twelve and

591
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:52,189
give it give it ten days see what it

592
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:54,019
does

593
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,390
now you're what two four or five weeks

594
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:58,700
in maybe six weeks in let's [Â __Â ] with it

595
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,560
again let's put the timer on 24 hours

596
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,840
for two days let's just see what happens

597
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,639
this plant may produce seeds if it

598
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,740
produces seeds on its own that's okay

599
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,600
but if it produces hermaphrodite signs

600
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,400
if it shows you male flowers popping up

601
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,449
we've got to get rid of that plant or do

602
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,120
not breed with it

603
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,340
you've got to breed with one it will not

604
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,979
hermaphrodite on you you need to get

605
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:21,199
very very careful to not have

606
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,460
hermaphroditic intersex traits in your

607
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,350
breeding project

608
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,259
to identify a solid female because you

609
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:29,149
only want a female out of this batch

610
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:30,829
then what I would do personally I would

611
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,769
whip up a batch of silver thiosulfate

612
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:35,779
and I would reverse that female and make

613
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:37,910
pollen out of that female and put that

614
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:40,700
pollen on a clone of the same plant and

615
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,560
make reversed seeds out of that then

616
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,750
grow those if you did a good job by

617
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,549
selecting one that is not hermaphroditic

618
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,259
which it's gonna be scarce in this batch

619
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:50,149
because that is a trait that is in there

620
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:51,589
these plants reproduced without a male

621
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,780
in the room there is a sexual

622
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:55,730
reproduction that happened there had to

623
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:57,859
be pollen production somehow I don't

624
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,079
know I can't identify what did I wasn't

625
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:02,779
there but we've got asexual reproduction

626
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:05,119
in this room so hermaphroditism or

627
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:06,859
intersex traits is very common or very

628
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,199
likely somewhere in this gene pool so

629
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:11,149
find a solid female find the female that

630
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,519
is what you want stress test the [Â __Â ]

631
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,470
out of her reverse her by using silver

632
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,119
thiosulfate don't do it with light don't

633
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,759
do it with heat go do with any of that

634
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,379
silver silly [Â __Â ] use silver thiosulfate

635
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:22,910
reverse it instead of causing a

636
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,500
hermaphrodite let's cause a chemical

637
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,820
reaction in the plant this is a little

638
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,589
bit different people are gonna say I'm

639
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,179
crazy but we're doing it chemically it's

640
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:30,559
controlled I know what I'm doing it and

641
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,690
with it this isn't a trait that's just

642
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,279
in there I'm using some science behind

643
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,410
my understandings of doing this to the

644
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:38,389
plant so then reverse it and pollinate

645
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:41,120
of a clone of the same plant now you've

646
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,310
made s1 you've got self seeds grow those

647
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,589
you'll find many phenotypes that look

648
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:47,269
just like that mother plant you just

649
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:48,529
reverse and then you'll find some

650
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:50,930
phenotypes that lean a little bit

651
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:52,430
towards whatever the pollen came from I

652
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,840
don't know and you'll have more that

653
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:56,120
lean a little bit towards or whatever

654
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,099
the pollen receiver was it sounds like

655
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,419
you could have Lucinda Williams crosses

656
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:02,449
you could have Candyland you could have

657
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,279
Clementine you could have blue og you

658
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,259
can have all kinds of random crosses in

659
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,549
this room but I don't know what seeds

660
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:10,009
you're working with because I don't know

661
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:11,569
which planet came from well I feel like

662
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:13,160
I really went on a good ramble on that I

663
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:15,169
think I covered it though you've got

664
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,610
random pollen in a room I don't know

665
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,930
which plants the pollen came from I

666
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:19,669
don't know what caused the pollen you've

667
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,890
got a lot of variables don't try to make

668
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,090
money off this batch of seeds you did

669
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,070
say that you're waiting before you

670
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:26,629
started doing some breeding uh advice

671
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:27,649
and expert knowledge and don't take

672
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,560
money for these because you'll make

673
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,820
people mad it will ruin your reputation

674
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,589
and don't share them if you do share

675
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:35,210
them make sure you only share them with

676
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:36,038
people you know that you can tell them

677
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,569
