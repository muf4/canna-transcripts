used to be cool and it politely says I

51
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,359
am only writing to say I think you made

52
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,219
a mistake when discussing the Joe Biden

53
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,618
pardoning people with Federal

54
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,179
convictions for simple possession and I

55
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,859
do understand where I went wrong we will

56
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,840
get to that and thank you for gently

57
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,300
correcting me I'm not afraid to be

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,979
gently corrected I do always ask for uh

59
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,540
questions Corrections comments concerns

60
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,818
please do send those to me again the

61
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,098
email address is grow from your heart at

62
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,958
hotmail.com let's get into this one says

63
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,818
I think you made a mistake I watched

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,979
Biden make the announcement but I do not

65
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,598
recall him saying anything about a

66
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,818
release of prisoners which is what I

67
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,799
misunderstood and where I misspoke it

68
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:33,060
says his announcement was to say that he

69
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,099
was pardoning people with Federal

70
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,560
conditions convictions for possession

71
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,899
now the result of any pardon would be to

72
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,519
release anyone serving time but as you

73
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,739
pointed out and which Biden would have

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,420
already been aware no one was serving

75
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,878
time for a simple possession so that

76
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,098
makes sense so far it says a part in

77
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:52,620
Acts to wipe out any conviction as if it

78
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:54,539
never happened and that is what Mr Biden

79
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,739
has accomplished so that is a little bit

80
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:57,419
different that does make a big

81
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,039
difference that does do some different

82
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,598
things for a few people that may have

83
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,179
affected more people so we'll talk about

84
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,280
that briefly he does go on he says while

85
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,800
Mr Biden may have been fishing for votes

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,719
he still did the right thing yet I would

87
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,340
urge you to correct the record and then

88
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,780
he signs it with his cool name used to

89
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,060
be cool big shout out to my buddy used

90
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,318
to be cool you guys I appreciate these

91
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,239
types of updates these types of

92
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,799
Corrections the only way I get stopped

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,480
from saying crazy stuff on here is if

94
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,280
somebody does correct me so thank you

95
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,959
for the correction and the update now

96
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,000
let's talk about that real briefly here

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,739
I don't want to dwell on old news I

98
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,360
misspoke I thought that nobody was going

99
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,039
to get released from federal prison

100
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,019
which that is that is accurate what's

101
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,939
going to happen is some people are going

102
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,340
to be pardoned which means their Federal

103
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,900
cannabis crimes will be wiped away which

104
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,759
will help people out why would this be

105
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,799
beneficial to people because on a lot of

106
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,479
job applications it says have you ever

107
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,099
been convicted of a crime and now if you

108
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,139
don't have a federal cannabis crime on

109
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:51,479
your record you're probably open to a

110
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,158
lot more job opportunity you're probably

111
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,199
also open to a lot more educational

112
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,060
opportunities when you apply for

113
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,979
colleges it says do you have any drug

114
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,719
crimes right there you go I got a

115
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,459
federal cannabis crime guess what no job

116
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,680
for you guess what they do deleted that

117
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,360
more opportunity for also this could

118
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,159
give people the opportunity for more

119
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,019
loans more people will be able to start

120
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,298
their own business so the main thing

121
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,980
that this did is it wiped a uh a dent

122
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,599
off of a lot of people's record a lot of

123
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,180
people got a fresh start we erased some

124
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,439
junk some some cannabis crimes that will

125
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,019
help people out that will give people

126
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,939
more opportunity was which is what the

127
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,160
world especially the states need right

128
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,379
now we need more opportunity

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,880
so the bottom line is more opportunity

130
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,199
people will be able to get more jobs

131
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,639
they'll be able to get more loans

132
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,439
they'll be able to go to more schooling

133
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,360
they'll be able to better themselves and

134
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,000
make a better future for themselves and

135
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,819
not be uh stopped or blocked or have a

136
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,560
hurdle of a federal cannabis crime in

137
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,180
the way so my friend used to be cool

138

um I bought a bunch of seeds

282
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,458
and within that bunch of seeds I got a

283
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,320
pack of seeds called Deadhead OG from

284
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,539
the Cali Connection yes controversial

285
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,800
company uh feel what you will think what

286
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,299
you may

287
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,919
um but that's where the seeds came from

288
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,000
the opinions and feedback don't matter

289
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,439
right now that's straight up history

290
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,240
that's what happened I'm not going to

291
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,100
change anything uh it's a pack of

292
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,778
Deadhead OG from the Cali Connection I

293
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,580
grew those out there were several

294
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:46,379
phenotypes that were fire there were a

295
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,820
couple phenotypes that were not fire in

296
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,519
my opinion but a couple of more hot

297
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,500
[ __ ] fire uh number nine was my

298
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,360
favorite uh phenotype out of that batch

299
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,820
out of the population number nine was

300
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,459
the best looking plant in my opinion it

301
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,440
had a gassy

302
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,819
um a funky gassy thing that when you

303
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,920
smelled it your eyes kind of squinted

304
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,920
like what is that but then it also had a

305
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:09,838
earthy musky thing that you went oh I

306
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,699
want some of that but then after then I

307
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,640
dried it and cured it and smoked it and

308
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,959
it had musky gassy skunky Funk but then

309
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,299
when you exhaled it a couple seconds

310
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,439
later a berry thing would hit your

311
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:21,899
tongue you'd be like well now there's

312
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,820
[ __ ] melons and berries in there it

313
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,120
was really confusing complex delicious

314
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,100
weed so that was number nine that was

315
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,799
Deadhead OG number nine is what that was

316
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,540
so I took Deadhead OG number nine I took

317
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,099
two clones of that plant because you

318
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:38,159
need two clones to do what I'm about to

319
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,959
do I put silver thiosulfate on one and

320
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,059
reversed it that made pollen that was

321
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,699
all female pollen I put that female

322
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,799
pollen on the other clone it is they're

323
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,079
both number nine it is Deadhead OG

324
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,539
number nine the seeds that came from

325
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,639
there I selected one out of that one and

326
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,219
I started calling that one Grateful Dog

327
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,379
then I grew a bunch of those my favorite

328
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,019
keeper out of that I called it Grateful

329
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:03,000
Dog it was Deadhead OG but I had felt it

330
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,578
and made my own out of that that one

331
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,679
became Grateful Dog we later took do I

332
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,838
even want to tell this part once again I

333
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,458
took that original pollen and put it on

334
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,200
my Grateful Dog and made another one

335
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,119
that I called 77 if you're a Grateful

336
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,920
Dead fan uh maybe I've talked about this

337
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,278
before 77 is just one of my favorite

338
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:22,439
years of the Grateful Dead uh 72 77 that

339
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:25,439
era but 77 is [ __ ] and awesome and

340
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,740
since I had Deadhead OG I made Grateful

341
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,240
Dog and then I made 77 from that 77

342
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,560
never got released that one's mine I

343
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,899
play with that you guys can't have it

344
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,359
but that is how grateful dog got made it

345
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,578
was a Deadhead OG reversed I selfed it

346
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,800
uh and then it's one of it's an S1 it's

347
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:43,139
one of the self from the Deadhead OG so

348
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,819
that is where that came from then I was

349
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:45,838
here's where the story gets fun I'm

350
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,920
checking my notes to make sure I'm

351
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,300
staying on track here because I'm high

352
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,458
and I get rambly big shout out to our

353
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:53,699
friends uh for the lemon Jeffrey uh

354
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:54,958
concentrates so I'm A Grateful Dog right

355
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,700
um I grow a bunch of seeds out I find

356
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,278
one that's a champ I keep this one champ

357
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,040
I'm growing it I'm smoking it everywhere

358
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,720
I go in town anytime I open up my bag or

359
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,219
pack a bowl or roll a joint or light a

360
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,839
bowl people go bro what kind of weed is

361
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,240
that it was getting a lot of attention

362
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,860
that Shield was fire in my opinion on a

363
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,480
lot of other people's opinion that was

364
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,240
top quality cannabis some of the best

365
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,159
herb I've ever bred and or grew and or

366
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,299
smoked so it's one of my favorites

367
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,919
that's why you people hear about it

368
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,620
that's why it's uh always sought after

369
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,319
that's why it's a legend so I went to go

370
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,419
see a concert at Red Rocks I believe I

371
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,160
was at either Reggae on the Rocks I

372
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,139
believe it was a Reggae on the rocks and

373
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,419
Revolution was the headlining act I was

374
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,278
way into Revolution at the time I ended

375
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,479
up going to this concert by myself the

376
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:37,980
person that was supposed to go with me

377
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,079
backed out they weren't able to make it

378
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,820
I went to Reggae on the rocks by myself

379
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,799
not a big deal I love a concert by

380
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,240
myself I'm there's going to be 9 000

381
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,500
other people there to make friends with

382
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,600
it's cool I'm gonna have a good time

383
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,620
don't worry so we go to the concert I go

384
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,259
to the concert

385
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,060
and anytime I go to a concert I roll up

386
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:55,500
a lot of joints back in the day they

387
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,000
used to be more strict about letting you

388
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,399
take weed into concerts I'm in Colorado

389
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,139
now they don't really care very much but

390
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,700
back in the day they used to be more uh

391
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,959
more they would scrutinize you more for

392
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,060
having your Wii they would pat you down

393
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,739
search you take your [ __ ] so my theory

394
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,359
was I'd put three joints in this pocket

395
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,100
three joints in this pocket three joints

396
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,019
here three joints here and I would just

397
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,399
be a walking joint dispenser that way if

398
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,659
they found these three they'd go I got

399
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,458
your weed and they'd quit and I'd still

400
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,838
have 30 more joints tucked away

401
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,819
somewhere in my clothing that I could

402
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,160
get into that concert so I took a bunch

403
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,720
of joints in there and there are several

404
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,278
bands ahead of Revolution so we're

405
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,959
smoking and just hanging out dancing to

406
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:28,860
the music I'm by myself just getting

407
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,078
down

408
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,820
I kept a joint burning the entire time

409
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:34,679
like I just did not put out a joint I

410
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,660
got there I got my space I decided

411
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,578
here's where I'm standing lit up a joint

412
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:40,078
started smoking it as soon as that joint

413
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:41,519
went out it flicked the roach light up

414
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,078
another one I had plenty I was by myself

415
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,240
I was not going to run out of weed I

416
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:47,159
knew that I noticed that this kid next

417
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,600
to me this this dude next to me about my

418
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,278
age he looked cool

419
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,899
um he was smoking weed too and I noticed

420
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,458
every time I would light a joint he

421
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,019
would look over like damn that smells

422
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,539
good and he would light his own joint

423
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,159
and I would smell his weed and go nah

424
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,299
mine's better and if it was better I

425
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,740
would have shared with him if he had

426
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,819
good weed that enticed me I would have

427
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,259
been like can I hit your weed you can

428
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,000
hit my weed we would add a talk but I

429
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,519
was like I got the good weed I'ma stay

430
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,159
over here and I just hung out by myself

431
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,659
uh eventually after a few joints and me

432
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,740
lighting up a joint that do lighting a

433
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,480
joint me lighting another and he

434
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,919
lighting another and all of my stuff

435
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,539
smelled better than his every time it

436
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,519
was just the Grateful Dog is all it was

437
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:22,620
smoking eventually he leans over and he

438
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,899
goes man you got some really good weed

439
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,940
and I was like oh thank you bro and he

440
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,559
asks what is that and I told him it's

441
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,480
called The Grateful Dog and he goes I've

442
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,179
never heard heard of that and I told him

443
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,899
I bred it and now this is like this was

444
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:38,759
Colorado around probably 2008 2009 maybe

445
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,559
2010-ish I could check and find the

446
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,480
exact date uh but I know when this

447
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,698
happened and I know the timeline around

448
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,980
that time this happened and around that

449
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:49,259
time everybody in Colorado every white

450
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,079
guy with dreadlocks was a new seed

451
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:54,120
breeder had some new hash company had a

452
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,620
new dispensary or something so when I

453
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,778
was like I bred this he was just kind of

454
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,399
like he was a little bit skeptical and

455
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,078
he's like where can I get a cut of that

456
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,879
and I was like ah man I don't really

457
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,319
want to sell a cut and then he

458
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,299
introduced himself and he was like well

459
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,860
my name is this uh should I say his name

460
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:09,899
his name is Noah [ __ ] it this is history

461
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,839
bro we got to get the history right so

462
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,879
my buddy Noah said my name is Noah and I

463
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,579
am the owner of Mile High Green Cross

464
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,740
and at the time so this was around the

465
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:22,019
same year that uh Mile High Green Cross

466
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,120
won first place and the Denver High

467
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,879
Times Cannabis Cup for their banana kush

468
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,120
or banana OG so if you want to reference

469
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,220
that date when Mile High green cross won

470
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,198
the Denver Cannabis Cup for their banana

471
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,940
kush or banana OG it's banana that's all

472
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:37,500
I needed to remember that's the same

473
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,480
year that this story happened and

474
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,220
Revolution was at Red Rocks that year as

475
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,039
well that's the year that this story

476
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,899
took place so my boy Noah says I own

477
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,578
Mile High Green Cross and I've been

478
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,320
smoking banana kush and it smells good

479
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:51,000
and it won the Cannabis Cup and I was

480
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,459
like nice and then he's like I'd be

481
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,679
willing to give you this much money for

482
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,179
a cut of that plan and I'd been thinking

483
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,799
that if anybody wanted a cut of that

484
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:00,899
plant that was the number that I wanted

485
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,419
he told me the number that I'd had in

486
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,458
mind and I said that's a really good

487
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,139
acceptable deal bro and I was like I

488
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,179
live here it's about two and a half

489
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:11,039
hours from where we are right now uh

490
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,838
here's my phone number I will cut the

491
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,000
clones for you as soon as I get home

492
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,620
from this adventure seeing reggae and

493
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,958
then in about two weeks give me a call

494
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,220
come to my house and we'll [ __ ] I'll

495
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,099
give you this colon for the money that

496
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,480
you offered and so basically that's how

497
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,879
Noah

498
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,379
um acquired that clone so he followed

499
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,899
through he called me into I came home I

500
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:32,278
cut the clones two and a half ish weeks

501
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,440
later he came down and picked up his

502
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,419
clones of grateful dog when he came down

503
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,920
he also brought me other clones he

504
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:40,919
brought other stuff that's where I got

505
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,679
the um the Action Bronson cut that is uh

506
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,299
silver chem uh Kim D two super silver

507
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,979
haze I'm not sure which order that's in

508
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:48,719
but that's where I got the Action

509
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,759
Bronson cut which made a couple of great

510
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,620
crosses some of my a couple of really

511
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,480
great plants actually came the hell's OG

512
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,740
actually came from our friend Noah he

513
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,060
would just trade me and bring me a lot

514
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,159
of stuff we established a pretty cool

515
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,439
relationship let me give Noah a big

516
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,299
shout out I knew that when I was giving

517
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,039
Noah clones that my clone technique

518
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:07,019
sucked I cut a bunch of clones of

519
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,058
Grateful Dog hoping to get a couple of

520
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,078
solid cuts to give to him I wanted them

521
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:12,000
to root and so that he could have

522
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,740
something fancy when he got here to get

523
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,078
him he looked disappointed in my clones

524
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,880
and to be honest I was my clone skill

525
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,740
was lacking at the time I wasn't where I

526
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,059
am now which I'm not sad to admit I'm

527
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,558
not afraid to admit you got to start

528
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:24,660
somewhere you got to learn everything my

529
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,220
clones really sucked at this time so

530
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,839
he's like bro what you need is an easy

531
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,279
corner and I was like an easy cloner and

532
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,779
he's like the clone machine I was oh

533
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,279
tell me about it so he showed me

534
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:34,200
pictures and videos I was like I need

535
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,240
one of those and then he wanted a bunch

536
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,038
of cuts from me some stuff that I wasn't

537
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,880
really excited to let go of you know

538
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:40,019
what I mean like sometimes you have

539
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,640
clones you don't want to get rid of some

540
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,980
I'll share some of them you can't have

541
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,380
he's like I want a couple of these and I

542
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,298
was like ah and then I said he made an

543
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,179
offer one of us made an offer he offered

544
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:53,519
to trade me an easy cloner machine for a

545
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,140
couple of cuts so what we did was he

546
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,058
bought an easy cloner and brought it to

547
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,580
my place where I was growing we went

548
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:01,019
into my mother room we've cut clones and

549
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,339
filled up the easy clone machine he

550
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,558
showed me how to get it running get it

551
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:06,058
dialed in get it PhD and set up how to

552
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,879
cut the Clones how to put them in there

553
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:10,440
then about 10 days later he got to come

554
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,539
back and pick up the Clones of choice

555
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,279
out of the cloner that's how he got paid

556
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:16,200
I traded him those cuts for the easy

557
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,720
cloner and the knowledge so that's how

558
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,640
my clone game got uh springboard it got

559
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,200
Leaps and Bounds of improvement was from

560
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,120
my friend Noah from Mile High Green

561
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,259
Cross if you hear this bro fist bump big

562
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,019
up I hope you're well wherever you are

563
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:29,339
we've kind of lost touch he had a child

564
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,839
I don't think he's in the Cannabis

565
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:32,159
industry anymore he's kind of doing his

566
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,959
own thing we kind of don't keep in touch

567
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,798
anymore I'm doing my thing he's doing

568
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,298
his

569
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:37,918
um he'll come around we never lose touch

570
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:41,220
for forever that's how this industry

571
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,080
Works anyway so uh my buddy gets the cut

572
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,640
um we we meet each other at Red Rocks he

573
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:46,439
comes to my place he gets the cut we

574
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,660
develop a relationship he teaches me how

575
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,480
to fill the easy clone her now he's got

576
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,700
his uh Grateful Dog clone that he takes

577
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,860
into a commercial facility he acquires a

578
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,120
commercial grow in that grow he had a

579
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:59,219
lot of my stuff he had a lot of my

580
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,538
plants in there uh I would give him seed

581
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,558
packs and let him run the seeds in there

582
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:03,538
and then he would bring me back the

583
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,460
keepers we had a pretty cool setup so

584
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:07,099
Noah's got my clone of Grateful Dog he's

585
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,019
running it in his commercial facility

586
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:11,699
eventually Noah decides he doesn't want

587
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:13,500
that commercial facility anymore this

588
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,298
just happens the rules change the laws

589
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,859
change so much that a lot of people that

590
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:19,019
were in it for the passion for the heart

591
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:20,339
uh we couldn't come up with the million

592
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,839
dollars that we needed for some of the

593
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,879
new rule changes so instead of doing

594
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,619
that a lot of people just sold out uh

595
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,880
sold their business got some money and

596
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,319
got out of the business because it went

597
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,059
to corporate they pushed out all the the

598
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,558
people with heart and they gave it to

599
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:33,839
all the people with suits and no

600
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,579
knowledge and that's why that's why it's

601
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,199
all commercial corporate crappy weed now

602
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:38,939
in the dispensaries because the people

603
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,558
that care about it we want to do a good

604
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,840
job but the people in the suits they

605
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,460
want money coming in yesterday and that

606
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,678
kind of messes it up so my buddy Noah

607
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,679
gets out of the industry and he sells

608
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,019
his grow to a guy by the name of Colin

609
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,759
Colin is the owner of ethos Collective

610
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:56,639
or ethos seeds

611
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,980
that is how Colin acquired my Grateful

612
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,538
Dog cut so at that point he's got full

613
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,579
access it's his it's in that grow

614
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:05,220
facility that's his plant he can do

615
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:06,899
whatever he wants with it anybody can

616
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,798
breed with my seeds if you've got my

617
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,720
beans

618
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:10,980
you're allowed to breed with them if

619
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,200
you've got a clone that came from me

620
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,240
you're allowed to breed with that I did

621
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,940
not invent cannabis I didn't just cough

622
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,319
or fart or sneeze or meditate one day or

623
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,480
pull them out of my dreadlocks I did not

624
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,519
make seeds out of thin air I had to use

625
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,200
seeds and or clones they came from guess

626
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,660
what other breeders they had to come

627
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,279
from somewhere nobody invented cannabis

628
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,140
we're all using other people's Creations

629
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,240
other people's platforms other people's

630
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,340
what is it Foundation we're all using

631
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,798
other people's seeds and clones so I

632
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:39,659
feel no uh territorial or no whatever it

633
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,240
is breed with my seeds I just want

634
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,558
credit if there's one of my plants in

635
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,240
there and you list it on the package

636
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:47,339
give me some credit maybe send me a pack

637
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,558
of seeds don't change names don't be

638
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:51,899
Shady if you do everything ethically and

639
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,519
cool it may be beneficial for you to say

640
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,080
that there is one of my crosses in there

641
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,058
that makes things desirable when you put

642
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,579
something good in it people want that

643
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:01,139
[ __ ] so uh Colin acquires my Grateful

644
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:03,178
Dog through the purchase of Noah's

645
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,679
commercial facility now he's got it at

646
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,780
this point he can do whatever he wants

647
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,480
with it which is where he bred it and he

648
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:11,460
created his own call in OG I'm pretty

649
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,140
sure that's Grateful Dog Sour Diesel and

650
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,579
the white I could be wrong there could

651
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,440
be more there's flow in there somewhere

652
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:18,000
I do believe I should have Googled that

653
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,519
but that is Colin's creation that's

654
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,200
Colin OG yes there absolutely is some

655
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,639
Grateful Dog in there and then let's

656
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,259
address that second part of the question

657
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,400
I kind of touched on it just a little

658
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:28,259
bit here

659
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000
um did he buy I'm curious was this a

660
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,339
collab it wasn't really a collab and he

661
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,960
did not buy seeds he got the Clone and

662
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:35,759
then he did do the breeding work and yes

663
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,980
he is making packs and giving me credit

664
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,019
after the fact which is very uh

665
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,599
admirable and respectful of that guy to

666
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:45,359
give me credit after the fact now

667
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:49,319
um the part about is this a collab

668
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:52,079
technically uh no but untechnically yeah

669
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:54,119
we're all collabing anybody that I have

670
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,859
put their pollen and my seeds or their

671
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,298
seeds in my pollen or my plants and

672
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:59,099
they're pollen together we're

673
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:01,379
technically collabing it's not always an

674
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:03,119
approved or an endorsed or assigned or

675
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,520
whatever planned out collab for both of

676
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,139
us but yeah anybody that all you guys

677
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,359
out there if you use one of my plants a

678
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,100
female or a male and you breed it to

679
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,139
something technically basically I guess

680
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:15,418
you can say we collab I can't deny it

681
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,000
because my pollen is in your plants so

682
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:20,700
yeah technically we did collab but

683
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,440
untechnically no it wasn't like a uh a

684
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,700
planned thought out collab he just did

685
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,500
his thing

686
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,419
um and I can't be mad about it I breed

687
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,880
with a lot of his stuff the uh lemon

688
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,559
what is it the lemon OG Haze that I

689
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,840
worked with that came from Colin and I

690
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,460
made the sonic boom out of that one so

691
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,798
can't be mad about him working with my

692
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,819
stuff I'm doing it too big up Colin hope

693
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:40,440
you're well if you ever hear this bro

694
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:42,538

695

portions of this email we're all

704
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,179
collabing you guys

705
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,159

708
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,918
plan projects but most of the time uh

709
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:09,178
it's just me selecting stuff it's really

710
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,500
