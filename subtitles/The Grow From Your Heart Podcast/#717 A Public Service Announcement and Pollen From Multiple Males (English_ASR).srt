165
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,439
i know who you are

166
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,478
but if we do business i might have to

167
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,839
mail you a package to stoner dave's pot

168

farm and i don't like that [ __ ] at all

169
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,719
you guys when you're naming your company

170
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,879
let's think about um stuff like that

171
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,880
you're going to have to have packages

172
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,199
mailed to you i don't like putting

173
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,800
stoner dave's pot farm in my shipping

174
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,879
app when i mail things to people if it's

175
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,439
a t-shirt or a pack of seeds i don't

176
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,120
like it um the kid at the post office

177
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,800
the old lady at the post office the old

178
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,399
man the transgendered person working at

179
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,560
the post office that is ageless or

180
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,120
sexless gotta be careful nowadays that

181
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,800
person may see that package that says

182
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,240
stoner dave's pot farm they're like well

183
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,840
i to know what the [ __ ] is in there and

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
they may they have the ability the

185
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,918
option the opportunity to be a shady

186
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,239
[ __ ] and open it up they may have just

187
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,159
stolen your t-shirt your seeds or both

188
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,960
and i don't want that to happen

189
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,319
so

190
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,839
just a public service announcement from

191
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,800
a guy who's been doing business for a

192
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,159
long time um who's got maybe maybe more

193
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,439
steps ahead of you in business maybe

194
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,680
just some ideas maybe it's just my

195
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,079
opinion let's be more careful about

196
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,478
naming our companies you can name your

197
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,800
company stoner dave's pot farm but you

198
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,519
can also have an llc or a doing business

199
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,240
as name that i can mail [ __ ] to and talk

200
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,680
about more openly in my business affairs

201
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,160
that it's not obvious that we're just

202
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,918
doing weed business i know that stoner

203
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,360
dave's platform is a cool name but it

204
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,439
doesn't look good on shipping it doesn't

205
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,560
look good on invoices and it definitely

206
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,399
here's the other thing i want to talk

207
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
about if you start a business

208
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,159
you've got to pay taxes do you really

209
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,680
want to send something to the irs the

210
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,680
government the state and the city with

211
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,280
stoner dave's pot farm written on it

212
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,639
unless it's a cultivation or a

213
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,478
dispensary those are the only things i'd

214
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
really do that to and still i don't name

215
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,439
those

216
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,439
obvious [ __ ] pothead things i try to

217
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,639
stay a little bit businessy professional

218
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,759
but naming your company is very

219
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,280
important

220
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,800
i have to put the name of your company

221
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,519
on an invoice i have to put it on a

222
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
package it goes on a tax report so that

223
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,000
stuff

224
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,439
uh i'm dealing with right now because

225
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,800
i'm mailing a package to somebody who's

226
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,000
i'm like really bro is that really the

227
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,960
name you want me to put on that package

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,319
i'm not going to do that you're going to

229
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,560
get initials is what you're going to get

230
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,720
on your package so just the idea you're

231
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,240
basically dry snitching on yourself if

232
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,800
you put um

233
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,240
[ __ ] dank weed llc and you live in an

234
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,478
apartment building

235
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,598

236
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:54,639

a while if you've been paying attention

365
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,160
a few episodes back i discovered a

366
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,679
spider in my grow room it was a little

367
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,199
fuzzy spider

368
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,958
in california we call them mexican

369
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,040

370

371
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,838
[ __ ] i don't know the genotype i

372
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,199
don't know phenotype what we got in

373

00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,078
spider i know it was a little fuzzy ugly

377
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,680
[ __ ] spider and he looked like he

378
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,159
wasn't causing any problems he wasn't

379
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,919
making any webs and in my opinion he was

380
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,278
working security he was eating fungus

381
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,599
gnats white flies whatever may have

382
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,958
chosen to pop into that grow room he was

383
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,399
working security and taking those

384
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,719
[ __ ] out cause i didn't see any bugs

385
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,559

you just quit popping up he quit coming

389
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:40,000

390
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,360
died or uh he's [ __ ] somewhere else

391
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,958
he traveled somewhere else into that

392
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,120
area and he's just hiding out hanging

393
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,719
out now got bored uh maybe he got tired

394
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,159

00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,958
to grow and collect pollen from multiple

486
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,519
male plants and strains in one tent

487
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,399
while keeping pollen separated or should

488
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,078
it only be one male plant per tent then

489
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,278
it follows up with what is the beth okay

490
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,278
we're going to talk about two different

491
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,879
questions here the next part is what is

492
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,958
the best method for growing and

493
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,439
collecting pollen from multiple male

494
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,518
strains um all right so this is a really

495
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,920
good question the question here is can i

496
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,759
put basically can i put multiple dudes

497
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,319
in a tent and collect the pollen from

498
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,079
those and then know what that pollen is

499
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,199
my answer is no bro i would not try that

500
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:06,479
i would not do that i would not

501
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,519
recommend that

502
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,519
um

503
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,679
there's no way to prevent pollen from

504
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,440
this plant just drifting over to this

505
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,120
plant this pollen drifting over to this

506
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,959
one you have no way of knowing which

507
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,799
pollen is which even if you do go tap

508
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,119
that plant get pollen out of it the

509
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,879
first one you touch that pollen is going

510
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,679
all over all of the plants now everyone

511
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,958
you touch is the first one plus the

512
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,879
second one and then when you touch the

513
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,679
second one now you're just compounding

514
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,838
you see what i'm saying you're gonna

515
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,198
have number one you might be cool number

516
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,639
two you're gonna have number one and

517
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:35,919
number two number three is gonna be one

518
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,480
two and three and four is gonna be a

519
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:41,198
[ __ ] of every meal plan in there

520
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,879
so uh i replied to our friend leo and i

521
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,479
said i would stick with one male plant

522
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,198
in the room or you're going to have a

523
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,039
mori povich situation nobody gonna know

524
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,039
who the baby daddy is

525
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,919
if that's okay with you that's fine but

526
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,599
i like to know pedigree and history of

527
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,759
the plants there's a reason a rhyme and

528
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,320
a reason why i'm making the cross i want

529
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,680
that selected male to do a certain thing

530
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,600
if you're just trying to do an open

531
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,720
pollination of multiple plants to make

532
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,759
seeds for fun you can do multiple males

533
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,919
it is not uncommon to take let's say we

534
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,078
wanted to make an arise open pollination

535
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,079
just to make a bunch more arise seeds

536
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,119
show diversity and see what is in that

537
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:22,000
seed line i would take a pack of males

538
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,838
or a pack of a rice seeds a number 10 20

539
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,038
30 seeds whatever you got room for time

540
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:26,879
for space

541
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,279
grow them you're going to find a number

542
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,440
of males and a number of females

543
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,599
i would kind of maybe pull out a couple

544
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
things that are not not exactly what i

545
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,639
want pull them out take them out of

546
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,200
there but then leave a few males and a

547
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,960
few females in there they're all arise

548
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,679
and just do an open pollination now

549
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,919
you've got we'll just say a rise f3 open

550
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,519
pollination with three or four males and

551
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,280
five females and then when i sell them

552
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,839
or talk about them i would list

553
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,359
descriptions of each male and female and

554
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,959
then we would just see what comes out of

555
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,599
there that's a beautiful open

556
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,319
pollination because that shows diversity

557
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,000
amongst all of those different uh is it

558
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,279
genotypes and phenotypes in that one

559
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,558
because we're gonna see genotypes from

560
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,319
the two different genes crossing and

561
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,240
phenotypes from different expressions

562
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,159
gonna see a lot of different [ __ ] by

563
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,400
crossing that open pollination different

564
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,480
males to different females

565
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,080
but the problem with that in my opinion

566
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,360
you don't know who the baby daddy is so

567
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,879
if you want to make more of those you

568
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,359
don't know which male to grab and which

569
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,799
female to grab to make that happen

570
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,558
but at the same time as a breeder as a

571
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,160
somebody who wants to see a lot of

572
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,839
expression a lot of things a lot of

573
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,600
traits i want a lot of data is what i'm

574
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,199
trying to say i love that open

575
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,439
pollination because it lets me know what

576
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,360
is in there somewhere i may not know

577
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,600
exactly where it is but i know it's in

578
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,119
that pack i know somewhere i can find

579
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,119
that [ __ ] plant and i can breed that

580
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,038
again and create it shows me potential

581
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,519
so unless you're doing an open

582
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,440
pollination to forward one line i

583
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,359
wouldn't do this if you've got like a

584
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,679
male of arise and a male of jack the

585
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,678
ripper and a male of candy store i

586
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,440
wouldn't do that i would have one dude

587
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,519
in there i would get his pollen and i

588
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,038
would work with him otherwise the best

589
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,960
way to say it bro you're gonna have a

590
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,038
baby daddy situation there's no way to

591
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,558
keep that pollen separated i would not

592
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,480
do that if you really want to collect

593
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,798
pollen from multiple males i would

594
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,160
stagger them i would flower one out it

595
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,079
only takes a few days to get pollen

596
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,640
maybe 21 days to get plenty of pollen

597
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,199
out of that dude ah get pollen cut him

598
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,320
down clean it up start over get another

599
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,319
dude you could have the other guy

600
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,678
vegging just have him on standby all you

601
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,359
do is throw him into flour as soon as

602
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,640
you're done cleaning up or

603
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,599
like two days before you cut down

604
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,038
because you're gonna get time there's

605
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,959
time ahead before the pollen starts

606
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,798
coming as long as you can clean up the

607
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,880
old pollen before the new pollen starts

608
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,319
coming you can perpetually make pollen

609
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,240
for yourself

610
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,918
now don't contaminate that pollen don't

611
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,599
cross that pollen there's more to the

612
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,720
question that i do want to cover what's

613
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,798
the best method for growing and

614
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,160
collecting pollen from multiple uh i

615
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,480
wouldn't do that so that answers the

616
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,759
second part there um like you to save

617
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,919
after separating from yeah i just would

618
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,640
not do that uh definitely wouldn't have

619
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,080
multiple dudes in there um

620
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,440
i'm reading this quietly to myself to

621
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,480
make sure i covered it multiple strains

622
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,720
and having a few different males you'd

623
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,000
like to save after seven yeah i just

624
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,400
wouldn't do that dude it's not gonna

625
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,159
work the way that you want it to um it's

626
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,480
gonna be that maury povich situation

627
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,400
just like i'm talking about who is the

628
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,319
father you're not the father maybe you

629
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,600
are the father if you want to make seeds

630
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,038
if you want something to play with that

631
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,599
is really cool that could really work

632
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:20,400
for you but if you want something uh to

633
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,119
put to market to make f2s with uh to

634
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,240
really work on i would kinda um i

635
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,759
wouldn't do that that's that's the

636
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,679
bottom line there all right ladies and

637
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,519
gentlemen boys girls pimps hoes friends

638

foes smokers growers clone cutters

639
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,038
pollen chuckers all of you beautiful

640
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,319
cannabis enthusiasts out there i want to

641
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,679
thank you once again for listening to

642
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,119
another episode of the grow from your

643
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,000
heart podcast this may be a short

644
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,399
episode i'm testing a new sd card and my

645
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,880
device is flickering so i'm not sure if

646
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,720
i'm recording the audio or not let's
