67
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,699
I completely appreciate the opportunity

75
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,150

76
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,860
company I get a lot of emails and

77
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,090
questions if people ask me a lot of

78
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,769

79
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,780

80

81
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,620
forward what the hell am i doing since

82
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,689
I'm no longer there I'm working on my

83
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,980
breeding projects you guys I have got

84
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:52,449
some I've been talking about the show

85
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:54,098
the breeding project here on the show

86
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:56,679
recently I've got a breeding project it

87
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:59,039
is about 50 days into flour at this

88
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,049
point which means it's probably close to

89
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:05,858
35 ish days since it has been pollinated

90
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:07,599
which means in about 7 to 10 maybe 14

91
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:09,670
days I'm keeping a real close eye on it

92
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,250
I will be able to chop these plants down

93
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,139
and I will be able to harvest the seeds

94
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,150
as soon as the plants dry up I'll pull

95
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,369
the seeds out and then I'll be able to

96
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,319
let them dry a little bit and then I'll

97
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,000
package them up and I'll get them in a

98
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,848
few of my friends hands and we will see

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,459
what our rise f2 has done we'll see what

100
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:29,589
comes from that I've also got a grateful

101
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,030
dog female pollinated by the arize male

102
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,098

103
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,259
gonna do there's a lemon skunk

104
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:36,729

105
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:38,979

106
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:41,048
arise in there those seeds will be done

107
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:42,369
in like 15 days you guys I'm really

108
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:45,099

109

and the new dad rig they gave me I'm

131
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,759
sure I mentioned it on the last episode

132
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:26,099
but they gave me a sweet dad rig with

133
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,990
the line of Judah on it I just

134
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,970
fat dad kind of coughing a little bit

135
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,220
but it's a good thing well what have I

136
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,500
been doing on Monday night I got the

137
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,230
honor to go see one of my favorite

138
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,199
reggae artists the master Sizzla Kalonji

139
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,990
was at servantes masterpiece Ballroom in

140
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,310
Denver that was a great show you know

141
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,800
there was an opening act by the name of

142
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,149
dubs skin I have never I thought I had

143
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,280
seen dub skin before and didn't like

144
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:52,379
them but I was completely wrong you guys

145
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,229
the band that played that night that was

146
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:57,480
called dub skin was [ __ ] great their

147
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,879
drummer was very charismatic and played

148
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,040
very creative reggae beats in my opinion

149
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,180
a reggae drummer is either boring or

150
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,040
really good

151
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,079
you either lock in and you play reggae

152
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,730
beats or you kind of fill in and you do

153
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,589
a lot of cool [ __ ] and he's one of those

154
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,290
guys that gets on top of it plays a lot

155
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:15,959
of cool [ __ ] I really liked his sound I

156
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:19,550
like the way he played I shot at the dub

157
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:22,439
skip they did a great set a very uh very

158
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,060
colorado esque reggae is my best way to

159
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,189
describe that then of course Sizzla

160
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,769
Kalonji came on stage something happened

161
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:31,139
when the band switched when dub skinned

162
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:32,789
left and Sizzla came on something in the

163
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,159
soundboard happened and the drums

164
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,930
sounded like [ __ ] when Sizzla came on

165
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,000
and i don't know i'm not a sound guy but

166
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,639
i obviously run a podcast I've got a

167
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,990
soundboard I'm a drummer I was really

168
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,610
bummed out when the drum sounded like

169
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,259
[ __ ] but I tried to get past it you guys

170
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,610
I tried to look for the good I was

171
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,349
seeing one of my favorite reggae artists

172
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,000
he came from Jamaica I had to show

173
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,310
appreciation I had to get Irie I had to

174
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,870
show some support I had to get down

175
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:58,139
Sizzla puts on an amazing show you guys

176
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,209
that dude put on he used more energy in

177
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,060
an hour and 30 minutes set than most of

178
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:04,409
us use in an hour in our entire day he

179
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,720
came out on stage and a long sleeve

180
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,400
button-up shirt I don't know how long

181
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,990
his dreadlocks are but I assume they are

182
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,629
quite long but he always keeps him tied

183
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,160
up this dude's always got his dreads and

184
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:16,199
a turban on his head so he's got a

185
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,330
turban filled with dreadlocks on his

186
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,129
head and he's under the lights of the

187
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:21,959
concert and he's running in place

188
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,000
basically for an hour and a half and

189
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,669
singing and not missing a beat while

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,019
singing and this dude was covered in

191
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,490
sweat it looked like he ran through the

192
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,889
sprinklers he was so sweaty

193
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,150
so that dude put out huge energy even

194
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,159
though he was kind of frustrated with

195
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:37,289
the sound I could tell I'm a musician

196
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,610
I've watched enough stage shows I've

197
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,720
been involved I could tell that the

198
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,699
drummer couldn't hear

199
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,990
to monitor mix so he was falling off the

200
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,879
beat a little bit trying to listen to

201
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,259
everything that was [ __ ] up the

202
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,240
singer and the singer was getting mad

203
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,279
and was kind of showing it a little bit

204
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,960
but it was a great show you guys if you

205
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,059
ever get the chance to see sizzla

206
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,529
Kalonji go do it also if you get a

207
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,280
chance to see a show at servantes

208
00:06:55,529 --> 00:07:00,329
masterpiece Ballroom in denver do it

209
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,319
leave all your fancy sheet at home you

210
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:02,579
don't want to park right there with a

211
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,680
bunch of fancy [ __ ] in your car though

212
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:07,169
it's kind of a sketchy area shout out to

213
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,790
Denver alright guys let's talk about

214
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,310
cannabis let's get to some of the emails

215
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,379
that I have received because I've been

216
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,910
talking about my stuff for too long

217
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,230
let's get to it I'm opening up an email

218
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,130
right now I'm unlocking the phone I've

219
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,540
got a screenshot of a message I received

220
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:23,699
I'll click clear my throat this message

221
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:27,420
came from a friend on Instagram he calls

222
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,849
himself Terps only 710 and they said hey

223
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,740
Rasta Jeff just recently I was gifted

224
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,360
some pure Terps the first time I've

225
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,079
encountered these before so I don't know

226
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,169
too much besides they taste great sorry

227
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,550
guys I'm trying so hard not to cough I

228
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,849
got it out of my way I coughed here we

229
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,889
go

230
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,960
I get a small dab of some other

231
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,969
concentrate and then drop a drip of

232
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,279
turps on it and it comes out great great

233
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,590
and tastes amazing the thing is the

234
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,479
Terps make the dab sizzle a tiny bit not

235
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:56,789
like the fourth of July tan brain status

236
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,470
but definitely a small sizzle that

237
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,270
wouldn't happen to the concentrate with

238
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,610
the addit without the added Terps is

239
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:05,399
this normal they ask and then they also

240
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,120
said any info any info would be great

241
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,799
thank you

242
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,079
longtime podcast listener hey thanks for

243
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,030
listening and then they say can honestly

244
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,759
say I've listened to all episodes since

245
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:16,469
episode 1 and I feel like we're the best

246
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,639
friends well we are have you been

247
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,530
listening for that long we are friends

248
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,899
I've been listening to Chris Hardwick

249
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:26,189
The Nerdist I didn't fall on Chris

250
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,379
Hardwick basically since he was on

251
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,668
singled out in the early 90s and I have

252
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,500
seen Chris Hardwick spiral out of

253
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:33,418
control and ruin his career and then get

254
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,830
his [ __ ] back together and now Chris

255
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:36,389
Hardwick is on top of his game and I

256
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,919
heard Chris Hardwick say several years

257
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:40,348
ago that all he ever wanted to do was

258
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,149
play Red Rocks and I got to see Chris

259
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:43,950
Hardwick at the oddball Comedy Tour a

260
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,319
couple of years ago play Red Rocks and

261
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,120
it felt like I was watching one of my

262
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,500
friends reach his goals because I've

263
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,000
been following him for so long and I

264
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,740
listened to his podcast so I completely

265
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,500
know what you mean about us being

266
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,539
friends and I agree

267
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,919
if we ever meet if I walk past you in an

268
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:58,299
event if we're in the same area you

269
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,879
better come see what's up and introduce

270
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:03,279
yourself because we were friends now all

271
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,990
right let's get to the point uh you said

272
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,740
you've listened since episode number one

273
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,240
Wow

274
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,950
I'm embarrassed when I think about

275
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,320
episode 1 but thank you I appreciate it

276
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,660
thanks for sticking along so you asked

277
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,280
about dabs sizzle

278
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:17,169
yeah that's understandable and that's

279
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,189
acceptable I think as long as it's not

280
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:19,360
going too crazy

281
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,160
the first thing I'm gonna say is you

282
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,450
might have your nail just a little bit

283
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,709
too hot when you're dabbing you might

284
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,210
want to let the nail cool if you're

285
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,379
using the email turn it down just a

286
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,660
little bit if you're getting too much

287
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:30,009
sizzle but what's happening is I'm gonna

288
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:32,409
pick up my little Jarrah chirps here and

289
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,330
let these Terps talk me through this the

290
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:35,829
Terps are liquid at least my Terps are

291
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,330
completely liquid I'm holding them in a

292
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,639
jar I can pour them out of this little

293
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,100
vial if I wanted to they are completely

294
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,779
liquid so you're putting that liquid

295
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,519
onto your dab and also you might be

296
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:47,799
using a little bit more than necessary

297
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,689
if you're pouring it onto there and it's

298
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,219
sizzling when you dab it you might be

299
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,900
able to put about half of that and

300
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,399
conserve your dad's a little bit make it

301
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,019
last twice as long and you're still

302
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,629
gonna get the flavor you're still gonna

303
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:00,399
get everything I know how it is I'm

304
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:02,139
excessive too I like to do big fat dads

305
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,220
with way too much Terps but if it's

306
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,080
sizzle and that might be part of the

307
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,180
thing but what's happen what's happening

308
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,710
is you're just putting moisture on a hot

309
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:11,019
nail and if you would put water on a hot

310
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,210
nail it would sizzle sometimes in the

311
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,649
summer when you get sweaty and you have

312
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,879
to manhandle your shatter with your

313
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:17,769
fingers because there's no other way to

314
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,088
pick it up or whatever sometimes a DAB

315
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,799
will sizzle from that too because it's

316
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:22,750
got moisture from your fingers so all

317
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,419
that's happening is basically you're

318
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,649
boiling the turps on the hot nail so

319
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:27,879
when they hit the nail it's just like

320
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:29,799
you're throwing some water and a skillet

321
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,659
and it's going and you're just getting

322
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,419
that sizzle it's not a problem it's not

323
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:36,009
a bad thing I you might be too hot he

324
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:38,860

want to know all right our next email

352
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:28,549

353
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,930
greetings Rasta I have a couple of

354
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:32,269
questions for you I was hoping to hear

355
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:34,069
your thoughts on question number one I'm

356
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:36,079
always reading and researching on

357
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,970
cannabis cultivation for endless hours I

358
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,889
was hoping you could list your top three

359
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,500
books that you have found a lot of good

360
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:45,019
information from or have heard good

361
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,169
things about I really love this question

362
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:49,490
I love going to the internet for answers

363
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:51,559
but the problem with the Internet

364
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,299
is that anybody can post anything and I

365
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,279
find a lot of [ __ ] posted on the

366
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:57,709
Internet and I see people giving people

367
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,299
advice that is just going to lead to

368
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,430
more problems and they're not getting to

369
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:02,839
the root of the evil they're like hey

370
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,549
I've got this problem and they're like

371
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,050
well then do this and I'm like oh [ __ ]

372
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:07,969
that's just gonna make the problem

373
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:09,319
you've got even worse and cause three

374
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,139
more problems down the line that you're

375
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,580
not aware of so I try to teach new

376
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:15,919
growers to avoid the internet a little

377
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,770
bit because the Internet can be really

378
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,409
full of [ __ ] so the way to go is trusted

379
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:23,000
books from trusted authors if you want

380
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:24,439
to know three books I would highly

381
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,990
recommend the first one I would

382
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,960
recommend for everybody is called

383
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,120
marijuana botany an advanced study the

384
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,310
propagation and breeding of distinctive

385
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,279
cannabis and I know that's a really long

386
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:40,159
title but if you go to amazon.com and

387
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,379
you search for marijuana botany by

388
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,529
Robert Connell Clark you will find that

389
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:47,629
book it's less than $20 with free

390
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,669
shipping so that's the book I would

391
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:52,129
start with marijuana botany by Robert

392
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:54,289
Connell Clark then I would go with

393
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:56,080
another trust and classic I would go

394
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:58,370
with the marijuana horticultural

395
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,129
indoor/outdoor medical growers Bible

396
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,649
from Jorge Cervantes Jorge is kind of

397
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,639
old school actually both of the author's

398
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,779
I've told you about her kind of old

399
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,919
school all three of the author's I'm

400
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,509
gonna tell you about are kind of old

401
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,129
school they've started they started

402
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:12,080
growing cannabis and breeding cannabis

403
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,970
probably before I was born so these guys

404
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,830
have been doing it for a long time a lot

405
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,920
of their techniques are very old and

406
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,990
they seem a little outdated but this

407
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,399
has been around forever and these guys

408
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,709
were doing it right back then and this

409
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,440
[ __ ] still works and it's like karate

410
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:28,819
you gotta learn the basics you started

411
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,279
off as a white belt your goal is to get

412
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,629
that that crystally green belt so you

413
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,429
guys started off as a white belt get

414
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:35,899
these books get a good foundation and

415
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:38,000
then build on that from there so the

416
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:40,220
first book again was marijuana botany by

417
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,629
Robert Connell Clark the second book is

418
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,610
the marijuana horticultural

419
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:45,980
indoor/outdoor medical growers Bible

420
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,509
from Jorge Cervantes they keep updating

421
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,269
that book I'm sure you can find it on

422
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:51,620
Amazon for like 20 bucks then the third

423
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:53,870
book I would recommend is Edie

424
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,179
Rosenthal's marijuana growers handbook

425
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,549
which is actually the Oaksterdam course

426
00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:00,948
guide it is the book that they use at

427
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:03,559
Oaksterdam in California to teach people

428
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:05,899
how to grow cannabis professionally this

429
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,119
book is very in-depth and I really like

430
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:10,789
the way it's laid out it teaches you the

431
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,198
basics of how to set up the grow excuse

432

me how to set up a grow how to maintain

433
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:16,939

434
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,860

435
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,930

436
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,000
vegging flowering teaches you how to

437
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:25,370
look for bugs how to identify bugs this

438
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,919
is a great book it's an Rosenthal's

439
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,350
marijuana growers handbook and then it's

440
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:33,169
also known as your complete guide for

441
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:36,079
medical marijuana that one I'm looking

442
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:38,719
at it right now on Amazon for $23.99

443
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,828
with $4.99 shipping I'm sure if I

444
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,629
shopped around a little bit we could

445
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:43,219
find it for cheaper those are the first

446
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:45,078
three books I would start with then

447
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,730
there's a book by soma that I really

448
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,409
like I do not have the book sitting next

449
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,990
to me right now but it's a small thin

450
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:53,028
paperback cannabis book from soma then

451
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,100
DJ sure also wrote a book by the same

452
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:58,159
publisher that sohmas book is out from

453
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,680
then there's also a book called let's

454
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,659
grow a pound which is a very useful book

455
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:05,179
in my opinion it's called let's grow a

456
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:07,458
pound from see more buds I think that

457
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:09,739
book would do every grower some justice

458
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,568
it goes from day one of the grow all the

459
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,610
way up to harvest is a very helpful

460
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:15,679
guide and while I'm thinking about it

461
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,509
let's throw in a book called secrets of

462
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,979
the west coast masters by a dude named

463
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:21,139
drew West that should be plenty of books

464
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,569
to get you started you can find a lot of

465
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,009
those books on PDF form for free on the

466
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:26,509
internet somewhere just a quick search

467
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,039
and you should be able to find them all

468
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,929
of those books will be available on

469
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,589

475
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:45,120
those are my favorite books let's get to

476
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:47,819
part two of your question part 2 if your

477
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,350
question goes like this I have read the

478
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,180
digital ballasts can mess with and

479
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,100
disrupt radio signals like ham radio and

480
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:53,669
Wi-Fi cable reception do you know this

481
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,680
to be true

482
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:57,360
have you heard you were alright as long

483
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,879
as they have something called an RF

484
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,379
shield and then he says thanks again for

485
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,720
the love on the show and keep dabbing

486
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:05,129
and sipping on that drink that's funny

487
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,509
cuz I said I need a little sip one time

488
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:08,009
I knew somebody who's gonna give me [ __ ]

489
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,409
about that thanks for paying attention

490
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:12,990
so let's talk about digital ballasts

491
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:16,409
that mess with and disrupt radio signals

492
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,720
that is possible they do put off a

493
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:20,519
frequency and if that frequency matches

494
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,050
your TV or your radio it could

495
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,509
definitely cause interference or be

496
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:26,579
picked up by something the thing is most

497
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:30,389
digit most of the digital ballasts

498
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:32,879
available work any much higher frequency

499
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:35,699
than what most personal electronics

500
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,740
would work at so most of them are in the

501
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,680
200 range and most of your personal

502
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,960
appliances are in the 60 range so you

503
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,269
should not have any problem when it does

504
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,580
happen you are usually using a lot of

505
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:48,960
ballasts like more than 15 or 20 that

506
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,300
would take enough that would be enough

507
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,610
ballasts to disrupt some signal or when

508
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:54,689
you're getting imported Chinese ballots

509
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,850
that are poorly made from other

510
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,730
countries and they have a lower

511
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:02,700
frequency vibration and those will be

512
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,600
more likely to cause a problem the thing

513
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,549
that people are worried about is that

514
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,860
they're putting off an RF frequency and

515
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:10,619
that frequency is able to be picked up

516
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:13,289
by law enforcement so that makes a lot

517
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,208
of people paranoid most of the new

518
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:16,799
ballasts are made with an RF shield

519
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:19,679
inside of them and they're at such a

520
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,419
high frequency that it will not disrupt

521
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,490
your household appliances it will not

522
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,230
disrupt your Wi-Fi back in the day that

523
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,328
was a thing but they've kind of solved

524
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,789
that problem now so you should be cool

525
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:30,869
an alternative to the the new digital

526
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:32,279
ballasts you could go with your old

527
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:33,869
magnetic ballasts the problem with those

528
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:35,759
is it's hard to take good photography

529
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:37,469
they make your pictures look like [ __ ]

530
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,119
so that's your option you can either

531
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,009
have the digital's and you can be

532
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,109
paranoid about the RF frequency or you

533
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,700
can have those old magnetics and you can

534
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:45,479
take shitty pictures but I really don't

535
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,860
think you have anything

536
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,410
worried about most of the new ballasts

537
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:52,168
you should be just fine in my opinion

538
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,340
there's a huge article on THC farmer

539
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,870
about this if you want to read about it

540
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,178
on THC farmer that's where I did my

541
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:57,750
research a lot of those guys bicker

542
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,419
about it

543
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:03,029
but from what I read I think we'll all

544
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,259
be ok with our digital ballasts all

545
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:05,759
right dude I truly appreciate your

546
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:07,650
interaction and your emails I'll keep

547
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,690
dabbing and sipping on that drink if you

548
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,070
keep sending me good emails like this I

549
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,730
appreciate your message

550
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:16,379
Mazhar 421 all right I've got another

551
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,690
email this one comes from our friend

552
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,309
Artie and he says hey Rasta Jeff don't

553
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,289
remember the episode but you mentioned a

554
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,480
female plant dying as soon as you put it

555
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:27,000
in the room with the girls well I had

556
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,798
the same exact thing happen except my

557
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,929
damn killer male plant shriveled up and

558
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,599
died within 48 hours of entering the

559
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:35,759
room any idea on either situation

560
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,298
thanks for the show again hope to see

561
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:42,390
that black cherry chem soon Artie ah so

562
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:45,480
a long time ago I did a breeding project

563
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:48,540
where I had a reversed was I putting be

564
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,279
okay I had a reversed golden goat in the

565
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,940
room so I had a golden goat that was a

566
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,399
female

567
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,200
I applied silver thiosulfate to it for

568
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,059
about 14 days before I put it into

569
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,429
flower I put it into flower

570
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:01,950
I continued applying silver Co sulfate

571
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:05,070
to this plant this golden goat plant

572
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,340
became a male that produced male pollen

573
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:11,308
this is how I make feminized seeds so I

574
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,899
put female plants in that room so that

575
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:14,399
they can receive that pollen and so that

576
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,960
everybody so I time the plants

577
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,298
differently some plants go in early some

578
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,160
plants go in later for breeding so I put

579
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:23,250
the plants in most of the girls looked

580
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,590
great I put a clone of headband in that

581
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,140
room to flower it was a female and it

582
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:31,399
looked okay as soon as the pollen from

583
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:34,470
that reversed golden goat plant hit that

584
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,660
female headband plant that plant

585
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,460
shriveled up and died overnight and I do

586
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,140
not know what caused it because all of

587
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,940
the plants in that room got treated the

588
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,429
same everything was the same the feed

589
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,808
was the same the amount of water they

590
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:48,179
got was basically the same

591
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:49,889
nobody was overfed nobody was under fed

592
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,900
nobody was over or under watered

593
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,160
everything slim seemed legit in there

594
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,409
the temperature was cool there weren't

595
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,240
bugs in there everything was cooled but

596
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:58,910
for some reason when the pollen hit that

597
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,799
plant the whole plant [ __ ] died

598
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,210
and I have no idea what caused it I've

599
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,649
talked to other breeders about it and

600
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,970
they all scratch their heads and look at

601
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,380
me like I'm crazy and they're like I

602
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,240
don't know something else was wrong and

603
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,430
I something I don't know what happened

604
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,079
honestly so this guy said he had

605
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,970
something similar happened he said his

606
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:17,059
killer mail plant shriveled up and died

607
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:21,170
within 48 hours of entering the room any

608
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:23,000
idea on that um that's really weird so

609
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,740
you took a male plant from a veg room

610
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,960
and then you put it into the flowering

611
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,759
room to initiate flower and within 48

612
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,549
hours it's straight-up croaked and died

613
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:34,490
I do not know offhand what would cause

614
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:37,250
that I've got a few guesses first I

615
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:39,170
would like to know was that plant is

616
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,789
this a soil or a hydro grow that's

617
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:44,509
something that I really am curious about

618
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:47,329
because soil is much more forgiving and

619
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:49,400
hydro you have more option to damage the

620
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,139
roots and everything happens much more

621
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,720
quickly in hydro so that would explain a

622
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:57,050
little bit more if it were hydro but my

623
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,940
main questions did it go from like a t5

624
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,409
light to right underneath a thousand

625
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,509
watt light cuz that may have been a

626
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:05,060
little bit much you may have just

627
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:06,740
[ __ ] microwaved it or barbecued it or

628
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:08,389
broiled it however you want to put it

629
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,490
you may have just put that little tiny

630
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,140
plant that came from a t5 or a little

631
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,000
fluorescent if you moved it to a

632
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,980
thousand and put the thousand too close

633
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,809
you might have roasted it you might uh

634
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,160
you might have just overpowered it

635
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,889
wasn't ready for all that you gave it

636
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,210
too much energy and it died it may have

637
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,970
gotten too high may have had too little

638
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,920
light also you may have gone from you're

639
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,170
a thousand watt in your bedroom where

640
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,250
there was only that one plant he had all

641
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,289
the space and then he put it in the

642
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,849
other room and it was not getting enough

643
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:36,649
light maybe that killed it maybe it was

644
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:38,029
overcrowded maybe you hid it between a

645
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,910
bunch of girls and it didn't get enough

646
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:44,269
air that's possible but maybe it got too

647
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,890
hot maybe it got too cold maybe it got

648
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,089
too wet before you carried it into the

649
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,670
flower room or when you put it in the

650
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:50,659
flower room did you get excited and

651
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,100
overwater it you're like this sucker is

652
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,920
gonna be a beast and the over-watering

653
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:57,319
or did you overfeed it or did it need

654
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,940
nutrients I don't know your room if I

655
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:01,279
had if I could walk into your grow room

656
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,690
and look at the room and the other

657
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,240
plants that's another question I need to

658
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:07,250
ask myself how did the other plants look

659
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,569
do you have other plants in that room do

660
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,849
you have females in there that look

661
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:12,349
happy because if the females in the room

662
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:14,058
look happy that it's just this

663
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:15,500
plant we got to figure out but if all

664
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:18,168
the plants are shitty then it's the room

665
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,579
we have to figure out so there are a lot

666
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:21,110
of questions I wish I could walk into

667
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,548
the room with plants and see what's

668
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:24,889
going on in there I wish I could just

669
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:26,660
walk in take a quick look around the

670
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,520
entire room look at your ducting look at

671
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,140
your lighting look at your source of

672
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,849
fresh air look at how you're getting rid

673
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,919
of the old air look at how you're

674
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:35,269
handling humidity there are a lot of

675
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,669
things I would like to see in there that

676
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:39,500
would help me answer this unfortunately

677
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:41,150
I'm not able to view your room through

678
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,619
my brain yet in the [ __ ] future

679
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,759
that'll be so happy when we can do that

680
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,199
I'll just teleport to your room I'll

681
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,690
check it out right quick tell you what's

682
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,250
going on but I can't do that so if you

683
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,110
want to send me some pictures or send me

684
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,569
some follow-ups to all of the stuff that

685
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:55,038
I just said I will talk about it further

686
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:56,899
on the show let me know what's going on

687
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,308
because it is really strange that you

688
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,950
put a plan into a room and it died

689
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:02,538
within 48 hours check out all the things

690
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,220
that I asked you probably check all that

691
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:05,658
your sound like an experienced grower

692
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,089
that was probably all the stuff you went

693
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:10,280
to right away but check that out if it

694
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:11,899
was hydro and you moved it from another

695
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,609
room to another room I'm assuming there

696
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,830
was some root damage is what caused that

697
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:19,759
plant to die because last night I

698
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:22,609
transplanted a medium amount of clones

699
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:25,519
from an easy cloner into Solo cups with

700
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:27,168
soil and I got kind of hasty and I was

701
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,879
in a hurry and I felt myself kind of

702
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:30,409
[ __ ] one up when I pushed the soil down

703
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,360
I felt that press too hard and I've kind

704
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,280
of felt the roots crush today that

705
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:36,079
plants all drooped over it looks really

706
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,240
pissed off it may pull through it may

707
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,548
die I can spare that clone it's not a

708
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,349
big deal I like having a hundred percent

709
00:23:40,548 --> 00:23:45,408
success I'm gonna have ninety nine

710
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:47,629
because of that [ __ ] but just a little

711
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:50,600
bit of root damage on a hydro plant is a

712
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,039
huge difference in happiness compared to

713
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,449
just a soil plant you can't mess up the

714
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:55,640
roots as much on a soil plant is what

715
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,110
I'm getting at I guess the bottom line

716
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,400
is I really don't know what caused your

717
00:23:57,109 --> 00:24:00,558
plant to die I wish I had a better

718
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,870
answer for you I really hope you had a

719
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,279
clone of that male plant if not you just

720
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:06,589
got to get some seeds and do some more

721
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:08,058
Fino hunting when you email me back let

722
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:10,069
me know what strain you were working

723
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:12,288
with and how many seeds you went through

724
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:14,000
to find that mail I've got questions for

725
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,879

726
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,409

727
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,330

you guys I received two emails one was

730
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:26,269
about

731
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:28,639
LEC that's light-emitting

732
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:30,558
make lighting the new 315 seem to be

733
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:33,019
really popular the company that makes

734
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,719
the 315 s just put out a smaller version

735
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:37,249
a lower wattage light I haven't paid too

736
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:39,440
much attention to that I need to do some

737
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:41,929
research on it also I got an email about

738
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,209
LED light emitting diode lighting

739
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:44,989
honestly you guys I've never grown with

740
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:47,239
an LED

741
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:49,219
I have never grown with an LEC I've used

742
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:51,229
some t fives and some thousand watt

743
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:53,899
HBS's and some thousand watt metal

744
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:55,429
halides that's how I've grown I've done

745
00:24:53,898 --> 00:24:57,398
some fours and sixes but I mean I've

746
00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:00,649
never done anything other than

747
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:02,388
high-intensity discharge lighting so I'm

748
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:04,939
going to find the people that make the

749
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:06,678
315 s you guys if you can put me in

750
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,298
touch with the guy that makes of 315 I'd

751
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,219
love to get him on the podcast let him

752

run us through the differences of LED

762
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:32,628
lighting and HID lighting because I

763
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,548
