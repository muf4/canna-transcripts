your heart podcast

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,599
you know i like to start the podcast off

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,560
by talking about what i'm smoking

28
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,239
today i've been taking dabs of tkd

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,560
number 10 live batter

30
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,359
this is a blend of chem d and triangle

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,118
kush

32
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,118
i've been trying to take a dab and

33
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,959
experience the flavor before i read the

34
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:21,519
label and let the label influence my

35
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,279
mouth

36
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,000
i took a dab and i said wow that tastes

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,000
like o.g kush and sour mothballs

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,118
then i read the label and it says the

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,239
flavor should taste

40
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,680
like sour petrol and lemon so

41
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,359
there's kind of a cushy description in

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
there and the sour part fell in but i

43
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,239
got a sour

44
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,519
cushy mothball which may not sound like

45
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,879

00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,599
lighting went to [ __ ] hopefully it'll

00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,038
tips or i think that's the name anyway i

170
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,160
don't remember when i joined but

171
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,000
sometimes

172
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,320
something in a post catches my eye when

173
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
i'm on there there are a lot of facebook

174
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,319
groups that talk about growing cannabis

175
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,839
and consuming cannabis i try to be

176
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,360
helpful and encouraging in those groups

177
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,319
but sometimes i have to leave because

178
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,199
there are people

179
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,319
uh you can get really really bad advice

180
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,319
in there and that is a lot of what

181
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,478
inspired this podcast i would see

182
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,759
a horrible advice and i said horrible

183
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,279
you're gonna get that h across the

184
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,600
screen again horrible

185
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,638
i would see horrible terrible advice on

186
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
social media

187
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,680
on forums mainly i started in the forums

188
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,280
reading

189
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,038
roll it up and other forms from back in

190
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,799
the day and i would just see people say

191
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,079
like well spray that plant with gasoline

192
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,840
and i'd be like wait what the [ __ ]

193
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,879
and they would mean it they'd think that

194
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,839
it's a really good thing and they're

195
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,439
giving advice

196
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,279
and i think a lot of the advice i saw

197
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,240
was going to compound problems yeah it

198
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,839
may look like you

199
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,759
solved the problem today but tomorrow

200
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,239
you're gonna have gasoline-flavored buds

201
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,160
like

202
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,680
so it just drove me crazy that's a lot

203
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
of what started this podcast seeing that

204
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,600
[ __ ] on facebook

205
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,120
and i agree with you uh it can be tricky

206
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,400
to navigate i want to catch up and fall

207
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,160
back into this one

208
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,079
there is more to this it says so as soon

209
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,759
as someone posts a question and needs

210
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,519
uh so as soon as someone posts a

211
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,038
question and needs help there are like

212
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,000
20 plus comments almost

213
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,199
instantly some are the wrong answer some

214
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,879
are right or

215
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,600
ask the right follow-up questions but

216
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,759
the thing i hate is that 25

217
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
of the people talk [ __ ] and make fun of

218
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,520
the guy or his plants on his first grow

219
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,479
or they are just

220
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,120
rude yeah it's ridiculous i try to help

221
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,719
people

222
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,959
people get mad at me because i ask

223
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,319
questions i say well what was your goal

224
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,439
when you fed the plants

225
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,560
[ __ ] humans i don't know whatever you

226
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,839
feed the plants what was your goal when

227
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,959
you fed the plants i just picked humans

228
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,159
from bob's burgers that's where that

229
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,198
came from if you wondered why i pulled a

230
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
strange reference because there were

231
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,560
humans in the burgers

232
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,000
but why did you feed your plants [ __ ]

233
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,199
mushrooms why'd you pour kombucha

234
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,079
in there what was your goal when i asked

235
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,680
them that they're like well who do you

236
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,359
think you are i'm like

237
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
you're on social media asking for grow

238
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,240
advice and i have a lot of it and i just

239
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,439
want to know why you're what your goal

240
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,720
is and maybe i can steer you in the

241
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,839
right direction but yes people are

242
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,319
confrontational

243
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,239
uh and really ridiculous and boastful

244
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,400
and territorial on social media

245
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
so it goes on it says so a guy posted

246
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,758
last week asking what was going on with

247
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,280
his plants and a pick

248
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,199
i was thinking heat stress but couldn't

249
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,758
tell for sure but me and most of the

250
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,439
growers

251
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,360
are having the same issue right now yeah

252
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,800
because it's hot outside uh

253
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,879
these people ripped them apart because

254
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
he's about posting such a shitty plant

255
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,879
and

256
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,319
all sorts of [ __ ] isn't it sad but then

257
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,560
you go look at those people talking [ __ ]

258
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,160
you look at their plants

259
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,439
they're even worse they're even sadder

260
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,479
they don't realize they've got [ __ ]

261
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,918
spider mites everywhere

262
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,519
like my plants look amazing and you're

263
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,120
looking like you've got spider mites you

264
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,000

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,480
a totally different vibe i've got a

317
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,519
different approach to growing sometimes

318
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
they've got a different approach to

319

growing sometimes

320
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,000

334
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,120
an official name but

335
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,080
let's keep on moving because dabs and

336
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,839
rambles anyway

337
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,399
because this community and facebook

338
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,560
blows yes the community on facebook

339
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,759
can blow i try not to let it get to me

340
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,599
but sometimes

341
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,720
uh you do the thing it looks like you

342
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,080
just got in a fight with your girlfriend

343
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,120
or you just got a shitty text from work

344
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
or something where you just close the

345
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,278
app and throw your phone down you're

346
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,039
like ah

347
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,399
like facebook makes me do that that's

348
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,679
the only app that i get that feeling

349
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,759
from when i just go uh

350
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,799
i seriously face palm like [ __ ] and

351
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,679
everyone's like what's wrong like that's

352
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,359
just facebook

353
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,639
so i stay off of there a little bit

354
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,200
because i don't need to poison myself

355
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,720
with that

356
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,440
i try to put up a big filter when i'm

357
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,240

360
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,838
i kind of agree with you i try to say

361
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680

377
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,119
comfortable breaking your balls on the

378
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,879
internet

379
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,959

nice following on

384
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,759
instagram i do instagram lives i've been

385
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,360
at this for a minute i was on periscope

386
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,480
before periscope was popular

387
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,240
i've been doing this for a while i can

388
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,000
handle some trolling i'm not asking for

389
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,159
it i'm not saying troll me but

390
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,679
uh the messages and the uh the

391
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,958
non-encouraging words that's what i'm

392
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,599
gonna say that we got on

393
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,559
youtube and emails from the last uh show

394
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,839
uh yeah people

395
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,359
they're they're keyboard warriors when

396
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,560
there's no uh face to face contact

397
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
they'll say whatever the [ __ ] they think

398
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,879
they can say

399
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,759
uh but they don't say that [ __ ] when

400
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,559
you're in the same room with them it's

401
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,399
way different

402
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,159
it says there's a lot of that out there

403
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,320
now and no one wants to be the one who

404
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,240
doesn't know and if there's 50 replies

405
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,920
chances are it got covered yes that is

406
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,000
the truth most of the time the useful

407
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,879
information gets buried by all of the

408
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,639
[ __ ]

409
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,159
i will post a link to the podcast in

410
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,278
three or four sentences about what we

411
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,879
can do for your grow

412
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,320
and it'll just get you got to filter

413
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,399
through to even find it it's

414
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
feed it vinegar spray it with fire dip

415
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,799
it in bleach and then there's my useful

416
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,079
answer

417
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,599
and it just gets overlooked and then

418
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:42,000
people laugh at me for giving useful

419
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,440
advice

420
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,360
like your hippie magic won't work and

421
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,720
i'm like what the [ __ ] a commercial

422
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,320
[ __ ] grower probably do commercial

423
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,759
consultations and you should pay me for

424
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,278
the [ __ ] sentence i just posted but

425
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,360
they don't even enjoy it

426
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,799
um we're gonna keep going it says but

427
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,079
you would be surprised so people just

428
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,559
argue with whatever the other

429
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,159
guy said then someone says then it's

430
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,119
time to battle and the guy posting is

431
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,759
stuck there

432
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,879
uh with no answer and confused and he is

433
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,039
racist yeah that's

434
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,958
that's [ __ ] funny yeah it turns into

435
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,000
uh the f trump and i shouldn't even have

436
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,159
said that since i may

437
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,240
bleep that out actually it turns into

438
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,759
the anti-trump and then it also turns

439
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,959
into that guy being racist and then it

440
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,319
just continues

441
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,000
uh yeah that is social media bro um

442
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,680
usually i make a bunch of notes on my

443
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
paper when i print out your email

444
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,719
i write a couple of notes so i don't i

445
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,160
don't just blindly go into it i've got

446
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,278
something to say after it

447
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,838
all i wrote on your message was yep i

448
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:33,360
agree

449
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,880
that's that's what i got for you dude

450
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,480
that is social media that is facebook

451
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,399
that is a large part i've said this why

452
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,159
i started this podcast because

453
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
it's hard to filter through the [ __ ]

454
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,159
on the internet you don't have to have

455
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,480
any uh

456
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,159
qualifications any documentation no

457
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,360
licensing no regulations you could post

458
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,439
whatever you want on the internet and

459
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,200
some people will believe it

460
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,720
so that's where we are with society

461
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
today that's not just cannabis that is

462
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,360
the whole damn world all right my buddy

463

465
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,120
tough time on social media don't let it

466
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,278
get to you

467
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,320
uh remember that that is the place where

468
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:03,919
i don't know it's just where all the

469
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,360
nonsense happens the real stuff is

470
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,719
happening here the real people that care

471
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,079
we're not doing that to each other when

472
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,959
we're talking hang out with some real

473
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,319
folks

474
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,359
you sound like a great person a great

475
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
guy you get a good head on your

476
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,600
shoulders

477
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,039
don't let social media get to you i know

478
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,480
you're trying to referee in there

479
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,919
but it's like trying to herd kittens

480
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,360
refereeing on facebook you just got to

481
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,919
let it happen just do your thing

482
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,519
enjoy your grow if people want to listen

483
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,958
to you maybe start your own group that

484
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,159
may be the way to do it but people

485
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,278
you'll get a following of people that

486
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,559
realize you know what you're talking

487
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:29,759
about and they'll listen to you they'll

488
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,319
ask you questions

489
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,078
and that little bit will make the

490
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,959
[ __ ] face punch feeling that you get

491
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:36,399
from facebook

492
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,679
it'll make all of that go away it'll

493
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,039
balance it out and make it feel good

494
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,319
you'll get a little bit of reward

495
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,000
to go with the face punch is what i

496
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,360
think i'm trying to say all right papa

513
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,079

uh fresh breath of fresh air to be in

515
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,039
the mountains where everyone wore masks

516
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,480
in public

517
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,480
uh yeah you were up there getting fresh

518
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,759
air no mask no uh social distancing

519
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,159

536
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000

for you and i'll try to be brief three

540
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,240
questions bro three

541
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,679
all right i'll do them all just to spoil

542
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,159
you and thank you for the great message

543
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,078
it said

544
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,439
i had a plant herm in my flower tent

545
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,919
with other plants

546
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,440
i was during week six that is the worst

547
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,919
[ __ ] time for herms

548
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,519
uh it says it was not one of yours

549
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,799
that's a good thing it says of which i

550
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,159
have two ggs and one l-o-g

551
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,359
a funny thing when i read that the first

552
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,958
time i had to rack my brain i was like

553
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,079
what the [ __ ] is log and i just gave up

554
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,359
and moved on i just hit me it's

555
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:18,638
liberation og

556
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,919
had to stop thinking about it and the

557
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,639
information just fell right out of the

558
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,120
sky to me

559
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,440
uh gg of course is probably the golden

560
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
goat it goes on it says i've inspected

561
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,760
my other plants and i don't think it was

562
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,078
seeded

563
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,240
and it's almost harvest time so maybe i

564
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,319
skated by this time however

565
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,560
i wondered how long does pollen stay

566
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,320
viable when it has been released with my

567
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,039
other plants that is a really good

568
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,879
question

569
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,039
that is going to be environmentally

570
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,958
dependent it'll probably sit around in

571
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,198
the open for like a month maybe longer

572
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,359
maybe six maybe eight weeks depending on

573
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,198
the environment keep that in mind

574
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,199
the heat will destroy and break down

575
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,359
your pollen cold will preserve your

576
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,479
pollen humidity and moisture

577
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,240
destroy pollen so if you've had it 50 60

578
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,079
humidity in that room that pollen is

579
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,039
getting deactivated a little bit more

580
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:04,958
every day

581
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,399
if you've got it up to 70 or 80 in there

582
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,319
the pollen is starting to cake together

583
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,480
it's turning weird colors it's not going

584
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,800
to be any good anymore after that

585
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,639
um but if you don't touch it i'm going

586
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,159
to say it's probably good if you just

587
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,759
if you just dumped pollen right here on

588
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,679
the desk and left it there and left it

589
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,039
this room stays pretty cool it's not too

590
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,638
hot because i got

591
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,719
sneakers and seeds in here as i try to

592
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,120
keep it cool they both like the cool

593
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,560
i kind of like it cool i guess i think

594
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,839
that pollen would stay on the desk for

595
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,599
quite a while and i could tell when it

596
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,199
starts changing colors and getting bad

597
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,040
on me and that will take a little bit

598
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,240
i can keep pollen in the fridge for a

599
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,599
long long time

600
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,600
uh put it in the crisper drawer in the

601
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,199
fridge i've seen it put in the freezer

602
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,199
when stored properly pollen will stay

603
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,399
for a long long time out in the open

604
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,399
i'm gonna say depending on your

605
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,039
environment two to six maybe eight weeks

606
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,958
max

607
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,799
and i'm not saying like completely

608
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,000
active lots of bunches of pollen but

609
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,679
you could have it's like you could have

610
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,639
just a little [ __ ] pollen is tiny

611
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,159
dude you know how

612
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
tiny pollen is you'd have this one

613
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,679
little grain of pollen somewhere that

614
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
could still be active after a few weeks

615
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,198
uh that is my opinion i have no science

616
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,318
to back that up that is debatable it is

617
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:05,838
debated

618
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,678
but i think it sticks around for quite a

619
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,759
while if we don't [ __ ] it up if you have

620
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,319
humidity if you've got wind and moisture

621
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,879
and

622
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,678
uh a lot of varying temperatures extreme

623
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,120
heat

624
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,720
that could destroy it more quickly the

625
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,000
extreme cold will preserve it like i

626
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,600
said cold keeps stuff around

627
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,119
heat cooks things and deteriorates it

628
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,038
breaks it down so

629
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,438
a couple of weeks to a lot of weeks is

630
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,279
my uh unofficial official answer

631
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,480
it goes on it says my second question

632
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,839
i'm gonna bill you for the second one

633
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,120
the first one was free the second one

634
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,119
i'm gonna bill you for

635
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,798
says i have never used humidity packs

636
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,079
but recently it seems as though they are

637
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,918
stealing flavor from

638
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,960
buds and long-term storage what is your

639
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,200
opinion on using them

640
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
you know for a long time i thought that

641
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,480
the humidipacks were messing up the

642
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
flavor when i worked at a commercial

643
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,558
grow

644
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,159
where we were sealing stuff up it was

645
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,038
how they did it when i came in and i

646
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,038
thought sure

647
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,359
it seems to be working but i noticed

648
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,119
everything had like a uh

649
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,798
like a watery flavor like just straight

650
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,719
when you're smoking it it tasted like

651
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,079
there was water in the buds it had

652
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,360
i've got a very sensitive palette i

653
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,199
could taste a lot of things i'm sure you

654
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,038
could tell by my flavor descriptions

655
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
uh when i smoke concentrates when i

656
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:09,919
smoke flowers i can tell you if you use

657
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,559
too much worm castings and [ __ ] like

658
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,120
that

659
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,399
but i could taste i could taste like a

660
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,399
wet watery

661
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,919
sort of a flavor in the buds and when i

662
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,840
wasn't smoking stuff that came out of

663
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,480
the humidity pack jars i didn't taste

664
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,558
that

665
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,400
also that stuff tasted stale it tasted

666
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,599
bland it all tasted the same like that

667
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,720
watery flavor

668
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,558
so in my opinion long-term extreme

669
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,480
long-term storage yes it did start

670
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,200
stealing the terps and the flavors

671
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,880
once mike and i took over that facility

672
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,480
and the harvesting and drying and curing

673
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,240
was done in a much more controlled

674
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,400
manner by mike and i

675
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,640
we eliminated the humidipacks eventually

676
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
we did our serve we did our method with

677
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,080
the humidipacks and it tasted

678
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,840
better then we got rid of them and it

679
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,399
tasted even better so

680
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,439
what i concluded in my mind in my theory

681
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,200
in my study

682
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,640
my unofficial study was that the

683
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,798
humidipacks work well

684
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,559
for like a shorter term storage if the

685
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,759
product is dried and cured properly

686
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,759
you've got to dry it and cure it

687
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,679
properly to give it that effect

688
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,160
then that works for like a medium

689
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,160
storage not a super long storage and

690
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,679
our versions of long lasting wheat are

691
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,038
probably vastly different but you can't

692
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,640
keep it around for super long in there

693
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,359
that's when i start thinking it steals

694
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,360
the terps

695
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,479
when it's not like uh beyond that like

696
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,839
we should have smoked that like a week

697
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,319
ago and you know when it gets to that

698
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,918
point

699
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,439
uh that's when i feel like they start

700
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,960
ripping off the terps if it's

701
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
dried and cured properly and it's just

702
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,120
being moved from the facility

703
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,640
to the store and then it goes on the

704
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,239
shelf and sells in a few days

705
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,720
i don't feel like we lose any terps it's

706
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,400
when it sits around in that container

707
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,160
for a long time that's when i feel like

708
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,880
your terps get stolen

709
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,279
so i do agree um i've actually seen

710
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,520
friends do experiments and comparisons

711
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,038
when they put a fresh bud in a jar

712
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,558
without a humidipack and a fresh blood

713
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:49,919
in a jar with a humidipack

714
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,918
the one with the humidipack i'm not

715
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,480
going to say the brand name it did burn

716
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,240
smoke

717
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,759
and grind better um but that was like a

718
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,038
week or two weeks that they put it in

719
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,599
there i think once you get to that four

720
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,119
and six

721
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,038
six week time period that's when your

722
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,239
terps start kind of getting ripped off

723
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,079
i'm gonna take a quick drink and then we

724
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,359
will answer question number three

725
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,359
all right we've come to your last

726
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,439
question and the last question goes

727
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,678
i've got a concern with red and purple

728
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,038
stems all three of my og plants have

729
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,360
developed red stems

730
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,038
despite having ample magnesium in my

731
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,959
super soil recipe

732
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,960
how do i know when red stems and pedials

733
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,880
are genetic and when they are

734
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,038
from a deficiency um knowing og kush

735
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,039
plants quite often your og kush

736
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,879
crosses and og kush things will have

737
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,158
purple leaves and purple pedials so that

738
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,080
could very well be

739
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,320
just a genetic thing don't panic too

740
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,279
much but i do have some good advice for

741
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,839
you

742
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,359
there are a few things that cause red

743
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,480
and purple pedials and you've got to

744
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,038
make sure you've got red or

745
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,319
purple it sounds like you've got red and

746
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,279
purple you could have a combo it could

747
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,879
be right in the middle

748
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,038
but hopefully my advice leads you to one

749
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,240
direction it could be nutrients

750
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:59,440
um if you have got red and purple stems

751
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,798
and crunchy leaves uh that is probably

752
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
uh let's see where were we now that's

753
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,639
probably a phosphorus problem you've

754
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,880
probably got a phosphorus deficiency

755
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,799
uh red and purple stems and crunchy

756
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,520
leaves is a phosphorus deficiency if

757
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:11,279
it's just

758
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,879
purple and the leaves aren't super

759
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,038
crunchy that is probably your magnesium

760
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,320
deficiency

761
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,919
um also your ph could be too low

762
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,000
that could be causing a nutrient

763
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,799
deficiency a nutrient lockout too low of

764
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,440
a ph

765
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,079
could make the nutrients not absorb the

766
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,038
cold

767
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,079
could be causing your pedials to turn

768
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,400
pinkish purple

769
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,319
red if the tops of the pitial is

770
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,000
changing colors but the underside isn't

771
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,359
that is probably from cold if the whole

772
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,079
thing all the way through is changing

773
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,639
colors

774
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,558
that's going to be from nutrients are

775
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,000
the leaves changing colors as well

776
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,319
if the leaves are changing colors as

777
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
well that is probably from low ph

778
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,759
uh and also from the cold if they're

779
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,279
crunchy again that's going to be from

780
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,879
phosphorus

781
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,038
genetics do that i mentioned a minute

782
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,600
ago that the og kush varietals will do

783
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:57,359
that

784
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,959
uh stuff from the afghanistan region

785
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,119
we'll get the purple petioles

786
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,038
uh you see a lot of the um what did i

787
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,479
used to grow a long time the torabora

788
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,919
used to get just straight up purple

789
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,599
petioles a lot of the grateful dog

790
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,400
crosses will give you purple pee deals

791
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,839
too and i said

792
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,120
said it multiple ways because i've heard

793
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,079
it multiple ways and now you're still

794
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,519
listening

795
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,879
um also something that may

796
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,158
not have come to your mind while you

797
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,000
were working in the garden if you have

798
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,760
done any bending popping and twisting or

799
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,440
manipulation of that plant

800
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,679
some of the new areas that are being

801
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,759
exposed to light may turn purple that

802
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,400
may be a reaction to being exposed to

803
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,400
light

804
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,919
parts that were going straight up maybe

805
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,200
you snapped it and twisted it and bent

806
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,240
it down a little bit that new part

807
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,919
that's getting light

808
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,359
that may turn purple on you as a

809
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,200
reaction a response

810
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,399
to new light and also a little bit of

811
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,798
stress the combo

812
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,159
will add some purple onto there so

813
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,319
you've got a couple of options

814
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,919
red and purple stems with crunchy leaves

815
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,038
again is probably a phosphorus

816
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,038
deficiency

817
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,798
uh just purple pedials is probably a

818
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,879
magnesium problem

819
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,240
the ph could be too low now here's

820
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,880
something to think about

821
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,640
uh too much potassium will block out

822
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,480
your magnesium if you've got too much

823
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,960
potassium in your feed mix

824
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,919
your plants will not absorb the

825
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,840
magnesium

826
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,679
also the opposite is true if you have

827
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,319
got too much calmag

828
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,440
you can give yourself a potassium

829
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,279
deficiency

830
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,640
so make sure that your nutrient mix is

831
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,798
where you need it to be

832
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,759
uh see if your if you've got crunchy

833
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,200
leaves that's going to tell you it's

834
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,759
phosphorous if it's just straight up

835
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,679
purple

836
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,400
that is a magnesium problem it could be

837
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,798
the ph check the ph of your solution

838
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,640
i've done a couple of episodes now on ph

839
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,679
meters and checking ph and dialing in

840
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,520
your gear

841
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,640
maybe check make sure the ph is accurate

842
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,158
that you're getting the ph of the

843
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,080
solution you think

844
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,600
um maybe the temperature could be a

845
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,678
little bit warmer in that room

846
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,119
i can only tell you what i suspect and

847
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,759
what could be options now you've got to

848
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,079
go in there

849
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,000
and do a little investigating and see

850
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,319
one of my options work best for you and

851
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,159
see what you need to correct if it is a

852
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,079
phosphorus or a magnesium issue that is

853
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,760
going to be very easy to correct

854
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,000
hopefully oh you said you were in super

855
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,359
soil uh you probably make a top dress

856
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,919
make a tea you might be able to pull

857
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,678
that out

858
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,278
i'm not a super soil or an organics

859
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,000
expert so i'm going to keep my mouth

860
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,798
shut and not

861
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
say anything wrong in that path all

862
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,440

community and

905
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,200
the industry it goes on to say your

906
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,359
genetics your community outreach and

907
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,679
uh your willingness to share information

908
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,879
are all very inspirational and they've

909
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,919
directly

910
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,840
been directly benefited me greatly so

911
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,559

912
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,480
thank you for

913
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,639
uh once again thank you for noticing and

914
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,679
you're welcome you are very welcome keep

915
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,600
doing what you're doing

916
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,038
keep watching the show uh that's all i

917
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,759
ask tell more people about the show too

918
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:49,839
you can do that

919
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,960
it goes on to say my questions mainly

920
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:55,278
surround the usage of co2 and commercial

921
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,319
cannabis grows i work for a chemical

922
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,240
detection company

923
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,558
and i'm looking into opportunities for

924
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,200
synergy in your industry that i have a

925
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,319
personal

926
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,278
interest in um yeah that's a really

927
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,960
viable

928
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,440
ancillary product that we need in the

929
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,480
grows it's not directly cannabis

930
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,080
you don't have to have all of the

931
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,200
cannabis licensing it's going to be much

932
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,519
easier for you

933
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,400
it's a great opportunity let's talk

934
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,038
about it it says

935
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,559
how widespread is co2 supplementation in

936
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,519
commercial grows

937
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,200
very it is very very viable and very

938
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,558
widespread it is in almost every

939
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,240
commercial grow if it's not in the

940
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,918
commercial grow when i get there

941
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,000
i request it that's one of the things we

942
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,640
install almost immediately

943
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,159
then it says what ppm range is generally

944
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,360
targeted for optimal

945
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,520
growth um the problem with that is that

946
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,319
co2 can become a little bit expensive i

947
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,679
would prefer

948
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,359
a little bit higher than what we

949
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,798
normally run most of the time we go

950
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,678
between 900 and 1100 ppms of co2 in the

951
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,759
rooms

952
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,720
um i would like to go closer to 12 maybe

953
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,919
14

954
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,079
uh that may sound a little bit

955
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,320
ridiculous but you'll see explosive

956
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,119
[ __ ] growth at that rate but getting

957
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:03,119
a big

958
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,479
uh 100 foot by 100 foot by 12 or 18 foot

959
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,678
tall grow facility

960
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,278
to maximize that with 1400 ppms of co2

961
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,600
for 12 hours a day

962
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,919
is a struggle and it's very expensive so

963
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:17,199
we aim for the 900 to 1100

964
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,480
uh ppms of co2 uh consistently from

965
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,919
the time the lights come on till the

966
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,880
lights come off we want that amount of

967
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,720
co2 in there

968
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,640
so there are things creating co2 all day

969
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,278
we'll talk about that in a minute

970
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,919
then it says are co2 levels monitored at

971
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,159
various

972
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,278
sites throughout a commercial grow

973
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,080
facility yes they

974
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,798
are um osha requires that we monitor

975
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,960
monitor

976
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,480
the co2 very carefully it's got to be

977
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,079
installed professionally

978
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,880
it's got to be monitored we've got to

979
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,480
have uh there are bright yellow flashing

980
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,120
lights that go off and say

981
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,880
dangerous hazardous co2 levels and the

982
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,398
alarm goes off and it will scare

983
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,559
the [ __ ] out of you it is completely

984
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,599
loud so we've got a lot of meters a lot

985
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,158
of monitors and

986
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,119
alarms to go with it then it says is

987
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,520
exposure

988
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,479
to high levels of co2 a concern for

989
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,158
workers no

990
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,839
because of all the monitors and meters

991
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,720
and osha regulations that i talked about

992
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,798
before

993
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,558
if it does get too high too dangerously

994
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,398
high that alarm will go off and

995
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:12,480
everybody in the building will hear it

996
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,959
it is as loud as the fire alarm and it's

997
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,558
[ __ ]

998
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,480
it's kind of scary it's a got a really

999
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,158
obnoxious sound to it so it says

1000
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,519
i'd appreciate your input and i look

1001
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,278
forward to the changing

1002
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,200
legislation in my state and hopefully

1003
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,079
seeing illegal ivory genetics growing in

1004
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,480
virginia

1005
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,000
soil very soon me too i'd love to see

1006
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,558
some photos of some stuff growing down

1007
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,038
there

1008
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,599
it goes on to say uh for the first time

1009
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:33,440
let's see

1010
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,199
oh yeah it says could you redact my name

1011
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,399
and my company absolutely your name and

1012
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,000
company will not be said

1013
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:40,000
i'll keep the email paper down here so

1014
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,720
that nobody sees any of that

1015
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,480
great question about co2 i did say we

1016
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,000
would talk a little bit about how co2 is

1017
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,319
used in a facility

1018
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,839
in the state of colorado uh to the best

1019
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,558
of my knowledge at the last time i

1020
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,599
checked

1021
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,558
co2 burners are illegal in a colorado

1022
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,959
commercial

1023
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,759
cultivation facility so you cannot hang

1024
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,759
up the

1025
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,679
co2 burner hook it up to the natural gas

1026
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,119
and run that that is not allowed

1027
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,840
i think they deem that a fire hazard

1028
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,000
kind of makes sense um so what we do

1029
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,119
we've got a service from a company i

1030
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
can't remember the name i think it is

1031
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,000
called green

1032
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,679
co2 i can see the logo in my head i'm

1033
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,960
pretty sure it's green co2 shout out to

1034
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,798
you guys if that's who you are

1035
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,960
sorry if that's not who you are we

1036
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,798
actually get uh big tanks installed

1037
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,440
outside they pour a concrete slab

1038
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:22,960
outside

1039
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,640
the appropriate size depending on how

1040
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,640
many tanks we're gonna get they gotta

1041
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,840
pour a pad outside then they put

1042
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,600
six foot tall co2 canisters depending on

1043
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,879
the size of your rooms and how much co2

1044
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,639
you're going to need they come and do

1045
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,840
calculations they've got the equipment

1046
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,038
the math to do that

1047
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,959
they've already done that they know how

1048
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,240
to do it they come and do a calculation

1049
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,519
they say you're going to need

1050
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,120
this much co2 per room per delivery time

1051
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,038
so they put tanks outside

1052
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,038
that they can drive a big truck up that

1053
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,519
is loaded with co2 in the truck

1054
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,519
they attach a hose to our main tanks and

1055
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,798
it fills up all of our tanks at one time

1056
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,480
they just park for a minute

1057
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:57,839
i watch the guy play on his phone

1058
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,880
[ __ ] i don't know what he's doing

1059
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,480
scrolling whatever

1060
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,919
the little dingy thing goes off and he

1061
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,519
goes oh the [ __ ] is full

1062
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,880
and he gets out and he unplugs the cord

1063
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,398
and he puts a little thing back in

1064
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,919
closes up a gate puts a lock on it

1065
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:08,879
because people steal [ __ ] everything

1066
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,799
that's outside

1067
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,480
he waves and he drives off and my co2 is

1068
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,720
refilled for the next duration of time

1069
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,278
until he comes back usually about a week

1070
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,759
i think he came about every tuesday so

1071
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:19,919
then

1072
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,278
he fills up those big tanks those big

1073
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,440
tanks run to a main line

1074
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,798
inside of the facility and then each

1075
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,880
room has a

1076
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,798
controller and a monitor and on that

1077
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,200
controller monitor you type in

1078
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,158
how much co2 you want in the room and

1079
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,080
then it will

1080
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,679
release co2 we run lines around the

1081
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,038
perimeter of the ceiling of the room

1082
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,320
so you see where my tapestry is here in

1083
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:39,038
the back of the room there'd just be a

1084
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,038
line of

1085
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,158
like a plastic line a perforated plastic

1086
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:43,200
line that would go all the way around

1087
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,640
the room about the door

1088
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,399
the door jam height right around the

1089
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,679
door frame there it just goes all the

1090
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,439
way around the room and we run that

1091
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,159
perforated line all the way around the

1092
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,080
rooms

1093
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,278
and then when you turn on the co2 it

1094
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,798
just pumps through the room and that

1095
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:55,278
monitor reads it and it says oh you're

1096
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:56,879
it

1097
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,038
the set the number you set and it turns

1098
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,039
it off and then sometimes the machines

1099
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,720
will freeze sometimes [ __ ] will go wrong

1100
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,640
sometimes co2 will keep coming out and

1101
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,600
it'll tell you you're at 2 000 ppm's of

1102
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,159
co2

1103
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,000
when it hits uh 2500 i think the alarm

1104
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,600
goes off and you got to go outside

1105
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,919
uh it's a really high number it could be

1106
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,439
like 25 it's 250 000

1107
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,600
it only went off a couple of times but

1108
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,440
when it went off we [ __ ] heard it

1109
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,119
so they deliver the big tanks the tanks

1110
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,038
are set up the tanks run to

1111
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,158
a controller and a monitor you tell it

1112
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,240
how much you want

1113
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,519
it's got a light sensor on it so it

1114
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,640
knows when the lights are on and when

1115
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,399
the lights are off because we don't want

1116
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,759
to run co2 during the lights off that is

1117
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:32,719
a waste of money it's also not good for

1118
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,640
the plants

1119
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,480
so it's got the light sensor we tell it

1120
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,159
how much to pump out it comes on

1121
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,759
it's shooting they told me that the

1122
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,278
technology shoots a beam out

1123
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,119
approximately three feet

1124
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,519
every 30 seconds and measures the amount

1125
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:47,359
of co2 present at that area

1126
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,960
three feet from the monitor every 30

1127
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,038
seconds and adjusted there

1128
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,720
we also hang a few other monitors

1129
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:53,359
throughout the facility at strategic

1130
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,360
places

1131
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,038
and it monitors there and the fans are

1132
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,119
supposed to activate and move it around

1133
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,720
if we have everything dialed in it's

1134
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,558
always hard to get all of the parts

1135
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,079
moving all together at the same time you

1136
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,359
guys honestly there's always one or two

1137
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,798
things that need to be dialed in and a

1138
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,558
giant commercial grow

1139
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:09,918
we'll get them dialed in but then uh

1140
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:11,119
once you get that dialed in something

1141
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,759
else is gonna break too and you get to

1142
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,398
work on that

1143
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,079
it's a lot of fun but we use a lot of

1144
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:17,439
co2 and that is the short version

1145
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,439
i don't know all the technical part we

1146
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,440
run the lines we run the controller

1147
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,640
and then sometimes the lines freeze but

1148
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,120
as long as you've got good customer

1149
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,880
service

1150
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:26,319
the co2 works wonderfully it only breaks

1151
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,519
down a couple of times

1152
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,119
most of the time it's right after a

1153
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,240
refill the [ __ ] lines will freeze and

1154
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,079
then they don't stop and then all your

1155
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,679
co2 is just pumping through the building
