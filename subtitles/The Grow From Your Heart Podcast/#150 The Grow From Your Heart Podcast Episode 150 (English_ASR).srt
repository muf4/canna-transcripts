151

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,870
and talk about it because it's great

153
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,579
talking to other people that have

154
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,860
experienced traumatic brain injuries

155
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:10,959
well thankfully you know I grew up in a

156
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,060
you know my parents were pretty big fans

157
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,859
of holistic medicine so I didn't really

158
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,230
they weren't too big of a fan to put me

159
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:21,520
right on any kind of pharmaceuticals

160
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:22,600
thankfully thankfully that was a pretty

161
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,129
great decision on their part and

162
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,120
actually to speak something else just

163
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,920
become something else besides head

164
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,569
injuries when I was in college I pull

165
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,220
out some ligaments in my knee so

166
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,839
cannabis is much more of an effective

167
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,370
pain reliever than a lot of the opioids

168
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,889
that you get prescribed so quickly and

169
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,210
in such large doses so cannabis is

170
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,559
really just something that a lot of

171
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,060
people should really be more aware of

172
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,009
and if even not aware of just more

173
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,439
accepting us right and no addiction

174
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:46,149
right and you don't go down that black

175
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,710
spiral of cannabis cannabis is good for

176
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:54,179

Instagram as well we'd appreciate that

187
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,450
we're trying to get everybody kind of

188
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,889

Brett let's talk about terms buddy I

196
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,930
just love

197
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:39,609
[Music]

198
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:47,198
like you're walking smile terse is much

199
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:48,909
that's probably the best compliment I

200
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:51,488
have ever gotten I appreciate I liked it

201
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:53,528
I like this so tell us more about so on

202
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:56,499
that we recorded this podcast before and

203
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:58,869
I asked explain to me what a Turk is

204
00:10:56,499 --> 00:11:01,239
nice and easily so that everybody keep

205
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:02,709
in mind a bit more than fifty percent of

206
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:05,230
my listeners are from a place where

207
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:08,618
cannabis is illegal so they know very

208
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,808
basic knowledge about cannabis so let's

209
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:13,629
break it down to where variable follow

210
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:16,350
along with us definitely definitely

211
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:21,879
well terpenes are in basically every

212
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:24,069
type of well there's two different types

213
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,869
of things that could be in fruits or

214
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:30,368
vegetables and stuff like that terpenes

215
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:33,660
or esters but a lot of stuff that you

216
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:36,939
get off either smell from or taste from

217
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:40,088
comes from some type of terpene

218
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:43,058
combination and terpenes are apples

219
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:46,269
oranges bananas everything that they

220
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:48,668
also are in cannabis now from my

221
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:51,188
understanding as of right now there

222
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:54,308
hasn't been any esters found in cannabis

223
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:57,418
but there are tons of terpenes and there

224
00:11:54,308 --> 00:12:02,649
are over a hundred and fifteen terpenes

225
00:11:57,418 --> 00:12:06,489
150 terpenes that make up kind of a

226
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:09,519
plant profile yeah right now the best

227
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:12,879
labs can maybe test for thirty of them

228
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,798
okay maybe 30 for maybe the best labs

229
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,589
and I honestly don't even know how

230
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:19,178
accurate those 30 tests those 30

231
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,360
terpenes the testings actually how

232
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:24,039
accurate they are but and then after

233
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:30,089
that there's some companies that can go

234
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:33,759
for 15 or even 10 so I mean it's it's

235
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:35,410
that's basically there's a whole bunch

236
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,589
of different terpenes that make up a

237
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:40,149
plant profile so the Terps are basically

238
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,120
what give a cannabis

239
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:45,069
it's smell it's smell its taste but also

240
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,100
there's a lot more than just smell and

241
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,320
taste to it and this guy stand next to

242
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,889
me knows a lot about the health benefits

243
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,140
and actually knows a lot about terpenes

244
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:59,939
and that's what actually the big article

245
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:02,949
in the magazine is about and he knows a

246
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,680
lot about the health benefits there is a

247
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,540
lot of stuff to do with the floral the

248
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,969
smell of it the taste of it and that's a

249
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:12,759
little most people that buy it only

250
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:22,779
understand but I have learned a lot from

251
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:23,710
Sam about it I like to waste I wouldn't

252
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:24,730
say I'm a total expert but I've

253
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,920
definitely had a chance to learn a

254
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,990
little bit about terpenes on a little

255
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,339
bit of a different level which is cool

256
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,430
that's one of the articles in the summer

257
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:43,180
edition of the hem connoisseur excellent

258
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:45,939
and terpenes you worked in okay so

259
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:48,519
basically as popular as terpenes are for

260
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,020
flavor they do a lot more medically I

261
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,490
actually had a chance to talk with max

262
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,470
Montrose he's the head of the trichome

263
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,810
Institute and he is you know he is

264
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,879
probably the beats her pinhead beats her

265
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,769
pain expert so he gave me you know

266
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,679
really nice little education and you

267
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:04,389
know terpenes are basically the way he

268
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,949
describes it in the way that I kind of

269
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,720
explained it in the article is basically

270
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,520
like a glass of beer so when you have a

271
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,930
fresh cannabis plant that's a fresh

272
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,279
glass of beer with all of those bubbles

273
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:14,199
floating off all that carbonation

274
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,970
floating up to the top over time that

275
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,680
disappears over time with a fresh

276
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,000
cannabis plant those fresh oils those

277
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,889
fresh terpenes on the end of the plan

278
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,350
are gonna disappear over time okay and

279
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:25,210
those not only add flavor but they also

280
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,320
add depending on the terpene a lot of

281
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,820
medical benefits some of them are

282
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,379
anti-psychotic they're anti-seizure

283
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,090
they're anti-inflammatory

284
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:32,350
they do a whole lot of different things

285
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,600
that we're just real starting to learn

286
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,000
about also depending on what time

287
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,550
harvest you do with the plant you can

288
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,740
also pull different terpenes of the - I

289
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:43,389
know that Jeff I don't know if you I

290
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,090
mean you grow a lot more than I do but I

291
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:48,370
know that if you chop plants certain

292
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:52,000
plants earlier certain plants late you

293
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:57,159
can get a higher CBG or cbn rate uh rate

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,919
usually and in the end what terpenes you

295
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:09,189
pull off the ten cents so also the heat

296
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:10,659
how much has affected how much and

297
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,310
really what fascinated me most i think

298
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,289
about my conversation with max Montrose

299
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:15,969
is really that what people think is the

300
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:18,459
medical benefit coming from cannabinoids

301
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,990
might really be coming from terpenes so

302
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,670
it's really kind of you have to really

303
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,930
combine the two to really get a full

304
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:27,339
picture of really what's happening cuz

305
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:29,769
every strain has CBD CBN CBG depending

306
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,090
on the distrain to some ratio but what

307
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,860
really differs what really

308
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,300
differentiates excuse me a lot of

309
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,279
strains is that terpene profile because

310
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:37,990
not every strain is gonna have that

311
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,120
certain combination of terpenes so the

312
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,710
combination of you know that terpene

313
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,840
profile and the cannabinoids in that

314
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,129
specific strain kind of contribute to

315
00:15:43,840 --> 00:16:02,230
the overall effect in the overall

316
00:15:45,129 --> 00:16:04,720
medical seems talking about and i have

317
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,240
read about it I do have talked to max

318
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,009
and when I do know that there are still

319
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,139
more studies hopefully that there's

320
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,730
gonna be even bigger studies going on in

321
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,799
obviously with the advancement of

322
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,110
cannabis in this community hopefully

323
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,859
more studies but what Stan was seeing

324
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:23,669
with is really true how without terpenes

325
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:26,529
can can't cannabinoids might not

326
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:29,049
transfer in your brain or transferring

327
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:31,899
your body the same way so that's what

328
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:34,179
kind of might there's still studies I

329
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:37,169
I'm not don't quote me obviously but I

330
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:41,338
know that there's people talking about

331
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:43,528
without the terpenes you can't get the

332
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:46,170
same effect and it's kind of true

333
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:52,139
because I felt it I mean you don't get

334
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:58,469
the full wouldn't a good example be

335
00:16:52,139 --> 00:17:01,350
taking the distillate or which all the

336
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:05,788
Terps that pulls out so when you smoke

337
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:39,870
that by itself which you're not supposed

338
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:42,240
to do we're not honest sometimes but

339
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:45,000
honestly sometimes not I mean I don't

340
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,638
mind raw distillate and I know Jeff

341
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:57,630
actually took a nice you try to take a

342
00:17:47,638 --> 00:18:00,209
nice just like who wants to take this

343
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:14,580
right now to the dome and Jeff honest it

344
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:18,058
was like okay but I do want to say wow

345

[Music]

353
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:54,119
iron your clothes cuz there was two

354
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,888
purple ones granny got one of them and

355
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:57,509
there was another one I was like oh man

356
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:59,099
I should scoop that cuz it matches his

357
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:00,659
rig and I was like yo he's not gonna

358
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,398
want that he's like why'd you buy me an

359
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:17,970
iron and now you love and I'm like crap

360
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:21,418
that one's gone so bad it can be I do

361
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:25,288
believe you get a better medicated

362
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:28,660
feeling once you add any of the Terps

363
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:32,259
like I like in the morning I like

364
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:35,560
that lemon gee oh god you know the ghost

365
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:37,240
train haze that's wonderful for in the

366
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:42,480
Moors are my two favorites granny Oh

367
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:43,900
night Zen berry or that blackberry Kush

368
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,420
definitely duh

369
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,060
I mean that's what I was saying I know I

370
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,130
personally feel that without terpenes

371
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:53,950
cannabinoids wouldn't transfer in your

372
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,660
your body the right way the same way as

373
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,640
I don't want to say the right way the

374
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,560
same way as they do right now when with

375
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,020
terpenes I know one thing as I love

376
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,789
Terps

377
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:06,089
[Music]

378
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:08,889
he got mics every direction it was like

379
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:12,459
gasps you my question I forgot the

380
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:14,230
question I know do you examples of like

381
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,670
what specific terpenoids work for

382
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,380
specific conditions what they may help

383
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,150
with because we already know a lot of us

384
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,310
know that like high THC strains will

385
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,800
work well for seizures high CBD works

386
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:25,629
good for like epilepsy oh he's got an

387
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,819
article in his hand to refer to I love

388
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,290
it when people come with research this

389
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,399
is gonna be awesome cuz we're gonna

390
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,170
learn what terpenoids

391
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,550
will help with specific ailments he's

392
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,110
pulling out a chart helping them find

393
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:41,379
the right page shot to do his page

394
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:42,789
turner brett over there what we've that

395
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,090
kind of smell like hume Leena's

396
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:49,960
commented a lot of sativa strains and

397
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:52,089
basically it's antitumoral antibacterial

398
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,319
it has anti-inflammatory properties and

399
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:55,269
steep hill labs has done a lot of

400
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,379
research on individual terpenes and

401
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:59,529
their benefits that's another place that

402
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,820
i've done some research exactly one

403
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:05,049
thing I can tell you about you Moline

404
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:07,389
it's also a natural you don't want to

405
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:13,779
eat it's like it's like a diet pill

406
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:14,830
almost yes that's it examples maybe one

407
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,859
or two more cuz that's really

408
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:21,460
interesting to me and I'm sure listeners

409
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:22,929
you can read all of this in THC mags yes

410
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,250
yes I'm not trying to make every just

411
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:28,090
won't magazine but I wanted to get at

412
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,950
least two or three this is a quote from

413
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:31,569
steep hill actually Lionel was a

414
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,220
critical precursor in the formation of

415
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:34,839
vitamin E it has been used in the

416
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,120
treatment of both psychosis and anxiety

417
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:38,470
and as an epileptic and as an as an anti

418
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,109
epileptic agent excuse me

419
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,480
what does that one smell like Lionel was

420
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:45,158
very floral like lavender okay alright

421
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,870
that's probably my least favorite turf I

422
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,778
really do not appreciate the smell of

423
00:22:46,869 --> 00:23:09,278
lavender and Lyle acts it drives my nose

424
00:22:49,778 --> 00:23:29,648
crazy for some reason my nose grows ice

425
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:30,638
cream different beans are definitely

426
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:33,459
useful for a lot of different things

427
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:35,678
were only really just start we love it

428
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,419
so much because we helps us not be

429
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,570
anxious and helps us not be depressed

430
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:42,610
yeah that's trains really uplifting with

431
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:45,819
depression exactly that's probably what

432
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:49,928
Brett what's your favorite term I'm

433
00:23:45,819 --> 00:24:04,388
gonna say Lyman or probably mercy okay

434
00:23:49,929 --> 00:24:07,090
mercy I like mercy this one time in a

435
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:08,558
way if you've got a sativa strain that

436
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:09,939
has lemony flavors and lemon

437
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,038
characteristics and you want to bring

438
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,048
out the D limonene terpenoids

439
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:15,460
let it get a little bit too close to the

440
00:24:14,048 --> 00:24:17,378
light and it will panic and it will

441
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,970
start treating D limonene as a panic

442
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:20,949
response and defense and that'll bring

443
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,629
out your lemony flavors and I learned

444
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,100
this on accident by getting my plants

445
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,689
too close to the light too many times

446
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:26,798
and I'm like we're always still lemony I

447
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,080
was like with those are the plants that

448
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,190
almost got burnt and I'm 90% sure that

449
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:32,288
that's what's happening that's from my

450
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,509
experience I think getting the plants to

451
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:35,769
close to the the HP s light will bring

452
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:37,360
out the Lima needs to do it on purpose

453
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:47,528
drop your lemon Jeffrey get the light

454
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:48,789
real close to that lemon Jeffrey thank

455

494
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:42,669
made with solvent less hash and they are

495
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:45,610

497
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,729

498
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:50,349
shout out to them shout out sure that

499

501
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:56,200
actually nice alright I'm afraid of

502
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,180
edibles the people who listen to the

503
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,759
podcast know that I way too many edibles

504
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:03,160
one-time shy since then

505
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:05,230
alright I wanna go this direction again

506
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,980
I was telling granny about how how I

507
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,110
found her

508
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,610
scroll through Facebook one day and

509
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:10,809
there was no sound in the video so I'm

510
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:12,129
gonna cut the sound out but they like

511
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:14,289
check out this lady and it was just

512
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,960
somebody reposting your video you took a

513
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:18,819
big-ass dad like a dad that I would take

514
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,610
probably a half a gram at least 0.3

515
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:24,069
maybe 0.5 you suck that dab and you held

516
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:26,169
it in you chug the beer you chug the

517
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:28,899
shot and then you grab do you blew out

518
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:37,750
your dab and you grabbed your your

519
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:40,920
nectar collector and did another yes you

520
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:44,259
should not be proud of it but I am

521
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:48,160
because really can you see your mother

522
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:51,099
or your grandma doing a knockout and

523
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:54,580
smiling and then most people think oh

524
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:56,559
she's laid out I'll come back and do

525
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:59,250
another big dab for you

526
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,179
she's a we've been we probably smoked

527
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,589
six people here in this group we

528
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:12,879
probably smoked three or four

529
00:29:02,589 --> 00:30:02,928
we've been hanging out here for the

530
00:29:12,878 --> 00:30:05,658
shows in fact everybody needs to take

531
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:07,038
big dads that's how I found granny was

532
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:08,330
watching her do strikeouts and then

533
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,589
somebody was like she lives in Springs

534
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:11,868
and I was like what and then like she

535
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:13,308
Shops at elevate I started following you

536
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:15,678
and I was like this lady and I cross

537
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:16,970
paths we go to all the same places you

538
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,769
shop it green and healthy wellness

539
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,659
occasionally you support all the

540
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:22,190
dispensaries in town which is yes I do I

541
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:29,509
love that you don't just go pick one

542
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:31,580
place I am a representative for the

543
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:33,528
cannabis community and so I'm gonna go

544
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:37,970
all over I'm not gonna give one

545
00:30:33,528 --> 00:30:39,648
dispensary my plant count because that

546
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:45,940
wouldn't be fair it wouldn't be fair

547
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:45,939
person I'm a free agent

548
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:49,689
so everybody what we're talking about in

549
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,640
Colorado if you're a medical marijuana

550
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:53,980
patient you were allowed to grow a

551
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,290
specific amount of plant plants based on

552
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,559
what your doctor feels is appropriate

553
00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:00,639
based on your medical condition or

554
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,619
honestly based on how much money is in

555
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,900
your pocket it just costs more honestly

556
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:06,549
so you pay for an elevated plateau at is

557
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,140
what we call it then you can that allows

558
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:10,509
you to grow more plants and also to

559
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,700
possess more cannabis when you go to a

560
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:15,369
dispensary in Colorado Springs we are

561
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,200
medical cannabis only and the way that

562
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:19,149
those dispensaries are able to grow is

563
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,009
those plants that those patients have

564
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:23,320
they can allow the dispensary to grow

565
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:25,210
those plants for them we call it signing

566
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:27,460
over your card signing over your plants

567
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,690
you become a member so that's what

568
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,400
granny's talking about is she's not

569
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,170
gonna let anybody have her plant count

570
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,330
she's in charge of that she is her own

571
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,220
she's a free agent she grows on her own

572
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:37,569
none of these dispensaries own her they

573
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,460
don't have her plants they can't brag

574
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:40,869
about it and hopefully granny's got a

575
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,490
nice garden overall but that's none of

576
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:44,919
our business unless she wants to tell us

577
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:54,430
I don't know the first thing about

578
00:31:44,920 --> 00:32:00,430
growing has helped me with a lot of good

579
00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:02,759
tips I could show you give me the idea

580
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:05,910
to become the davin granny

581
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:08,690

583
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:18,720
illegal and this dabbin thing was pretty

584
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:21,389
new about what maybe two years ago and

585
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,039
at the dispensary I was going to they

586
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,530
kept saying you need to try this you

587
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,589
need to try this I know y'all are young

588
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:32,279
boys with slapback hats I'm not gonna

589
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:35,459
try this uh this is not for me I'm an

590
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:39,569
old lady well then actually it was the

591
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,819
owner of the canna Canyon Erin and Pete

592
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:45,750
they were like come on try it you have a

593
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:49,470
high tolerance try it when I tried it

594
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:52,829
but I wasn't too big on it cuz I didn't

595
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:55,410
know what I was doing then November I

596
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:57,149
got a portable email can I tell that

597
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,330
story you could definitely tell any

598
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:02,460
story I'm gonna shout out gabato up and

599
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:06,089
in Denver because they're the ones that

600
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,710
encouraged me to go in front of a camera

601
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:10,949
when I didn't know what the hell I was

602
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:13,410
doing and do dabs and smile and talk and

603
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,950
when I was like but why should I do it

604
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:26,790
they're like cuz people will like you

605
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:28,679
people like me I don't know you can

606
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:31,109
handle it and so there's several things

607
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,000
that intrigue people especially the

608
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:35,250
normal people that are in Colorado

609
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,470
taking dabs and the people that don't

610
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,329
get to dab the people then when they do

611
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,250
take dabs it's a pea-sized and they get

612
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:45,750
high because they rarely get to dab

613
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:48,869
they're blown away by this but now

614
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:51,660
everybody wants to dab yeah everybody

615
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:52,678
wants to dab with you yes keep it quiet

616
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,210
that you're coming here because

617
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,830
otherwise this place just fills up with

618
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:58,950
people trying to beat granny I have

619
00:33:55,829 --> 00:34:00,388
learned don't say where I'm going yeah

620
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,679
in the August issue of the hub

621
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:03,569

622

00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:59,048
anyway so I got to know him because of

713
00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:01,659
the parchment paper anyway so some Biola

714
00:41:59,048 --> 00:42:05,108
which needs to be kicked up a notch it's

715
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:09,250
not real flavorful so our good friend

the Turk pimp has some Durbin poison I'm

grumpy grandpa and I was like ok

821
00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:47,548

pain and chronic illness some days he's

823

pretty grumpy compute 11 huh but

824
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:58,108
considering I've been with him since

825
00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:05,490
1974 and he still makes me laugh every

826
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:07,380
day he's not that's awesome yes he is my

827

consuming cannabis at the age of 14 I am

837
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:50,910
an Iowa corn [ __ ] I think that might be

838
00:50:41,608 --> 00:51:01,650
better than Terps let some Hornets from

839
00:50:50,909 --> 00:51:12,509
Illinois were either we talked about

840
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:13,950
earlier does exist how hard was it for

841
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:17,190
you to get some cannabis when you lived

842
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:18,960
in the corn up in the corner actually I

843
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:23,460
started meeting guys coming back from

844
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:27,119
the Vietnam wha you told us about you

845
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:29,230
know I was exposed to first cannabis and

846
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,140
then many other things

847
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:34,030
arrests yeah okay and at this point in

848
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:36,579
my life I can truly say with life

849
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:39,700
experience don't mess with that other

850
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:42,519
[ __ ] I can agree with that I mean okay

851
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:44,769
you all you young folks say you need

852

your spiritual experiences with

853
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:50,889

great Facebook live videos it's only a

957
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:54,269

take a DAB on Facebook live as the end

959
00:56:54,269 --> 00:57:05,039

a few sponsors some first ones are

963

debate oh I know they take a lot of

964
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:18,780
grief about their product but as far as

965
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:21,179
I'm concerned there's many of those

966
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:24,000
portable emails out there branded under

967
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:26,068
many names any one of those companies

968
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,409

1143
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:01,019
great the canyon is a great place you

1144
01:07:59,139 --> 01:08:04,538
guys states that are passing

1145
01:08:01,018 --> 01:08:05,299
legalization for medical please keep in

1146
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:07,400
mind

1147
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,800
not go strictly rock I mean there's

1148
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,389
people that really truly need medical

1149
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:15,740
please keep that in mind

1150
01:08:11,389 --> 01:08:20,239
secondly remember you need places to

1151
01:08:15,739 --> 01:08:22,880
gather and consume you have people that

1152
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:24,649
have leases that they can't medicate in

1153
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,220
their own apartment where are they gonna

1154
01:08:24,649 --> 01:08:27,979
go

1155
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:30,920
you need places like this we have

1156
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:33,019
learned here in Colorado so listen to us

1157
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,480
we're trying to help you

1158
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:37,490
we're not being arrogant but just put

1159
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:39,588
some forethought in a couple of things

1160
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:41,269
granny's completely right in Colorado we

1161
01:08:39,588 --> 01:08:43,670
messed up when we wrote the bills here

1162
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:45,890
we did not include consumption areas so

1163
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:47,720
there's a gray area these places can be

1164
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:49,430
shut down at any time this canna Canyon

1165
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,838
where we sit are allowed to sit here at

1166
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:52,310
this table and gather peacefully and

1167
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:54,229
take some dabs and have a podcast

1168
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:56,150
together this could be stopped at any

1169
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:57,649
moment with just a letter all that would

1170
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:59,329
have to be done as a letter written and

1171
01:08:57,649 --> 01:09:01,909
a judge says no more and it could be

1172
01:08:59,329 --> 01:09:03,890
over so when you do get around to

1173
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:06,108
writing the legalization bills in your

1174
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,970
state make sure you include these types

1175
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:09,470
of places make sure you put so many of

1176
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:11,659
these places available in so much

1177
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:13,670
locality and write rules for them

1178
01:09:11,659 --> 01:09:14,930
because if you don't write rules when it

1179
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:16,548
comes to make rules for cannabis

1180
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:18,289
legalization in your area the rules will

1181
01:09:16,548 --> 01:09:20,149
be written for you and when they make

1182
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:22,789
the rules for you you get really [ __ ]

1183
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:23,929
they say okay nothing then if you let

1184
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:25,909
them write the rules they don't give you

1185
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:27,170
[ __ ] if you make the rules yourself you

1186
01:09:25,909 --> 01:09:28,880
can have experienced people on there

1187
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:32,480
that understand what this community

1188
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,680
wants it needs encourage you you'll be a

1189
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:38,059
part of that make sure you get the

1190
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:38,659
social clubs in the legislation get your

1191
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:43,970
[ __ ] together

1192
01:09:38,659 --> 01:09:45,858
remember people knowledge is power on

1193
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:47,480
the March yes just because we're getting

1194
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:49,420
a recreational Eagle in some places

1195
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:52,309
doesn't mean we can get lazy with it
