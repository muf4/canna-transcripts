99
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,400
emails here in this uh short one camera

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,920
episode yes we're only recording with

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,680
one camera today

102
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,280
still trying to figure out a tech issue

103
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,120
we'll get it figured out you guys aren't

104
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,799
concerned with that i do apologize it's

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
only one camera tried to deliver a

106
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,879
two-camera show let's get to this

107
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,360
message it comes from our friend who

108
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,679
calls themselves they did not even sign

109
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,840
it there's no name this one comes from

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,239
anonymous anonymous says hello irie

111
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,120
unfortunately my last paper towel and

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,878
seeds went dry for a few hours i sprayed

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,158
them around six and found them dry

114
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,560
around two the tap roots generally still

115
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,318
seem healthy then the question let me

116
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,239
kind of talk about what happened here

117
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,598
our friend is germinating some seeds

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,120
they're attempting the

119
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,639
fold up a paper towel and stick your

120
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,399
seeds in their method put some water in

121
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,560
it keep it moist those seeds should

122
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,319
sprout unfortunately our friend got

123
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,519
stoned got tied up in a video game got

124
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,120
distracted i don't know what happened

125
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,319
i'm making [ __ ] up our buddy got

126
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,120
distracted and those seedlings went dry

127
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,800
the question is should i start over or

128
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,519
will these plants be stunted in the

129
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,199
future and or offer less yield less

130
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,680
ideal plants to breed and clone in the

131
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,720
long run or will they somehow recover

132
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,400
and be worth keeping thank you irie uh

133
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
this is a pretty good question

134
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,120
i don't have any scientifical input or

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,120
evidence based on uh what i'm gonna to

136
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
support what i'm going to say this is

137
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,840
just what uh i think and what i've

138
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,439
experienced and how i think that uh

139
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,039
the will to survive excuse me if you

140
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,959
heard me get all choked up

141
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
talking about the will to survive and

142
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,519
life must go on it got me all choked up

143
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
there

144
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,879
so uh you say that the tap roots

145
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,600
generally still seem healthy your

146
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,439
concern here is should i start over will

147
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,840
these plants be stunted uh will these

148
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,240
plants not offer what they could have

149
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,599
um i don't think you if they keep

150
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
growing if they survive i don't think

151
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
you cause them any problems i think they

152
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,038
will recover i think they'll bounce back

153
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,960
they will give you their full potential

154
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,719
possibly they may be a little bit

155
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,560
stronger i think anything that goes

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,960
through a little bit of a struggle a

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,959
little bit of adversity and survives it

158
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,478
comes out stronger better i think the

159
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,399
phrase is what doesn't kill me only

160
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,800
makes me stronger i think you may have

161
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,679
done that to these plants if they didn't

162
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
die

163
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,478
during your little drought period if

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,680
they didn't go too dry they're fine

165
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,439
they're going to be

166
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,600
great plants i would not start over i

167
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,360
would keep growing these i would

168
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,520
proceed as usual

169
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
business as usual on with the regularly

170
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,599
scheduled program i think you're going

171
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,959
to get good viable usable plants they

172
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,319
will live up to their potential their

173
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,359
full outcome

174
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,680
you can

175
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,520
clone breed keep a mother plant i think

176
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,959
you're going to do great so nothing to

177
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
worry about there as long as you keep

178
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,399
them going as long as they're still

179
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,359
healthy as long as they look happy if

180
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,439
they do give you any problems um once

181
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,800
you get them past that tiny delicate

182
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,879
seedling stage if you do have any

183
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
problems don't blame it on yourself for

184
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,000
this issue you do have to get them past

185
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,478
this they've got to recover they've got

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,839
to get cotyledons and turn into plants

187
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,439
if you have any issues after the

188
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,399
cotyledons form and they're actually

189
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,120
plants

190
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,638
that is not from this so don't use this

191
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,680
as like a uh

192
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,360
a reason later um this isn't the uh the

193
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,120
sprained ankle and training camp is not

194
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,038
why you lost the fight six weeks later

195
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,478
don't blame this this isn't why so if

196
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,560
you do run into trouble it wasn't from

197
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,478
this i think you will have success i've

198
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,879
rambled on more than enough about this

199

car trip together it says you are a

240

cannabis hero um

242
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,478
your hero but i in no way consider

243
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
myself think of myself as a hero that

244
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,399
felt weird to read

245
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,560
but i can't belittle or discredit your

246
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,560
label so i am a [ __ ] hero thank you

247

a general hero to me uh i will

249
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,639
definitely take credit if you call me a

250
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,120
hero i've got to be your hero be

251
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,199
disrespectful not to take it it says i

252
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,000
was that guy talking about a doug

253
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,680
stanhope strain one time uh that's funny

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,158
in my instagram lives we chat about

255
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,239
strain names and random chaos i like to

256
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,679
name strains after uh people that

257
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,320
inspire me things that make my life

258
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,639
better uh things that just are great and

259
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,360
i named strains after tom segura and

260
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,958
bert christopher uh burnt chrysler brant

261
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,560
chrysler how do you say it bert

262
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,799
christopher that's the guy's name i made

263
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,319
strains after those guys uh the soccer

264
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,919
souffle and the machine are named after

265
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,080
those two uh tom segura and bert

266
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,399
kreicher and we were joking that there

267
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,240
should be a doug stanhope name

268
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,679
and uh i can't come up with a strain

269
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,839
name for doug stanhope but that'd be

270
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,000
funny because doug stanhope is one of my

271
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,160
uh favorite comedians he is great i got

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,958
to see him at the oriental theater here

273
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,879
just a couple of months ago honestly

274
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,719
frustrated myself i caught myself too

275
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,159
high and zoning out during the show i

276
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
took a vape pin into that show because

277
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,120
it was a theater show and i was hitting

278
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,120
the pen

279
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,879
the opening act wasn't my favorite no

280
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,278
disrespect to uh i won't even say his

281
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,958
name the opener was boring and i was

282
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,480
just hitting my pen to pass time and by

283
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,559
the time doug came out i was way too

284
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,639
high for a comedy show so i missed i

285
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,000
feel like i missed part of it i realized

286
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,360
this i was like you're zoning out you're

287
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,039
looking around at the crowd and like

288
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,560
paying attention to the wrong [ __ ] i had

289
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,559
to lock myself in and pay attention to

290
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,039
stanhope but he was great i did enjoy it

291
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,799
once i kind of snapped out of my coma

292
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,000
but uh doug stanhope's [ __ ] awesome

293
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,838
if you guys haven't heard digging up

294
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,360
mother listen to that bit it's a comedy

295
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
bit um

296
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,879
it's dark it's dark so i hope you're

297
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,039
into dark comedy anyway doug stanhope's

298
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,879
strain name would be great i digress

299
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,439
this message says anyway i have a couple

300
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,000
of your strains in my veg tent from seed

301
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,160
i've got sun kiss and raphael they're

302
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,799
about four to five weeks oh that's good

303
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,319
info it says i want to determine the sex

304
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,958
of my sun kiss

305
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,600
so i turned my veg tint to 1212 to get

306
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,599
the plant to show sex so in five to ten

307
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,600
days i expect to see signs of it being

308
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,639
male or female that will work that's

309
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,200
going to do what you're thinking it's

310
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:28,000
going to do it says now my question is

311
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,079
how long do i have to run or how long do

312
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,958
i have to run 18-6 again before

313
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,399
determining the sex of the plant

314
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,919
after determining the sex of the plant

315
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,360
sorry i misread part of that i thought

316
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,120
it sounded kind of weird it was my fault

317
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,680
not yours so then he does follow that up

318
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,959
with an example that says my example uh

319
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,838
day one i switched from 18 6 to 12 12

320
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:51,039
day 55 i determined sun kisses a female

321
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,600
so i switched from 12 12 back to 18 6.

322
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,319
now what day would sun kiss be safe to

323
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,959
go back to 12 12 and go through its

324
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,120
normal flowering cycle

325
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,000
that is a very good question

326
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,720
um

327
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,120
i like the idea i like the strategy i

328
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,079
like the approach however i would have

329
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,879
done this a little bit differently i

330
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,679
would have put these plants into flower

331
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,919
when they were a few inches tall i would

332
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,359
not have done this at wood are we 45

333
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,958
days in

334
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,600
now the hormones in those plants have

335
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,679
spread and developed so much more

336
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
and when you put it into flour those

337
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,359
hormones are going to take a little bit

338
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,399
longer to switch over to flower to show

339
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,879
you that the plant is in flower

340
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,480
depending on it may it may be it may

341
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:35,360
have reached a sexual point in its

342
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,680
growth that it could have some

343
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440
pre-flower into it it may be ready which

344
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,958
also could be a problem

345
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,839
because then it's not going to want to

346
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,199
go back to veg as quickly so i would

347
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,279
have done it much earlier your plants

348
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,959
are 45 days in when you put them into

349
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,720
flour it is going to take you that 10 to

350
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,159
12 day period to find out if you've got

351
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,920
a male or female

352
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,519
then you can put it back into veg but

353
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,278
it's going to take a little bit longer

354
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,200
because you've got a plant with much

355
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,039
more hormones much more stuff to work

356
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,759
with that you've got to return all the

357
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,000
way back to veg i would give it two

358
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,240
three at least three maybe four weeks to

359
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,159
veg before i went back into flower at

360
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
this point you're gonna have a big-ass

361
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,519
plan

362
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
what i would have done and i'm not

363
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,480
saying you can't do your method you can

364
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
do this

365
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,800
but it's going to be slightly stressful

366
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,320
on the plant and on you what i would

367
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,359
have done what would have been better

368
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,959
next time what you can do is either flip

369
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,200
these plants when they are much much

370
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,000
smaller like i said when they're an inch

371
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
tall

372
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,958
i determine the sex before they find

373
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,800
their forever home so i don't waste

374
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,039
space i don't waste soil i don't waste

375
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,039
even waste the time up potting them i

376
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,679
don't waste the electricity

377
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,679
they go from seed into a beer cup i get

378
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,000
some cotyledons i let them grow i put

379
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,120
them into flour they'll show me in when

380
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,720
they're that little they'll show you

381
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,000
pretty quickly if they're male or female

382
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,000
and then you can toss them really

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,759
quickly then you don't even transplant

384
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,519
the boys they don't even make it to that

385
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,720
stage so i would have done it much

386
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
earlier

387
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,040
then you're gonna vet you're gonna take

388
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,278
your small plants veg them for a week

389
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,679
then flower them for seven to ten days

390
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,439
put them back into veg and now in like

391
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,679
10 to 12 days those plants will go back

392
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,200
into veg because they're so little but

393
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,479
we're gonna grow them out for weeks

394
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,959
because we're just starting them so

395
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,039
they've got all that veg time to recover

396
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,039
uh they're gonna continue to grow while

397
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,120
the hormones go back into a vegetative

398
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,278
stage and it won't take long depending

399
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,879
on how deep into flower you got them 10

400
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,039
or 12 days isn't too far they should

401
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,278
revert fairly quickly if they're little

402
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,759
plants without a lot of a lot of changes

403
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,679
in hormones so that should work better

404
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,200
for you what i can recommend that you

405
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,198
can do with these plants since you're

406
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,519
already at this point i do have a great

407
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,599
recommendation for you to minimize the

408
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,759
stress on yourself and these plants what

409
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,759
i would do at this time is i would take

410
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,319
a few clones from the plant that you're

411
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,919
trying to sex and sex the clone you've

412
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,879
got these big fancy plants they've been

413
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,479
going for

414
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,679
45 days you should have pretty big

415
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,879
plants by now they should be a couple

416
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,239
feet tall they should be nice and

417
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,600
branchy

418
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,799
you should have

419
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,959
at least two or three maybe four or five

420
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,759
viable clones available off of each

421
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,759
plant i would get a clone dome and a

422
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,039
tray and some clone plugs or an easy

423
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,559
cloner if you really want to make an

424
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,879
investment if you've already got it set

425
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,278
it up get it running i would invest in a

426
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,039
cloning setup then i would take a clone

427
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,720
from each of these sun-kissed plants i

428
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,000
don't know how many you have in there

429
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
um

430
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,679
a couple of them so it sounds like just

431
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,600
one i would take two or three clones

432
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,278
from the sun kiss plant

433
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
one of them if you can turn it into a

434
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,639
mother plant that way you've got a

435
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,078
proven female for next time you already

436
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,560
know it's a girl you don't have to sex

437
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,638
it this is how we uh do a see i would

438
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,919
have done a proper phenohunt first is

439
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,159
kind of what i'm getting at we're gonna

440
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,519
get you a pheno hunt out of this uh to

441
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,078
find out if you've got a plant that's

442
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,519
even worth growing after 45 days what i

443
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,519
would do let me get my ass back on track

444
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,600
here i would take a clone i would get

445
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,120
the clone and a clone dome uh you've

446
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,519
probably got four or five clones off

447
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,159
there take four or five clones maybe

448
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,959
designate one as a mom keep that around

449
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,120
i would put this clone dome into flour

450
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,119
right away get four or five clones put

451
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,440
them into flour you can cut the clones

452
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,519
dip them stick them put them under 12 12

453
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,839
lighting while they are rooting they

454
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,440
will also flip to flower they will then

455
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,760
show you in 7 10 12 maybe 14 days if

456
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,360
they are boys or girls those clones will

457
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,958
be boys or girls just like the plant

458
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,879
they came from you've only got one plant

459
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,638
so if it shows you boy that plant's a

460
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,198
boy if it shows a girl that plant is a

461
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,680
girl so i would cut clones

462
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,758
oftentimes i like to lolly pop my plants

463
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,758
right before they go into flower

464
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,360
that means taking off the bottom stuff

465
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,278
if you can get a couple of good clones

466
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,959
off the bottom pull that stuff off there

467
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,480
you can clean the plant up and create

468
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,399
clones at the same time

469
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,159
if your plant is getting tall and it's

470
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,000
getting unruly you can always take that

471
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,000
center top right out of the middle and

472
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,240
use that for a clone i love cloning that

473
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,839
center top i top my plants anyway so

474
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,320
that topping that just becomes a

475
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,279
beautiful healthy hearty clone i label

476
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,440
that one clone a plant a put that clone

477
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,759
in the clone dome put it under 1212

478
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,320
lighting right now in my area i'm in

479
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,360
north america i'm in colorado we're

480
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,278
experiencing less than 12 hours of light

481
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,879
per day i think we're headed back up in

482
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,039
daylight hours at this time we might be

483
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,600
going more but still currently

484
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,719
we do experience [ __ ] about six hours

485
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,480
of daylight it feels like i think we

486
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,639
might get seven and a half eight hours

487
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,199
of daylight right now if you put a clone

488
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,039
dome in a window silla just provided it

489
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,278
daylight it has to stay warm don't get

490
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,439
it cold uh in colorado it might [ __ ]

491
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,278
freeze to death right now oddly it's not

492
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,639
cold enough but it will get cold for the

493
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,879
plant um

494
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,720
put that clone under 1212 lighting if it

495
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,519
gets 12 hours of darkness every day it

496
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,160
will go into flower and then in 10 12

497
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,560
maybe 14 days you will know if that

498
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,159
plant is a male or female and you won't

499
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,159
have to stress out your big plant by

500
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,799
putting it into flour putting it back

501
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,399
into veg at this point

502
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,838
i would almost just put that depending

503
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,600
on how much space you've got you've got

504
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,279
the uh what's your size i think you told

505
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,199
me the size of your tent no it doesn't

506
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,360
say the size i would just put that [ __ ]

507
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,559
in a flower and grow it at this point

508
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,120
and then find out if it's a male or

509
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,438
female 45 days uh what are you waiting

510
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,198
for that's about how long my plants veg

511
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,720
they don't get that much more veg time

512
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,959
that [ __ ] would be running turn it and

513
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,519
burn it at this point um

514
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,519
so you do have an option you do have a

515
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,279
couple of options i wouldn't i wouldn't

516
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,798
recommend putting the big plant into

517
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,798
flour and then bringing it back i would

518
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,639
just veg for two more weeks and then put

519
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,078
it in the flour and send it don't even

520
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,679
bring it back just let it go if it's a

521
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,480
boy it's a boy you cut it down if it's a

522
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,880
girl finish it let it go all the way or

523
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,360
your other option is to take a clone and

524
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,360
put that clone under 1212 lighting right

525
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,319
away and it will show you sex within

526
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,719
just a few days uh in the future i would

527
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,639
recommend to either get a clone from it

528
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,038
much earlier as soon as the plant is big

529
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,919
enough to clone cut a clone sex the

530
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:53,119
clone or sex that plant when it is real

531
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,720
tiny so we don't get 45 days in um and

532
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,879
not know if that plant is a boy or a

533
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,038
girl i i couldn't handle 45 days

534
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,559
wondering is that a dude or is that a

535
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,279
chick that i've been hanging out with

536
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,200
like i'd really want to know by now so i

537
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,119
find out much earlier that way it would

538
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,880
have never even it's probably in a three

539
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,558
maybe a five gallon pot do you tell me

540
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,240
in this message you don't mention that

541
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,480
but it's in a pot big enough to sustain

542
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,759
it for 45 days it's probably a three

543
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,599
gallon at least which means you got

544
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,160
three gallons of dirt which means it's

545
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,079
taking up at least a one by one maybe a

546
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,279
two by two square foot space in your

547
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,199
grow space um it is definitely taking

548
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,720
what's most valuable to me in that

549
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,120
equation

550
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,519
is the plant number i'm only allowed so

551
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,678
many plants so if that's a dude that i

552
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,679
don't need that's a wasted [ __ ]

553
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,679
number i could have done something way

554
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,360
better with a plant that i do need what

555
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,440
sometimes i need a boy sometimes i need

556
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,599
a female but if i don't need a boy and

557
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,240
it's a boy uh get rid of it so i can

558
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,759
replace it i can have 12 and every one

559
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,839
of those 12 counts when you're a seed

560
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,879
breeder trying to create new [ __ ] trying

561
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:57,199
to discover things final hunt keep moms

562
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,440
it gets hectic it's a fun juggle so

563
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,759
let me quickly recap because that is my

564
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,840
style what i would have done is i would

565
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,679
have flowered it much sooner and then

566
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,119
put it back into veg when it was six

567
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,720
inches tall it would have gone into

568
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,319
flour maybe even three or five inches

569
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,600
tall would have gone into flower we

570
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,599
would have discovered if it was a boy or

571
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,038
a girl then put it right back that way i

572
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,798
don't have to take a clone i don't have

573
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,960
another plant count that's a way to

574
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,119
dodge another plant in the count just

575
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,360
flower that one then it's still there

576
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,199
the other that clone just doubled my

577
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,038
plan account if i clone everything to

578
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,840
sex test it i just doubled my [ __ ]

579
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,759
count so i would do that or uh there's

580
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,279
another option i almost looked over sex

581
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,679
testing you can do the mail-in sex

582
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,359
testing order a sex test card rub your

583
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,038
weed plan on the card mail it in the lab

584
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,359
will tell you if it's a boy or a girl

585
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,879
let me get back on track where i was

586
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,759
what i would do what i would recommend

587
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,559
is the early sexing from a small plant

588
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:51,038
or grow it get a clone sex test the

589
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,558
clone when you do the clones also you

590
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,798
can revert the clones they'll go back

591
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,599
quicker and you can keep a mom that way

592
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:00,000
um or you can put this bad [ __ ] into

593
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,158
flower and see what it does at this

594
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,480
point i know it sounds uh

595
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,880
it may sound crazy but dude you're 45

596
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,720
days in how long do you really plan on

597
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,120
vegging this plant how big do you want

598
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,279
it you're already 45 days in i would

599
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,839
just turn it and burn it send it see

600
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,759
what you got if it's a boy you've wasted

601
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,199
45 days if it's a girl you're gonna have

602
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,400
a decent harvest

603
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,759
if you want to keep vegging it it's

604
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,600
going to get big

605
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,759
but in in

606
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,158
i think quicker veg cycles and more

607
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,599
cycles per year is more productive in my

608
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,120
opinion i don't know your space i don't

609
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,359
know your situation

610
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,279
but my advice [ __ ] send it get her

611
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,439
done get that [ __ ] out of there get it

612
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,200
going get more plants in

613
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,159
i would already flower the crop by now i

614
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,759
would have been i would have been ahead

615
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,120
of you anyway that's just what i would

616
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,679
do uh my buddy dave from ontario i hope

617
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,918
i did not break your heart by giving you

618
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,919
by saying that i wouldn't do what you're

619
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,919
planning to do it will work but it will

620
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,080
be stressful there are better ways to do

621
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,000
it what i did do was i set you up with

622
