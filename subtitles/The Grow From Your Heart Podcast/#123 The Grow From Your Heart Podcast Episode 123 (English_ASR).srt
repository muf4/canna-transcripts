thank you for joining me this episode

43
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,989
will come mostly from the canna Canyon

44
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:48,728
the candy Canyon is my favorite cannabis

45
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:50,559
social lounge in Colorado Springs where

46
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:52,599
we are allowed to congregate and

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,789
socialize and smoke recreational

48
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:57,159
cannabis like a responsible adult should

49
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:58,719
be allowed to so before I get to that I

50
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,049
want to talk about something I've been

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,939
seeing on Facebook the cannabis cup for

52
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:06,429
Colorado has been canceled for the year

53
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:09,008
2016 there will be no cannabis cup over

54
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,830
the 4/20 weekend high times intended to

55
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,689
have the event in Denver Colorado Adams

56
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,730
County I believe it was rejected all of

57
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:17,650
the permits and would not let high times

58
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:19,329
have their event high times had to

59
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,360
scramble to find a new location for the

60
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:25,290
cannabis cup they opted to try pueblos

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,090
they put in applications for permits

62
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:29,889
they decided through that process that

63
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,019
there would not be enough time to

64
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:34,569
advertise and organize a cannabis cup

65
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:36,219
should the event be approved so what

66
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,840
I've seen a lot on Facebook is people

67
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:39,459
bitching out high times and people

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,229
bitching out the city of Pueblo and

69
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,229
people bitching out the city of Denver

70
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:46,449
for a cannabis cup not happening hey

71
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:48,129
guys this was a huge event there's a lot

72
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:51,039
of risk involved

73
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:53,560
we can't blame any city for an event not

74
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,090
happening maybe Denver they did kick

75
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,979
high times out they did not approve the

76
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,959
permit so maybe we can be mad at them

77
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:00,729
but it is not high times his fault nor

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,069
is it Pablo's fault that this event did

79
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:06,129
not happen in the backup plan of Pueblo

80
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:08,739
ah high times submitted the permits and

81
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,870
high times also pulled the permits they

82
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,930
decided are the applications for permits

83
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,700
they decided to stop the process so

84
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,650
there wasn't enough time to get an event

85
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:19,479
together even if Puebla did approve it

86
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,370
so high times just decided to pull the

87
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,659
plug we can't blame it on anybody let's

88
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,230
quit pointing fingers let's all be

89

00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:05,590
about doing an episode about what you

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,900
could do if you came to Pueblo for the

111
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,400
cannabis cup obviously there's no point

112
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,539
in doing that because you're not going

113
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,580
to come here because there's not a

114
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:14,169
cannabis cup so I apologize for teasing

115

181
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:34,129
disclaimer out there Camille is working

183

are you the owner here is that correct

184
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:39,769
I am co-owner owner so she may have to

185
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:41,899
stand up and take off and go for a run

186
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:43,879
any given moment here so excuse her if

187
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:46,129
that happens we'll try to get some of

188
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,449
her stuff covered in the beginning of

189
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:49,639
the show here so one thing I want to

190
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,778
talk about everybody the cannabis cup

191
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,778
for Colorado

192
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,500
yeah we were all stoked about that I'm

193
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,269
sure everybody here had an idea of

194
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,819
something they wanted to do for 4/20 and

195
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:08,949
for the cannabis cup absolutely fairly

196
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:12,670
excited I think that this is going to be

197
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:15,819
kind of the turn of 4/20 being about

198
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:22,689
private events I'm kind of excited about

199
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:23,980
that I know the secret sesh we're

200
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:26,139
planning on doing something as well I

201
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,420
can't talk too much about what we're

202
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:32,250
planning on doing but I'm excited I

203
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:34,270
think this is kind of a new wave of

204
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,310
different 4/20 I think it's gonna be

205
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:37,990
cool I like the way that you put that

206
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,730
because that kind of works me into part

207
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,220
of what I wanted to talk about the

208
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,660
importance of consumption clubs since

209
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,030
they're not going to let us have large

210
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,430
events like that we need to have places

211
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:50,199
like the canna Canyon to consume our

212
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,000
cannabis for people to come and

213
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,379
socialize like we're all we're doing is

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,240
hanging out in consuming cannabis and

215
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:57,899
being friends here absolutely

216
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,670
we definitely need something like this

217
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:03,039
so before I get to that let's talk about

218
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,449
the veteran farmers Alliance event that

219
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,250
happened a couple of days ago I want to

220
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:08,199
give you a huge shout out Stephen that

221
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:14,050
was a huge event how many people do you

222
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:28,719
think Shelly was I'd see we think Matt

223
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:31,150
probably over 200 we were at the lounge

224
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,960
in Colorado Springs is another social

225
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,000
smoke lounge

226
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:39,399
shout out to the dad lounge and thank

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,590

229
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:48,160
official title the veteran farmers

230
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:50,169
Alliance get together have a good time

231
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,579
all right can you tell us a little bit

232
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:53,799
about the veteran farmers Alliance

233
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,270
absolutely basically the veteran farmers

234
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,000
Alliance brings the community together

235
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,860
brings veterans together with civilians

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,330
brings breeders together growers

237
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,230
together nutrient manufacturers and

238
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,600
glass blowers

239
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,539
it just takes everybody and brings them

240
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,659
all in one place and allows these guys

241
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:17,659
to have free genetics free information

242
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:20,689
education all that and they're able to

243
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:24,198
get it in one centralized location to

244
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,790
where they can have good medicine and

245
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:28,309
get the best medicine that's out there

246
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:29,958
it's not this watered-down crap no these

247
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:33,169
are fresh genetics good genetics and

248
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:35,359
these guys care so we had 300 people

249
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:37,219
came through this event inside of the

250
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,930
dive lounge we had breeders set up with

251
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,089
their booths they had seeds available we

252
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:42,919
had nutrient companies we had glass

253
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:45,769
companies and all of these companies

254
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:53,509
threw down stacks of merchandise for the

255
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:56,179
veterans absolutely well the total the

256
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:58,940
total value was just a little over

257
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,519
$12,000 $12,000 with the products given

258
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,680
to veterans to help them grow better

259
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:11,568
cannabis to fight their PTSD their pain

260
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:12,888
their absolutely usually respectable and

261
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:27,500
also thanks these guys to the right they

262
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:29,870
all showed up and last night there was a

263
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,190
city council meeting everybody's facial

264
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,049
expressions I'll just change everyone's

265
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,019
body language just deflate it a little

266
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:37,849
at this city council meeting a lot of

267
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,500
things went down I live in another city

268
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,180
I was trying to keep up what I

269
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,970
understand is they have put a moratorium

270
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:46,189
on more social clubs like this and in

271
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,509
eight years all clubs like this force to

272
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:52,420
close yes yes so the moratorium was

273
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:56,328
actually set in place back in September

274
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:59,318
six months a moratorium set so we're we

275
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:59,318
are reappropriation

276
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,909
what they decided was they wanted to ban

277
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:13,519
them originally supposed to be for five

278
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:18,169
years but they extended it to eight

279
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,778
years kind of a blow but at the same

280
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:23,419
time this is what the voters wanted

281
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:26,149
we're very passionate about that that's

282
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:28,250
what we believe in and that's what we're

283
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:32,688
gonna fight for so this isn't the end

284
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,708
this is just the beginning okay yes the

285
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:35,528
way that it's written does that mean

286
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:39,859
that in eight years you have to close

287
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:41,659
yes in eight years by March 2024 we will

288
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,199
have to close our doors is there a

289
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:47,958
second vote coming right so there's

290
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:51,649
another vote on March 22nd the second

291
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:53,058
round of votes but you know a lot can

292
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:56,958
happen in eight years

293
00:11:53,058 --> 00:12:10,328
marijuana can become federally legal you

294
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:14,719
know the opposite direction as well so

295
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:17,120
it gives us a little bit of time to get

296
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,339
a ballot referendum to allow these kind

297
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,759
of clubs and it gives us a little bit of

298
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:26,860
time to force legislation on the issue

299
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:29,990
because Jonathan singer himself and also

300
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,629
the representative KITT Roop from

301
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:35,600
Colorado Springs himself he's backing a

302
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:39,708
bill to legalize these types of clubs

303
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,930
statewide so these are already we

304
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:44,299
already know that there is a lot of

305
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:46,638
support here in Colorado Springs other

306
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:49,938
otherwise get root wouldn't be on board

307
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,159
absolutely so I think another thing that

308
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:55,188
really spoke volumes about that as well

309
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,659
was the amount of people that showed up

310
00:12:55,188 --> 00:13:01,909
for that initial meeting on like

311
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:06,019
February 22nd 24 yeah I mean a

312
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:07,759
standing-room-only and I think I think

313
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,909
there was only like two people out of

314
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,899
like a 120 plus that we're against these

315
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:14,659
Cubs and the majority of those people

316
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:17,688
there were very much so for them about

317
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:22,219
them and so that was very frustrating

318
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:23,599
but the community has spoken so I saw

319
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,559
the meet I watched part of the meeting

320
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,200
on the internet the other day and the

321
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:28,759
place was packed once again

322
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:44,089
we got to see our friend from the lazy

323
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:45,799
lion that guy's named Andrew I'm glad he

324
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,690
chose he's a veteran also so shout out

325
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:50,000
to the veterans cool that he came and

326
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,220
supported the vast majority of people

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,789
there were veterans how about the two

328
00:13:52,220 --> 00:14:03,079
City Council members was it okay so I

329
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:05,889
was and I asked a city council members I

330
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:08,239
said how many of your veterans show me

331
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:10,430
no not one of them raised their hands

332
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,110
they wouldn't acknowledge that they were

333
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:13,578
veterans that's disrespectful

334
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,870
absolutely disrespect and they are

335
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:19,159
veterans to their service I'm sure that

336
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:23,299
when they go other places they get a

337
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:26,028
veteran's discount of course yeah well

338
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:28,039
they wait raise their hand then but you

339
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:29,990
know they didn't raise their hand so I

340
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,028
asked I turned around and said how many

341
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:36,709
veterans are behind me and like three

342
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:38,778
quarters of the room marijuana patients

343
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:41,349
you know they these guys don't

344
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:43,909
understand this is a cry for help and

345
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,079
all those guys that raised their hands

346
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:47,389
all those guys and girls will have to

347
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:50,239
say that they raised their hands and

348
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:52,309
it's like they didn't care they don't

349
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,470
care it was an emotional cry for help

350
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,778
too there were people breaking down on

351
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,339
the stand talking about the importance

352
00:14:56,778 --> 00:15:00,078
of these clubs and the importance of

353
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,670
these gathering places because they

354
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,409
can't go anywhere else they have lease

355
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,208
agreements that prevent them from

356
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:07,519
smoking in their own homes

357
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:09,109
these are people who serve their country

358
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,850
and they're not allowed to take part in

359
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,829
the freedoms that they're guaranteed by

360
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,329
the Constitution of the state they live

361
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,979
in

362
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:18,049
it's a travesty we could almost just in

363
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,139
the show right there that was that's

364
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:22,189
yeah that's exactly what's going on

365
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:23,149
about the importance of these clubs you

366
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,500
got something to say go for it yeah

367
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:26,120
you're just gonna say and not to mention

368
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,129
shout-out to the dad launched for

369
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,919
providing an awesome space for those

370
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:32,870
veterans to have the veterans farmers

371
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:35,208
Alliance event I mean if it wasn't for

372
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,459
these social clubs that community

373
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:39,109
wouldn't be able to be brought together

374
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,849
as easily so

375
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:59,149
I gave veterans dabs for their first

376
00:15:40,850 --> 00:16:01,129
time I met four sets of parents that had

377
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,230
special needs children that were curious

378
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:05,990
about cannabis and curious about CBD and

379
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,389
it's funny that places like this bring

380
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,039
all sorts of patients throughout the

381
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:11,838
spectrum together in some way or another

382
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,299
and we help each other even if it's just

383
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,279
lending an ear and understanding or

384
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:17,569
being available and being you know

385
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:19,309
introduced to someone and networking

386
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:23,000
with someone that can help us these

387
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:25,009
clubs are absolutely essential to anyone

388
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,610
who really is seeking a healthy social

389
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:30,528
outlet in our community to not only

390
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:33,019
discuss cannabis but why it works for

391
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:35,149
them and you know I really can't see

392
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:38,000
anything healthier you know it saddens

393
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:40,610
me to see it go the way that it has and

394
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,629
you know I'm happy to help fight it in

395
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:49,070
any way possible because it's it's

396
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:52,399
[ __ ] it just makes me sad and

397
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:55,370
honestly working here also I mean we see

398
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,490
all types of members as well and one

399
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,778
thing that really kind of stands out to

400
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,850
me is the amount of questions that

401
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:05,539
people have that they're scared to ask

402
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:09,910
yeah whether it's about CBD or THC or

403
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:12,609
the benefits edibles or proper dosing

404
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,169
information that they might not get in

405
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:17,240
dispensary started cuts you off oh no no

406
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:19,130
that was just adding on that point like

407
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,599
that we were having a conversation as

408
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,100
friends at the front counter just a few

409
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,019
minutes ago to smoking dabs talking

410
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:26,240
about growing and the folks behind us

411
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:28,279
we're learning everything we were saying

412
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,808
yeah we're absorbing that as one of that

413
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,279
one of those people in that group was

414
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:33,168
learning from us on accident oh

415
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,808
definitely education and support they

416
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:38,299
get just from showing up here is crucial

417
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:40,879
yeah we can go to a bar and drink

418
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:43,220
alcohol until we die you can physically

419
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,510
drink enough alcohol at the bar there's

420
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,370
one bottle if you drink that whole

421
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:47,490
bottle of whatever you choose it will

422
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:50,189
kill you

423
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,839
you can come here and no one's going to

424
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,029
let you smoke enough cannabis to hurt

425
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,279
yourself and I don't think you can smoke

426
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:58,230
enough cannabis to hurt yourself now I

427
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,869
will say you could probably get higher

428
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,549
do some dumb [ __ ] I can argue that but

429
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:04,289
yeah I mean no one's gonna let anybody

430
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,579
that's that high leave here we all have

431
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:05,909
each other's backs we look out for each

432
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,710
other

433
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,820
I've never seen anybody getting in our

434
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:13,170
this is and that's what's different

435
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:15,000
about bars I think that's one of the

436
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,670
points that I brought up in the the

437
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,029
testimony the other day was you know we

438
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:24,808
may have had what 300 combat veterans

439
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:26,700
packed into a club we could not have

440
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:28,769
done that in an establishment serving

441
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,308
alcohol and I was a peaceful night it

442
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:35,220
would not have happened yeah it was

443
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:36,839
packed I have I have a pass with alcohol

444
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,980
and we don't get along very well so if

445
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,990
it weren't at a place that served

446
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,360
alcohol there's way less likely of a

447
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,099
chance that I would have gone yeah and a

448
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,709
lot of these guys it's the same way you

449
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:48,959
know these these veterans especially you

450
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,759
know they they've self medicated with

451
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,650
alcohol before in their lives they've

452
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,929
self medicated with pills all these

453
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,250
things are harmful to them they hurt

454
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:59,809
them they hurt them they're for their

455
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:02,940
families they hurt their their friends

456
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:04,980
bodies but but this it doesn't it brings

457
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,620
them back inside society it brings back

458
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,630
into this community that we can sit

459
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:13,799
there and help each other and take care

460
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:16,170
of one another like we should we got to

461
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:18,089
become friends and hang out guys real

462
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,519
good with words there I think the first

463
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:22,259
time I met everybody in this group the

464
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,429
first time Oh kabuki I met you at a

465
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:27,710
cannabis cup you gave me some of that

466
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:30,120
delicious banana yeah but these awesome

Steve and I met here at the can of

468
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,409
Canyon and I've met you at the event

469
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,790

470
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,679
clubs I wouldn't be making all these

I mean it went down pretty smooth I had

610
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:34,460
I did have a veteran that was upset the

611
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:37,490
way it was going down and I had him come

612

back and I talked to him and you know he

613
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,819
brought up a good point on some things

614
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,309
and so I hooked him up with the case

615
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:47,299

656
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:14,509
heal and being able to offer them that

657
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,980
that's like nobody's ever been able to

658
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:18,140
do that everybody wants to make things a

659
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,640
competition yeah we're trying to save

660
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:23,660
lives we just need to all come together

661
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,460
and stop the BS yes and just say hey

662
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,050
we're gonna take care of these guys you

663
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,460
know what I can't take care of them but

664
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:30,230
you can you take them when you're done

665
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,340
with them I'll take care of you when I'm

666
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,470
done with them you go to that next

667
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:35,089
organization it's no competition we're

668
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,970
here to save lives let's drop this

669
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,918
piddly bullsh

670
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,528
and let's start doing what we need to do

671
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,940
veterans unite pretty much there you go

672
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:44,819
and the community that's the most

673
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,620
important point exactly

674
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:49,769
people need to see that the community

675
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:51,750
and veterans can come together and they

676
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:54,269
can integrate together and they can

677
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,700
socialize and there's no drama you know

678
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:59,899
you can't do that in a bar somebody says

679
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,759
the wrong thing you know somebody's joy

680
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:04,768
that oh man you got your someone's gonna

681
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,960
get something the face yeah you know and

682
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:10,230
but you go to a cannabis club and people

683
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,240
are able to sit back relax get some

684
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:15,929
education you know throw some knowledge

685
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,730
to these guys and and and maybe show

686
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:19,470
these guys what's really up with with

687
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,579
cannabis I mean some people go in there

688
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,899
they're scared they don't know what's

689
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:27,148
going on right you know I think a lot of

690
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:30,408
the clubs in town offer free entry for

691
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:36,479
veterans I know that we do the lazy lion

692
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:37,799
does the dab lounge so if there's

693
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,120
veterans that are out there that are

694
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:45,109

another thing you mentioned PTSD in the

699
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,200
in you know veterans are the public face

700
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,600
of it right now but they are we know

701
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,940
that we are really a tiny portion of the

702
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,189
people in society that actually have

703
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,850
PTSD the vast majority are actually

704
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:11,460
women and we may be fighting a fight for

705
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:13,918
our rights right now with PTSD but we

706
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:17,519
know that we're still fighting for the

707
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,059
people who are way too hurt too scared

708
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,839

legal place for people to congregate and

consume so if you want to have somewhere

744
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,280
in smoke other than hanging out in the

745
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,220
car behind some building or something or

746
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:49,289
be public which we're technically

747
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,450
legally not allowed to do and you know

748
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:53,789
to be respectful of others you know I

749
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,380
don't feel the need for others to smell

750
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:59,069
my medicine and that's just me being

751
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,830
considerate but I also as a patient and

752
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:03,899
there's someone who's over the age of 21

753
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:07,199
recreationally don't have a lot of safe

754
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:10,080
places to go you know and not everyone

755
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,179
works in the industry or has made their

756
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:16,069
lifestyle around everything that we do

757
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:18,600
so in those moments were a patient or a

758
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:20,789
normal record herb occasional

759
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,730
recreational user might want a safe

760
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:26,899
place to enjoy cannabis what are we

761
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:29,910
gonna do if these places aren't around

762
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,100
the fact is is that if they pass laws

763
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:34,110
banning these types of establishments

764
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:36,389
they're gonna push people out into their

765
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:38,369
public spaces and who wants to smell

766
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:40,200
weed wherever they go yeah nobody wants

767
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:42,118
to smell weed wherever they go well

768
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:47,369
everyone has to go

769
00:32:42,118 --> 00:32:48,958
people breathe exactly there's a large

770
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:51,058
majority people out there who probably

771
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:53,219
are gonna want to smell weed in the

772
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:56,838
public parks why do you give people bars

773
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:59,759
so they won't sit on a public park bench

774
00:32:56,838 --> 00:33:01,588
somewhere such a great point I'm a

775
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,538
cannabis consumer I'm a breeder I'm all

776
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:05,608
about the cannabis life but I do have a

777
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:07,199
daughter that I don't hide her from

778
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:09,178
cannabis I don't hide cannabis from her

779
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:11,129
she knows what cannabis is she has not

780
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:12,749
attracted to the smell of it at all but

781
00:33:11,128 --> 00:33:14,698
I don't think that anybody should have

782
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:18,739
to be at the park with their child and

783
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:18,739
explain what those guys over there doing

784
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:25,618
my daughter about that anybody's sure I

785
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:28,468
should decide when that conversation

786
00:33:25,618 --> 00:33:29,638
yeah absolutely yeah keep that in mind

787
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:37,288
you guys know code a bit at the park

788
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:38,098
yeah those guys I completely agree I

789
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:40,019
have a daughter

790
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:42,658
very much feel the same way you know

791
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:44,699
right you know it's funny I was in City

792
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:46,349
Council me and I looked up I was like

793
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:50,068
how many liquor stores are there in

794
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:54,808
Colorado Springs hmm 104 we said how

795
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:57,898
many bars are there in our space 188 Wow

796
00:33:54,808 --> 00:34:01,918
but 15 cannabis clubs Oh everybody loses

797
00:33:57,898 --> 00:34:03,988
their [ __ ] it's kind of like when they

798
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,729
did the whole caregiver act it's not

799
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:07,469
even 1% of the people that grow in

800
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:14,909
Colorado are caregivers did they sneak

801
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:17,099
something in at that City Councilor

802
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:21,059
residential plan countess 12 plants

803
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:23,700
twelves yeah so a huge problem with that

804
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,919
in the fact that the I have a large

805
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:28,588
concentration of pediatric patients here

806
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,239
that they're not even epilepsy for the

807
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:33,449
most part their cancer patients they

808
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:37,068
Supply on it they rely on a heavy supply

809
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:40,498
of Dino THC heavy material and 12 plants

810
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:42,538
sometimes doesn't even cut 60 days of

811
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:43,980
medicine for them depending on what

812
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,950
they're working with you know most of

813
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,059
these guys are you know they're not

814
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,189
commercial growers they're not you know

815
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:53,560
they're modestly growing organically and

816
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:56,119
getting you know decent yields but

817
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:58,159
these parents can do a lot better with

818
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:01,449
some you know with more decent numbers

819
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:04,250
but restricting it to 12 I feel is just

820
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:05,899
it's gonna cause caregivers a lot more

821
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,610
headaches it's gonna cause parents who

822
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,820
are trying to grow themselves because

823
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:12,019
they can't go to dispensaries to get

824
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:16,400
what they need because they might not

825
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:22,670
have it or whatever the case is I just

826
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:25,280
feel that it's unfair and very unjust

827
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,900
yeah just about to say it seems like

828
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,940
time and time again it kind of feels

829
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,840
like we're not getting what we voted for

830
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:34,820
yeah absolutely yeah it's I feeling the

831
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,380
medical market away and forcing

832
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,780
everybody to go shop at the dispensary

833
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,640
they want the caregivers and they want

834
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,830
all of the tax money they do they was a

835
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,949
defense ruse they're actively pushing

836
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:49,069
for that and there are senators who are

837
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:53,389
trying to take away home grow as we

838
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:55,430
speak this this year actually I saw some

839
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:59,389
language off of I'm gonna go ahead and

840
00:35:55,429 --> 00:36:02,839
call her out senator Conte her desk that

841
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:05,029
wanted to limit all caregivers and

842
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:09,100
patients in the state to six plants

843
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:11,019
maximum and this would not only affect

844
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:13,869
individuals but it would affect

845
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:16,159
structures so that an apartment complex

846
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:18,710
complex would have a maximum of six

847
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:23,329
plants and that'll come in the same

848
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:29,059
apartment building exactly a felony

849
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:31,159
that's so I you know thankfully we

850
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:33,949
managed to get that language removed

851
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:36,469
from that bill but there are a lot of

852
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:38,269
issues like this that are coming up that

853
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:40,639
are coming from from the industry

854
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:44,690
they're they're being actively lobbied

855
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:47,329
for by recreational and and some medical

856
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:50,179
facilities to ones that are joint

857
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:53,000
medical record to eliminate medical

858
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:54,589
rights and push everybody into the

859
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,780
recreational market and a lot of those

860
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,760
dispensary owners have issues with clubs

861
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,619
like this because they think that it's

862
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,410
going to ruin their business as it yen

863
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,920
no not that we've noticed it's still

864
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:07,409
growing

865
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,088
yeah our shop is still open this place

866
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:11,190
is still open and every one of the

867
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:15,058
business owners that I know they are all

868
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:17,818
happy for wanting regulation they're all

869
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:20,910
for licensing none of these people that

870
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:24,480
I know that run these clubs have an

871
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:26,489
alter motive to take money from any

872
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,088
establishment but to provide a service

873
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:32,038
for people that is genuinely needed and

874
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:35,518
that's my honest two cents I don't work

875
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:37,769
for any of these clubs I you know visit

876
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:39,568
them from time to time and that's just

877
00:37:37,768 --> 00:37:43,739
honestly how I feel here every time I'm

878
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:49,829

879

11th of 2008 I was doing route clearance

896
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:43,920

901
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,608
off blue a 13 inch hole into my vehicle

902
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:02,368
and blue a 5 inch hole into my back

903
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:05,670
causing my my hip to be shattered my

904
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:08,280
pelvis to be broken and my spine to be

905
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:10,769
shifted forward causing me to have so a

906
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:15,030
little bit of spinal injury head over

907
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:16,289
200 pieces of shrapnel in me and took

908
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:18,329
about three and a half months for the

909
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:24,079
wound closed up very lucky to be alive

910

absolutely thank you I'm very happy

911
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:30,180
Thanks and for the listeners it looks

912
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,150
like if you took a normal dudes back and

913
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:35,219
it excuse me no you're good you can I

914
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,380
I'm a big dude I could put my fist in

915
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:40,230
the hole that's exactly how I described

916
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,588
to fill the hole with putty would take

917
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,969
your fist

918
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:54,029
my wife she jokes she's like I need to

919
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:56,338
slap a little bond alright alright but

920
00:39:54,030 --> 00:40:00,900
you know the whole 12 plant count thing

921
00:39:56,338 --> 00:40:04,318
like I mean I consume so much I ingest a

922
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:06,990
smoke I dab I use topicals

923
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:10,500
you know for them to cut me down to 12

924
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:13,379
when I have a 65 plant count is asinine

925
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,108
it's it's just with they're not doctors

926
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:18,750
there's no way for them to judge who

927
00:40:16,108 --> 00:40:20,818
needs what I mean the standard whatever

928
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,068
they're not medical doctors I spent

929
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:25,759
three hours with my medical doctor going

930
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:29,190
over my plant program failure rates

931
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,910
pesticide rates clone failure race you

932
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:35,849
know successful harvest you know like

933
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:36,899
fan failures light failures and you know

934
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:38,640
you go over that and then we're like

935
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,588
okay we have finished product this is

936
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,588
what's usable this was is usable and

937
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:45,869
then for City Council to have no

938
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:48,960
training in the medical field to to not

939
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:51,000
even understand what a plant count means

940
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,280
to somebody to not even understand what

941
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,920
you know what level of a grower they're

942
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,710
you know is is just

943
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,880
forgiveable it's just an insult and I'm

944
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:04,530
not gonna buy the wall because I paid

945
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,480
for that extended plant count I have

946
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:08,190
proven every right why I need that plant

947
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,809
count and they are not gonna take that

948
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,550
what it should stand up in court

949
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:13,139
oh absolutely you know I think it has

950
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,910
before you're gonna file a lawsuit

951
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:18,650
against the city phone rings yes sir

952
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:18,649
will your lawyer come to court with you

953
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:25,110
good because I have over 6,000 pages of

954
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,630
medical documents that can prove to them

955
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:29,880
that in every single manner they are

956
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:36,360
wrong you've got better SOPs than some

957
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:38,309
dispensaries I've gone to taking and

958
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,070

00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,799
craziest thing that happened was um we

981
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:34,730
like to keep a certain atmosphere for

982
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,350
members it's very important to us so

983
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:40,340
occasionally we'll have a member come in

984
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:42,809
who is intoxicated and in that moment

985
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,789
you know we try and scooch amount as

986
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:47,159
fast as possible but occasionally they

987
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:50,039
will get into the main lounge just by

988
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:52,349
people exiting so there's been one

989
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:55,230
instance where we had to escort someone

990
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:58,619
off the the premises but it was fairly

991
00:42:55,230 --> 00:43:01,170
easy they went they went kind of

992
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:03,309
willingly so that helped and and they

993
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,769
were drunk too so

994
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:07,750
no we just had to deal with a couple

995
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:09,780
drunk people that completely proved my

996
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,780
point

997
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:13,949
social lounge or the drunk people that

998
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:16,868
showed up

999
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:19,179
I can't really appreciate you is more

1000
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:22,420
than once we've had members kind of

1001
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:29,399
bring something that someone has left up

1002
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:29,400
to the counter kabuki is notorious yes

1003
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,970
my wallet on the counter here earlier

1004
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:43,779
and it was promptly returned to me it

1005
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:45,339
was yeah you called members members this

1006
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:54,070
is a place where people look out for

1007
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:57,440
each other the City Council meeting they

1008
00:43:54,070 --> 00:44:00,489
said it wasn't safe that these are safe

1009
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,489
[Music]

1010
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:11,108
city council comes and what's really

1011
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,429
frustrating is all of it Matt was

1012
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:14,019
talking is it okay if I call you Matt I

1013
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:18,269
do perfect okay

1014
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:21,759
Matt was talking about KITT repay and

1015
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:25,750
can't repay is how you said pronounce it

1016
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,000
like yeah met his name although sorry

1017
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:31,409
thank you it's a weird name it is weird

1018
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:36,190
name so they've been working on this

1019
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:38,920
this license for the clubs and um there

1020
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:41,470
there came out and said nothing's made

1021
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,750
in a vacuum and that's very true and

1022
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:45,909
what's frustrating is it feels like city

1023
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:48,969
council does not have that mentality at

1024
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:52,899
all they can't seem to grasp or

1025
00:44:48,969 --> 00:44:57,309
understand a few different sides whether

1026
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:59,289
it be veterans people who consume on a

1027
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:02,019
recreational level or even just business

1028
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:04,840
owners they just don't seem to want to

1029
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:07,420
listen to what we have to say

1030
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,920
but ya can't repay an Jonathan singer

1031
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,970
are doing some really awesome

1032
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:16,090
progressive stuff with the licensing and

1033
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:17,799
trying to make these clubs here to stay

1034
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:21,010
which I can appreciate but Colorado

1035
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,630
Springs a whole nother story right yeah

1036
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,550
we have the same issues in Pueblo it

1037
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:27,010
feels like our city council hears us and

1038
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,269
we're like we want social clubs and they

1039
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,930
turn around they talk to each other and

1040
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:33,400
they they go guess what happens do they

1041
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:37,469
just like yeah have these conversations

1042
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:40,690
right in front of you and it's insane

1043
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:42,309
aren't they there to represent us aren't

1044
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:44,650
we supposed to be telling them what they

1045
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:46,358
want they provide it and then 200 people

1046
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:48,760
show up and they say we want this and

1047
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:53,619
two people say no and the whole City

1048
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:55,740
Council can say oh yeah no I did that

1049
00:45:53,619 --> 00:46:00,460
you were saying it's it's just act

1050
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:02,229
yeah it's incredibly upsetting to me so

1051
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:05,320
sorry if I'm for a lack of words at the

1052
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:08,349
moment but yeah that is infuriating to

1053
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:12,010
see that and I mean it's like four

1054
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:13,839
people come up wait is bad and they're

1055
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,490
spitting out facts that you could go on

1056
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,619
the internet and it's like yeah that's

1057
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:19,479
been there reading [ __ ] off a piece of

1058
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:21,039
paper not looking anyone in the eye then

1059
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,769
walking out of the room right George

1060
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,719
it's in its stack because they had the

1061
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:28,539
people that were four against all go up

1062
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:30,639
first it's not like you know normal

1063
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:32,380
sessions everybody's allowed to voice

1064
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:34,719
their opinion whether for or against

1065
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,820
Cooley at the same time that way you can

1066
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:37,779
hear both sides know it's they said

1067
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,859
their thing and they got to leave

1068
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,300
because they're like yeah we're not

1069
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:41,858
gonna make these old people stay and

1070
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,510
that's who it was the people that are

1071
00:46:41,858 --> 00:46:45,519
complaining we're over 60 and you know

1072
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:50,800
what that's not cool man you made a very

1073
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:51,820
very firmness propaganda exactly and a

1074
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,500
lot of people that were making these

1075
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,990
complaints or more about the opposition

1076
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:58,480
of what happened after we voted in him

1077
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:59,949
in 64 then about the club's themselves

1078
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,429
and I feel like that distinction was

1079
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:05,049
completely lost in translation if yeah

1080
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:08,409
most of them like they would say things

1081
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:11,560
like my I live next door to an apartment

1082
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:15,909
complex and the people there they smoke

1083
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:17,570
they smoked marijuana x' and they they

1084
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:19,879
they grow the marilyn

1085
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:23,860
and they vent it right out into the open

1086
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:26,960
and it had nothing to do with the actual

1087
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:29,030
consumption clubs whatsoever they were

1088
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,970
complaining about the the ancillary

1089
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:33,680
effects of amendment 64 they're just

1090
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:36,829
stuck in the mud and if they have a

1091
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:39,409
problem with it then they should take it

1092
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:41,500
up with the voters who actually voted

1093
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:47,719
amendment 64 into our state constitution

1094
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:59,300
Constitution right now people call it

1095
00:47:47,719 --> 00:48:19,179
marijuana's CBD I don't like it when

1096
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:21,289
people PluralEyes waters drivers anymore

1097
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:22,399
so these clubs are important you guys we

1098
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:26,389
need to do everything we can to

1099
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,380
absolutely hustle to what can we do for

1100
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:28,940
the next eight years is there anything

1101
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,840
we can do to sway them on that one or is

1102
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,990
that a permanent thing here in Springs

1103
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,940
okay

1104
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:37,369
so right now what I can say is that

1105
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:43,909
there are petitions at a lot of the

1106
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:46,759
clubs here in town to kind of what's the

1107
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:49,609
word recall yeah

1108
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,050
the ban so you can get out there you can

1109
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,150
put your name on the list

1110
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:55,370
no let your city know that this is not

1111
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:59,210
something you're down for and that's

1112
00:48:55,369 --> 00:49:00,889
what we can do initially there's an

1113
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,750
online petition as well Stephen says

1114
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:04,250
Steve and Camille are politely sharing a

1115
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:06,469
mic so sometimes Stephen gets cut off

1116

want everybody in Colorado to sign it if

1159
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:05,208
you're a computer nerd figure out some

1160
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:07,519
way to set up your computer and proxy in

1161
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:09,948
yes and change your IP address every

1162
00:51:07,518 --> 00:51:11,889
time and just do it billion times

1163
00:51:09,949 --> 00:51:14,449
absolutely I didn't say that on the air

1164
00:51:11,889 --> 00:51:16,759
hire some kid in Malaysia to do it on

1165
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:17,298
Fiverr yeah that's fine I'm not gonna

1166
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:19,639
argue with you

1167
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:22,400
also in canvas to me after that whole

1168
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:25,489
city council people are talking about

1169
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,939
running for office now oh yeah yeah

1170
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:30,619
someone needs to kabuki yeah okay the

1171
00:51:28,938 --> 00:51:35,389
problem with that is

1172
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:37,699
a lot maybe in Pueblo but here's the

1173
00:51:35,389 --> 00:51:39,500
thing what's happening in the Springs

1174
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:41,149
right now yes we obviously need a voice

1175
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,980
we need a voice on that council but I

1176
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:46,160
think it also starts with maybe removing

1177
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:47,869
if these people who are supposed to

1178
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,369
represent us won't listen then maybe

1179
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:50,869
they shouldn't be representing us and

1180
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:53,599
that's what it comes down to their job

1181
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:56,029
so maybe getting that rotten apple out

1182
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,699
of the bunch and trying to progressively

1183
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:02,510
put someone who will voice all of our

1184
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:04,849
concerns and I mean yeah we do need to

1185
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:07,880
find someone and I wish I had the time

1186
00:52:04,849 --> 00:52:09,500
but I know there are much more people

1187
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,160
out there much more qualified to do

1188
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,789
something like that

1189
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:16,279
and I would willingly back them a

1190
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:18,050
hundred percent foxtrax run see with

1191
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,390
ijen eggs and just me as a person as an

1192
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:25,940
advocate and I know Thursday's yeah sure

1193
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:27,920
why not someone's gotta someone's got to

1194
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,079
teach them but that's the thing there

1195
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,880
needs to be education these guys have no

1196
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,000
education they're basing all of their

1197
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:38,450
decisions on their emotions and you know

1198
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,780
the 50 year old arguments the most

1199
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:43,519
outdated medical information exactly and

1200
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:46,580
and what's happening is when you have

1201
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:49,759
maybe seven people come up and say no

1202
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:52,610
and you have over 200 people willing to

1203
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,200
testify that they want something you

1204
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:55,849
should be supporting the people that

1205
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:58,879
look that want it I mean that's what the

1206
00:52:55,849 --> 00:53:01,730
people want or it's not it's fair it's

1207
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:06,380
just it's it's insane to me that you can

1208
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:10,400
not even just hear or try to shelve it

1209
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:11,960
to make two hundred people I mean was it

1210
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,150
less than twelve people that came up

1211
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,340
against it I mean it sees eleven okay

1212
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:18,889
yeah so less than a dozen people - like

1213
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:20,930
200 people in a room motion batteries so

1214
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:24,019
that was about 30 minutes yeah testimony

1215
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:26,299
five hours all right yeah Wow five hours

1216
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:28,070
of testimony and even after all that you

1217
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,150
know you disrespect other veterans you

1218
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,920
don't even acknowledge that you're a

1219
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:34,610
veteran and then you sit there and you

1220
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:38,000
have these smart ass looks like wasn't

1221
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:40,490
one of them nodding off yeah yeah yeah

1222
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,110
and someone did because that would have

1223
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:42,739
made me fear so to throw a shoe at that

1224
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:46,849
dude

1225
00:53:42,739 --> 00:53:49,189
that's it's ridiculous guys crying yeah

1226
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:51,139
your job is to stay awake this is your

1227
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:53,780
job do you mean yeah and they're all

1228
00:53:51,139 --> 00:53:57,618
over 6000 most of them are only 65 you

1229
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:59,300
know what's past if you're over 50s time

1230
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:01,430
to leave office isn't there the right to

1231
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,869
redo the entire meeting since somebody

1232
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:06,169
fell asleep there was a member not

1233
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:08,780
present 488 they didn't even represent

1234
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:12,110
deaf people there no have a person that

1235
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:13,730
is sign language who's good with the

1236
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:15,230
legal [ __ ] in Springs help us out here

1237
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,750
maybe that meeting can be totally redone

1238
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:19,490
since a city council member took a nap

1239
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,690
during the meeting maybe we need a redo

1240
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,949
on that whole thing thank you since

1241
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,630
there wasn't something there for deaf

1242
00:54:21,949 --> 00:54:25,730
people so that they could hear and

1243
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:27,160
participate as well maybe we need a redo

1244
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:31,159
maybe we need to try that one over

1245
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:33,879
absolutely to see how this second vote

1246
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:37,219
will go on what's the ones the date

1247
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:41,329
right okay can the public come to that

1248
00:54:37,219 --> 00:54:47,118
one again yeah they're not gonna

1249
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:49,099
actually allow public comment protests

1250
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,470
actually is that our best bet right now

1251
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:53,569
is to call like a massive amount of

1252
00:54:51,469 --> 00:54:56,239
people and show people how unhappy we

1253
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:58,190
are but I still don't think that that

1254
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:59,750
would actually sway their vote but it

1255
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:02,090
would at least show them what they're

1256
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:04,340
doing is wrong and we're starting to

1257
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:06,260
assemble yeah exactly that we are active

1258
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:08,660
and that we can we can actually change

1259
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:12,080
the face politics in Colorado Springs we

1260
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:13,579
can get them on out of office isn't it

1261
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,858
I'm sorry go ahead

1262
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:17,869
I've just seen it done in Denver you

1263
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:22,549
know I've I've hiked up to the Capitol

1264
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:25,010
plenty times to stop this [ __ ] for lack

1265
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:27,170
of better words they've so many bills

1266
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:28,730
that they've tried to pass with children

1267
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:32,720
not being able to medicate on school

1268
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:36,230
grounds them trying to CPS trying to say

1269
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:41,449
that any parent with the red card was

1270
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:43,309
you know basically you know in drink

1271
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:45,079
engaging their child you know if they

1272
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:47,480
had yeah just a whole bunch of [ __ ] that

1273
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:49,819
we've had to go through so I feel like

1274
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,530
in the springs first of all educating

1275
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,269
people about what's going on just like

1276
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:56,059
we did in Denver

1277
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:58,159
and bring making people aware of

1278
00:55:56,059 --> 00:56:00,798
everything and then like I like Matt

1279
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:03,769
said getting people together to actively

1280
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:06,230
show that we can be the face of change

1281
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:08,929
we do need that down here these clubs

1282
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:12,170
are essential limiting that plant count

1283
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:14,298
is absolute [ __ ] I've been getting

1284
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,470
phone calls non-stop from these parents

1285
00:56:14,298 --> 00:56:16,849
that are freaking out about that and

1286
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:19,909
patients that are freaking out because

1287
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:22,910
they're actively growing anywhere from

1288
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:24,409
you know whatever you know 24 to 36 or

1289
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:26,719
sixty plants you know whatever the case

1290
00:56:24,409 --> 00:56:28,159
is pending on their needs without a

1291
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:29,929
problem without there ever being

1292
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,489
overages or stacks and sometimes they

1293
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:33,379
still come showed up for their medicine

1294
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:34,848
when it comes time to be processed even

1295
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:37,068
with that many plants depending on what

1296
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:40,849
they grow and how they grow so I just

1297
00:56:37,068 --> 00:56:44,179
think it's insane for an Olympic city to

1298
00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:47,778
talk about limiting what patients can

1299
00:56:44,179 --> 00:56:50,298
and cannot grow and how they can it just

1300
00:56:47,778 --> 00:56:52,699
upsets me so much that that also wasn't

1301
00:56:50,298 --> 00:56:55,190
talked about enough that wasn't you know

1302
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:56,659
DEA the focus on the clubs is equally

1303
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:58,670
important but I feel like they're

1304
00:56:56,659 --> 00:57:00,828
sliding one in with the other and that's

1305
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:03,559
horseshit and that needs to be addressed

1306
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:05,869
more and I feel like within the group of

1307
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:07,849
everyone that's for the clubs and and I

1308
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:10,789
don't think you know people are aware

1309
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:12,528
about these plan counts if I if we bring

1310
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:14,180
both these groups of people together

1311
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:15,798
that have this the same invested

1312
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:17,750
interest I think we'd have a greater

1313
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:19,940
showing and that's just you know my

1314
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:22,010
personal opinions so I'm more than happy

1315
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:24,349
to reach out to the people that I know

1316
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:26,180
that are really coming at me and are

1317
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:28,068
distraught about them you know cutting

1318
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:29,868
down the residential plant count and

1319
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:31,608
obviously you know we know all the

1320
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:33,920
veterans and all our friends and all our

1321
00:57:31,608 --> 00:57:35,449
colleagues that are in this business and

1322
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,039
are for these clubs they're doing

1323
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:38,808
amazing things in the community let's

1324
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:41,359
get together this is the only way we're

1325
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:43,220
gonna make a change is to put any little

1326
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:45,348
thing aside and come together so we can

1327
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:46,608
actually show them the real numbers and

1328
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:48,680
the real faces of people that they're

1329
00:57:46,608 --> 00:57:51,650
affecting do you think we'd be so bold

1330
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:53,149
to show them give them maybe a preview

1331
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,490
of what's gonna happen if they ban these

1332
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:57,108
clubs on the 22nd I say we get a

1333
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:59,358
thousand people out there by City

1334
00:57:57,108 --> 00:58:02,298
Council and just smoke it up let's show

1335
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:03,848
them what happened yeah massive civil

1336
00:58:02,298 --> 00:58:06,699
disobedience

1337
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:08,528
it works yes I mean that might be what

1338
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:11,588
it takes to show them I mean we won our

1339
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:14,768
clubs we don't want to do this but maybe

1340
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:16,960
this is an example we need where does

1341
00:58:14,768 --> 00:58:18,728
that lead us and how okay so and that

1342
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,809
was something I don't know if it was you

1343
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:22,328
or somebody else brought a point of

1344
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:24,640
about Manitou and then being in the same

1345
00:58:22,329 --> 00:58:27,339
El Paso County and then allowing

1346
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:31,538
recreational cannabis do they have clubs

1347
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:34,599
in Manitou or now okay so I just don't

1348
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:36,369
understand how you're going to allow

1349
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:38,229
these different assets you know these

1350
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:40,358
even with medical big Medical

1351
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:42,068
dispensaries we have attend down here in

1352
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:44,170
the springs we have a ton of places or

1353
00:58:42,068 --> 00:58:48,699
medical and recreational patients can go

1354
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:50,920
and take me taken care of and then where

1355
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:53,018
they go okay that's just the truth of it

1356
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,720
that's that option why are you setting

1357
00:58:53,018 --> 00:58:57,848
up your pro the police chief I mean just

1358
00:58:55,719 --> 00:59:01,268
to not to jump on my note but he came in

1359
00:58:57,849 --> 00:59:05,170
the room and basically said this is this

1360
00:59:01,268 --> 00:59:08,199
is not enforceable so and that being

1361
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:10,210
said that's coming from the words of the

1362
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:11,618
police chief of our city basically

1363
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:13,869
telling us that there's really no way

1364
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:21,608
for them to be able to enforce this

1365
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:24,278
didn't he say he put in 900 hours to

1366
00:59:21,608 --> 00:59:26,078
bring a single kid to college and

1367
00:59:24,278 --> 00:59:28,509
whatever it was and our tax money like

1368
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,700
I'm just saying like stupid thousand

1369
00:59:28,509 --> 00:59:33,099
hours divided by 40 our other cops

1370
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:35,828
probably yeah we're work week how many

1371
00:59:33,099 --> 00:59:38,259
cops was that for how much Thole yeah

1372
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:39,400
yeah for one club citizens of Colorado

1373
00:59:38,259 --> 00:59:45,489
Springs you paid for that

1374
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:49,960
yeah no charges brought nine thousand

1375
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:51,940
hours at a cops wage so that's what you

1376
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,619
guys paid for them to come and hang out

1377
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:55,869
at one of these clubs with us try to

1378
00:59:53,619 --> 00:59:57,460
mingle yeah and they still don't

1379
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:58,900
understand it probably came here and got

1380
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,239
stoned how God had a great ass time

1381
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:05,440
models oh yeah watch cartoons and eat

1382
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:08,108
pizza but yeah so that's also it creates

1383
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,229
a little confusion because you have the

1384
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:13,869
council saying one thing police chief is

1385
01:00:11,228 --> 01:00:15,759
telling you another citizen saying a

1386
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:16,780
completely different thing yeah no one's

1387
01:00:15,759 --> 01:00:23,409
being heard

1388
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:25,960
you have a couple yeah and if the police

1389
01:00:23,409 --> 01:00:28,509
isn't gonna enforce it and the citizens

1390
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:31,570
obviously want it it's only a matter of

1391
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:34,090
time putting that wall breaks and we

1392
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:36,640
just keep pushing forward yep there you

1393
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:38,500
go well I have a question for Camille if

1394
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:39,909
now that they've done this they're

1395
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:42,760
giving you eight years to recoup your

1396
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:45,719
funds and there's no regulation doesn't

1397
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:48,580
that reopen the black market can it I

1398
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:51,849
wasn't gonna go there encourages the

1399
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:55,269
Craigslist seller it encourages um deals

1400
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:58,089
going on behind in parks behind schools

1401
01:00:55,269 --> 01:01:02,019
and parking lots that's what that

1402
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:03,789
encourages now we have tourists

1403
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:08,440
like I said jumping on Craigslist

1404
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:09,699
looking for 420 weed marijuana these are

1405
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,760
things that were brought up at the

1406
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:16,449
meeting for the licensing with Carrie

1407
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:19,590
pay and Jonathan singer so they're just

1408
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:21,939
not thinking it through like at all huh

1409
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:23,230
it's all about the outside image even

1410
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:25,780
though you can see through it it's all

1411
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:28,119
about what it brings to other cities or

1412
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:30,460
other businesses that may want to come

1413
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:32,289
to this city it's a very military town

1414
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:34,990
there's a lot of military influence here

1415
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:37,090
and an Church influence and true yeah

1416
01:01:34,989 --> 01:01:40,209
both yeah I mean are weird kind of a

1417
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:42,340
area they want to keep that image they

1418
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:44,590
don't want to look like Pueblo or Denver

1419
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:47,829
they want to have that clean military

1420
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:49,990
churchy feel yeah unfortunately the data

1421
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:54,819
goes the other way after they legalized

1422
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:58,659
marijuana soldiers piss and hot actually

1423
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:59,980
went down so they went in the opposite

1424
01:01:58,659 --> 01:02:11,199
direction now that it's legal it's no

1425
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:13,090
fun yeah they'll do their yeah and

1426
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,669
that's how most veterans that I know

1427
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:18,280
even felt being out of state out of

1428
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:20,139
medical states is you know in do their

1429
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,610
time or you know they serve their tour

1430
01:02:20,139 --> 01:02:24,429
whatever the case those and come back

1431
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:26,710
and medicate and be done with the whole

1432
01:02:24,429 --> 01:02:27,750
thing girl on their beard and be happy

1433
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:30,130
you know

1434
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:31,960
when you come to Colorado yeah you know

1435
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:34,090
why [ __ ] up while you're working you

1436
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,740
know those if your employee says you

1437
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,789
can't and obviously that's the rule of

1438
01:02:35,739 --> 01:02:38,709
the game if that's how you're getting

1439
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:40,630
your money you know if that's what's

1440
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:43,420
paying for your school why jeopardize it

1441
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:45,010
out trip I know more people think about

1442
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:48,490
it that way than the other but at the

1443
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:50,320
same time that's also asking someone not

1444
01:02:48,489 --> 01:02:52,689
to medicate and that's a very hard

1445
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:55,230
choice that people have to make to make

1446
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:59,289
all those decisions so you know it's a

1447
01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:02,369
double-edged sword on that you know but

1448
01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:06,539
to that thought of this place being a

1449
01:03:02,369 --> 01:03:10,630
church heavy military town

1450
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:13,630
I know more housewives and girls I know

1451
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:15,940
that consume cannabis you know that's

1452
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:21,789
such a closeted thing in this community

1453
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:24,130
it's really funny weeds the did the

1454
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:30,670
biggest growing demographic of weed

1455
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:32,890
smokers is about 55 nice elderly people

1456
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:34,530
are flocking to Colorado in order to

1457
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:41,409

1468
01:04:04,659 --> 01:04:08,049

yeah with those people are profoundly

1472
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:23,740
grateful that these places exist

1473
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:25,720
you know they mean and it showed that

1474
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:28,389
the other night I mean a lot of them

1475
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:29,439
broke down into tears otherwise you got

1476
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:32,139
people that just bought their first

1477
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,670

1478
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:36,029
first AB they're in their car so first

1479
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,030
marijuana

1480
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,490
have you guys seen that there's a

1481
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:45,160
documentary or the dudes light in the

1482
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:47,949
bottom of the pipe you don't know what

1483
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:49,599
you're doing you're brand new I get the

1484
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:53,559
glass hot and somebody here will

1485
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:56,230
definitely show you how between going

1486
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:57,849
into a dispensary and talking to some

1487
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:00,039
chick that has big tits and there's no

1488
01:04:57,849 --> 01:05:03,519
education on what strain does what or

1489
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:05,409
this or that she's just there oh yeah

1490
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:07,059
that falls up to management you know and

1491
01:05:05,409 --> 01:05:09,339
they're right into that regard

1492
01:05:07,059 --> 01:05:12,150
I will say I love the Springs that there

1493
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:15,789
are a lot of places here that have good

1494
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:19,869
educated but tenders now you go into a

1495
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:21,880
club like this it's different yeah and

1496
01:05:19,869 --> 01:05:24,339
there's also another issue I mean if you

1497
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,970
get you get a 21 year old kid you know

1498
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:29,230
would you rather him go to a bar where a

1499
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:31,179
bartender can sit there and monitor him

1500
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:33,550
and then cut him off when he's had

1501
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:35,619
enough or would you rather him go to a

1502
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:38,230
liquor store and go home with a bottle

1503
01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:40,659
of vodka and get himself stupid drunk

1504
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:42,369
and ended up destroying something or

1505
01:05:40,659 --> 01:05:46,119
getting behind the wheel and destroying

1506
01:05:42,369 --> 01:05:49,179
somebody yeah I'd rather him be at a

1507
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:51,489
cannabis club not drinking if he were my

1508
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:52,960
son sitting on the couch collection

1509
01:05:51,489 --> 01:06:01,359
conversation listening to laid-back

1510
01:05:52,960 --> 01:06:03,250
music and I see people do that these

1511
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,590
clubs members might not offer whatever

1512
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,989
the case is none of these club owners

1513
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:10,059
wake them up early to leave or you know

1514
01:06:07,989 --> 01:06:12,250
it's not about a turnkey spot thing and

1515
01:06:10,059 --> 01:06:13,869
they rest there comfortably till they're

1516
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:15,699
comfortable enough to wake up and you

1517
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:18,190
know they make sure they're okay they're

1518
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:20,049
hydrated every club I've been to has

1519
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:22,119
literally had that mentality and I point

1520
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:24,030
that out to people because people don't

1521
01:06:22,119 --> 01:06:27,400
know and they assume that it runs like

1522
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:29,800
something that's not I like to take huge

1523
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,840
dabs and to sometimes when I take a

1524
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,400
giant dab here before I can blow it all

1525
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,960
the way out somebody's got a bottle of

1526
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:42,190
water in my face like you're gonna need

1527
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:43,630
this bro you never have to cough more

1528
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:46,539
than once or twice before someone's got

1529
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:48,309
water for you and they're free think so

1530
01:06:46,539 --> 01:06:49,179
yeah if you're thirsty you need a couch

1531
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:52,449
and it

1532
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:54,399
it's a great sport here for you the

1533
01:06:52,449 --> 01:06:55,509
mixture of people is always great here -

1534

policy we defend all kinds of natural

1563
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:11,289
individual rights such as the right to

1564

access medicine safe access of medicine

1569
01:08:22,118 --> 01:08:26,710
is is the primary one that we lobby on

1570
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:28,658
here in Colorado because it is such a

1571
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:32,198
big issue here this is a new industry

1572
01:08:28,658 --> 01:08:34,509
it's forming and it's the Wild West you

1573
01:08:32,198 --> 01:08:36,399
know there's there's no real regulation

1574
01:08:34,509 --> 01:08:39,158
it's being crafted right now we're

1575
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:41,588
setting policy and everyone's eyes are

1576
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:43,088
on us we are the revolution yes to be a

1577
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:45,908
part of it thanks for standing up for it

1578
01:08:43,088 --> 01:08:49,000
with us well it's I'm proud to do so

1579
01:08:45,908 --> 01:08:51,670
thank you thank you so now also if you

1580
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,500
are in a state that has not gone legal

1581
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:55,569
with cannabis yet start if you're

1582
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,399
writing the rules to create medical

1583
01:08:55,569 --> 01:09:00,730
and/or recreational cannabis in your

1584
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,778
state be sure to include these social

1585
01:09:00,729 --> 01:09:03,278
clubs

1586
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:05,080
make sure they can be open make sure

1587
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,509
that they exist make sure they're

1588
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:09,430
regulated in a fair way make it I

1589
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:11,920
recommend that you make it tour these

1590
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:13,569
places have a grow tour these social

1591
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,310
clubs have a grow attached to them that

1592
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:17,500
can provide the product to this place

1593
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:20,259
would be ideal in my opinion or at least

1594
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:23,380
a private road right that has like an

1595
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:26,289
overabundance and they want to offload

1596
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:27,970
their their extra they should be able to

1597
01:09:26,289 --> 01:09:30,880
do that I mean we should be able to

1598
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:33,490
stimulate and stabilize the economy in

1599
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,930
every shape in way and manner I mean it

1600
01:09:33,489 --> 01:09:37,420
only makes sense to do that and by

1601
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:39,520
blocking that we're just blocking you

1602
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:41,500
know really good medicine that otherwise

1603
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,150
could be shared all over the city

1604
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:45,430
how many potholes did you guys hit on

1605
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:48,039
the way over here oh [ __ ] yeah right

1606
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:50,440
swerve every six months in Colorado

1607
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:52,180
Springs because of the potholes if we

1608
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:54,129
could kind of do proper things with the

1609
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,780
tax money yeah enter a proper tax

1610
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:58,090
revenue places like this we could fix

1611
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:59,679
some of the damn pothole pothole could

1612
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:02,529
be filled with Bob yep fill those

1613
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:03,789
potholes with pot money let's do it what

1614
01:10:02,529 --> 01:10:05,920
it's for I want to give a shout out to

1615
01:10:03,789 --> 01:10:08,380
Rhode Island I was told there in Rhode

1616
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:11,140
Island the dispensaries are going to

1617
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:12,940
open without grows attached and the

1618
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,070
grows will be done by guys like you and

1619
01:10:12,939 --> 01:10:16,779
I that know how to grow and we can take

1620
01:10:15,069 --> 01:10:29,529
it to the dispensaries and legally sell

1621
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:33,329
it to them you do three three sheets

1622
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:33,329
paper you get a test and then you can go

1623
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,670
that every last grower the top-notch

1624
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:44,409
growers in Colorado they they're not a

1625
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:47,710
dispensaries no they're independent guys

1626
01:10:44,409 --> 01:10:50,289
guys who are running their own grows and

1627
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:52,029
they're growing the best medicine in the

1628
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:53,019
entire state in the entire country in

1629
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:55,829
the entire world

1630
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:59,110
all the best growers I know are

1631
01:10:55,829 --> 01:11:01,639
independent growers or breeders or have

1632
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:04,789
not working with

1633
01:11:01,639 --> 01:11:07,880
yeah and it's very rare I may be you I

1634
01:11:04,789 --> 01:11:09,859
guess like I'm Jeff you're the first I'm

1635
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,329
trying I run a small grow I've got a

1636
01:11:09,859 --> 01:11:13,250
very small grow that I breed a lot in

1637
01:11:11,329 --> 01:11:15,500
mostly I'm trying to bring that quality

1638
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:17,600
to this large facility I'm running the

1639
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:20,679
green and healthy wellness grow now 85

1640
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,880
flowering lights I see why the quality

1641
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:24,710
falls off a little bit it's a lot of

1642
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,618
stuff to manage it's a new environment

1643
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:29,329
you can't just throw up a 14,000 BTU air

1644
01:11:27,618 --> 01:11:32,750
conditioner a couple of blowers a fan

1645
01:11:29,329 --> 01:11:34,368
going yeah yeah I put in tons of air

1646
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:37,158
conditioning you have to have ducting

1647
01:11:34,368 --> 01:11:41,179
for days there are miles of PVC tubing

1648
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:44,420
in that grow I use one room uses a

1649
01:11:41,179 --> 01:11:46,368
thousand gallons of water a day if I mix

1650
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:48,289
one of those tanks off of it imagine the

1651
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:50,118
amounts of nutrients I'm mixing there's

1652
01:11:48,289 --> 01:11:52,550
one thousand seven hundred and fifty

1653
01:11:50,118 --> 01:11:54,198
milliliters of one nutrient that goes in

1654
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:55,789
there and I'm using five or six

1655
01:11:54,198 --> 01:12:00,559
different things if I mess one of those

1656
01:11:55,789 --> 01:12:02,149
up imagine the catastrophe trying to

1657
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,460
bring that level of quality to that

1658
01:12:02,149 --> 01:12:06,529
playing field it's a true challenge not

1659
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:09,880
a lot of people don't take any of those

1660
01:12:06,529 --> 01:12:13,988
things into account you brought that up

1661
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:16,279
I see why the small boutique grows are

1662
01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:17,718
preferred and beneficial it's hard to

1663
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:19,460
get this stuff going on in a big

1664
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:23,389
facility like that yeah okay TIFF there

1665
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:27,020
I promise for sure most of it solo right

1666
01:12:23,389 --> 01:12:29,929
I can take probably 78 percent credit

1667
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:31,310
for it in the first run at the new grow

1668
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:33,289
the ladies helped a lot shot it to

1669
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:35,719
damsel and Haley they did give me a lot

1670
01:12:33,289 --> 01:12:37,310
of help John hunt is in there as often

1671
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:39,590
as he can and then I have a crew of a

1672
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:41,060
few dudes that come occasionally and do

1673
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:43,760
if I need things that I just can't

1674
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:46,400
handle by myself they do D leafing so I

1675
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,260
could take like 75 80 percent credit for

1676
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:51,618
it yeah and hunt runs a lot of the

1677
