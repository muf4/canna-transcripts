hitting my hitman eseries sidecar this

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,289
is my first hitman rig and I have been

72
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,010
impressed since my first rip out of any

73
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:40,590
hitman rig I can remember the first time

74
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:43,889
I hit a hitman I hit a hitman sidecar

75
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,569
with my homie Hank we may have been in

76
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:50,518
his car buddy Hank for introducing me to

77
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,989
the world of hit man glass I have not

78
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,760
looked back since then

79
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,860
you guys I know everybody likes a nice

80
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,750
custom rig a nice colorful rig made by

81
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,650
some fancy artist it's always great to

82
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,750
have in your collection

83
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,640
but sometimes you pay a bunch of money

84
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,560
and you go to hit that rig and when you

85
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,699
put water in it the first time you go to

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,500
draw through it you get water in your

87
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:08,759
mouth every time you try to take a dab

88
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,829
you get water in your mouth because the

89
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,209
water level has to be just at this

90
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,650
awkward level to where when you hit it

91
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,969
you get water in your mouth where you

92
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,560
can put a little less water and not get

93
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:20,359
any bubbles that never happens with

94
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,390

they're out to get the entire cannabis

134
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,830
community what I read today was as long

135
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:57,589
as you don't post pictures of yourself

136
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:59,359
using cannabis you can post pictures of

137
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,469
your plants and of your rigs and of your

138
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,060
hash and of your buds

139
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,950
you just can't post pictures of yourself

140
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,360
smoking is what somebody tried to tell

141
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:09,800
me today and you know what it seems true

142
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,750
because the accounts that are getting

143
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,490
deleted or people smoking and the counts

144
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,470
the accounts that are still there they

145
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,910
don't have images of them smoking so I'm

146
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,550
gonna try to stick with that I'll just

147
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,200

mention absolute number 106 you guys I

181
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,410
put up episode number 106 a couple of

182
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:30,610
weeks ago and stitcher failed to grab

183
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,860
the episode it would not play on

184
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,020
stitcher but since then it has been

185
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,160
fixed so if you are a stitcher listener

186
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,560
you can go back and listen to episode

187
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,689
number 106 it's kind of an important

188
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,189
episode if you're uh if you hang out

189
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,269

190
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,759

192
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,490
kind of important it tells you a little

193
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:50,229
bit about what's going on in my world I

194
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,540

196

197
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,349

202
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,140
106 is about I no longer work at the

215
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,529
saying I quit the spot recently I just

216
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,250
wasn't working for me nothing personal

217
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:34,779
against the spot

218
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,180
it just wasn't they don't have any

219
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:38,750
plants yet and I'm a pot grower so I

220
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,129
needed to be growing and that

221
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,750
so I quit but c-spot held a contest or

222
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,180
maybe a raffle it wasn't really a

223
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,730
contest what they did was anybody who

224
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,069
spent over $50 in purchases got their

225
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,110
name entered into a raffle to win two

226
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:56,269
tickets to the Grateful Dead concert at

227
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,250
the First Bank Center just a couple of

228
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,120
nights ago it wasn't actually the

229
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,160
Grateful Dead they called themselves

230
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,569
dead end Co it's most of the members of

231
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,920
the Grateful Dead but the bass player

232
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,849
and the lead guitar player and the

233
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,080
keyboard player are new guys because

234
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,060
well the guitar players dead yeah

235
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:12,620
Jerry's Jerry Garcia has been dead for

236
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,000
several years so they had John Mayer of

237
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,860
all people replace him

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,600
they had Oteil Burbridge replaced the

239
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,490
bass player because Phil lashes out with

240
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,660
bladder cancer and if you know anything

241
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,400
about the Grateful Dead you know that

242
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,750
they just have an issue with keyboard

243
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,209
players their keyboard players seem to

244
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,569
die for some reason so this time they

245
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:31,879
had Jeff Jim NT on keyboards but so when

246
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,429
the spot had this raffle to anybody that

247
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,288

248
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,299
tickets by being entered into a raffle

249
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:40,519

this version of the Grateful Dead on

268
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,860
Tuesday and I think it's great because I

269
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:23,449
quit the spa a week ago and I'm still

270

getting perks and hookups from the spot

271
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,270
so showed up to the spot for the free

272
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,919

280
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,779
Dead show that was kind of a fun

281
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,610
experience and also big shout out to

282

Rachel is good seeing you there it's fun

283
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,959
watching you blow big ole vape clouds

284
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:48,889
through the whole show but ya see the

285
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,588
Grateful Dead and I think it's kind of

286
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,179
neat that the job I quit a week ago kind

287
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,830
of in a roundabout way gave me free

288
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:57,169
tickets to go see the Grateful Dead that

289
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,180
was ironic in my mind but uh the

290
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:01,610
Grateful Dead holy crap that was such a

291
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:04,609
good show um they're at a whole new

292
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,350
level of playing the music is refreshed

293
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,730
I said it a minute ago and you guys

294
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,500
probably scratched your head and said

295
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,230
what John Mayer plays for the Grateful

296
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,120
Dead now yes that happened um a few

297
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,230
years ago John Mayer did something

298
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,700
stupid and I don't pay a lot of

299
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,409
attention but he said something stupid

300
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,150
somewhere and it messed up his musical

301
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,459
career and people did not like him so he

302
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:24,309
kind of took a little hiatus and went

303
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,660
away for a while and while he was

304
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:27,769
finding himself he discovered the

305
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,209
Grateful Dead and discovered the

306
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,860
Grateful Dead music and the way of the

307
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,470
dead and the community and really got

308
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,690
into it and somehow ended up playing

309
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,310
guitar for the Grateful Dead now and you

310
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,490
know what at first I was skeptical

311
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:43,159
because John Mayer is not my style of

312
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,899
music at all he's uh it's like girl

313
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,639
music it's like teenager music in my

314
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:49,699
mind and yeah I know I'm a prick because

315
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,919
I'm really judgmental about music but I

316
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,800
gotta say when I saw John Mayer playing

317
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,389
with the Grateful Dead he nails it he

318
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,399
gets it perfect he does everything

319
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,919
exactly the way it should be done his

320
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,379
tone is perfect he does not overplay the

321
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,629
dude knows how to play a guitar he can

322
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:08,419
sing you guys he's sing a few tunes and

323
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:10,519
they sounded perfect I loved it great

324
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:11,899

362
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,990
party of winner we've rented a house and

363
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,789
we're going to have a tasting party I've

364
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,409
got ten jars in front of me I'm gonna

365
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:33,899
crack one open right now just for fun I

366
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:37,169
got ten dog jars of herb that I drew for

367
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,458
the lovely damsel it smells so we're

368
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:40,740
gonna have a little tasting party and

369
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:43,379
Miss damsel is going to decide which of

370
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,089
these phenotypes gets to be the

371
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:48,328
selection that will take the name of

372
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:50,339
damsels dank and then we will get a

373
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:52,439
clone into the shop and we will start

374
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:55,019
growing damsels dank at green and

375
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,550
healthy wellness in Colorado Springs and

376
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,709
it will be available on the shelves

377
00:12:56,549 --> 00:13:00,629
it'll be a little while but we'll get it

378
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,759
there and the whole world with a medical

379
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:04,500
card will be able to try it hopefully

380
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,179
eventually Colorado Springs will wake up

381
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,370
and start allowing recreational cannabis

382
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:11,009
sales and that way we can make Daniels

383
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,720
tank available to the entire world that

384
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:14,610
would be awesome big shout out to hunt

385
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,250
for putting me in touch with damsel and

386
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,829
also a huge shout out to the lovely do

387
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,110
dats danzel hey Britt thanks for giving

388
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:24,239
me the honor of being the breeder chosen

389
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,159
to create a stream for you I understand

390
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,289
how important this is to you and I'm

391
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,500
gonna get it right for you trust me all

392
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:30,269
right

393
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,309
so the next thing I want to do is a

394
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:34,799
little grow lesson this will be a very

395
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:36,479
simple lesson um I was watching a

396
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,849
facebook argument the other day and

397
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,459
people were arguing over a plant being

398
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,470
male or female and I thought I just come

399
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,028
on here and just make it really clear

400
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,490
and simple and we'll talk about what a

401
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:49,289
male and a female plant look like okay

402
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,329
when it comes time to determine the sex

403
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:53,458
of your plants there are a few ways you

404
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:55,469
can go about doing it the main way that

405
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,958
you can do it is to just flower your

406
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,300
plant if you've got a plant and you put

407
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,818
it under 1212 which is 12 hours on and

408
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,649
12 hours off of light and you need full

409
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:07,169
darkness in your dark cycle you guys you

410
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:09,299
need complete darkness uninterrupted for

411
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:10,919
12 full hours if you can see anything in

412
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:12,740
that room in the dark cycle it is too

413
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,448
bright you need to make it darker

414
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,220
there's if there's any light it's not

415
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:18,719
dark enough that is not considered dark

416
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,830
if you can see your hand in front of

417
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,050
your face it

418
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,550
is to light in there the only lights

419
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:26,069
that you can have in a grow room during

420
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:28,529
the dark cycle are green LED lights or

421
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,120
those green coiled florescent lights

422
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,519
those will work for you need green light

423
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,960
in your dark cycle green lighting during

424
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,090
the flowering cycle does not interrupt

425
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,769
the flowering photo period because the

426
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:40,170
plants are green and they do not absorb

427
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:42,779
green light so so by putting any plant

428
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:46,589
into the 1212 period you will actually

429
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:49,110
induce the flowering stage in about 10

430
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,700
10 to 14 days ish you'll be able to tell

431
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,070
if your plant is male or female

432
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,390
by signs that it shows and we'll talk

433
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,400
about those here in just a couple of

434
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:58,740
seconds you guys you can flower a plant

435
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,779
at any size it doesn't matter how big it

436
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,909
is what's gonna happen is it's gonna

437
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,679
flower when you put it into 1212 that's

438
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:06,240
what's gonna make it flower but what I

439
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:09,329
always recommend is that you take a

440
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,850
clone from every seed that you grow when

441
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,250
you start a plant from seed please take

442
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,170
a clone from it you never know you might

443
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,940
be growing the most amazing strain

444
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:19,919
anybody has ever smoked it may be the

445
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,210
perfect medicinal strain for the every

446
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,459
for everybody on the planet for the

447
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,620
entire population it can cure every

448
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,150
element you never know and if you didn't

449
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,060
take a clone oh you're gonna be so mad

450
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:31,769
at yourself about that hey guys there's

451
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,419
one strain that I grew that got away I

452
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,620
could not get it to clone and it was

453
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,909
some of the best cannabis I've ever

454
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,279
smoked and I'm a little mad at myself

455
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:39,719
that I couldn't get it to clone but I do

456
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,600
have more seeds of it so hopefully I can

457
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,310
find that phenotype again anyway when

458
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,350
you grow so grow a plant from seed right

459
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:48,239
and then put it under 1212 and it will

460
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,580
flower I'd always recommend taking a

461
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,110
clone so take a clone now you've got a

462
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,310
plant that is grown for a little while

463
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,950
and you've got a clone

464
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:57,629
you can either flower out that original

465
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,980
plant that has been growing and that way

466
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:00,570
you've got a little bit of product to

467
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,950
show for yourself and you've got

468
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,920
something to smoke and make it worth

469
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:07,050
your time or you can flower out that

470
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,000
clone as soon as that clone that you

471
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:11,099
took starts showing roots you can switch

472
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,799
that light to 12 12 and that clone will

473
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,750
flower and in 10 to 14 days you'll have

474
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,479
a little tiny plant with either male or

475
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,500
female flowers coming out of it and

476
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,480
you'll be able to tell if you've got a

477
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,850
boy or a girl but at that point you can

478
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,460
either throw away that male plant that

479
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,800
you've got that's in the bigger pot or

480
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,330
you can put that female plant into the

481
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,919
flowering room and start making buds out

482
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,550
of it or keep it as a mother plant keep

483
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,129
taking clones off of it

484
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:38,109
and have that strain around forever so

485
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:40,000
take clones you guys and then you can

486
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,250
either clone that original clone or a

487
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,600
flower that original clone as it routes

488
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,539
out and then you can see what you've got

489
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,470
or you can flower that original plant

490
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,929
either way it's gonna do the same thing

491
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,420
and you will know what you've got please

492
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:55,120
take a clone I can't stress that so also

493
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:57,610
you guys the plants will show sex if you

494
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,019
let them pre flower if you leave a plant

495
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,310
in a pot for long enough to where it

496
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,740
feels like it's starting to get root

497
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:04,958
bound and it's reached its space I had

498
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,000
space constraints in that pot it will

499
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,769
actually start to flower on its own some

500
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,660
genetics will just panic and start to

501
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:12,009
flower on their own that way and they

502
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,380
will show you what is called a pre

503
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:16,209
flower that's just the plant showing you

504
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,890
that it's reaching maturity then it is

505
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,328
ready to go that it's hormones are built

506
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,550
up that it wants you to switch the

507
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:23,198
flowering cycle so simply waiting for

508
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:24,578
the plant to pre flower is a good way to

509
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,800
determine if you've got a male or a

510
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:28,629
female but then you do waste a lot of

511
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,889
light and a lot of nutrients and a lot

512
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,720
of space and if you're a productive

513
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,190
gardener sometimes you just can't deal

514
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,750
with that that's why I recommend cutting

515
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,120
a clone and flowering out that little

516
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,429
clone and seeing what you've got it's a

517
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,049
lot easier to waste a little bit of time

518
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:42,820
under a fluorescent light than it is to

519
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,319
waste time under that big thousand watt

520
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:46,480
high pressure sodium lamp or you could

521
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,129
have been running a useful crop so take

522
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,259
some clones flower amount see what

523
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:52,840
you're working with and now it feels

524
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:54,490
like it's time to talk about what to

525
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,659
look for when your plants do start

526
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,529
flowering so that you can tell if you've

527
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:01,150
got boys or girls basically I'm gonna

528
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,589
call it an intersection but and a node

529
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,850
where the two nodes separate you've got

530
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,990
your main stock coming up and then

531
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,339
you've got the little intersection where

532
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,289
the branch comes off to the left and a

533
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:10,509
branch comes off to the right ah

534
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:12,819
right about there your plants are either

535
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:14,140
gonna grow balls or hairs and I know

536
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:16,599
that sounds really general but that's

537
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,360
the most simple way to describe this

538
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:21,069
you're gonna get a pair of balls growing

539
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,369
out right there at that intersection or

540
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:26,558
you are going to get little hairs if you

541
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,119
see two little hairs sticking up those

542
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,519
are your female plant parts those are

543
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:32,079
actually the parts that if you were to

544
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,179
spread pollen in the room the pollen

545
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,949
would land on those little pistols those

546
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,080
are called pistols and those pistols

547
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,700
would slide the pollen up into the ovule

548
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,039
which would absorb the pollen which

549
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,970
would then pollinate your plant and then

550
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,918
it would produce seeds so

551
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,629
if you've got those little hairs you

552
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,879
have got girls if you've got those balls

553
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:52,798
you've got male plants and unless you

554
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:54,959
plan on making some seeds and doing some

555
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,878
breeding it is time to get those boy

556
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,229
plants out of the room and honestly if

557
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:59,308
you're listening to this lesson and

558
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:01,619
you're learning about how to determine

559
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:03,329
sex please do not breathe cannabis yet

560
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:05,009
please learn a lot more about plants

561
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:06,478
before you breed and I'll touch on that

562
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,169
in a minute I'll try to remember to to

563
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,569
mention why

564
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:11,549
so if you see balls get those plants out

565
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:13,470
of there also here's a good hint the

566
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:14,729
male plants I'm a breeder I've been

567
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,200
breeding plants for a long time I've

568
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:18,330
been growing plants for a really long

569
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,538
time one thing I really notice is the

570
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:23,098
male plants grow much much taller if

571
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:24,720
you've got a plant that's just taken off

572
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:26,908
it's just getting really really tall

573
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,368
it's got a real thick fibrous stalk

574
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:30,929
that's probably a boy I would just count

575
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,428
on that don't get so excited that you've

576
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:34,889
got this one plant that grows like a

577
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:36,359
son-of-a-bitch it is probably a son of

578
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:37,319
that [Â __Â ] it's probably a boy you're

579
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:39,148
gonna want to get rid of that in the

580
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,398
future as soon as you flower it you

581
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:43,768
won't know pull the males as soon as you

582
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:45,358
can you guys um if you got male and

583
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:49,440
female plants flowering next to each

584
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:51,028
other by day 14 that male plant is

585
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,249
getting ready to drop pollen I've seen

586
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:55,979
them drop pollen around two weeks into

587
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:57,929
flower the second to third week that's

588
00:19:55,979 --> 00:20:00,090
that male plant is really gonna start

589
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,889
spitting out as pollen your female

590
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:03,449
plants are gonna be just ready to take

591
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:04,888
pollen at that time so you're gonna end

592
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,298
up with a seated crop if you don't pay

593
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:08,128
attention and get those boys out of

594
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:10,348
there if you leave those boys in too

595
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:12,408
long they'll see it up the entire room

596
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:15,388
very quickly it just takes one quick

597
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:17,099
little pass of the fan to spread that

598
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:18,658
pollen through the whole room and then

599
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,999
you've got a pollinated crop you've got

600
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:23,190
seeds everywhere so pay attention check

601
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:25,589
every single day get the males out of

602
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,840
there be diligent about it don't relax

603
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:29,579
stay on top of that [Â __Â ] get those out

604
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,319
of there all right so it feels like I've

605
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:33,658
talked enough about male plants and how

606
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:35,308
to identify them let's talk a little bit

607
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:38,070
about hermaphrodites because

608
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:40,440
hermaphrodites can really confuse a new

609
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:42,720
grower gender Maronites can confuse an

610
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,399
experienced grower or hermaphrodite is

611
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,868
and there are a lot of words for it

612
00:20:44,398 --> 00:20:48,538
you'll hear people call it a hermie or a

613
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:51,259
herm it's a hermaphrodite you guys it is

614
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:54,538
a plant that has both male and female

615
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:56,278
sexes and it will show them hopefully

616
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:58,558
very early in flower and unfortunately

617
00:20:56,278 --> 00:21:00,358
sometimes you don't see it until like

618
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,739
week eight on a nine meat plant and then

619
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:03,148
it starts showing a little pollen sack

620
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:04,710
and then you're like gosh [Â __Â ] I got to

621
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:05,098
cut this plant or gonna pick this pollen

622
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,739
sack

623
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:10,678
you start panicking but let's talk about

624
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:13,319
hermaphrodites when you see a plant with

625
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,909
male and female parts coming out of it

626
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,788
during flower you've probably got

627
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:19,349
yourself a hermaphrodite

628
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:21,358
oftentimes this happens in regular

629
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:23,548
breeding and it often happens in

630
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:26,158
feminized seeds this is something that

631
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:28,470
just happens I breed regular and

632
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,820
feminized seeds a lot of people try to

633
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,950
hate on feminized seeds for

634
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:33,358
hermaphrodite um if feminized seeds are

635
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,979
made correctly they will not be

636
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:38,038
hermaphrodites you guys they will they

637
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:40,798
will be good seeds um I've gotten more

638
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:43,048
hermaphrodites from regular seeds than I

639
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,989
have from feminized seeds and I'm a

640
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:48,329
breeder and I run a lot of seeds so I

641
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:49,889
don't blame it on the feminized seeds at

642
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:52,739
all I think it is just something that

643
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:54,988
happens you get males you get females

644
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:56,970
and you get hermaphrodites there's a

645
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:58,858
whole goal of this plant it's whole goal

646
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,528
is to reproduce itself that's what it

647
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:03,388
wants to do it's a horny plant its a

648
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,888
horny male it's a horny girl they just

649
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,538
want to find another plant they want to

650
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:08,308
make seeds so that the seeds can drop

651
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:09,509
into the ground and those seeds can

652
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:11,460
happen again next year

653
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:13,618
this whole plants goal is to just

654
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,288
reproduce sometimes it will do whatever

655
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:18,418
it's got to reproduce and one of its

656
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:19,108
failsafe backup plans is to become a

657
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,570
hermaphrodite

658
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:23,278
so sometimes that happens now I've said

659
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:25,798
that that can be a trait that is just in

660
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:28,079
the plant that can be in the DNA of that

661
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:31,048
plant it can be that plant can be born

662
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,749
as a hermaphrodite but sometimes

663
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:37,408
hermaphrodites are caused by environment

664
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:40,259
or mistakes if you interrupt the dark

665
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:41,489
cycle during the flowering period I

666
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,618
talked earlier about how you have to

667
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:45,778
have that complete 1212 photo period

668
00:22:43,618 --> 00:22:48,358
with 12 hours of complete uninterrupted

669
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:50,249
darkness if you wanna if you interrupt

670
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:52,978
that you will cause your plants to

671
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:54,899
hermaphrodite if you seriously if you

672
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:58,200
open up that door and left that light on

673
00:22:54,898 --> 00:23:00,268
for six hours during one dark cycle you

674
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,129
will start to see male flowers pop up in

675
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:04,549
your female flowers you'll see it happen

676
00:23:02,128 --> 00:23:07,039
and you will have a seeded plan

677
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,980
it happens like that that is the kind of

678
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,509
thing that can cause from Afrin ISM a

679
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,250
lot of the Kim dog and COO strains if

680
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:15,170
you push them too hard with nutrients or

681
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,480
just give them a little bit of stress

682
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,550
somehow if they get bugs or powdery

683
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,500
mildew they'll hermaphrodite on you just

684
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:23,750
in a survival method that is something

685
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,640
that that plant wants to do just to make

686
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,710
sure that it gets to carry on with its

687
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,750
race it just wants to keep going on with

688
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,000
its life so hermaphrodites can be really

689
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,769
confusing [Â __Â ] does happen like that in

690
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,319
the grow room that's your job as a

691
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:39,500
grower to be aware of it and to learn

692
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:41,419
how to identify it so if you see pollen

693
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,099
sacks and pistols on the same plant

694
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,350
you've probably got a hermaphrodite

695
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:46,909
it is not worth keeping you need to get

696
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:49,099
rid of that plant no matter how good it

697
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,470
looks no matter how sweet it smells that

698
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,969
plant needs to go now if your plant is

699
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,350
well into the flowering cycle and you've

700
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,940
got big old chunky buds and you're

701
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,189
starting to see these pollen sacs come

702
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,390
up these little male flowers they look

703
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,940
like little bananas you guys it just

704
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,500
looks like maybe a piece of rice or just

705
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,090
it's a little tiny tiny micro sized

706
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,529
banana popping up out of your plants

707
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:07,970
it's a little male pollen sack this

708
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:10,309
little male flower coming out of your

709
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,559
female plants oftentimes that stuff will

710
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:15,409
happen late in flower somewhere between

711
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,109
week seven and nine if your past week

712
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,490
seven or past I'd say past week seven

713
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:20,959
and you see those you've got a decision

714
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,309
to make any time before week seven you

715
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,130
guys if I see that [Â __Â ] that plant is

716
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:26,690
dead I just murder it I've got a veil

717
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,250
ability two more plants I've got access

718
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,350
to seeds and clones like you wouldn't

719
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,150
believe so I'm a little picky I'm not

720
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:33,799
afraid to euthanize a plant sometimes

721
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,950
[Â __Â ] just has to go if it doesn't work

722
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:38,509
for my grow room sometimes a certain

723
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,610
plant and your environment that's it

724
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:42,410
called a phenotypic expression the plant

725
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:43,849
will express that it is not happy with

726
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,170
your environment and it won't work for

727
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,449
you and you just got to get rid of that

728
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,130
plant grow a different plant but if you

729
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,380
start seeing those bananas popping up

730
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,820
around week six or seven or eight you

731
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,380
have a decision to make if they're

732
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:55,700
popping up around week nine it's not

733
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,410
that bad because you've only got a few

734
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,630
days left most plants are gonna go about

735
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,880
nine maybe ten weeks if you've got a

736
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,990
plant that you're ending up week seven

737
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,510
and you start seeing little manners

738
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,950
popping up you want to figure out if you

739
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:08,980
want to keep that plant going is it

740
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,480
worth risking the rest of the garden

741
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,710
maybe sometimes those little bananas are

742
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,259
sterile and they don't produce pollen

743
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,840
sometimes one of those can rupture and

744
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:18,299
it will pollinate the plant that that

745
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,609
banana

746
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:23,430
is on and it will pollinate the plants

747
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:24,959
all around that plant as well sometimes

748
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,850
it can pollinate the whole room you guys

749
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,559
it doesn't take much pollen to create

750
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:30,089
seeds and so now you'll have seeds in

751
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,419
all of your plants so you've got a

752
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:34,740
decision to make do you want to try to

753
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,080
eliminate the plant do you want to risk

754
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,120
it or do you want to try to get rid of

755
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,599
those bananas well you can do to those

756
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,909
little male flowers you can mist them

757
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,559
with water because water deactivates

758
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,600
pollen so just miss to the plant with

759
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,789
water and then get some tweezers and

760
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:53,399
pluck out those little manners if you're

761
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:54,659
around week eight week nine just pluck

762
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,980
those out if you want to if you're in

763
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,540
week nine just leave it there and don't

764
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,130
touch it until you harvest and you

765
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,690
should be just fine

766
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,870
if it's popping up at week nine it's

767
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,039
probably sterile but sometimes it's

768
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,419
scary and you don't want to risk it

769
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,069
around week seven or week eight you

770
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,269
might want to pluck them out it's up to

771
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:11,129
you that's when you have a decision to

772
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:13,319
make but if you're a breeder

773
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:15,780
do not ever breed with a plant that'll

774
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:18,299
make a hermaphrodite little pop up a

775
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:20,099
little male plant around week seven

776
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:21,720
eight or nine don't do that because then

777
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:24,569
you're gonna breed that hermaphroditic

778
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,950
tray into something so make sure you

779
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:28,049
pull out they're hermaphrodites keep an

780
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,250
eye on that that's that's a decision

781
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:31,349
you're gonna have to make that's gonna

782
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,900
happen at some point in your grow career

783
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:35,730
you're gonna see a female plant popping

784
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,680
up a male flower at week eight and

785
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,789
you're gonna panic but don't worry it's

786
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,310
not the end of the world

787
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:43,109
you can either pluck out that male you

788
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:45,480
can let it grow or you can just destroy

789
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:46,949
the plant it's up to you you can always

790
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,230
turn those seated plants into really

791
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,960
good hash I think plants that are

792
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,150
allowed to seed make better hash than

793
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,279
plants without seeds you don't get as

794
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,980
much hash sometimes but I think that the

795
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,240
high is better once you allow the plants

796
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,190
to make seeds and I only know that

797
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,960
because I breed and sometimes when I

798
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,920
breathe there's material left over well

799
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,269
most of the time when I breathe there's

800
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,460
material left over you have to separate

801
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:10,500
the seeds from the actual bud and we

802
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,039
will run the bud material and turn it

803
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:16,349
into BHO and I like the seeded BHO

804
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:18,029
there's no seeds in the pho but I mean

805
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:20,309
it comes from seeded materials seeds are

806
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:22,619
removed then we run the material the

807
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:24,599
seeds are packaged and grown and then

808
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:27,089
the material is turned into hash and

809
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:29,969
that hatch seems to get me a little bit

810
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:33,659
better of a buzz that's my opinion

811
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:35,910
I talked earlier about new growers not

812
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:39,330
breeding and hermaphrodites are a little

813
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:41,460
bit of why let me touch Juan why I said

814
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:44,490
please don't breed if you're a new

815
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,529
grower breeding takes a very selective

816
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,180
eye you need to understand what plants

817
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:49,559
you're putting together and if you're

818
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,200
putting a plant a plant needs to be

819
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,849
properly tested before it's bred I have

820
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,080
talked about how I stress test a plant

821
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:57,389
before I'll breed with it I'll take a

822
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,699
girl plant and I will try to piss that

823
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:01,530
plant off the best I can and see what it

824
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,370
takes to make that plant hermaphrodite

825
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:08,160
or die or stress or whatever and I make

826
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:09,929
sure it's not gonna harm on me and more

827
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,880
importantly I make sure that the progeny

828
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,440
the offspring the seeds that come from

829
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,030
that female plant I make sure that

830
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,019
they're not going to hermaphrodite on

831
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:20,819
you so you have to have a plant you have

832
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:23,849
to stress the [Â __Â ] out of it you have to

833
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:25,980
have a properly selected male the I for

834
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:27,509
a male selection is a skill I plan to

835
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,400
have a conversation with other breeders

836
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:30,690
on this show about male selection so

837
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,360
we'll give you a heads up on that

838
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,460
but selecting a male is definitely a

839
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,740
special skill selecting plants for

840
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,049
breeding is a it's a skill it's an art

841
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,910
and if you're not experienced with the

842
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:43,259
plants you're using you may breed some

843
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,820
[Â __Â ] and then you're gonna have a

844
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:46,109
bunch of seeds and you're gonna give

845
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:48,750
those seeds out and you're gonna grow

846
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:51,029
those [Â __Â ] seeds and it's going to

847
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:54,000
the whole idea of breeding cannabis is

848
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:56,339
to improve the genetics to improve the

849
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,750
race to make the plant better and if

850
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:59,069
you're breeding [Â __Â ] into it you're

851
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,650
just watering it down and you're

852
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:03,000
spreading genetics that are a waste of

853
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,320
time there are a waste of people's

854
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,200
garden space when they could have been

855
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,849
growing some usable medicine that would

856
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,650
have worked for them so I'm not dissing

857
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:12,059
any new growers I'm just asking you

858
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,160
please don't try to breed until you're a

859
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,750

episode that comes from the car but this

1027
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,690
is a sort of a part - recently I did an

1028
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:22,610
episode about ways to improve your

1029
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,800

garden I also include a little rant

1032
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:31,279
toward the end I did have to stop

1033
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:33,049
recording halfway through because I

1034
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,490
arrived at my destination but I did

1035
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:36,289
start recording on the way home so

1036
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:38,299
there's a little cut in the middle but I

1037
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:39,619
hope you enjoy that before I go too far

ball or the nail attaches goes straight

good time I would have to say I would

1112
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,320
recommend that you guys go to Instagram

1113
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,020
if you're on Instagram go to Instagram

1114

00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:43,759

1120
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,940
Instagram

1121
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,130
I understand attics and Instagram is my

1122
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,150
new page I did start a new Instagram you

1123
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,250
guys I don't know if I've mentioned that

1124
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,588
on the podcast yet but I am back on

1125
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:56,300
Instagram trying to follow all of the

1126
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:58,519
rules I've been told that you can't put

1127
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,010
photos of yourself consuming cannabis so

1128
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:02,900
that means no dab videos no fat joint

1129
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:04,190
shots none of that kind of stuff and I

1130
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:08,000
was told that you can't have contact

1131
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:09,710
information on your Instagram so I'm not

1132
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,139
going to put any contact information up

1133
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:13,579

due dates Gatsby Invitational I really

1144
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,349
encourage you guys to go look at some of

1145
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:38,989
the pictures that were taken on

Instagram and we will also post a

1147

podcast that tells you all about the due

1148
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,240
dates Gatsby Invitational

1149
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:46,068
what it is who was involved and why it

1150
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,539
happened I've got a head at that down

1151
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:50,029
it's a great show

1152
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:52,250
we got stupid hi you guys so it'll be a

1153
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,390
fun show to listen to anyways I'm

1154
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,400
driving on the interstate I'm kind of

1155
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:56,539
rambly let's talk about something I've

1156
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,619
got a couple of notes here they're hard

1157
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:59,869
to read cause I'm driving but I wrote

1158
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:01,880
this down I've been watching a show on

1159
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:04,430
Netflix a show called narcos it's a show

1160
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,130
about Pablo Escobar and his drug empire

1161
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:09,169
that he created I had no idea the dude

1162
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,000
was so huge I knew he was huge but I

1163
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,099
didn't know that this dude was super

1164
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,599
huge this guy I've never seen that kind

1165
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:16,609
of money nobody else has ever seen that

1166
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,140
kind of money that dude was building

1167
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:19,549
forts out of hundred dollar bills pretty

1168
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:21,440
much that [Â __Â ] is awesome anyway

1169
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,839
something that happens in the show

1170
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,909
narcos narcos is on Netflix it's a 10

1171
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,440
season or a 10 episode season I

1172
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:29,420
recommend you watch it something that

1173
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,130
happened recently made me chuckle I

1174
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:34,818
wanted to come out on the show and say

1175
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,769
that [Â __Â ] will not work so Pablo Escobar

1176
00:43:34,818 --> 00:43:38,358
is standing on the balcony having a

1177
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:39,980
little thought time by himself he's just

1178
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:41,929
thinking and reflecting and staring off

1179
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,579
into the know where and then he turns to

1180
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:45,980
the right and there's a ganja plant to

1181
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:48,589
the right of him and it looks it's not

1182
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,929
mature it's nowhere near done

1183
00:43:48,588 --> 00:43:53,659
and Pablo just grabs a little bud off

1184
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:55,248
the stalk and pinches it off and gives

1185
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:59,239
it a good smell and sticks it into his

1186
00:43:55,248 --> 00:44:00,798
pocket you guys that may do a little for

1187
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:03,139
him but that weed is gonna suck

1188
00:44:00,798 --> 00:44:05,838
that plant was not finished you can't

1189
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:07,068
just pick buds off of a plant randomly

1190
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:08,778
it's not like an apple tree

1191
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:09,679
you gotta harvest it you got to trim it

1192
00:44:08,778 --> 00:44:11,719
you gotta try it you gotta do it

1193
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,639
properly so that was a little goofy but

1194
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:15,769
everything about the cocaine about the

1195
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:17,208
production the shipment everything about

1196
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:18,738
cocaine seems to be accurate they've

1197
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:20,268
talked about how they make cocaine how

1198
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,818
they processed cocaine how they hide

1199
00:44:20,268 --> 00:44:24,649
cocaine all of that has seemed to be

1200
00:44:22,818 --> 00:44:26,929
fairly accurately done but when it came

1201
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:28,099
to to growing a little bit of weed they

1202
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:31,009
had no idea what they were talking about

1203
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:32,568
on that show all right you guys I wanted

1204
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:33,889
to mention that let's see I talked about

1205
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:35,358
the dude it's Gatsby invitation I'm

1206
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:37,578
trying to go through my notes here so

1207
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,798
this podcast is going to be a follow-up

1208
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:42,079
to a recent show recently I did an

1209
00:44:39,798 --> 00:44:44,449
episode that was aimed at how to improve

1210
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,559
your crop once I posted that show I

1211
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:47,869
realized there were a couple of things

1212
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:48,798
that I really skipped things that I've

1213
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:50,329
been thinking about that would

1214
00:44:48,798 --> 00:44:51,739
definitely help you improve your crop

1215
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:53,630
that I should have mentioned in that

1216
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:54,798
show so let me scroll up on my phone

1217
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,509
here while I'm driving sorry guys you

1218
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:58,068
gotta be patient with me trying to do

1219
00:44:56,509 --> 00:44:59,449
this safely more ways to improve your

1220
00:44:58,068 --> 00:45:03,018
crop we need to talk about the

1221
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:05,209
importance of pH here that sorry we need

1222
00:45:03,018 --> 00:45:07,338
to talk about the importance of pH pH

1223
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:09,409
stands for potential hydrogen pH is

1224
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:11,239
super important for your plants when

1225
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:12,798
you're making a solution when you're

1226
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:14,208
mixing your nutrients in your bucket or

1227
00:45:12,798 --> 00:45:17,389
in your reservoir however you're mixing

1228
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:20,719
it you need to adjust the pH before you

1229
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:22,009
feed it to your plants mix up all of

1230
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,009
your nutrients have everything in there

1231
00:45:22,009 --> 00:45:26,688
get a pH meter stick your pH pin your pH

1232
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:29,509
meter in there and see what the pH says

1233
00:45:26,688 --> 00:45:31,068
it fits like seven it needs to come down

1234
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:32,748
you guys you want your pH for your

1235
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:35,778
plants to be somewhere between six and

1236
00:45:32,748 --> 00:45:37,428
6.5 I think you'd be much happier your

1237
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:39,259
plants will look better they'll take up

1238
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:41,059
the nutrients more properly the plants

1239
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:43,728
will grow better you won't see as many

1240
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:46,400
problems a lot of times a pH problem

1241
00:45:43,728 --> 00:45:48,708
will mask itself as a deficiency or a

1242
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,229
nutrient burn so if you just go ahead

1243
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:52,428
and fix your pH you have to fix the pH

1244
00:45:51,228 --> 00:45:54,978
of the solution you're feeding your

1245
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:56,719
plants if you're feeding it nutrients if

1246
00:45:54,978 --> 00:45:58,548
you're feeding it water adjust the pH if

1247
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,030
you guys are feeding it teas don't mess

1248
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:02,280
with the pH of a tea because

1249
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:04,440
tea is organic trying to add something

1250
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,150
to bring down the pH of your tea will

1251
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,349
probably kill off your microbes and

1252
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,389
whatever you're trying to build up in

1253
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:13,199
the tea so just let that go that'll be

1254
00:46:09,389 --> 00:46:15,359
fine don't stress too much on the pH of

1255
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,819
your soil if you bought good soil at a

1256
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,920
gross store your pH will be just fine as

1257
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:23,280
long as you're feeding it properly pH

1258
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,260
nutrients a properly pH solution so once

1259
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,450
you're done mixing up your nutrients pH

1260
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,650
and get some pH and get a pH pin stick

1261
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:31,049
it in there and see what it says add

1262
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:32,700
very little pH down if you're using a

1263
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:36,030
five gallon jug it's not gonna take much

1264
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:38,909
pH down to get your pH to drop massively

1265
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:40,470
so check your pH pay attention to the pH

1266
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:41,849
I see a lot of people skipping that they

1267
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:43,469
think it's not important they think it's

1268
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:44,639
not gonna mess with their plants they

1269
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:46,919
think it's just one more thing to worry

1270
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:49,349
about but it's one more thing that can

1271
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,980
definitely improve the quality of your

1272
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:54,509
plants alright so adjust the pH also

1273
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,990
let's talk about the importance of

1274
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:59,640
getting the whites close enough excuse

1275
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:00,750
me gotta clear the throat there I see a

1276
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:02,009
lot of people with their lights real

1277
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:04,619
high in the garden if you're using

1278
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:06,360
DeVita's you do need that 3-foot gap but

1279
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:08,250
unless you're using double ended bulbs

1280
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:11,400
there's no need to have the bulbs way

1281
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:14,699
high above the plants if you've got the

1282
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,950
type of hoods that are ducted and have

1283
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:18,539
glass inside of them and if you're

1284
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:20,939
venting them properly and the room is

1285
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:23,309
air-conditioned you can probably get

1286
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,960
those those light reflectors right down

1287
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:27,179
on top of the plants really close you

1288
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,559
want to get them there's a section that

1289
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:31,659
comes off the bulb that is kind of too

1290
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,159
bright for the plant and those those

1291
00:47:31,659 --> 00:47:35,228
illumines I guess they are that are

1292
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:36,940
coming off the bulb right there that

1293
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:38,828
spectrum is too much for the plant right

1294
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:41,710
around the plant that 8 to 10 maybe 12

1295
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:44,048
inch circle around the bulb but if you

1296
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:45,699
get a little further about 10 12 maybe

1297
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:47,079
14 inches away from that thousand watt

1298
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:49,149
bulb you're gonna get optimal growth

1299
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:50,739
right there if you can cool it and keep

1300
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,028
it cooler you can get closer and pay

1301
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:53,949
attention to the plants and see what's

1302
00:47:52,028 --> 00:47:55,719
happening but I see a lot of people that

1303
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:57,308
have their lights way too far away from

1304
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:59,379
the plants get your plants closer to

1305
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:02,380
your lights you want to get that light

1306
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:04,239
right on there nice and intense light is

1307
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,338
the most used nutrient that your plants

1308
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,349
will receive so make sure you flood them

1309
00:48:06,338 --> 00:48:09,818
with light and also try to give them the

1310
00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:11,950
appropriate light if you're in the veg

1311
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:13,538
cycle you want lights that lean more to

1312
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:15,098
the blue spectrum if you're in the

1313
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:18,430
flowering cycle you want lights that

1314
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:21,009
lead more to the red spectrum alright so

1315
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:22,598
make sure you've got enough light try to

1316
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:24,548
get your plants close to the light and

1317
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,259
use as much as you can you guys you can

1318
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:27,818
burn your plants with your light so pay

1319
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:30,519
attention to that but get them close

1320
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:32,170
it's what you want to do alright let's

1321
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:35,709
see what is my next note say my next

1322
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:37,509
note says co2 in Richmond I didn't write

1323
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,650
a lot of notes about this but co2 in

1324
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:40,478
Richmond if you want to improve the

1325
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,489
quality of your crop if you want to make

1326
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:44,139
your plants grow more quickly more

1327
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:46,778
heartily and if you want bigger fatter

1328
00:48:44,139 --> 00:48:48,338
harvests add a little bit of co2 in a

1329
00:48:46,778 --> 00:48:49,748
Richmond to your grow room you can go to

1330
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:51,639
the gross store and you can get tanks of

1331
00:48:49,748 --> 00:48:53,498
co2 and you can get a set up to

1332
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:55,509
distribute the co2 properly through your

1333
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:57,518
room you may have to rethink your

1334
00:48:55,509 --> 00:48:59,469
ducting in your ventilation situation if

1335
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:02,618
you're gonna do that but co2 will

1336
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:04,298
drastically increase the quality of your

1337
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:05,528
grow maybe not the quality completely

1338
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:08,588
but the harvest weight you will

1339
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:10,210
definitely see a difference the ambient

1340
00:49:08,588 --> 00:49:12,940
air outside and in your grow room

1341
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:16,269
probably contains about 400 particles

1342
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:18,338
per million of co2 if you get an

1343
00:49:16,268 --> 00:49:20,048
enrichment system maybe a co2 burner

1344
00:49:18,338 --> 00:49:22,478
maybe some tanks whatever you decide to

1345
00:49:20,048 --> 00:49:23,710
do you're gonna have to think about that

1346
00:49:22,478 --> 00:49:25,989
one and talk to the guys at the hydro

1347
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,059
shop maybe do some research on that if

1348
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:29,889
you're gonna put co2 in your room you're

1349
00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:31,569
gonna need to think about how to do it

1350
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:34,509
but what my point is you can get that

1351
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:36,639
co2 up to like 1600 PPM's you can get it

1352
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:38,349
four times what it is in the natural

1353
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,719
environment and your plants will love it

1354
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:42,850
those plants want to suck up the co2 so

1355
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,010
you can add co2 to your grow and

1356
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:47,799
would greatly increase your harvest

1357
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:48,910
weight so what you're gonna add co2 and

1358
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,440
you're gonna start getting bigger buds

1359
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:52,299
something that really helps with all

1360
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,740
gardens and something I'm learning now

1361
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,440
that I'm running this giant commercial

1362
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:58,509
garden is trellising you guys trellising

1363
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:02,079
and like a screen of green method if you

1364
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:04,360
can set up a scrog that is a huge way to

1365
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,969
improve your crop you will give yourself

1366
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,750
more canopy space more canopy space

1367
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:12,459
gives you more room to grow more buds

1368
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:14,289
everybody wants more buds also you're

1369
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,119
able to get more airflow to the bottom

1370
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:19,360
of the plants the plants like that I

1371
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:21,880
think that a sprog is the way to go I'll

1372
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,710
do a whole episode on how to do a scrub

1373
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,630
when I'm in the studio and I'm not on

1374
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,980
the road because I would definitely want

1375
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,930
to pay a little bit of attention Spence

1376
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,389
and I talked about it a while back but I

1377
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:34,029
wasn't sold on the idea and I wasn't

1378
00:50:31,389 --> 00:50:36,519
exactly sure how to do it so I didn't do

1379
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:38,019
the idea justice but you guys we will

1380
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:40,570
talk about how to scrog on a future

1381
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:42,400
episode all right so use some sort of

1382
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:44,590
trellising system a screen of green a

1383
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,240
net get those plants in there and get

1384
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:48,160
them supported get them spread out that

1385
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,109
would definitely help with your garden

1386
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:51,759
something that I see a lot of people

1387
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,260
neglecting to do that I think would

1388
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,510
greatly improve the quality of your

1389
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:58,000
garden it'll also save your trimmers a

1390
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:59,980
lot of headaches you guys I think it

1391
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,809
would be really useful for you to get in

1392
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,719
there and lollipop' your plants a little

1393
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:06,699
bit so what that means is from the

1394
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:09,099
bottom of the plant up take off all the

1395
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:10,539
branches that don't have a useful bud

1396
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,489
sight there is that don't look like

1397
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:15,789
they're gonna create a chunky bud just

1398
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:17,289
cut those off about ten days into flower

1399
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:19,900
you'll know where you're gonna have buds

1400
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:22,449
if the light is not getting to that area

1401
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:24,550
just pinch that little starter of a bud

1402
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:26,319
just pinch that right off all those

1403
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,820
little tiny sucker stems that are

1404
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,930
growing off your main stalk at the

1405
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,330
bottom of the plant that are gonna make

1406
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:33,669
little shitty flowers then nobody wants

1407
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:35,679
to trim cut that [Â __Â ] off of there and

1408
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:38,470
that will allow that plant to use its

1409
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,940
energy to produce bigger buds up top you

1410
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:42,579
won't have all that crap on the bottom

1411
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,869
you'll get better airflow a lot of

1412
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:45,279
people say they want to use those bottom

1413
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:47,319
butts for hash that's cool if you want

1414
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,450
to do that if you're trying to grow buds

1415
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,570
with bag appeal big fatty chunky Nuggets

1416
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:53,460
cut that stuff off of there

1417
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:55,080
and you will have better results you'll

1418
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,250
have better airflow and then you won't

1419
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:57,900
have to trim all that little popcorn

1420
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,159
crap cuz that's what sucks at the end

1421
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,829
all that just gets chopped up and put

1422
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:03,420
into the hash pile anyway so do some

1423
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:05,789
lolli popping get in there and clean all

1424
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,590
the bottom buds all the just the bottom

1425
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,480
crap off the plant before it even has

1426
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:11,280
time to suck up the nutrients and suck

1427
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,570
up the energy of the plant just get that

1428
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,350
right off of there and allow that energy

1429
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:18,000
to go up to the top alright so let's see

1430
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:20,400
something that people really don't think

1431
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,690
about that I think could truly benefit

1432
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,490
the quality of your garden and the

1433
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:26,610
health of your plants the overall health

1434
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:28,409
of your plants it's wintertime here in

1435
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,309
Colorado and the grow room floor is

1436
00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:31,429
getting cold

1437
00:52:29,309 --> 00:52:33,570
my personal grow is in a basement

1438
00:52:31,429 --> 00:52:35,489
something I would recommend to get your

1439
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:37,590
pots up off the ground you guys get your

1440
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:39,209
plants off the ground a really easy way

1441
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,440
to do it if you can't build something if

1442
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,440
you can't build a table I would

1443
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,119
recommend getting like a 4 by 4 Botanic

1444
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,470
hare tray and just build yourself a

1445
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,750
little table that'll support the tray

1446
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:50,639
and your plants just lift it up whatever

1447
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,619
is comfortable for you 2 to 4 feet off

1448
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,449
the ground usually about 30 inches is

1449
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:56,130
the height people go 36 inches is kind

1450
00:52:54,449 --> 00:52:59,369
of high for me I'm tall I don't need it

1451
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:01,320
that high so just get your plants up off

1452
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:03,059
the ground the pot the floor is cold you

1453
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,420
don't want those cold pots on the cold

1454
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,130
floor

1455
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,570
you're gonna water them the water is

1456
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,309
gonna stay in the pot you've got water

1457
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,809
down there in the root ball and that

1458
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:11,340
water is gonna get cold because the

1459
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:13,559
floor is so cold when the lights go off

1460
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,850
at night so raise your pots up off the

1461
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:16,829
ground I was gonna tell you a cheap and

1462
00:53:14,849 --> 00:53:18,779
effective way to do that buy an extra

1463
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:20,519
pot if you're running a seven gallon pot

1464
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:22,110
and you've got your plant in there get

1465
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:23,849
yourself another seven gallon pot and

1466
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:25,410
flip it upside down and just set your

1467
00:53:23,849 --> 00:53:26,219
seven gallon pot right on top of there

1468
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:28,529
and you'll be just fine

1469
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:30,419
so that's a cheap effective way to get

1470
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:32,220
your plants up off the ground your

1471
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,200
plants are gonna it's gonna look like

1472
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:35,789
your plants are happier just one night

1473
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:37,589
of having them up off the ground they'll

1474
00:53:35,789 --> 00:53:40,050
grow more quickly the buds will develop

1475
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,850
much larger it'll taste better the

1476
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,070
plants will act happier and that cold

1477
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:46,110
floor will also describe disguise itself

1478
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,610
as a pH or a nutrient problem you'll be

1479
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,590
thinking what's going on with my crop

1480
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:51,360
your floor is too cold and your plants

1481
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,769
are pissed off you don't like to get up

1482
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,809
in the morning and walk across a cold

1483
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:56,550
floor in your bare feet that sucks so

1484
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:58,349
don't make your plants do it get them up

1485
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:59,610
off the ground and that may help you get

1486
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:01,409
them a little bit closer to the light as

1487
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,910
well I may have just put you in danger

1488
00:54:01,409 --> 00:54:03,480
of getting too close to the light but

1489
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:05,039
that's some

1490
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,539
that the trellising we're gonna talk

1491
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:07,079
about in another episode we'll help you

1492
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:09,269
out with

1493
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:11,069
so get your plants up off the ground you

1494
00:54:09,269 --> 00:54:14,340
guys I'm in a traffic area so I can't

1495
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:15,359
really look at my notes right now so

1496
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,500
while I'm driving right here I'm just

1497
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,239
gonna give you a huge shout out to hit

1498
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,980
man glass because hit man glass sponsors

1499
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,839
the show and there's nothing like taking

1500
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,099
a fat out of a hit man ring all right

1501
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,600
we're getting out of the traffic area I

1502
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:27,299
can look down at the phone once again

1503
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:29,909
and see what the next one is all right

1504
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,859
here we go check your PPM's of your

1505
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:34,139
solution when you guys are mixing up

1506
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:36,599
your nutrients to feed your plants pay

1507
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:38,759
attention to the PPM's PP M stands for

1508
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:41,400
particles per million that will tell you

1509
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,680
how much stuff is in the water or the

1510
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,570
solution that you have created so if

1511
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,539
you're using reverse osmosis water it'll

1512
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:51,000
start off at 0 ppm s most tap water is

1513
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,800
gonna come out fairly low the tap water

1514
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,260
where I am at home comes out about 400

1515
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,300
ppm s it changes seasonally they add

1516
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:01,190
stuff to it but we're usually about the

1517
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:03,300
400 ppm area you can feed your plants if

1518
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:04,980
you know what you're doing you can feed

1519
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,869
them really high I've gotten into the

1520
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:09,840
2000s people tell me I'm crazy for

1521
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:11,430
feeding my plants 2,000 ppm s but I'm

1522
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,990
paying very close attention to what I'm

1523
00:55:11,429 --> 00:55:15,299
giving them I'm not doubling up on

1524
00:55:12,989 --> 00:55:16,829
anything they're getting a broad array

1525
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,050
of nutrients instead of just getting

1526
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:21,269
really heavily blasted with phosphorous

1527
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:24,240
so I would recommend that you don't go

1528
00:55:21,269 --> 00:55:25,679
much higher than like 1200 PPM's when

1529
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,199
you're mixing up your nutrients what you

1530
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,608
can do if you've got a big reservoir if

1531
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,809
you're using this is gonna be a little

1532
00:55:29,608 --> 00:55:31,769
harder if you're using a five-gallon

1533
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:35,099
bucket because you don't get as much

1534
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:37,530
wiggle room but if you're using like a

1535
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:40,650
25 gallon rez or a 50 gallon rez from

1536
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:42,180
the hydro shop fill it up maybe like 40

1537
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,619
gallons if you got a 50 gallon or s fill

1538
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:46,500
it up to about 40 gallons if you got a

1539
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:47,519
25 fill it up to about 15 or 20 then mix

1540
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,889
your nutrients the way you normally

1541
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,059
would put your ppm meter in there and

1542
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:52,889
it's gonna show you that it's too high

1543
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:54,719
right now but all you got to do is just

1544
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:56,519
run normal water or if you've got

1545
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,519
reverse osmosis water just that normal

1546
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:03,090
clean non solution mixed water to it

1547
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:05,340
until it comes to about 16 or 1800 PPM's

1548
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:07,350
and feed that to your plant you can mix

1549
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:09,119
it up and then dilute it until it's at

1550
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:10,440
the right dilution and everything will

1551
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,550
be at the right ratios you've still

1552
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,650
mixed the

1553
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,510
Agro a the same amount of Grobe the same

1554
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:17,160
amount of Cal and mag everything will be

1555
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,720
the same it's just you've kind of

1556
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:20,369
diluted it to a proper solution that

1557
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,559
your plants are gonna love and then take

1558
00:56:20,369 --> 00:56:24,839
notes feed your plants the solution that

1559
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,549
was at 1600 PPM's and see how they react

1560
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,320
if you think you want to mix it a little

1561
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,730
heavier next time and mix it up to 18

1562
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,740
sheet it to them and see what they do

1563
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:34,289
don't go too heavy don't go past the 18

1564
00:56:31,739 --> 00:56:35,639
pay attention to your ppm s but I think

1565
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:37,230
that is something that will really help

1566
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:38,849
you guys out this guy just passed me on

1567
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:41,010
the ride going about 90 miles an hour

1568
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:42,089
playing on his phone that's crazy [Â __Â ] I

1569
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:44,580
can't talk too much [Â __Â ] I'm doing a

1570
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:45,780
podcast while I Drive but still at least

1571
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:47,340
put your phone down if you're gonna pass

1572
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,620
me on the right all right guys I'm

1573
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:51,240
coming up on the Fillmore exit I'm gonna

1574
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:53,159
go handle some plants at the green and

1575
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:55,679
healthy wellness garden I will be back

1576
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:58,079
in the car in just a couple hours and I

1577
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:00,149
will do more of this podcast and we will

1578
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,480
all have a good time so hang out I'll be

1579
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:05,490
right back all right podcast world I am

1580
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,079
back at your boy Rasta Jeff I just got

1581
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:10,079
done putting in about two and a half or

1582
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:12,119
three hours in the grow I had to fill up

1583
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,880
some reservoirs we've got three gigantic

1584
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:16,849
reservoirs we've got a drip system set

1585
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,170
up tour every about two and a half hours

1586
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:20,549
the drip system comes on for about a

1587
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:22,409
minute and a half and waters the plants

1588
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:24,780
so I just have to make sure that the

1589
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:26,369
reservoirs are fooled Fulda they're

1590
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,980
filled and they are mixed with nutrients

1591
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:31,440
improperly pH so I did that I checked on

1592
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,849
the clones the clones look marvelous I'm

1593
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,409
not really good at cutting clones in

1594
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:36,750
rock wool but this batch is looking

1595
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:38,819
pretty nice for me I checked on all the

1596
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:41,400
plants the plants look glorious you guys

1597
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:42,600
today is day two of flower they're

1598
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,039
taking off I can see that they've

1599
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:46,019
already started to stretch a little tiny

1600
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:47,789
bit since yesterday I know that sounds

1601
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:50,730
ridiculous but they have definitely done

1602
00:57:47,789 --> 00:57:51,869
some growth so I checked the tanks to

1603
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,250
check the clones I checked on all the

1604
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:54,869
plants the plants look happy they are

1605
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,889
starting to flower they're not showing

1606
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:59,039
but I mean they're starting the

1607
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:00,839
flowering phase now and then I had to

1608
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,759
tinker with the Gavita controller so we

1609
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,550
got that working all set up those plants

1610
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,920
are gonna be super duper happy now I'm

1611
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:10,230
on the road headed south back to Pueblo

1612
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,630
from lovely Colorado Springs it is now

1613
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:14,730
dark the temperature has dropped

1614
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:16,860
dramatically I am just now headed past

1615
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:19,170
the which exit am i I hear the Fort

1616
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,420
Carson the mesa ridge parkway fort

1617
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,289
carson exit we're at mile marker 132

1618
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,729
then

1619
00:58:22,289 --> 00:58:26,789
is relevant I'm just talking because it

1620
00:58:23,728 --> 00:58:29,548
is what's on my mind let's get back to

1621
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:32,099
where we were you guys this episode was

1622
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:34,739
about ways more ways to improve your

1623
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:36,239
garden we talked about co2 enrichment we

1624
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:38,429
talked a little bit about trellising I

1625
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:39,719
want to talk about trellising for a

1626
00:58:38,429 --> 00:58:41,519
second

1627
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:43,259
so trellising will go back to that

1628
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:45,058
trellising is when you take like a net

1629
00:58:43,259 --> 00:58:48,199
like a five by five net with about

1630
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:50,429
either four inch or six inch squares

1631
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:52,559
spaces between the netting you got about

1632
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:55,168
four inch or six inch holes in there so

1633
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,278
I would take the net and just you got to

1634
00:58:55,168 --> 00:58:58,528
stretch it tight but build like a

1635
00:58:56,278 --> 00:59:00,239
five-foot frame or attach it to some

1636
00:58:58,528 --> 00:59:01,708
poles and just lay that right over the

1637
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,108
canopy of your plants while you're in

1638
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:07,018
avenge just drop that right over and

1639
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:09,239
pull it tight and then what I do is I

1640
00:59:07,018 --> 00:59:10,978
grab the branches from the plants and I

1641
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:13,769
make sure that one branch is sticking

1642
00:59:10,978 --> 00:59:15,659
through each square of that trellis so

1643
00:59:13,768 --> 00:59:17,399
this will it'll do a few things it'll

1644
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:18,808
separate the plant it's where you don't

1645
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,539
have a bunch of branches all clumped up

1646
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:23,789
into one area which will allow more of

1647
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:25,799
the plant to get more light it will also

1648
00:59:23,789 --> 00:59:28,499
work as a support for the plant when the

1649
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:29,548
plant starts gettin chunky buds and the

1650
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,988
plant starts getting taller and

1651
00:59:29,548 --> 00:59:32,728
stretching it's gonna need some support

1652
00:59:30,989 --> 00:59:35,338
so every branch will be supported by

1653
00:59:32,728 --> 00:59:37,438
this trellis so it'll also spread the

1654
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:39,088
plant out it'll give you a little space

1655
00:59:37,438 --> 00:59:41,219
and it'll do it'll create what I call

1656
00:59:39,088 --> 00:59:42,838
the little grid you'll be able to grow

1657
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:45,269
on the grid you'll have more bud sites

1658
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:46,438
per square foot than most people because

1659
00:59:45,268 --> 00:59:47,818
you have gone and stretched out your

1660
00:59:46,438 --> 00:59:50,458
canopy and spread it out in this trellis

1661
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:52,768
so in veg a couple of weeks before a

1662
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:54,358
flower drop that trellis on and start

1663
00:59:52,768 --> 00:59:55,438
making the plants grow into the trellis

1664
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:57,808
and get them stretched out the way you

1665
00:59:55,438 --> 00:59:59,129
want then I would recommend flowering

1666
00:59:57,809 --> 01:00:00,839
once they're all up through there you've

1667
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,009
got a node coming through every part of

1668
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:04,259
the trellis you're comfortable with the

1669
01:00:02,009 --> 01:00:05,938
height of your plants any guys if

1670
01:00:04,259 --> 01:00:07,349
something's getting too high all you got

1671
01:00:05,938 --> 01:00:09,298
to do is grab it and bend it down back

1672
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:10,140
under that trellis and then it'll start

1673
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:11,788
growing up again

1674
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:13,318
Cannabis wants to grow up that's what

1675
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:15,329
it'll do so if you bend a branch down

1676
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:18,239
and stick it in that trellis it will

1677
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:19,890
grow itself back up so after a couple of

1678
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,418
weeks you put the plants in flower after

1679
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:23,400
they've edged into the trellis and Grunk

1680
01:00:21,418 --> 01:00:26,338
grown comfortably then you put them in

1681
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,199
Flour and then just a couple of weeks

1682
01:00:26,338 --> 01:00:29,458
after flower maybe ten days after flower

1683
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:31,380
I would recommend putting up another

1684
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:33,838
trellis maybe less than ten days maybe

1685
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,300
seven days put up another trellis just

1686
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,250
about eighteen inches

1687
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,630
higher than that first one your plants

1688
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:40,340
are gonna start budding and they're

1689
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:42,619
gonna grow right into that trellis maybe

1690
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,760
16 inches if you're at a home grow we're

1691
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:45,279
doing a commercial drill we're going

1692
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,960
about 18 inches to give them some space

1693
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,490
maybe 24 just depends on how fast they

1694
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,440
grow by then but you want them to grow

1695
01:00:49,489 --> 01:00:53,719
up into that trellis to where those top

1696
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,220
colas have more space to lean they're

1697
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:57,169
gonna kind of lean on those trellis

1698
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:59,089
wires so make sure you pull the trellis

1699
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:01,550
tight when you put it up there get it at

1700
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:03,230
the right height to begin with pull the

1701
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:05,210
branch nodes through that trellis don't

1702
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:06,650
be shy be careful not to break them but

1703
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:08,449
don't be shy to get in there and just

1704
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:11,389
kind of reshape that plant make it go

1705
01:01:08,449 --> 01:01:13,159
the direction you want and then I'll get

1706
01:01:11,389 --> 01:01:15,469
it growing into that trellis squares and

1707
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:16,879
then add the other trellis a little bit

1708
01:01:15,469 --> 01:01:18,469
into flower and then keep the buds

1709
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,590
growing through that and you'll be able

1710
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:23,419
to create more bud sites more buds more

1711
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:25,070
harvest weight without adding more light

1712
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,780
or without using more space in your grow

1713
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:28,820
room and I find that to be a huge

1714
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,290
improvement so something else I want to

1715
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:33,800
touch on you guys this is a major

1716
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:36,019
important factor that people overlook

1717
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,060
they say that cleanly cleanliness is

1718
01:01:36,019 --> 01:01:39,500
next to godliness so something that

1719
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:41,840
would really improve your garden you

1720
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,550
guys just clean up after yourselves get

1721
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,870
in the garden and clean up if it doesn't

1722
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:46,789
need to be in there take it out of there

1723
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:48,440
you don't need to have the broom and

1724
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:50,360
dustpan in there overnight when you're

1725
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,920
not using it if you've got a trash can

1726
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,450
in your grow room make sure there's a

1727
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,220
lid on it I would recommend taking that

1728
01:01:53,449 --> 01:01:57,049
trash can out of the grow room at night

1729
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:59,779
don't have anything in the room that

1730
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:01,160
doesn't need to be in there clean up all

1731
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,210
that crap in the corner or whatever

1732
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:04,039
you've got over there if it's your

1733
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:05,869
nutrients if your if it's your notes if

1734
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:07,550
it's your gear clean that up take that

1735
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:09,349
out of the grow room if you've got

1736
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:11,360
leaves on the floor get those leaves up

1737
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:13,519
off the floor now here's something I'm

1738
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:15,620
gonna kind of contradict myself with but

1739
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:18,530
I think it's really important to have a

1740
01:02:15,619 --> 01:02:21,949
super clean grow room cleanliness will

1741
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:23,540
keep bugs away cleanliness just helps

1742
01:02:21,949 --> 01:02:26,869
you keep everything more organized

1743
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:28,159
it keeps healthier plants but here's

1744
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:30,859
something that I'm gonna add to this

1745
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:32,809
around week 6 or 7 your plants are gonna

1746
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:34,340
start getting really sticky they're

1747
01:02:32,809 --> 01:02:36,409
gonna start producing resin the

1748
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:39,200
trichomes are gonna get fat the plants

1749
01:02:36,409 --> 01:02:40,759
are gonna want to stick to everything if

1750
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:41,960
you're a girl or a dude with long hair

1751
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,550
you'll notice that every time you walk

1752
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,568
past the ganja plants you leave some

1753
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:45,859
hair in them

1754
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:47,150
if you're a pot photographer you'll

1755
01:02:45,858 --> 01:02:49,278
notice that every time you try to take a

1756
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:51,380
picture that one killer bud has got a

1757
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:54,438
dog hair or a people hair or a kitty

1758
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:55,969
hair or some kind of hair in it what I'm

1759
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:58,248
getting at you guys is these sticky

1760
01:02:55,969 --> 01:03:00,829
plants love to collect everything and

1761
01:02:58,248 --> 01:03:03,168
you're gonna give them about 21 to 25

1762
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:04,809
days of straight sticky collection time

1763
01:03:03,168 --> 01:03:06,949
they're gonna be sticky for three weeks

1764
01:03:04,809 --> 01:03:08,569
so in that whole time they're acting

1765
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,880
like flypaper I just collecting

1766
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:14,268
everything that's in that room so my

1767
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,099
advice to you guys is try to control the

1768
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:18,708
dust that's in the air in your grow room

1769
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:20,630
try to control the particulates and hair

1770
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:22,998
that is flying around that are flying

1771
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,650
around in your grow room try to minimize

1772
01:03:22,998 --> 01:03:26,268
all of that stuff because it's going to

1773
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:29,599
stick to your buds and end up in your

1774
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:31,938
buds and these days most of the people

1775
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:33,859
in Colorado in California in a legal

1776
01:03:31,938 --> 01:03:36,768
state that are producing a grow at least

1777
01:03:33,858 --> 01:03:38,208
half of the grows are being turned into

1778
01:03:36,768 --> 01:03:40,308
extracts which means they're being

1779
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:42,139
blasted with butane they're being turned

1780
01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:45,349
into water hash they're being turned

1781
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:46,909
into some sort of concentrate what's

1782
01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:48,289
gonna happen is you're gonna take so

1783
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:49,399
you're in your grow room right and

1784
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:51,079
you're not cleaning up after yourself

1785
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,489
and you're mixing soil for your next

1786
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:54,619
batch or whatever you do in there and

1787
01:03:52,489 --> 01:03:57,139
you get dust all in the air you get soil

1788
01:03:54,619 --> 01:03:59,239
all in the air all of that [Â __Â ] is going

1789
01:03:57,139 --> 01:04:01,489
to stick to your trichomes all of it and

1790
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:03,108
then you're gonna smoke those plants and

1791
01:04:01,489 --> 01:04:04,668
they're gonna taste like dusty dirt and

1792
01:04:03,108 --> 01:04:07,278
then you're gonna extract it make hash

1793
01:04:04,668 --> 01:04:10,129
out of it and all that dust and dirt and

1794
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:12,438
[Â __Â ] and dog hair is going to be in your

1795
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:14,499
concentrates so I really recommend you

1796
01:04:12,438 --> 01:04:17,568
keep the grow room clean try to minimize

1797
01:04:14,498 --> 01:04:20,568
dust and hair in the air you can get a

1798
01:04:17,568 --> 01:04:22,188
carbon scrubber I just throw a tall

1799
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:23,719
carbon filter on the floor point it

1800
01:04:22,188 --> 01:04:25,998
straight up put a blower on top of it

1801
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:28,789
and just let put that sucker by your

1802
01:04:25,998 --> 01:04:31,818
door kind of near the door so that way

1803
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:33,409
any air that is drawn in any particles

1804
01:04:31,818 --> 01:04:36,349
will get sucked up by your carbon filter

1805
01:04:33,409 --> 01:04:38,088
hopefully and also on any intakes going

1806
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:40,249
into the room I would recommend putting

1807
01:04:38,088 --> 01:04:42,349
a HEPA filter over all of the holes or

1808
01:04:40,248 --> 01:04:44,598
all of the ducting into the room so

1809
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:47,220
you're not bringing in crap from outside

1810
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:49,588
I definitely don't recommend

1811
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:51,449
bringing in air from the outside that

1812
01:04:49,588 --> 01:04:53,909
has not been filtered and treated for

1813
01:04:51,449 --> 01:04:56,250
temperature right now it's the winter if

1814
01:04:53,909 --> 01:04:58,139
you were to bring in it's gonna be

1815
01:04:56,250 --> 01:05:00,179
probably 20-something degrees tonight

1816
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:01,920
I'm guessing if you're running your

1817
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:03,989
lights at night and you bring in that 20

1818
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,550
degree air over your plants you're gonna

1819
01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:07,379
cause powdery mildew issue you're

1820
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:08,970
bringing in frosty cold air you're

1821
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,710
introducing it into a warm draw room

1822
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:15,269
environment that is a great way to

1823
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:16,349
create powdery mildew situations so pay

1824
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:18,030
attention to what you're bringing in the

1825
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:20,190
room be clean that's my point you guys

1826
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:22,500
every leaf on the floor is a spot for a

1827
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:23,970
bug to hide every piece of crap that

1828
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,219
you've got in there is another place for

1829
01:05:23,969 --> 01:05:28,588
a bug to hide it's a place for a mold

1830
01:05:26,219 --> 01:05:30,779
spore to start growing just be clean

1831
01:05:28,588 --> 01:05:33,088
cleanliness is very important in the

1832
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:35,400
grow room all right guys I think that's

1833
01:05:33,088 --> 01:05:39,059
what I've got free four ways to improve

1834
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:40,470
your garden for now all right guys thank

1835
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:42,119
you for listening to another episode I

1836
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:44,489
don't think that the car episodes are up

1837
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:46,170
to my quality standards the sound

1838
01:05:44,489 --> 01:05:47,969
quality and the amount of attention I am

1839
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:49,800
allowed to give a show doesn't seem like

1840
01:05:47,969 --> 01:05:51,838
it's fair to the listener I am going to

1841
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:53,609
probably stop doing the car episodes if

1842
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:55,739
I do a car episode it will just be

1843
01:05:53,608 --> 01:05:58,409
something ranty it won't be something

1844
01:05:55,739 --> 01:05:59,639
educational or detailed so I appreciate

1845
01:05:58,409 --> 01:06:01,858

1846

if you guys remember what happened on

2165
01:21:02,659 --> 01:21:08,840
that episode got a little sloppy so I've

2166
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,610
got a bunch of notes here in the phone I

2167
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,380
should probably open that stuff up and

2168
01:21:10,609 --> 01:21:13,909
start getting on it first before we get

2169
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:16,550
too far I need to learn a little bit

2170
01:21:13,909 --> 01:21:17,539
about the dude it's Gatsby Invitational

2171
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:23,050
do you guys want to tell me all about

2172
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:28,430
that I'm sure so I've kind of been

2173
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:30,470
organizing these like a few years for a

2174
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:32,990
different company I'm gonna bring a

2175
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:35,150
bunch of girls and photographers to

2176
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:36,769
different locations and we would make a

2177
01:21:35,149 --> 01:21:38,989
whole bunch of art and have a really

2178
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:41,120
good time and there was kind of an

2179
01:21:38,989 --> 01:21:43,429
excuse for all of us to get together

2180
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:47,720
even though we are spread across the

2181
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:50,630
country and I thought why not do that

2182
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:56,240
for cannabis products and for businesses

2183
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:58,940
and so we kind of jet I kind of ran the

2184
01:21:56,239 --> 01:22:00,289
idea pestilent and he was like that

2185
01:21:58,939 --> 01:22:02,509
could actually happen it was kind of

2186
01:22:00,289 --> 01:22:04,279
just an idea wouldn't it be cool I

2187
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:05,539
really just wanted an excuse to bring my

2188
01:22:04,279 --> 01:22:11,569
friends somewhere and watch them run

2189
01:22:05,539 --> 01:22:12,510
around naked but make it a real thing

2190
01:22:11,569 --> 01:22:18,189
and

2191
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:21,520
and lots of hard work and planning and

2192
01:22:18,189 --> 01:22:23,949
some sweet sponsors later and a lot of

2193
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:27,040
these guys here teaching me how to be a

2194
01:22:23,949 --> 01:22:31,119
boss you have to be a boss before I met

2195
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:33,369
you I mean I think lifestyle marketing

2196
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:36,069
and kind of like content creation in

2197
01:22:33,369 --> 01:22:37,989
general is something that numerous

2198
01:22:36,069 --> 01:22:40,000
businesses whether big or small are

2199
01:22:37,989 --> 01:22:43,149
utilizing in different aspects and so

2200
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,220
with you know the the GG fam and

2201
01:22:43,149 --> 01:22:49,199
different kind of aspects and I actually

2202
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:52,630
met damsel at one of those shoots before

2203
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:54,489
giving a cannabis class to like the

2204
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:57,909
photo shoot and kind of doing some

2205
01:22:54,489 --> 01:22:59,710
cannabis consulting but with the people

2206
01:22:57,909 --> 01:23:02,409
that are in the room now there's a

2207
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:05,050
massive imprint and footprint so to

2208
01:23:02,409 --> 01:23:06,639
speak on like how social media and

2209
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:09,579
social engineering and lifestyle

2210
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:11,440
marketing comes to be very effective and

2211
01:23:09,579 --> 01:23:14,319
so it was kind of a double-edged sword

2212
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:20,949
with bringing the right people together

2213
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:24,630
but also getting the right brands and

2214
01:23:20,949 --> 01:23:24,630
what brands were part of the event this

2215
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:40,289
for this one we have all kinds of

2216
01:23:37,899 --> 01:23:42,279
different companies seem to be obviously

2217
01:23:40,289 --> 01:23:44,350
some of the stuff we've been putting in

2218
01:23:42,279 --> 01:23:45,819

2221
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:52,240
using and also having some great shoots

2222
01:23:49,689 --> 01:23:56,500

[Music]

2230
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:23,420
huge you know Chris coming out in person

2231
01:24:21,619 --> 01:24:35,899
is a blessing in general just having out

2232
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:37,340
the scientists of the mats mats that can

2233

we're staring at green and healthy

2235
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:47,929
wellness we had some places there that

2236
01:24:45,829 --> 01:24:53,109
we shot at and saw what was going down

2237
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:53,110
with that there are other ones

2238
01:24:53,329 --> 01:25:05,119
a huge success we brought out a bunch of

2239
01:25:03,289 --> 01:25:07,250
veteran models and a veteran

2240
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:09,349
photographer and girls that are really

2241
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:11,149
used to like pitching in and doing their

2242
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:13,070
shirt at work and helping out and we all

2243
01:25:11,149 --> 01:25:15,199
get along really well but we know how to

2244

yes okay all right because when I think

2311
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:41,779
you can't fire I think like when you go

2312

camping and your hair smells like

2313

2319
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:15,019

sparkly chirps on it um and I described

2322
01:29:18,859 --> 01:29:24,380

2333
01:30:00,349 --> 01:30:04,880
20 seeds of three different strains and

2334
01:30:02,658 --> 01:30:07,429
I narrowed it down through the veg phase

2335
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:09,498
and through flower I ended up with three

2336
01:30:07,429 --> 01:30:10,670
of letter A and I just labeled the seeds

2337
01:30:09,498 --> 01:30:12,349
so that nobody knew what they were I've

2338

01:31:46,560 --> 01:32:00,539
there's just another strain that I

2381
01:31:48,750 --> 01:32:03,569
compared all of my eyes to and there

2382
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:04,920

with that

2409
01:33:53,619 --> 01:34:01,479
how long is before so b-1b all of the

2410
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:02,770
bees were very very similar growth you

2411
01:34:01,479 --> 01:34:04,539
could barely see a difference in them

2412
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:06,130
they kind of stretch the lemon skunk

2413
01:34:04,539 --> 01:34:08,800
make some stretch pretty well they grow

2414
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:10,569
real dense they grow real chunky they

2415
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,279
take they could take 70 days these went

2416
01:34:10,569 --> 01:34:14,049
63 I think it could have gone another

this stuff immediate type of effect

2804
02:04:25,579 --> 02:04:35,539
where like you can feel it and if the

2805
02:04:32,210 --> 02:04:37,579
drink is potent enough within five to

2806
02:04:35,539 --> 02:04:40,130
ten minutes you are at you know pretty

2807
02:04:37,579 --> 02:04:42,680
much euphoria and it also can pound

2808
02:04:40,130 --> 02:04:45,770
itself or some sort of like multiplier

2809
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:48,260
where it's like if there's 60 milligrams

2810
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:54,110
in the cub it really feels like 200

2811
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:56,090
milligrams and some batches in the R&amp;D

2812
02:04:54,109 --> 02:04:58,849
phase were extremely chirpy and

2813
02:04:56,090 --> 02:05:02,539
unpleasant and other batches have been

2814
02:04:58,850 --> 02:05:04,010

2827
02:05:30,939 --> 02:05:36,009
that was some crazy [Â __Â ] I lived in oh I

2828
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:37,779
grew up in a grew up in Ohio lived in

2829
02:05:36,010 --> 02:05:39,280
Colorado here for a couple years and

2830
02:05:37,779 --> 02:05:40,840
when we live down here in Colorado

2831
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:43,389
Springs I mean I always knew the deers

2832
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:46,840
to be pretty damn friendly and fearless

2833
02:05:43,390 --> 02:06:59,890
this [Â __Â ] was trying to get in

2834
02:05:46,840 --> 02:07:08,199
on the cipher I know you don't work on

2835
02:06:59,890 --> 02:07:10,060
deer bro clear can you tell me about the

2836
02:07:08,199 --> 02:07:11,649
clear a lot of my listeners this is

2837
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:13,390
listen to people have listened to by

2838
02:07:11,649 --> 02:07:16,089
people from all over the world not just

2839
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:17,619
people in Colorado or Cali a lot of the

2840
02:07:16,090 --> 02:07:20,829
people listening have a hard time

2841
02:07:17,619 --> 02:07:22,840
finding pot so it's a clear if you just

2842
02:07:20,829 --> 02:07:24,069
want to tell them kind of basically they

2843
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:25,539
know if they probably know about shatter

2844
02:07:24,069 --> 02:07:26,769
and basic hashes from listening because

2845
02:07:25,539 --> 02:07:28,720
we want to give them an update on what

2846
02:07:26,770 --> 02:07:32,860
the clear actually is that'd be awesome

2847
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:34,570
so clear is is a brand of product that

2848
02:07:32,859 --> 02:07:37,389
we you know made a couple started a

2849
02:07:34,569 --> 02:07:39,599
couple years ago in California and it

2850
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:44,729
was sort of the first

2851
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:49,708
I guess popularized a purified cannabis

2852
02:07:44,729 --> 02:07:54,179
oil that because it was always a nice

2853
02:07:49,708 --> 02:07:55,708
high clarity and like low color in in

2854
02:07:54,179 --> 02:07:59,340
the kind of were one of the first quote

2855
02:07:55,708 --> 02:08:03,059
solvent free companies you know existed

2856
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:05,458
so people have their own ways of making

2857
02:08:03,059 --> 02:08:06,809
these activated cannabinoids decolorized

2858
02:08:05,458 --> 02:08:09,688
and Stephane so we don't really speak to

2859
02:08:06,809 --> 02:08:11,639
how we do it keep it always a secret so

2860
02:08:09,689 --> 02:08:14,489
other people do it and tell you how they

2861
02:08:11,639 --> 02:08:16,949
do it but as far as we kind of stick to

2862
02:08:14,488 --> 02:08:19,738
just a purification method and we have

2863
02:08:16,948 --> 02:08:21,029
our own particulars as to what machines

2864
02:08:19,738 --> 02:08:22,708
we use we build a lot of our own

2865
02:08:21,029 --> 02:08:25,529
machines and have our own processes and

2866
02:08:22,708 --> 02:08:27,809
things like that so kind of particulars

2867
02:08:25,529 --> 02:08:29,698
and we have our own like unique flavors

2868
02:08:27,809 --> 02:08:32,939
that we then blend back they're all

2869
02:08:29,698 --> 02:08:34,589
natural flavors that can range from

2870
02:08:32,939 --> 02:08:36,840
cannabis type flavors that have high

2871
02:08:34,590 --> 02:08:39,119
doping content to like you know your

2872
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:40,949
standard strawberry or grape and you

2873
02:08:39,118 --> 02:08:42,538
know we have sort of a flavor department

2874
02:08:40,948 --> 02:08:44,638
that we you know pump out different

2875
02:08:42,538 --> 02:08:46,469
flavors and try to keep those flavors

2876
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:48,059
derived from cannabis or other products

2877
02:08:46,469 --> 02:08:49,979
so they're all derived from other

2878
02:08:48,059 --> 02:08:55,199
products okay everything's natural none

2879
02:08:49,979 --> 02:09:10,530
of them are like all the flavors we you

2880
02:08:55,198 --> 02:09:12,569
know I've talked to you for a couple of

2881
02:09:10,529 --> 02:09:16,099

2925
02:11:46,399 --> 02:11:53,029
Las Vegas which very exciting so that

2926
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:53,990
right about when this comes out this

2927
02:11:53,029 --> 02:11:55,880
will probably come out in about two or

2928
02:11:53,989 --> 02:12:02,389
three weeks so right when this drops

2929
02:11:55,880 --> 02:12:05,630

02:12:07,630 --> 02:12:13,220
throughout the Las Vegas market are

2933
02:12:10,789 --> 02:12:15,319
calif you know we originally came out

2934
02:12:13,220 --> 02:12:17,360
here from California and but be pretty

2935
02:12:15,319 --> 02:12:18,920
awesome because now California patients

2936
02:12:17,359 --> 02:12:21,889
will have access to the products that we

2937
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:33,199
make again because Nevada has reciprocal

2938
02:12:21,890 --> 02:12:34,850
medical marijuana and you have a

2939
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:37,699
California medical marijuana card you

2940
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:45,140

2941
02:12:37,699 --> 02:12:46,819

2942
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:50,510

2943
02:12:46,819 --> 02:12:55,519
some herb go get some tur packs at the

2944
02:12:50,510 --> 02:12:58,220
first of the year damn it out how much

2945
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:59,810
of so you guys are talking about nut

2946
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:01,880
runs all of the room you're growing has

2947
02:12:59,810 --> 02:13:03,050
to be made into Earl what percentage of

2948
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:04,550
that and if this if I'm out of line just

2949
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:06,260
let me know and I won't ask the question

2950
02:13:04,550 --> 02:13:08,900
how much of that product will actually

2951
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:10,880
be sold as smokeable Earl and how much

2952
02:13:08,899 --> 02:13:13,309
will be sold to a vendor and turned into

2953
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:20,390
something like a topical or an edible or

2954
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:23,810
something you know it's we you know we

2955
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:25,460
take pretty we take pretty good steps in

2956
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:28,880
the grow to make sure that you know we

2957
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:31,310
have really high quality to let people

2958
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:32,930
you know experience the flowers but the

2959
02:13:31,310 --> 02:13:34,760
fact that we can take all that high

2960
02:13:32,930 --> 02:13:36,039
quality flower product and turn it into

2961
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:38,119
extracts

2962
02:13:36,039 --> 02:13:41,269
you know we want to get as much of that

2963
02:13:38,119 --> 02:13:43,599
branded tur PEX awesome nug run flavor

2964
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:45,219
on the market as possible

2965
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:47,170
I'd say most of that product will be

2966
02:13:45,219 --> 02:13:48,880
sold as smokeable oil if we start

2967
02:13:47,170 --> 02:13:52,569
delving into other products and find

2968
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:54,699
that you know it's more beneficial to do

2969
02:13:52,569 --> 02:13:56,139
things that way you know maybe work into

2970
02:13:54,698 --> 02:14:01,960
that now but right now the plan is to

2971
02:13:56,139 --> 02:14:03,250
just make five resin talk about live

2972
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:06,069
resin for a minute I heard you say

2973
02:14:03,250 --> 02:14:12,210
something to a client earlier the bottom

2974
02:14:06,069 --> 02:14:12,210
line on the show people call me a hater

2975
02:14:19,139 --> 02:15:02,828
we backed up everything I've said you

2976
02:14:58,510 --> 02:16:19,329
know you know because of the way

2977
02:15:02,828 --> 02:16:21,189
everything it's amazing I think the main

2978
02:16:19,328 --> 02:16:25,658
reason why people like live resin so

2979
02:16:21,189 --> 02:16:40,850
much is because the color brings out a

2980
02:16:25,658 --> 02:16:43,929
lot of flavor the Terps are amplified

2981
02:16:40,850 --> 02:16:43,929
[Music]

2982
02:16:53,799 --> 02:16:58,960
[Music]

2983
02:16:56,609 --> 02:17:02,969
pleasing as if it's cut down early

2984
02:16:58,959 --> 02:17:07,178
frozen and extracted true form you know

2985
02:17:02,968 --> 02:17:08,709
this yellow yeah yeah I've learned to

2986
02:17:07,179 --> 02:17:10,359
take the plants a little bit early if I

2987
02:17:08,709 --> 02:17:12,178
know they're gonna be oil actually looks

2988
02:17:10,359 --> 02:17:15,569
so much better it's definitely a

2989
02:17:12,179 --> 02:17:18,579
definitely a tactic that a lot of

2990
02:17:15,569 --> 02:17:19,449
alright these days I just want to go

2991
02:17:18,579 --> 02:17:21,489
around the room what's your favorite

2992
02:17:19,450 --> 02:17:23,800
screen to smoke as a flower and favorite

2993
02:17:21,489 --> 02:17:25,420
to dab that's funny I was just talking

2994
02:17:23,799 --> 02:17:28,268
to Chris about this my favorite was

2995
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:31,210
always the SF vog and I haven't had it

2996
02:17:28,269 --> 02:17:33,370
in quite some time but uh that's my

2997
02:17:31,209 --> 02:17:35,049
that's the ultimate in flower and dab

2998
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:37,389
for the San Fernando Valley

2999
02:17:35,049 --> 02:17:39,069
oh gee yeah it's gonna I'm gonna if I

3000
02:17:37,388 --> 02:17:41,679
ask a lot of people I asked 100 people I

3001
02:17:39,069 --> 02:17:42,849
bet 50 of them would say the SF vog and

3002
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:44,040
probably 40 of them didn't smoke the

3003
02:17:42,849 --> 02:17:48,630
real one yeah

3004
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:51,630
I'm sure you have I know Chris is

3005
02:17:48,629 --> 02:17:54,888
thinking about it already you want us to

3006
02:17:51,629 --> 02:17:57,808
skip you alright Brian favorite strains

3007
02:17:54,888 --> 02:18:02,579
really like smoking Jack your flower

3008
02:17:57,808 --> 02:18:19,079
okay and really any any African sativa

3009
02:18:02,579 --> 02:18:24,510
just love okay I really like those get

3010
02:18:19,079 --> 02:18:26,728
up and do things during your day when

3011
02:18:24,510 --> 02:18:29,250
it's done right it's done it can be done

3012
02:18:26,728 --> 02:18:30,148
so well I want to assume that Turpin

3013
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:37,590
alene is a terpenoid

3014
02:18:30,148 --> 02:18:39,659
it is correct Chris one of the isomers

3015
02:18:37,590 --> 02:18:46,710
of Terp Terp Anil I can remember I

3016
02:18:39,659 --> 02:18:49,619
believe it's gamma has a very distinct

3017
02:18:46,709 --> 02:18:52,259
smell and is attributed to like D Jack

3018
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:54,029
and XJ type smells and a lot of times

3019
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:56,519
can be a very like overpowering note in

3020
02:18:54,029 --> 02:19:00,300
like a lemon haze or silver haze or

3021
02:18:56,519 --> 02:19:08,130
something like that very fairly common

3022
02:19:00,299 --> 02:19:11,670
in like hybridized definitely yeah Dutch

3023
02:19:08,129 --> 02:19:13,978
treat you can really that's I think like

3024
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:38,398
if you're gonna get into terpenes that's

3025
02:19:13,978 --> 02:19:43,888
when you're gonna be able to pick that

3026
02:19:38,398 --> 02:19:46,429
flower flower strain we got that we call

3027
02:19:43,888 --> 02:19:46,429
Lemongrab

3028
02:20:03,659 --> 02:20:50,140
you know the common nice it's all you my

3029
02:20:34,120 --> 02:20:52,030
friend flower and dabbers uh that's a

3030
02:20:50,140 --> 02:20:56,399
flower you know just blunt swisher

3031
02:20:52,030 --> 02:20:59,261
Sweets a granddaddy purp call it a day

3032
02:20:56,399 --> 02:21:01,359
but you know granddaddy purp probably a

3033
02:20:59,261 --> 02:21:18,970
favorite but you know mainly more I

3034
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:20,351
really love otogi Gigi's particular yeah

3035
02:21:18,970 --> 02:21:28,180
and definitely can I've been going

3036
02:21:20,351 --> 02:21:31,810
really heavy on like mainly OG cut OG

3037
02:21:28,181 --> 02:21:36,659
flowers I'll cook it up from that from

3038
02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:36,659
time it's a unique thing yeah

3039
02:21:41,659 --> 02:21:49,851
have that distinct no-good gorilla glue

3040
02:21:44,690 --> 02:21:50,930
man that's got different distinct break

3041
02:21:49,851 --> 02:21:57,200
it up and you get a little something

3042
02:21:50,930 --> 02:22:04,489
different you know compared the number

3043
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:07,010
fours with the ones we got from the

3044

3046
02:22:08,479 --> 02:22:11,569
we've got this new warehouse far enough

3047
02:22:10,101 --> 02:22:18,521
I think we're gonna check them out and

3048
02:22:11,569 --> 02:22:18,520
we have the cut of the gg4 so you know

3049
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:24,771
I've grown a ton of gg4 so I'll be able

3050
02:22:22,819 --> 02:22:26,000
to recognize it a little bit so we were

3051
02:22:24,771 --> 02:22:27,500
talking about the granddaddy purple and

3052
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,360
I said it's not my favorite I'm gonna

3053
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:30,560
kind of diss your strain here but then

3054
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:31,970
I've got the two guys in the room that

3055
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:34,369
are gonna be able to explain to me why I

3056
02:22:31,969 --> 02:22:35,899
don't like it when I smoke granddaddy

3057
02:22:34,370 --> 02:22:38,030
purp snow matter and it's a lot of

3058
02:22:35,899 --> 02:22:40,010
purple buds do this to me when they're

3059
02:22:38,030 --> 02:22:42,141
dried and cured they taste like they are

3060
02:22:40,010 --> 02:22:43,280
still wet is that have you experienced

3061
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:45,109
that or does that make sense to you that

3062
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:46,670
it's taste like there's moisture in the

3063
02:22:45,110 --> 02:22:51,200
bud or I don't like the flavor of

3064
02:22:46,670 --> 02:22:56,601
granddaddy perps the moisture content

3065
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:58,220
shouldn't be affected I don't think it's

3066
02:22:56,601 --> 02:23:06,351
actually moisture it just tastes like

3067
02:22:58,219 --> 02:23:07,909
wetness or different sort of like floral

3068
02:23:06,351 --> 02:23:10,460
top notes terpenoids things that are

3069
02:23:07,909 --> 02:23:11,750
like a little bit less like elucidated I

3070
02:23:10,459 --> 02:23:13,369
would think you linked to cannabis like

3071
02:23:11,750 --> 02:23:15,260
sort of spectrum relative to like the

3072
02:23:13,370 --> 02:23:18,351
symbol terbium so you've got like a

3073
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:21,800
situation where like how they age and

3074
02:23:18,351 --> 02:23:23,000
how they oxidize is kind of dependent so

3075
02:23:21,799 --> 02:23:25,399
you may get that effect

3076
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:30,049
some people might identify that physical

that but I think the game's gonna be you

3204
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:47,500
know sort of just keeping the essence of

3205
02:34:45,549 --> 02:34:49,209
cannabis so that everyone can experience

3206
02:34:47,500 --> 02:34:51,040
it in all the different formulations you

3207
02:34:49,209 --> 02:34:52,599
know it's like kind of more of an art

3208
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:55,210
and cannabinoids they're a little bit

3209
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:57,700
more stable and flavors are kind of like

3210
02:34:55,209 --> 02:35:03,179
our you know perfumers and people who do

3211
02:34:57,700 --> 02:35:06,880
that sort of extraction you know I think

3212
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:08,520
hasn't quite matured to that level of

3213
02:35:06,879 --> 02:35:10,869
science and its kind of getting there

3214
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:13,390
we're just now been given the freedom we

3215
02:35:10,870 --> 02:35:15,399
were a little we were prohibited from

3216
02:35:13,389 --> 02:35:16,539
doing that experimentation all right so

3217
02:35:15,398 --> 02:35:19,709
you feel like Terps are next you look

3218
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:19,710
like you got something important to say

3219
02:35:23,969 --> 02:35:26,969
okay

3220
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:45,891
a lot of people poopoo on that but it's

3221
02:35:35,319 --> 02:35:48,079
it's definitely real and we use it for

3222
02:35:45,890 --> 02:35:52,069
people using lavender oil and stuff like

3223
02:35:48,079 --> 02:35:54,039
that just in their bedside steamers and

3224
02:35:52,069 --> 02:35:57,649
stuff like that or whatever the

3225
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:59,090
essential essence so if I mean it's

3226
02:35:57,649 --> 02:36:00,399
definitely real and so incorporating

3227
02:35:59,090 --> 02:36:03,380
that in the cannabis is pretty cool

3228
02:36:00,399 --> 02:36:04,279
keeping even that original essence and

3229
02:36:03,379 --> 02:36:06,680
so coming up with the different

3230
02:36:04,280 --> 02:36:09,221
extractions and trying to get just the

3231
02:36:06,681 --> 02:36:10,780
terpenes and then

3232
02:36:09,220 --> 02:36:13,171
get plants that produce a lot of

3233
02:36:10,780 --> 02:36:15,761
turbines and there's this pretty neat

3234
02:36:13,171 --> 02:36:18,040
information out there in theories on how

3235
02:36:15,761 --> 02:36:20,381
you can influence the turbine levels by

3236
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:23,290
soil management in like environmental

3237
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:24,729
controls and stuff like that okay you

3238
02:36:23,290 --> 02:36:26,471
know this isn't the only industry where

3239
02:36:24,729 --> 02:36:28,529
turbines are prevalent or where people

3240
02:36:26,470 --> 02:36:59,829
want the turbines from what we're

3241
02:36:28,530 --> 02:37:01,960
there's a lot of different things you

3242
02:36:59,829 --> 02:37:03,970
said that environmental factors play a

3243
02:37:01,959 --> 02:37:06,220
lot into my terpenoids and my soil I

3244
02:37:03,970 --> 02:37:07,511
know you're not you're more on the hash

3245
02:37:06,220 --> 02:37:09,341
side then you are the grow game from

3246
02:37:07,511 --> 02:37:11,950
what I understand about you could you

3247
02:37:09,341 --> 02:37:14,050
give myself and my listeners one hint on

3248
02:37:11,950 --> 02:37:15,521
how we could improve our Terps in our

3249
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:17,649
garden one thing that we could just stop

3250
02:37:15,521 --> 02:37:26,950
doing or start doing it would correct

3251
02:37:17,649 --> 02:37:28,329
our Terps sounds good to me you guys

3252
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:35,710
heard it here he's gonna read that and

3253
02:37:28,329 --> 02:37:36,780
find rosin rosin bro Triple Threat a lot

3254
02:37:35,709 --> 02:37:39,819
of my friends listen to this podcast

3255
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:42,070
I've tasted one person's rosin that I

3256
02:37:39,819 --> 02:37:43,770
liked everything else tastes like burnt

3257
02:37:42,069 --> 02:37:46,390
popcorn

3258
02:37:43,771 --> 02:37:47,681
yeah I had one guy my buddy Tim came

3259
02:37:46,390 --> 02:37:49,329
through and he had some properly made

3260
02:37:47,681 --> 02:37:50,860
rosin I think he made it himself he was

3261
02:37:49,329 --> 02:38:00,069
the only one who had rosin that I liked

3262
02:37:50,860 --> 02:38:09,250
about that low Tim rosin from you know

3263
02:38:00,069 --> 02:38:11,591
you don't wax a sufficient dry suit or

3264
02:38:09,250 --> 02:38:13,780
any kind of other gets you away from

3265
02:38:11,591 --> 02:38:15,690
that bulk of the plant material and

3266
02:38:13,780 --> 02:38:18,341
that's going to increase your resin

3267
02:38:15,690 --> 02:38:21,310
quality you're gonna get a lot less of

3268
02:38:18,341 --> 02:38:21,780
the resin stuck in the plant material

3269
02:38:21,310 --> 02:38:23,399
and

3270
02:38:21,780 --> 02:38:24,750
overall just gonna be more of a pleasant

3271
02:38:23,399 --> 02:38:28,590
experience just kind of come up with a

3272
02:38:24,750 --> 02:38:30,719
reasonable sipped dry I sift or you know

3273
02:38:28,590 --> 02:38:32,130
if you can keep the moisture away you

3274
02:38:30,719 --> 02:38:34,739
know people are building out cold rooms

3275
02:38:32,129 --> 02:38:36,689
doing do go in the fold to full length

3276
02:38:34,739 --> 02:38:39,180
and so you can break that material down

3277
02:38:36,690 --> 02:38:42,329
get away from all that leaf there it is

3278
02:38:39,180 --> 02:38:43,829
okay so oh man that's a lot of work for

3279
02:38:42,329 --> 02:38:44,879
a home grower sometimes what's your

3280
02:38:43,829 --> 02:38:46,559
what's the most recommended way of

3281
02:38:44,879 --> 02:38:49,649
getting some dry sift out of that to

3282
02:38:46,559 --> 02:38:51,869
work it into rosin I mean I think you

3283
02:38:49,649 --> 02:38:54,719
can just kind of promptly break down

3284
02:38:51,870 --> 02:38:57,960
you know they got wrote at machine okay

3285
02:38:54,719 --> 02:39:01,409
they've got material that can that are

3286
02:38:57,959 --> 02:39:08,609
pretty efficient if you just can i rosin

3287
02:39:01,409 --> 02:39:18,979
my Keefe popcorn ER since we didn't use

3288
02:39:08,610 --> 02:39:24,090
plant matter taste right is a classic

3289
02:39:18,979 --> 02:39:36,059
comes any process true if it's key for

3290
02:39:24,090 --> 02:39:37,889
not what should I be doing with my

3291
02:39:36,059 --> 02:39:52,920
reclaim I've got a drop down it's

3292
02:39:37,889 --> 02:39:54,989
probably got thrown it away okay make

3293
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:58,520
sleepy time sleepy time CBN heated up

3294
02:39:54,989 --> 02:39:58,520
make it in and then just dab it again

3295
02:40:05,239 --> 02:40:10,610
we've got a video going they said can we

3296
02:40:07,889 --> 02:40:12,799
season our nails with reclaim

3297
02:40:10,610 --> 02:40:15,829
yeah yeah why couldn't you bro yeah you

3298
02:40:12,799 --> 02:40:17,629
totally could if you're kind of like

3299
02:40:15,829 --> 02:40:28,760
upset with your buddy you know take some

3300
02:40:17,629 --> 02:40:33,920
of his oil and just kind of clean one

3301
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:35,960
thing one thing I've seen I saw a

3302
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:37,639
picture on the internet the other day of

3303
02:40:35,959 --> 02:40:40,039
someone who had smashed their fingers

3304
02:40:37,639 --> 02:40:46,159
song it was a girl because there's girl

3305
02:40:40,040 --> 02:40:48,680
fingernails you know low temp high

3306
02:40:46,159 --> 02:40:52,639
pressure situations and didn't get their

3307
02:40:48,680 --> 02:40:54,350
fingers out of the way and it was not

3308
02:40:52,639 --> 02:41:03,739
pretty sight it looked like you ran over

3309
02:40:54,350 --> 02:41:05,149
a banana yeah yeah most of you guys are

3310
02:41:03,739 --> 02:41:06,229
you stole your girlfriend's hair

3311
02:41:05,149 --> 02:41:08,299
straightener they're not using a

3312
02:41:06,229 --> 02:41:17,810
hydraulic press or anything be fair that

3313
02:41:08,299 --> 02:41:20,000
as goofy and stupid as it works actually

3314
02:41:17,810 --> 02:41:21,920
flower and a hair straightener is the

3315
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:25,899
first time we tried it what was that

3316
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:28,521
from the gorilla glue I don't remember I

3317
02:41:25,899 --> 02:41:29,719
don't remember your rosin virginity

3318
02:41:28,521 --> 02:41:31,100
unfortunately I think you think we're

3319
02:41:29,719 --> 02:41:33,439
gonna run into two just like any of

3320
02:41:31,100 --> 02:41:39,739
these other extracts is that with some

3321
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:42,380
plants will be absolutely frozen you get

3322
02:41:39,739 --> 02:41:44,180
certain heats and [Â __Â ] with certain snow

3323
02:41:42,379 --> 02:41:47,689
and certain ones are fine so I think

3324
02:41:44,180 --> 02:41:50,479
it's a matter of like where do these if

3325
02:41:47,690 --> 02:41:51,890
it's all going there's five or six ways

3326
02:41:50,479 --> 02:41:54,459
to make oil and that's gonna leave

3327
02:41:51,889 --> 02:41:57,049
different spectrums of which plants get

3328
02:41:54,459 --> 02:41:58,399
the GDP maybe he gets pressed and

3329
02:41:57,049 --> 02:42:00,409
doesn't taste like so

3330
02:41:58,399 --> 02:42:02,119
right so whatever or maybe it's like you

3331
02:42:00,409 --> 02:42:05,840
really taste better when you get it

3332
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:08,240
first I like the way you think my friend

3333
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:10,250
yeah we got to get some GDP impressive

3334
02:42:08,239 --> 02:42:11,750
and then blast it and then make bubble

3335
02:42:10,250 --> 02:42:13,600
out of it and see if we can convince me

3336
02:42:11,750 --> 02:42:15,739
that I like that flavor

3337
02:42:13,600 --> 02:42:17,540
[Music]
