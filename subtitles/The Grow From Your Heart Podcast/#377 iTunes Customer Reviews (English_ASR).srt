8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,589
seed dot store I like to start the

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,570
podcast off by letting you know what I'm

10
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,149
dabbing on today I've got a nice little

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,768
buffet of viola labs concentrates in

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:29,098
front of me let's start off with this

13
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:31,709
sfv og chem daily camp I really like

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,109
this because of the diesel II dirty

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,969
funky fuel II smell I'm giving it a

16
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,878
smell right now it's got a hint of

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,649
diesel feel to it and then that sfv og

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,419
in there gives it that kind of fuel II

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,629
Feeny kind of thing and I really like

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,539
that aroma a lot the next on the list is

21
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,829
the TK la this one smells great I'm

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,870
cracking it open right now to give it a

23
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,579
smell it's got that earthiness to it

24
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,070
it's got a little bit of a gas eNOS to

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,920
it not as extreme on the diesel Terp as

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,590
the sfv but it certainly does have a few

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,109
li earthy sort of aroma to it and the TK

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,670
la packs quite a punch this one kind of

29
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,040
put me to sleep last night so I'm loving

30
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,659
the TK la and then if we're gonna go by

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,280
flavor this next one would be my

32
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,100
favorite in terms of flavor

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,200
this is the Tropicana cookies this one

34
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:20,728
as soon as you crack it open I get a

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,070
hint of grapefruits followed by a little

36
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:24,868
bit of maybe bubbly champagne or maybe a

37
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,969
hint of pineapples now that I'm smelling

38
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:29,280
it up real close there's a hint of

39
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,950
pineapples and grapefruits in here and

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,049
as it lingers on my nose I smell sort of

41
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,150
a sweet candy maybe a sweet tart sort of

42
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,829
a thing so I've got a nice variety of

43
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,049
concentrates from our friends at viola

44
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:41,849
labs today it's hard to pick a favorite

45
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,118
out of all three of these I like that

46
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:47,969
sfv o G chem de Lechem blend because of

47
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,250
that gassy decently sort of aroma and

48
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:51,959
that aftertaste that it leaves I really

49
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,299
love the Tropicana cookies because of

50
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,289
that sweet grapefruit pineapple kind of

51
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,060
flavor and then it just leaves a

52
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,090
candy-coated layer on your tongue but

53
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,399
that tea KLA it lacked in flavor but it

54
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,630
really punched me with the potency so

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,159
there are all three winners in my book

56
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:06,989
big shout out to veal the labs they've

57
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,459
been doing a great job lately and I'm

58
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:09,989
staring at this package on my table and

59
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,840
I just realized it no matter which way I

60
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,700
turn this this says viola upside down

61
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,709
or right side up so great job at the

62
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:18,629
creative logo there I'm honestly not

63
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,159
sure if it's viola or viola I was

64
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:23,159
recently told that it was named after

65
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,719
the one of the people's grandmother I

66
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,479
would like to get your name correctly

67
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,159
but everywhere I go if I say viola in a

68
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,409
dispensary they correct me and say it's

69
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:32,939
viola if I start by saying viola they

70
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,250
correct me and say it's viola

71
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,509
so I'm always wrong so I don't know the

72
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,500
proper way to say it but big shout out

73
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:39,719
to your company you're doing a great job

74
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,519
at the concentrates I do approve I will

75
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,019
be back for more while I'm talking about

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,670
this great concentrate I should mention

77
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,980
where I picked it up I grabbed this at

78
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,958

79
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,459
south end of Pueblo big shout out to my

83
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,180

84
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,680

85

90
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,548
out in a big fist bump to the whole crew

91
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:09,958
and the one that got me super talkative

92
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:11,430
out of that mess was the Tropicana

93
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,620
cookies the other two were kind of more

94
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,209
on the mellow side that Tropicana

95
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,489
cookies lifted my head up and made me

96
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,349
super talkative again so let's get into

97
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,909
a podcast you guys this will not be a

98
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:23,370
long episode this is going to be a

99
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:25,259
Thursday episode I have been spoiling

100
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,120
you guys with two episodes every week I

101
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,349
don't want to cut back on episodes but

102
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,909
I'm going to do a couple of short

103
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,739
Thursday episodes for a couple of weeks

104
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,599
while I get a few things handled I am

105
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,700
just busy I'm overwhelmed I don't want

106
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,409
to stop doing podcasting at all but the

107
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,869
Thursday shows make it a little shorter

108
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:41,789
the Mondays shows will stay long intense

109
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,379
there'll be in-depth grow lessons but

110

00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:41,250
tending our garden time in the garden

166
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,079
together has strengthened our

167
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,600
relationship and were happy to have you

168
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,849
as a part of it she usually doesn't like

169
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,490
to listen to podcasts but after a few

170
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:53,160
episodes she warmed up to it quickly as

171
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,079
growers ourselves we encourage our

172
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,850
friends to start their own garden and we

173
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,310
recently turned them on to your grow

174
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,870
lessons if you have taken our suggestion

175
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,069
and it's easier than going to their

176
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,889
house and walking them through

177
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:08,310
everything so thank you Timothy green

178
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:10,439
thumbs and dread head Martha hey Timothy

179
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,060
green thumbs and red head Martha it is

180
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,850
an honor to be in your grow with you

181
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,740
it's an honor to be contributing to your

182
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,390
relationship and helping you to build a

183
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,019
bond together while building a bond with

184
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,419
your plants

185
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:23,819
that's an awesome iTunes review I truly

186
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,050
appreciate that I also appreciate that

187
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,670
you are sharing the show with other

188
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,259
people that means a lot to me a great

189
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,640
way for the show to grow is by word of

190
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,589
mouth so you were doing a great job

191
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,599
thank you thanks for the great review

192
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:35,399
thanks for the great support and thank

193
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
you for sharing the show and it's kind

194
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,250
of funny that you say it's easier than

195
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,569
going to their house because that's part

196
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,918
of what started me

197
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,869
boarding a show I got tired of telling

198
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,088
the same speech over and over on how to

199
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,679
do stuff so I just started recording it

200
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:48,658
and posting it and when people ask me

201
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:50,489
the same question I can say hey just go

202
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,649
listen to episode 315 and you can learn

203
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,059
about mother plants so I'm glad that you

204
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:56,158
got the same idea and you were sharing

205
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:58,259
the show so that people can learn hey

206
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:59,968
Timothy green thumbs and redhead Martha

207
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,189
I look forward to catching you at a show

208
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:05,819
this summer thanks again for the great

209
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:07,740
itunes customer review our next customer

210
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,629
review comes from somebody we have heard

211
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,028
from before this person calls themselves

212
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,399
Yolo grower they left us a three star

213
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:16,649
review the title of their review is

214
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,098
white Mike and their iTunes customer

215
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:21,478
review goes like this I think 99% of

216
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,430
your listeners are here for grow

217
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:25,079
information it would be great if you

218
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,019
stopped bringing white Mike on the show

219
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,248
so we don't have to listen to politics

220
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:31,528
cannabis-related or not it's still

221
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:33,088
politics I don't think you have to

222
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:35,639
convince your listeners to be Pro

223
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:38,459
cannabis we obviously all are Pro

224
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,139
cannabis well first off let me thank you

225
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,699
for the customer review and thank you

226
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,019
for listening you're obviously listening

227
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,699
to quite a few episodes if you are

228
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,288
catching the mike episodes so I'm

229
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,430
grateful that you're here I'm grateful

230
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:49,588
that you're a part of the crew I'm

231
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,990
grateful that you were enjoying most of

232
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:54,509
the show as for not liking the episodes

233
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,728
with Mike the podcast is free and you

234
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:59,369
can always skip the episode I can

235
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:01,438
recommend the dude grow show baddam done

236
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:03,719
show or you can always try to listen to

237
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,789
cannabis cultivation and science with

238
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:07,618
tad huh see if you need more grow

239
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:09,808
knowledge while I'm not doing a grow

240
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:11,329
lesson also let me point out that the

241
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:14,430
point of the show is cannabis news

242
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:15,778
education and conversation and just

243
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,519
because we're not talking about growing

244
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:18,838
cannabis doesn't mean that you're not

245
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,059
going to learn something that there's

246
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:22,949
not something valuable also just because

247
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:25,050
there's not something valuable for you

248
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:27,389
in that lesson doesn't mean that a lot

249
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,399
of people are enjoying it so however

250
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,228
much I do appreciate your review I'm not

251
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,000
gonna change anything Mike is one of my

252
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:35,458
best friends Mike is a valuable resource

253
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,769
and to be quite honest with you several

254
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,418
people request more episodes with Mike

255
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,639
so look forward to hearing from Mike on

256
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,139
the show this is an out loud invitation

257
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,909
hey Mike whenever you want to come on my

258
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,620
show brother you were always [ __ ]

259
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:48,778
welcome that seat across from me that is

260
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,089
yours bro come be on the podcast Mike

261
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,460
number two is for you whenever you are

262
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,080
free so Yolo grower

263
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,820
unfortunately this isn't gonna work out

264
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,410
for you I'm going to have Mike on the

265
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,930
podcast more I feel like he is a

266
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:02,579
valuable resource I feel like educating

267
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:04,079
and informing our community is an

268
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,370
important thing I feel like I've got a

269
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,980
large audience and part of my

270
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,080
responsibility is to educate and invoke

271
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,000
people I want people to vote I want

272
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,680
people to support cannabis you say that

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,080
obviously all of us are Pro cannabis

274
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,359
maybe not I encourage people to listen

275
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,100
to my show with people who are not

276
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,230
cannabis friendly so that we can

277
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,480
possibly sway them to be cannabis

278
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,800
friendly so I'm sorry you don't like you

279
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,269
know what I'm not even sorry it's too

280
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,679
bad you don't like some of the episodes

281
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:30,120
I wish you would have more of an open

282
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,009
mind and you would learn to enjoy those

283
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,750
episodes with Mike because honestly

284
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:35,189
there is some gold hidden in those

285
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,049
episodes if you were skipping them

286
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,460
you're missing some good [ __ ] sorry you

287
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,969
couldn't hang out with us for the good

288
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,830
times

289
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,240
Yolo grower I hope everything goes well

290
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,490
for you I hope you still listen to the

291
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,110
episodes without Mike I look forward to

292
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,240
your next review I'm sure I'm gonna hear

293
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,100
from you sometime soon keep doing what

294
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,740
you're doing you will never slow me down

295
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,379
alright let's move on to the next iTunes

296
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,299
customer review this next review comes

297
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,570
from somebody who calls themselves supa

298
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:02,490
Shah they left us a five-star rating the

299
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,640
headline says this podcast is for you

300
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,590
and the review goes a lot like this if

301
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,110
you were anything like myself and have a

302
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,780
desire to learn how to grow this show is

303
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,789
one of the best ways period from the

304
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,879
basics all the way to his latest grow

305
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:20,849
lessons Geoff's knowledge and passion

306
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,710
resonate through the podcast hey super

307
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,090
Shaw thank you for the great review I'm

308
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,170
glad you're listening to the grow

309
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,759
lessons and I'm glad that they're

310
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:28,500
helping you out and I'm glad that you

311
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,000
see my passion I've got a lot of love

312
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,919
for the cannabis plant I've got a lot of

313
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,019
love for people and I want people to

314
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,059
grow the best cannabis they possibly can

315
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,340
I think a podcast is one of the best

316
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:40,469
ways to effectively teach people how to

317
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,149
grow because knowledge changes everyday

318
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,830
in the cannabis world so I can do

319
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,419
updates I can teach you what I've

320
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,340
learned I can share my knowledge without

321
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:48,990
having to write a book I feel like by

322
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,490
the time you finish writing a book you

323
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,440
run it through all the processes the

324
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,240
publishers the editors by the time that

325
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,380
book comes out it's pretty much outdated

326
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,080
and all of your knowledge needs to be

327
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,789
rewritten with a podcast I can record an

328
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,050
episode the day I learn something I can

329
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:03,209
get it out and get all that fresh

330
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:05,009
content right to you so thank you for

331
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,259
enjoying the podcast and thank you for

332
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,939
learning with me I never enjoyed

333
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,860
but I always enjoyed learning new things

334
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,540
so having a different way of learning

335
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,580
things was always great to me and

336
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,500
finding podcasts and different avenues

337
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,820
of absorbing knowledge without sitting

338
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,470
in a classroom and listening to some

339
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,210
teacher drone on about crap I didn't

340
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,860
care about I feel like learning through

341
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,930
podcasts and things like that were a

342
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,550
great option and an opportunity for a

343
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:28,859
person with a brain like mine who is

344
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:30,990
always inquisitive but doesn't have any

345
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,419
desire to sit in a classroom and be

346
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,159
still and listen to a lecture and I

347
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:37,379
think that also makes me understand how

348
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,000
to teach people in a different way I

349
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:40,500
don't teach in a traditional way because

350
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,110
I don't learn in a traditional way so

351
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,240
since I've got some weird a DD or

352
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,279
boredom or whatever I feel like I can

353
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,350
keep people's attention who also suffer

354
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,059
from the ad D or the boredom I can get

355
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,769
you learning I can suck you in and you

356
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,149
don't get bored listening to the girl

357
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,009
essence and then you're able to absorb

358
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:57,600
the knowledge you'll laugh a few times

359
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:00,299
and at the end it doesn't feel like you

360
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,240
were just beat up by some lecturer so

361
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:05,789
super Shaw after a long ramble thank you

362
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,950
for a great iTunes review and also thank

363
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:10,799
you for noticing my passion for cannabis

364
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,540
and also my passion for teaching I feel

365
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,359
like it's partly my duty to teach people

366
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:16,769
about cannabis I was blessed to absorb a

367
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,259
lot of knowledge about the cannabis

368
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:21,179
plant very quickly at a young age I was

369
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,189
also very blessed to be involved in the

370
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:26,069
cannabis industry as it bloomed around

371
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:28,440
me I feel like it is my job and part of

372
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,720
my karma to go and teach as much as I

373
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,610
can about this plant and to shine as

374
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,769
much positive light on this plant as I

375
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,200
can so it does mean a lot to me when

376
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,909
people notice my passion and my desire

377
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,100
to teach and might drive behind this

378
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:42,839
plant so extra thanks for noticing that

379
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,149
dude that means a lot to me alright

380
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,990
