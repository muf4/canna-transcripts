flushing for sure all right let's put

62
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:26,120
this trainwreck of a podcast back up to

63
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,680
was really two minutes and 30 seconds in

64
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,360
we're already rambling ladies gentlemen

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,310
this is part 2 of an episode that we did

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,040
a few actually recorded like an hour ago

67
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,599
you heard it a few days ago the there

68
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,009
was an email and it started off with

69
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,229
questions for Mike and then there was a

70
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:41,659
part two that had questions about going

71
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:43,129
from a basement grow into a large

72
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:44,210
facility so let me catch you up on the

73
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,009
email I'll read it all the way from the

74
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,510
beginning it says hey what's up Rasta

75
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,399
Jeff huge fan of the podcast as I've

76
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:51,469
said before I had a few questions I

77
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,789
thought could be a podcast I'm in

78
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:54,859
Michigan we just passed three bills

79
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:57,319
pushing us into a seed to sale system

80
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,030
based on Colorado system I was wondering

81
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,859
if you would white Mike could touch on

82
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,229
the subject like how do I go about

83
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,120
finding out information from the city

84
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:07,609
about how many license facilities they

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,950
will allow that part we handled on the

86
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,410
last episode I hope you listen to it if

87
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:14,419
not press pause go back listen to number

88
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:16,400
158 and check it out then come back and

89
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:17,659
see us so the second part of the

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,689
question what we're going to address

91
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:22,280
today he says what is the biggest hurdle

92
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:24,349
going from a basement grow to a

93
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,509
warehouse I know you've recently made

94
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,759
the switch from soil to cocoa any advice

95
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:31,250
on that transition then he also says I'm

96
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,929
planning on using veg bloom I'm already

97
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,479
in the basement but do you add anything

98
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,980
else to their line as well what are some

99
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,409
things you didn't expect going to a

100
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:40,909
large-scale and any other advice you

101
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,430
think one would need to know about

102
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:45,049
taking the leap into the big leagues and

103
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,239
he says thanks for such a great podcast

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,040
I'm gonna get into the question it goes

121
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,259
if I didn't say thanks again for the

122
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,510
killer question yes they think the app

123
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,709
is a great question we've we've gotten

124
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:26,240
old we're gonna get two hours worth of

125
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,849
content out of this question he

126
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,370
ah where is it what is the biggest

127
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,229
hurdle going from a basement grow to a

128
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,910
warehouse there are a lot of things to

129
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:37,399
think about there one of the biggest

130
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:41,060
things that I noticed was different was

131
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:43,068
the airflow a large building the air

132
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,720
doesn't feel like it does in a small

133
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:46,069
room you can change the air out in a

134
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,590
small bedroom in a matter of minutes

135
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:49,970
with a small blower a large room you're

136
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,739
gonna have hotspots you're gonna have

137
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,389
cool spots you're gonna find humid spots

138
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,129
you're gonna need to learn how to

139
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:57,319
control that temperature and the

140
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:59,689
humidity all throughout a large room

141
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,780
it's the the scale of the increase is

142
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:04,610
where every time you've got many legal

143
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:07,239
retailers and production facilities are

144
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:10,189
still problems shooting their their

145
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,710
multi-million dollar grows because the

146
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:15,348
difference in scope from a basement grow

147
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:18,469
or a smaller grow to a huge warehouse is

148
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:20,029
monumental a good reliable HVAC company

149
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,349
in Colorado that will come work on a

150
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:23,538
grow and knows what they're doing

151
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:24,978
we'll make you wait three months just to

152
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:26,598
come give you an estimate because they

153
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:30,348
are so backed up with cannabis growers

154
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:32,418
right now if if I had enough money to do

155
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:35,689
anything I wanted cannabis business wise

156
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:38,269
I would build from the ground up because

157
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:41,329
I've seen what so many companies have

158
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:45,019
had to go through attempting to improve

159
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:47,990
an existing structure to where it's not

160
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:49,549
giving them problems so many people that

161
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,389
I mean they thought they had everything

162
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,639
under control

163
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:55,908
and then as the season started to change

164
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,639
one whole wall was the temperature

165
00:05:55,908 --> 00:06:01,788
change in that wall was causing major

166
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,139
problems and it grow I mean that's not a

167
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:05,899
unique problem that happened to a lot of

168
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,968
people if you're one wall you're

169
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,918
whichever whichever side gets the most

170
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:11,418
Sun or the least Sun it just kind of

171
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,639
depends on your environment when the

172
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:15,408
seasons change in Colorado but you'll

173
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,908
usually see in a grow that you've never

174
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,259
been in before you have to find out

175
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:20,089
where the powdery mildew is going to

176
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,408
happen when the first winter comes you

177
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,209
just got to find out where it's gonna

178
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:24,408
happen because it probably will if you

179
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,658
if you haven't designed your room

180
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:28,129
flawlessly you're on one wall

181
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:29,990
you're probably gonna give you in an

182
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,788
exterior wall you're gonna get powdery

183
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,939
mildew that are one the seasons you and

184
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:36,659
I can problem shoe a basement grow or a

185
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:41,250
bedroom grow in like 20 minutes

186
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:43,380
in our to I mean in by troubleshoot I

187
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,420
mean like find the problems and suggest

188
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,069
easy ways to fix them I can walk in a

189
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,170
home like a basement growing point out

190
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,790
ten things in ten seconds we can improve

191
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,680
your grow and make it button ocean you

192
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:56,010
know where house grow part of its just

193
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,439
put in the time right to get through the

194
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,659
cycle where you're huge means of heating

195
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,850
and cooling a lot of people don't aim

196
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,080
for enough cooling they don't think

197
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,430
they're gonna need enough cooling and

198
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,870
then they put plenty of cooling or they

199
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,000
don't think about enough airflow you

200
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,209
have to evacuate humidity out of there

201
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,360
so that's got more on AC units than they

202
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:17,579
did on building building no I know that

203
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,560
place yeah I know I know where yeah I

204
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,389
know that place it's not one outfit in

205
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,889
Colorado I'm sure that's true for a half

206
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,439
dozen or more I just happen to know the

207
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:27,360
one so the airflow is gonna be a huge

208
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,829
thing also you're gonna be feeding on a

209
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,449
much larger scale or you're gonna build

210
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:32,609
a drip system are you gonna be watering

211
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:34,079
by hand every time you run that drip

212
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,340
system you're creating more humidity in

213
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,659
the room that you're gonna have to deal

214
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,339
with every time you water my hand

215
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,750
there's gonna be more humidity do you

216
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,219
have a drain do you have a floor dream

217
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,629
that's something I would definitely look

218
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,960
for if you're moving into a new building

219
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:47,009
a floor drain treating water is a huge

220
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,019
deal

221
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,509
treating water you're gonna have if

222
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,709
you're moving into a warehouse at the if

223
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:54,149
the green and healthy warehouse we used

224
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,699
to add a thousand gallons of water every

225
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:58,589
other day ish you're gonna need to treat

226
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,899
that somehow I would recommend a really

227
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:02,399
nice reverse osmosis machine because

228
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:04,079
something I noticed was we were using

229
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,859
the water they came from the meters have

230
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:10,109
more buckets and boulders oh my god it's

231
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,050
the scale is what we're getting at here

232
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:17,939
guys is when you're talking about a

233
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:19,740
basement grow you're talking about one

234
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,779
employee you're talking about a thousand

235
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,910
dollars worth of equipment the little

236
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,459
warehouse you multiply those numbers by

237
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,840
a hundred right well we were using what

238
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,699
let me get back into smart we were using

239
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,709
the municipal water from Colorado

240
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,379
Springs and as the temperature would

241
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:34,769
change this smell of the water would

242
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,629
change

243
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:38,218
I could smell chlorine in it on some

244
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:41,099
days I could smell other things on some

245
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:43,080
days and I would do a simple pH test and

246
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,670
on some days the pH would be seven some

247
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,040
days it would be nine and it would just

248
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:49,019
be days apart from that and then I would

249
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,699
do ppm tests and sometime

250
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,500
be really high sometimes it would be

251
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,170
really really low and we're feeding

252
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,360
cocoa where our plants are in cocoa so

253
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:59,549
it was really hard to predict what water

254
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
you're gonna get tomorrow or the next

255
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:03,629
day or the next day so an RO machine

256
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,649
would really be really helpful in a

257
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:06,120
large grow that's something I would

258
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,740
highly recommend is you're gonna need

259
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,529
clean water you're gonna need a lot of

260
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,940
it have more RO water than you think

261
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:15,350
you're going to need available because

262
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,160
if you get too much he's anywhere

263
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,170
guaranteed there's stuff in your

264
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,000
municipal water that you do not want to

265
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:23,490
feed to your plants through your

266
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,669
watering system bugs if you get a

267
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,840
problem like bugs or powdery mildew

268
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:29,339
you're going to have a larger problem

269
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,170
than you have ever thought of having

270
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,580
because hopefully you're running a

271
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:34,199
perpetual grow if you've got a large

272
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,210
system and you're gonna have plants that

273
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,490
are in full flower at the end of flower

274
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,650
if you can't treat those for bugs so be

275
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:43,440
highly prepared for pests and pathogens

276
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:46,049
and powdery mildew be on the lookout be

277
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,400
ahead of that don't bring anybody into

278
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:50,699
that grow unless it is absolutely

279
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,409
necessary it's you have to get clones

280
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,240
from somewhere but when clones come in

281
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:55,769
quarantine them treat the [ __ ] out of

282
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,389
them almost kill them you're treating

283
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,529
them so hard for pests and mold because

284
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,379
you don't want to bring any of that

285
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:04,379
stuff in I know a lot of facilities that

286
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:06,899
have just they've given up trying to

287
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:09,029
treat clones and their seed only now Wow

288
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,889
I know a few outfits that have just

289
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:13,049
given up entirely and I know a lot of

290
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:14,789
home growers that are that that's been

291
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:18,209
their policies since the last time they

292
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:21,319
got a gift clone scheduling and getting

293
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:24,180
everything on track in a big grow is a

294
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,030
challenge in the beginning unless you're

295
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:28,500
a guy like myself that is kind of OCD so

296
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:30,500
you're gonna need to get a good schedule

297
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,700
happening you're going to need to get

298
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,110
veg plants then you're going to need

299
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,550
flowering plants then you're going to

300
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,139
need clones and you're gonna need to

301
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:38,459
keep in mind that these flowering plants

302
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:40,949
are going to be done in this amount of

303
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,930
time and I need this many veg plants to

304
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,030
replace them immediately because you do

305
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:47,459
not want downtime and that's gonna kind

306
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:50,100
of segue me into something that I can

307
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,110
really rant about personally the hugest

308
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,570
caveat of going from the basement to a

309
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,610
wire house grow is often the

310
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,950
relationship between the money person

311
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,200
and the actual grower or their so

312
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,730
oftentimes there's a middleman you're

313
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,170
going to have an investor

314
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,399
an owner and you're gonna have a grower

315
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:08,429
I'm not sure which position you're

316
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,198
planning on taking please get all of

317
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:12,088
those people on the same page because I

318
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:14,969
see a lot of grows fail because an

319
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:18,839
investor throws down money and he wants

320
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,490
money back in [ __ ] 60 days because

321
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,430
you're growing weed where's my money and

322
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,198
then you've got an owner that's rubbing

323
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:27,269
his balls to keep him off you for a

324
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:29,549
little while and he's like give me 120

325
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,198
days and so now the owner will say how

326
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:32,789
long do you need to grow this crop and I

327
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:35,789
know that the crops that I'm trying to

328
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:37,948
grow take me I'm gonna say 150 days this

329
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:39,838
is hypothetical I need 150 days to make

330
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:41,159
this crop happen the owner of that

331
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,350
facility is gonna look you dead in the

332
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,059
face and go cool I'll see you in 120

333
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,050
days and it should be done and now

334
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,059
you're saying to yourself these are

335
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:49,828
[ __ ] plants I can't cut 30 days off

336
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,719
of this cycle there's no way it's gonna

337
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:53,789
happen so you've got an owner bitching

338
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,440
or investor bitching in an owner and

339
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:57,539
owner Yellin or to grow or a grower that

340
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,829
wants to do the absolute best he can for

341
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,019
these plants because that's where the

342
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:02,578
passion is but the owners got to make

343
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,539
money he's got to return the investment

344
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:06,689
and then you've got an investor that

345
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:08,399
only cares about the money so the

346
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,500
hardest part of a commercial grow is

347
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,568
getting all of your people on the same

348
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,059
page you need your owner your investor

349
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:16,409
your master grower then you need whoever

350
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,059
else you've got in there if you've got

351
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,809
somebody working the bedroom and the

352
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:21,088
flower room

353
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:22,948
those two people need to have a meeting

354
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:25,680
every couple of days if you've got a

355
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:27,750
trim crew your master grower and your

356
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,759
assistant grower and your trim crew

357
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,440
leader all need to communicate you need

358
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,568
to know what plants are coming down you

359
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,980
need to know how long you have to trim

360
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:37,019
this until there's more plants so that

361
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,519
you can schedule for the trimmers to be

362
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,159
there those are some of the things that

363
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,448
you may overlook it's just so the scale

364
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,689
and the scope are so much more

365
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:48,059
complicated than a basement grow I mean

366
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,529
with a basement grow you're getting

367
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,448
ready to harvest you check out your

368
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:53,939
plants every day every couple of you

369
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:55,769
know days for a week when they get to

370
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,079
where you want them you just start

371
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:00,060
harvesting maybe you call a buddy if you

372
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,009
maybe make a little plan and have two

373
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:03,989
friends coming over when you're talking

374
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:05,818
about an industrial scale you're talking

375
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:10,769
about like 15 or 20 people that need to

376
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:14,399
be scheduled paid w-2 trained I believe

377
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,990
two or three people could run one or two

378
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,409
people can run a hundred like gross of

379
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,948
fish

380
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:21,480
ah two people pissed right but when it

381
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:22,889
comes time to trim then you need a small

382
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,329
trim crew you need five or six people

383
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:26,669
that's when you need that trim crew

384
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:28,948
manager maybe that assistant grower now

385
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:29,969
becomes also the trim crew manager but

386
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:32,490
you're gonna need somebody that can

387
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,379
delegate somebody that can man you need

388
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,850
a director that can direct the facility

389
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:37,470
that can direct the employees that knows

390
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,569
about the plants that knows about people

391
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,160
that know and then you need like I said

392
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,719
in the last episode a lawyer and an

393
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,429
accountant those are some things that

394
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,259
you're definitely gonna need in a larger

395
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:48,239
grow that you didn't think as much about

396
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:52,139
in the other grow also

397
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,990
[ __ ] goes wrong everyday in a large

398
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,419
scale grow well in a lot of times

399
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:00,060
investors don't necessarily know any of

400
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:02,088
that which is where a lot of headaches

401
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,469
and a lot of partnerships break up is

402
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,509
the money man doesn't know anything

403
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:10,110
about marijuana and so they doesn't

404
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:11,699
realize that something so simple is when

405
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,528
we were doing trimmer interviews we

406
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:17,818
walked a dude through the grow and we

407
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:20,549
think he gave us trips and that's why

408
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:24,269
this crop is a third smaller than it

409
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:25,979
should be ah like there's there's stuff

410
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:28,169
that comes up because you're dealing

411
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,949
with plant growth and you're dealing

412
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:34,649
with a live plant and a medium where

413
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:39,120
mistakes can mean millions in lost

414
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:40,889
revenue or delays this we really can't

415
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,828
get it out of enough the scope is so

416
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:45,568
much different the attitude and the

417
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:48,479
skill sets are different

418
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:52,169
one of the biggest traits for a basement

419
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,009
grower is secrecy the ability to hide

420
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:58,318
and stay hidden that keeps people with

421
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:00,649
shotguns away from your door whether

422
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:02,879
they be law enforcement or rippers

423
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:05,519
that's one of the biggest skill sets you

424
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,948
can have as a basement grower as a legal

425
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,438
marijuana business owner you need to be

426
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:12,240
very out front loud and proud about what

427
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:15,629
you do how you do it and the fact that

428
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,549
you love to follow the rules I love to

429
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:19,139
follow the rules and I make sure all of

430
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:21,269
my employees love to follow the rules

431
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,860
needs to become your mantra and you need

432
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:24,778
to get used to sitting in front of TV

433
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,610
cameras especially if you want to be one

434
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:27,580
of the first marijuana business owners

435
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,289
in your area

436
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,300
in Colorado we have somebody that's

437
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:33,459
known as a compliance officer and his

438
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:34,990
only job is to make sure that you're

439
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,420
following all of the rules he gets

440
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,980
emails from here we have the meed the

441
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:40,839
marijuana Enforcement Division he gets

442
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,399
emails from them every day saying that

443
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,830
you know that this is a new rule this is

444
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,289
a new rule and it's his job to go

445
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,150
whether it's the retail or the grow or

446
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:50,529
the extraction facility it's his job to

447
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,600
get the employees together and say this

448
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:55,419
is the rule and he has to oversee that

449
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,920
that happens the rule changes like that

450
00:15:55,419 --> 00:16:01,000
a frequent here in Colorado and until

451
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,849
nationwide we really good legalization

452
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,899
handed out or hammered out it they'll be

453
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:10,330
common in your area too so uh yeah be

454
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:13,240
ready so I did in the past I'm sure that

455
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,950
we did an entire episode on going from a

456
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,850
basement grow to a large-scale grow and

457
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,220
pretty sure that we did an entire

458
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,870
episode on that I will leave that in the

459
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,610
show notes there will be a link to that

460
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,240
in the show notes or if you go to the

461
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,669
website

462
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,570
I read genetics Colorado comm and scroll

463
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:27,610
through the shows I'm sure you'll be

464
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,170
able to find it on there I cannot recall

465
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,759
the episode number right now and I do

466
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:33,250
not want to scroll through old episodes

467
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,200
while we're recording so look for that

468
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,059
it's a whole episode about moving from a

469
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,400
basement grow to a large-scale grow one

470
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:41,289
of the the things that we haven't really

471
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,000
hit that you have available now that

472
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:46,120
wasn't available to us when we started

473
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,379
this is you you can come to Colorado now

474
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,179
and hire a consultant or go visit a

475
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:56,799
couple of legal businesses and see how

476
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:58,569
they do it and get an idea of what's

477
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,419
gonna be required of you and where you

478
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:05,559
want to go and I know a number of people

479
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:07,180
out here in Colorado have been hired to

480
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,769
travel out to other states and help

481
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,900
people navigate some of the things like

482
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:12,490
planning out where house grows I mean

483
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,160
just the logistics that go into these

484
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,430
things will blow your mind the amount of

485
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,100
cooling that's required for a one-story

486
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,860
warehouse grow is typically greater than

487
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:26,049
like a 30 story office building I mean

488
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,849
the amount of equipment that's necessary

489
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:31,210
is just insane learning how to maintain

490
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,500
all that equipment like we're talking

491
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,440
about pot growers they know how to grow

492
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,690
pot the amount of information that needs

493
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,610
to be learned and adapted to his money

494
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,140
man that's something that's something

495
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:42,699
that I quickly learned is I'm not

496
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,100
just a pot grower anymore I learned how

497
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,480
to build drip systems with PVC I learned

498
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,889
how to work on pumps I learned how to

499
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,900
work on air conditioning I learned how

500
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,280
to work on the humidifiers now I know

501
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,810
how to work on the security camera

502
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,730
system now I know how to build [ __ ] that

503
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:56,230
I never thought I would it and it's just

504
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,759
all because I went and helped with a

505
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,579
giant commercial facility and I learned

506
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,440
a ton of things well no and it's you you

507
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,579
need such a varied skill set because

508
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,559
little things that don't have anything

509
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:09,220
to do with growing marijuana can affect

510
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:11,950
your legal ability to do so if you see a

511
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,980
camera down and they grow and you ignore

512
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,960
it you might get hit with a compliance

513
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:22,269
violation because that camera was down

514
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:24,519
for an extra half day and have your

515
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:26,079
business shut down quickly that quickly

516
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:28,000
all right so he's got more parts of this

517
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,589
question I don't want to harp on the one

518
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,049
part for too long cuz the last episode

519
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:34,659
got long that way that I just say harp

520
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:36,309
on it jeez how old am I getting so he

521
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,500
also said I know you've recently made

522
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:40,599
the switch from soil to cocoa any advice

523
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,339
on that transition

524
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,169
he also says I'm planning on running veg

525
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:45,459
bloom and I am already in a basement but

526
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:49,570
do you add anything else to the veg

527
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,819
bloom wine as well um so that's kind of

528
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:53,589
a multi-part question there I've made

529
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:56,379
the switch from soil to cocoa any advice

530
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:58,179
on that transition yes I use an easy

531
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,740
cloner and I take my clones from the

532
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,049
easy corner and I put them into Solo

533
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,339
cups the Solo cups have got holes in the

534
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:04,809
bottom of them so that they can drain

535
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:06,730
plenty of water in the water doesn't get

536
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:09,669
stuck in there I usually fill the cups

537
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,549
with a aerated soil something like Fox

538
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,380
farms either ocean forest or the happy

539
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,730
frog and I put the clones into there and

540
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,880
then I water them with my desired

541
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,950
nutrient solution I did so this time but

542
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,980
I used cocoa instead of the aerated soil

543
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,720
and 50% of my clones died they [ __ ]

544
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,029
hated going into cocoa they were not

545
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,980
happy about that the cocoa seems to have

546
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:31,569
compressed and smothered them they did

547
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,750
not get a chance to get their legs and

548
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:36,159
they got crushed and killed so my

549
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,450
thought on that is put your clones into

550
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,519
soil if that's what you're doing because

551
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,049
they did not like the cocoa go into cups

552
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,700
of dirt put those cups of dirt into the

553
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,319
cocoa in the future that's what I have

554
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,500
learned because my plants were really

555
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,689
really pain you can go dirt clones to to

556
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,859
cocoa plants easy enough oh yeah they

557
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,090
just drive right in there they love it

558
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,319
just gonna give a don't mind in the

559
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,359
transition once those

560
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,970
strengthen up a bit right yeah well I

561
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,398
know all the the weight of the water in

562
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,899
that Coco compressed the Coco real tight

563
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:03,879
yes new roots and they've just got

564
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:06,398
crushed in there so that's one thing

565
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,460
that I learned also you can water a

566
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:10,808
whole heck of a lot more more you can

567
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,038
feed more frequently is what I think I'm

568
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:13,778
trying to say I'm sorry you can't water

569
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:16,058
a lot more you can feed a heck of a lot

570
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:19,028
more when I was running soil I would

571
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:20,980
feed maybe twice twice a week now every

572
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:23,740
time I am watering the plants they are

573
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,839
getting nutrients okay so let three

574
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,950
maybe four times a week these plants are

575
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,388
getting nutrients and they don't show

576
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,940
any signs of burn and they are growing

577
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:33,158
vigorously at the coco not holding your

578
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,769
newts as well right the Coco it doesn't

579
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,778
hold on at all the nutrients just yeah

580
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:39,220
so then you don't get as much burn and

581
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,929
you can feed more frequently it'll eat

582
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,620
what it wants better for your plants but

583
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:45,820
not your wallet well maybe in the end it

584
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,898
will pay for it I'm thinking if it's

585
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,189
gonna eat that much there's gonna be

586
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:49,388
that much more weight that'll make up

587
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,460
for it which isn't a bad thing

588
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:53,769
time to do some math something I'm

589
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,870
thinking I don't know if I'm convinced

590
00:20:53,769 --> 00:21:00,480
on a hundred percent Coco I may start

591
00:20:55,869 --> 00:21:03,038
doing a 50 percent soilless mix like a

592
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,990
honestly not an expensive soil something

593
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,759
like roots organic or maybe even two per

594
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,038
or the Fox Farm ocean forest wouldn't

595
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,769
hurt my feelings a 50 percent mix with

596
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,648
the soilless mix and Coco put the cocoa

597
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:15,788
in there I know a couple of people that

598
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:17,408
started doing that a while ago and they

599
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:19,388
all seem to rave about it yeah I think

600
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:22,210
I'm gonna try that next

601
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:23,709
that's next I'm gonna run I'll run one

602
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,269
light with the cocoa one light with the

603
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,850
soil and then one light with the cocoa

604
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:29,230
soil mix and we'll see what happens so

605
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:32,678
that's that's something I feel about the

606
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,870
the soil too cocoa switch and also I've

607
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:36,759
noticed if I overwater they take really

608
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:39,250
long to dry out and the plants will kind

609
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,480
of slow down I thought that I could yeah

610
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,829
I thought I could water the [ __ ] at home

611
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,058
with the cocoa but I've noticed that I

612
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:44,678
want some aeration in there if I

613
00:21:43,058 --> 00:21:46,960
overwater them they really started to

614
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:49,298
get really like that aeration they do

615
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,100
they like air I've noticed that right

616
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:52,628
when they start to dry out is when they

617
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:54,250
really take off with the most explosive

618
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:56,619
growth so they're getting kind of dry

619
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:00,148
I've only ever seen one good aeroponic

620
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:02,229
system in motion and I was blown away

621
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:04,628
with this dudes timelines

622
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,000
the next part of his question he said

623
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:08,649
I'm planning on running veg blue

624
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,769
and then he said do you add anything

625
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:13,419
else to their line as well yes actually

626
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:15,519
I've got a screenshot here of a

627
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:18,250
conversation I had with a rep from veg

628
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,009
bloom and he says this is what we are

629
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:25,480
recommended to use he said four to five

630
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:28,569
grams of base nutrient per gallon in veg

631
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,730
five grams per gallon and flour so

632
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:32,829
you've got your base nutrient it's

633
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,240
probably the HD or the RO or the dirty

634
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:35,589
whichever one they selected for you

635
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,269
hopefully you had a consultation with

636
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:38,678
them and had your water checked out is

637
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,839
if you get your water tested send them

638
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,700
water test results they will recommend a

639
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:44,980
base nutrient for you but four to 5

640
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,110
grams of base per veg R per gallon and

641
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,110
veg five grams per gallon in your

642
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:53,109
flowering stage Benny says 1/2 of gram

643
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:54,639
per gallon of plus life once a week and

644
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:57,548
that's their routing inoculate the plus

645
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,490
life I really like that stuff half a

646
00:22:57,548 --> 00:23:02,558
gram per gallon of plus life once a week

647
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,470
through veg and flour and then taper

648
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,970
that off in late flour so like around

649
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,110
week four or five you can start pulling

650
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,220
that back and then he says shine

651
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:16,000
starting in week 3 so at the beginning

652
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,640
of week three add shine put one gram a 1

653
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,400
to 2 grams per gallon of water is what

654
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,070
he says the shine starting in week 3 one

655
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,750
gram to 2 grams per gallon of water and

656
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,579
then you can kind of increase that a

657
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,529
little bit as time goes on from what

658
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:31,599
I've seen so week 3 do a gram to two

659
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:33,490
week four increase it a little bit week

660
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,928
five increase it a little bit six and

661
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,849
seven increase it a little bit and then

662
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:39,429
start flushing from there and then he

663
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:41,769
says push foliar feed every five to six

664
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:44,980
days honestly I would cut out the push

665
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:46,658
foliar feed maybe spray it one time at

666
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,640
the beginning of week five and then pull

667
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:52,390
off of that and he says the push foliar

668
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,429
to spur a 50 milliliters per gallon of

669
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,440
water so maybe if you've got a small

670
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:59,169
crop just makes up a half gallon and put

671
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,029
25 mils in there I also think that

672
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:02,500
pa-ching that water before you spray it

673
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:04,000
may help you but be careful what you use

674
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,230
to pH because you don't want to go

675
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
killing off the live there's so silic

676
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,710
acid there's calcium and there's seek

677
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,710
help in there so be careful what you're

678
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:18,279
using to adjust the pH also you asked if

679
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,028
I add anything to that mix yes I put a

680
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:21,648
little bit of oh so 28 in there I like

681
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:24,169
some potassium silicates to the mix I

682
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:25,728
think that is the plants more vigor it

683
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:29,119
makes them a little bit more robust and

684
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:31,399
then once about every once a week once

685
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:33,918
every 10 days ish I'll hit them with

686
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:36,108
either hybrid or carbo load just to

687
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,028
speed up some carbohydrates in there put

688
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:40,308
a little bit of a boost in there so

689
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:42,259
that's when I add to the veg blue mix

690
00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:44,778
it's not too expensive that way and it

691
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:46,190
is highly efficient it'll put some shine

692
00:24:44,778 --> 00:24:47,329
on your plants it'll make them beefy

693
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,298
they'll taste good they'll be high in

694
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:52,128
THC you will have quality flowers so

695
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:53,778
that's what I add to the veg bloom you

696
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:56,449
also said you're already there in a

697
00:24:53,778 --> 00:24:58,489
basement what else well what are some

698
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:03,739
things you didn't expect going into such

699
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:06,229
a large scale honestly be the demand I

700
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:08,028
was expected to put out a specific

701
00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:10,038
amount of cannabis and a specific amount

702
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:11,598
of time and I didn't know that there

703
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:13,460
would be obstacles I didn't expect there

704
00:25:11,598 --> 00:25:15,618
to be a problem every day when you walk

705
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,879
into a large commercial grow when I

706
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:18,108
would train new people we trained a few

707
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:19,338
new guys and they said so what's the

708
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,749
first thing we do when we get in here

709
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:21,499
because I like to you know everyone's

710
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:22,759
like excitingly

711
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:25,038
the first thing we got to do is find

712
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:26,868
what [ __ ] up last night and I was like

713
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,898
what and I was like there's so many so

714
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:32,058
many moving parts something in here just

715
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:34,368
broke and it's funny that's the size and

716
00:25:32,058 --> 00:25:38,210
scope thing I was hitting at earlier

717
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:40,488
it's in any grow you need to keep an eye

718
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,129
on the moving parts your timers your

719
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:45,558
plugs your palms your hoses connections

720
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:47,868
all of it the bigger you grow the more

721
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:51,019
those equipment checks eat up in your

722
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:53,238
time when you're talking about a hundred

723
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:56,329
light or a five hundred light massive

724
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:58,069
warehouse checking to make sure none of

725
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:59,838
your drip system plugs have come loose

726
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:02,210
and you're spraying water towards your

727
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:05,358
ballast wall like it takes half the day

728
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,219
sometimes I spent honestly the first

729
00:26:05,358 --> 00:26:08,718
half of my shift when I would walk into

730
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:10,879
the growth in the first hour would just

731
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:12,528
be making sure that none of the cloners

732
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:13,759
are clogged know that the no the

733
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:15,229
sprinkler system is clogged

734
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:16,669
none of the pumps are clogged none of

735
00:26:15,229 --> 00:26:18,649
the breakers have flipped all of the

736
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:20,450
fans are on their wood all of the

737
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:22,158
humidifiers are running and none of the

738
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,899
filters were clogged up I would

739
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,389
seriously spend an hour checking all of

740
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:28,278
that equipment just like that I got a

741
00:26:26,388 --> 00:26:30,528
text message back from a buddy of mine

742
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:32,058
maybe a month ago that read can't talk

743
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:34,019
have to lie stick come on this morning

744
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:36,119
ouch and it was just that

745
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:37,769
two-sentence way to let me know he can't

746
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:39,538
talk right now and he's gonna be busy

747
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:40,048
all goddamn until he figures this [ __ ]

748
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:42,269
out

749
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:44,460
I yeah I mean that's a game-changer

750
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:45,720
that's your you've got a half million

751
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,850
dollars and the fires getting closer

752
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,190
it's really uh it's really neat in our

753
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:53,158
industry we run multimillion-dollar grow

754
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,558
facilities that are responsible for I'm

755
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,149
not bragging on Facebook by the owner of

756
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:58,769
the facility I was growing for posted

757
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:01,589
one time that I pulled three hundred and

758
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:03,319
twenty something and a fraction pounds

759
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:06,178
of cannabis from eighty five lights

760
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:09,240
which is three point something sounds

761
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:10,169
pearl-white more the hell I was headed

762
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,319
with what was I saying

763
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:14,700
just so there's that much product being

764
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,369
grown three hundred and something pounds

765
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,630
at somewhere between eighteen and twenty

766
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,739
two hundred dollars a pound proximately

767
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,320
two thousand dollars a pound

768
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,659
I had three hundred of them times two

769
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,939
thousand dollars I produced that uh and

770
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:29,429
we rely on like ten and twelve dollar

771
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,778
timers they could [ __ ] everything I find

772
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:32,250
it really funny that we've got like this

773
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:34,288
eight dollar timer from Lowe's that

774
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,089
makes all of this get fed if that one

775
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:39,288
timer [ __ ] up the whole facility does

776
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:41,639
not get water for a day in a basement

777
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:46,490
your your timer screws up you don't

778
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:49,610
notice it for three days one growers out

779
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:52,259
you know six thousand eight thousand

780
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:55,048
depending on how bad the problem got

781
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:58,109
before it got found same thing happens

782
00:27:55,048 --> 00:28:00,839
in an industrial grow someone's out

783
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,199
several million in everybody getting

784
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,639
fired

785
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,798
yeah there's a whole dispensary that now

786
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,950
has to go buy retail weed well no and

787
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,690
take this a step further there's 365

788
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,159
days in the year and a shitload of her

789
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,919
[ __ ] holidays you want to be with your

790
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,528
home with your family um somebody's got

791
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,370
to be at the grow every day to make sure

792
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:21,990
all your lights went off when I started

793
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:23,489
a great healthy wellness monster

794
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,839
spraying everywhere and I'm no longer

795
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,339
there I don't know if everybody listen

796
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,359
to every episode but I no longer work at

797
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:28,678
Green and healthy wellness I'm not

798
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,479
involved in a large-scale production

799
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,460
facility at this time I'm pursuing my

800
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,659
own endeavors right now but when I was

801
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,679
in green and healthy wellness for the

802
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:41,039
first crop I did not take a day off for

803
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,750
the first harvest was we were in flower

804
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,460
for nine or ten weeks there were some

805
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,619
strains the lemon Jie went for eleven

806
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,399
weeks and then there was a little bit of

807
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:52,378
veg time before

808
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:55,348
that I did not take a day off for 79 or

809
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:55,798
80 four-ish days because somebody had to

810
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:59,009
be there

811
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:02,690
so that's that I did not expect but it

812
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:04,919
was willing to do you can't be even

813
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,450
tangentially involved with the legal

814
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,059
industry before the lazy stoner

815
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,460
stereotype evaporates yeah I mean the

816
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:12,808
amount of work put in the industrial

817
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,848
grows like the legal industry in

818
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:17,249
Colorado Colorado we did a billion in

819
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:22,319
sales last year we're gonna do like 1.2

820
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:25,710
this year maybe more the amount of days

821
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:28,528
like 12 15 hour days that people around

822
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,659
the state put in to make that true is

823
00:29:28,528 --> 00:29:34,409
just astronomical can I spend a billion

824
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:38,219
dollars buy a country and people are

825
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:40,109
running showers on hash okay you could

826
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:41,489
do this for minutes on drum gear can I

827
00:29:40,108 --> 00:29:43,588
come to that party yeah I imagine the

828
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:49,829
drum kit I build oh man I can't decide

829
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:53,278
which color oh okay but just when you

830
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:56,158
when you make that step from from gray

831
00:29:53,278 --> 00:30:00,269
market or the basement up into the legal

832
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:03,509
industry everything changes in ways that

833
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:05,368
you can't predict or imagine in I mean

834
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:07,169
you guys listen to this lucky you know

835
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:07,769
this going in we learned this [ __ ] the

836
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:09,479
hard way

837
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:11,429
something I gotta jump in and talk about

838
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:14,278
it had something I did not expect that

839
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:16,409
was overwhelming uh harvesting drying

840
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:19,048
and curing it's not [ __ ] prepared for

841
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:20,999
that you need space for however much

842
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:22,528
blood you've got growing you need that

843
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:24,149
much room for hanging buds

844
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:25,499
basically yeah because you can't just

845
00:30:24,148 --> 00:30:27,959
crush it all together because it's gonna

846
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:29,608
get funky you need I've seen people I'm

847
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,899
in controlled room for drying and curing

848
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:32,968
that much herb that is something I

849
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:34,319
totally did not plan properly for when I

850
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:35,719
was a green and healthy wellness I've

851
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,569
seen people try to put a

852
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:42,269
football-field-sized grow room into a

853
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:43,618
bathroom sighs drying area it's like

854
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:45,538
dude you're not gonna do it there's no

855
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:46,918
way right that air is gonna get stuck in

856
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:48,148
there all the humidity is stuck in there

857
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,889
it's not gonna go anywhere you need

858
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:51,808
somewhere for the freshly cut buds to be

859
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:54,118
for the older buds to be if you need a

860
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:56,308
drying and curing hanging trimming

861
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:58,168
system that is sufficient for your space

862
00:30:56,308 --> 00:31:00,450
so do you make sure you work on that the

863
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:01,110
amount of like when you're doing any

864
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,650
size

865
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:08,939
the best thing you can do to ensure

866
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:10,590
success is to plan upfront and when

867
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,039
you're talking about the size and scope

868
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:16,829
and the legal industry that's

869
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,079
astronomically important I've seen

870
00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:22,109
little little oversights lead to

871
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:26,539
multi-million dollar fuck-ups and

872
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:30,389
businesses collapsing I mean just silly

873
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:32,220
stupid decisions or little things that

874
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:35,009
people overlook the cooling thing I've

875
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,529
seen multi-million dollar grows sit idle

876
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:41,099
half the year because the there isn't

877
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:42,750
physically enough cooling on site to run

878
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,359
during the hottest months of the year

879
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,819
and the business just needs to make

880
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,799
another 300 grand before they can buy an

881
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,990
air conditioner big enough to cool their

882
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,089
home and it's like having a dope like a

883
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,980
Ferrari or a rocket or a Tesla but

884
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:57,959
missing parts you just got it where I've

885
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,660
seen other gross just say [ __ ] it and

886
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,400
grow when it's way too hot and put out a

887
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,080
super Airy product and then they just

888
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,640
have it all blasted in ash I'm so

889
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,470
excited that the winter is coming we get

890
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,970
free air cooling just filter that air

891
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,319
that comes in you guys you know you

892
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,850
don't want to bring it you don't wanna

893
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,919
bring in ice crystals and fungus from

894
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:16,289
outside but filter that air the

895
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,880
temperature swing in the the giant

896
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:20,000
concrete wall that you didn't think

897
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,470
about once while you were planning

898
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,359
causing massive powdery mildew and mold

899
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,220
growth because of the temperature swing

900
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,199
I mean how many people didn't see that

901
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,180
coming in their original plans right and

902
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,130
what are you gonna how do you heat a cut

903
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,840
a foot and a half thick concrete move

904
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,940
the one house that had a basement with

905
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,559
one concrete exterior wall and the first

906
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,960
time that I grew in that basement in the

907
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:41,879
winter guess what white rhino plant like

908
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,529
a 5-ounce plant it looked like a frosted

909
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,690
Christmas tree it got all funked up with

910
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:49,139
powdery mildew and went bye-bye I I

911
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:50,850
watched another guy his what he thought

912
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,450
were the best plants in the harvest when

913
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:55,859
we finally got back to him the section

914
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:59,130
of wall that they were up against was

915
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:01,049
ice-cold oh yeah and they were I mean it

916
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:04,410
was the craziest look in pink mold I've

917
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:05,609
ever seen but I mean just found us it

918
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,980
was because of the temperature swing

919
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:10,469
when you multiply that I mean that was

920
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,839
like maybe a $400 loss to that grower

921
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,640
but if that wasn't an industrial setting

922
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,679
would be for 2,000 yeah it would

923
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,790
going right down that row all right so

924
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,350
those are a lot of things that you can

925
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:22,230
look out for and you can expect

926
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:24,359
he also said any other advice you could

927
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:26,779
you may think one would need knowing

928
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,459
about taking a leap into the big leagues

929
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:31,109
keep a positive attitude shit's gonna

930
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,069
happen like I said every day you're

931
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,839
gonna walk into that ground you're gonna

932
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:35,279
find some [ __ ] and you can either

933
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,419
freak out you can throw your arms up in

934
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,889
the air and you can be like ah what the

935
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,180
[ __ ] happened in here and you could kick

936
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,950
some buckets and you can throw some [ __ ]

937
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,360
around and make more of a mess or you

938
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,120
can go get the [ __ ] mop you can mop

939
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,339
it up figure out where that pump broke

940
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,750
could go get some PVC pipe and a saw and

941
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:50,250
fix all that [ __ ] that you got to fix

942
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,349
and just put some glue on it and hope it

943
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,089
doesn't break again because you still

944
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:56,189
got work to do plants need to be grown

945
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:57,689
shits gonna keep going so that's what I

946
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:01,080
could say keep a positive attitude keep

947
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,920
your head up also pay attention make

948
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,169
sure you're getting paid what you

949
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,200
deserve to be paid and if there's some

950
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:08,849
[ __ ] in the grow that can be done today

951
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,720
do it don't wait until tomorrow just

952
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:11,610
[ __ ] do it

953
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,428
never in the grow I mean little things

954
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:16,320
that you can get away with it home I

955
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,898
mean sometimes four weeks at a time you

956
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,000
can get away with at home do not fly in

957
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:24,719
an industrial setting there's just so

958
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,130
much less room for error and things are

959
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,539
gonna stack up you're gonna think I've

960
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,610
got eight hours worth of work to do

961
