00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,560
for a long time I feel like we've

119
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,799
covered a lot of business here at the

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,280
top of today's podcast we are going to

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,600
skip the pet peeve section because I

122
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,799
want to make sure to cover a few grow

123
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,039
questions in today's episode earlier I

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,720
mentioned my website IR genetics.com at

125
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:49,680
the top of that website there is a tab

126
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,320
that says grow help if you click on that

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,800
grow help tab that gives you the

128
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,839
opportunity to tell us a few things

129
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,400
about your grow we ask questions like

130
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,959
what strain are you growing are you

131
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:01,439
growing indoors or Outdoors are you

132
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,599
using HPS or metal highlight light we

133
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,120
ask a few basic questions to give me an

134
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
idea of how to answer the question that

135
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,639
you're going to ask then at the bottom

136
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,360
we give you plenty of opportunity to

137
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,439
type in great detail about the issue

138
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,600
that is happening in your grow room if

139
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,399
you send a question to that growel Tab

140
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,600
and I do read your question here on the

141
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,038
podcast I will send you a coupon code

142
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,439
for a free pack of seeds off of edirect

143
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,000
decom today's first question came from a

144
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,240
person who wants to be called D Rod guy

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,918
I think that's how you say that that's

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,319
how I'm going to say it uh we're just

147
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,599
going to call you D for now so I don't

148
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,800
so I don't have to keep saying your name

149
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,039
wrong big shout out to my new friend D

150
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,800
D's question goes a little bit like this

151
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,360
it says yo Rasta Jeff I love your

152
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,919
content well that's a great way to start

153
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,120

154
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,478

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,600
both ways thank you bro it says I am

156
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,079

158

careful out there in prohibition Landon

159
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:58,240
the person that wrote this is a

160
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,359
hypothetical character does not really

161
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,879
exist I don't even exist my name is not

162
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,000
rosta Jeff so this is all fictional uh

163
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,639
this is just hypothetical it goes on it

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,360
says uh maybe possibly hypothetically I

165
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,120
currently am growing in a small portion

166
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,720
of a closet so I have used one and two

167
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,800
gallon pots that makes sense you got the

168
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,759
small space so you'd run smaller pots

169
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,520
that's a good logical decision there

170
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,199
then here is where we come to a great

171
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:25,318
question it says by limiting the size of

172
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,919
the plant am I also limiting the potency

173
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,319
I must say that the flower I've gotten

174
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,359
so far has been pretty good but not

175
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,240
great do I have to let her grow to her

176
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,720
full potential uh that's a really good

177
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,519
question so if you're running in a small

178
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,440
space you've got small pots you're going

179
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,038
to grow smaller plants are those plants

180
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,800
going to reach their full potential um

181
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,719
or are you limiting yourself on potency

182
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,439
was the main part of the question here I

183
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,240
really don't think so I think that as

184
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,598
long as you let that plant finish its

185
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,199
full flowering cycle uh those hormones

186
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:56,759
and that triome development is what you

187
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,120
are going for so I really don't think

188
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,879
you are uh limiting yourself by running

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,800
small plants honestly I don't think so

190
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,720
my first question though is are you

191
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,520
running from seed or are you going from

192
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,039
clones uh that may make a difference

193
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,519
those clones are technically the age of

194
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,959
whichever plant they were cut from so I

195
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,639
know that that blows some people's minds

196
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,359
when I say that let's think about that

197
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,120
for a minute you've got a mother plant

198
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,598
that is we'll say 3 months old right

199
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,639
it's this tall it's three months old

200
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,319
it's got some Bush to it you cut clones

201
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,000
from it those clones are the age of that

202
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,199
plant they're 3 months old when you cut

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,439
them so when 3 months that clone is

204
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,680
technically a six-month old plant in all

205
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,918
technicality I know that sounds wild so

206
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,598
uh perhaps those smaller plants even if

207
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,918
the hormones and the uh and everything

208
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,878
wasn't developed properly in your

209
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,959
smaller plants if you're running from a

210
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,080
clone it technically already is all

211
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,000
there it's the age of that original

212
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,240
plant like I've been talking about so if

213
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,598
you're running clones it definitely

214
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,158
shouldn't be an issue at all seeds as

215
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,560
long as you veg them up for a couple

216
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:56,879
weeks two or three weeks and then flip

217
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,519
it sounds like you got plenty of time to

218
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,319
do that uh they should uh be fully

219
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,959
developed and give you a great outcome

220
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,240
um as long as you let them flower long

221
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,079
enough that may be something that you're

222
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,280
missing and it sounds like you're also

223
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,758
kind of if you're running in a small

224
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,000
tight space like this you might be a new

225
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,120
grower don't expect that first crop to

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
be amazing and impressive that's that's

227
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,478
the one you learned on uh figure out

228
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,360
what you don't like about it figure out

229
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,158
how to improve on that and then work

230
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,680
from there and make it better next time

231
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:25,399
what's going on in the room how is the

232
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,918
VPD how's the circulation uh how is the

233
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,560
light quality the light quality is going

234
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,598
to have a lot to do with it you can't

235
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,839
put a really power light in that small

236
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,120
space but put as much light as you

237
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,279
possibly can in there the most efficient

238
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,639
the proper Spectrum get a good light in

239
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,679
there uh how's the air that's the VPD

240
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,439
basically uh how's your feeding what are

241
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,799
you feeding how often did you feed how

242
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
was the ph and the EC of each feeding

243
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,240
did you make every feeding and every

244
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,279
watering to that plant count was it all

245
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,839
strategery or was it just done kind of

246
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,120
willy-nilly that'll make a difference in

247
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,360
your next grow did you take a lot of

248
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,839
notes uh do you know what you did last

249
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,680
time so that you can look back and say

250
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,200
this seems to have worked this right

251
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,359
here was an experiment might have thrown

252
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,200
me off we can do that better maybe take

253
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,320
notes on uh future grows um my next

254
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,519
notes to myself are I run small plants a

255
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,040
lot when I'm doing new projects when I

256
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,399
so let's just say I just bred a bunch of

257
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,360
new seeds and I want to see what those

258
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,480
seeds have created I'll run a bunch of

259
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,919
tiny plants just so I could see what

260
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
they look like instead of growing them

261
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,958
big and tall and wasting time I'll run

262
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,360
them real small and I've come out with

263
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,239
really satisfactory uh results from just

264
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,200
little tiny plants uh there may have

265
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,759
only been just a couple of blunts or a

266
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,000
few fat joints or something to smoke out

267
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,919
of that excuse me for the throat

268
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,720
clearing by the way I'm just trying to

269
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,879
keep moving uh keep my train of thought

270
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,360
here uh there may have been little

271
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,919
plants to gave me just a few bong rips

272
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,079
or a couple of fat joints to smoke but

273
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,919
we definitely enjoyed uh every rip and

274
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:46,078
every puff of that and it was quality it

275
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,679
was potent it tasted good and I feel

276
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:48,919
like it did come to its uh full

277
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,599
potential even though it was a little

278
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:53,039
tiny plant um and those smaller plants

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,278
the advantage of those smaller plants of

280
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,360
course you've got to do small plants

281
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:58,320
you're in a small space but smaller

282
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,360
plants is less time for potential

283
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,079
problems uh just think about anything if

284
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,759
you're doing anything for less time

285
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,159
you've got less potential for things to

286
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,000
go long or to go wrong so if you're just

287
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,879
running vegging for three weeks a little

288
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,078
tiny plant while I'm over here vegging

289
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,958
for eight weeks I got five more weeks or

290
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,679
for spidermites to sneak in for powdery

291
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,679
mildew to pop up something like that to

292
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,958
happen you're you're harvested five

293
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,120
weeks ahead of me before I've even

294
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,319
thought of harvesting because I'm still

295
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,959
vegging so um yeah you're going to get

296
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
more crops per year with that short veg

297
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,838
time with small plants and you may run

298
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,360
into smaller problems the only thing it

299
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,320
sounds like you need to work on is

300
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,839
diagnose the problems which are not uh

301
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,680
which are making your cannabis not meet

302
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,639
your expectations and then improve from

303
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,519
there uh my friend D thank you for the

304
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,919
great question I do appreciate this make

seeds on IR direct.com all right this

308
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,879
next question that popped up is a

309
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,039
breeding question this one came from

310
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,360
somebody that we are going to call NBC

311
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,919
you know who you are NBC uh make sure

312
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,120
you check your email because you've got

313
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,399
a coupon code for a free pack of seeds

314
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,799
from iir

315
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,720
the message goes hey rosta Jeff I love

316
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,199
your podcast specifically the ones that

317
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,440
feature breeding information well here

318
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,759
you here you go because you've got a

319
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,399
good breeding question and thank you for

320
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,519
listening to the show I do love your

321
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,360
support as well it says I have a

322
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,759
question about breeding specifically

323
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,480
since I know that you do this for a

324
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,278
living I figure you would be the best

325
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,600
person to ask uh bro I do do it for a

326
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,838
living but before that I do it for

327
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,278
sanity I do it out of passion I do it

328
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,240
because I am uh strongly compelled to do

329
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:32,639
so even if you's stopped buying the

330
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,200
seeds if nobody followed me on social

331
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,720
media if the world went blackout and

332
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,600
everybody disappeared and all I had was

333
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
a grow light and some seeds I would

334
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,800
still grow and breed this would all

335
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,639
still happen so I do do it for a living

336
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,879
but I also do it uh just out of

337
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,399
necessity uh or I might blow up if I

338
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,639
didn't breed and smoke a bunch of good

339
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,440
ganja and uh produce and create good

340
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,480
seeds I have something I might just

341
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,600
spontaneously combust anyway but thank

342
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,480
you for noticing and here we go it says

343
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,320
I'll start I will be starting a breeding

344
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,000
project very soon soon and I want to

345
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,959
know if it is better to have the male

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,839
grow directly next to the female and

347
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:09,159
create seeds the oldfashioned way or is

348
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,079
it just as viable to gather the pollen

349
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:13,480
store it and then pollinate the females

350
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,120
later on down the line have you noticed

351
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,519
to reduce seed numbers or lack of

352
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,240
viability from storing then pollinating

353
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,278
or is it same same all right this is a

354
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,039
very good question and I understand this

355
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:26,958
very strongly uh perfect timing equals

356
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,919
more seeds uh that's the first thing

357
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,599
that I wrote so the more uh the better

358
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,278
you time it the more seeds you will

359
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,639
produce and um I would recommend just

360
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,439
getting the pollen straight from the

361
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,480
plant onto the females because uh

362
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,240
Gathering it storing it that reduces

363
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,519
viability Maybe by a small percent but

364
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,039
why would you can just get it straight

365
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,278
from the plant onto the other plants

366
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,919
without storing it if that is possible

367
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,759
that's what I would recommend but it is

368
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,198
all about the timing as the main

369
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,838
ingredient here um let me get more in

370
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:57,319
detail about the timing um if you put

371
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,240
the boy and the girl in the room at the

372
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,320
same time just a mail plant and if

373
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,440
female plant and don't do anything they

374
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,639
will make seeds just the timing of

375
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,519
nature the timing of these plants uh one

376
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,519
may be a longer flower plant one may be

377
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,679
shorter but it will work out there will

378
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,159
be viable pistols when pollen is

379
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,799
available that will happen but sometimes

380
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,799
if you put certain plants in ahead of

381
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,198
time uh then put the male in or put the

382
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,000
male in and put the females in at

383
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:25,559
certain times then you will achieve much

384
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
higher seed production now the examples

385
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,679
that I always use in this situation uh

386
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,600
two plants that I breed with quite often

387
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,439
are the Platinum Tangi plant the

388
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,639
Platinum Tangi plant is the mom to the

389
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,760
sunkiss the mom to the orange gasm uh

390
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,000
the mom to uh the uh Tangi Ripper and

391
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,838
then on the other side we've got the

392
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,198
Strawberry Fields plant that is the mom

393
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,320
to Strawberry Starburst uh the red pill

394
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:48,639
uh what else have we done with that

395
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,040
there's a bunch of stuff that came from

396
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,600
that one anyway let's stay focused so

397
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,879
that sunkiss plant prefers to receive

398
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,120
pollen between days 21 and

399
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,240
26ish like I'm saying is I've done it

400
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,039
indoors Outdoors there's a window there

401
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,959
but that's about a week that 21 to 26

402
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:08,039
day window there is when that orange

403
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:10,078
gasm or the uh sunkiss plant the

404
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:11,198
Platinum Tangi wants that pollen the

405
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,159
most I know I said a bunch of different

406
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,319
strains and my brain skips when we think

407
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,639
about strains Platinum Tangi is a strain

408
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,240
so that Platinum Tangi wants the pollen

409
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,480
around day 21 to 26 but the Strawberry

410
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,278
Fields plant that one wants its pollen

411
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,120
around day 28 to day 35ish so if I put

412
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,679
the mail in the room and let everybody

413
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,639
go at the same time I will get a minimal

414
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:34,359
amount of seeds from both of them

415
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,399
however if I put that Strawberry Fields

416
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,399
plant in the room a week ahead get it

417
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,159
pollinating put that Platinum Tangi

418
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,480
plant in the room a week later get or

419
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,439
not pollinating get it growing get it

420
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,079
flowering get a bunch of pistols on it

421
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,680
then if I bring in that male when he's

422
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,559
already got a bunch of pollen on him and

423
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,958
Shake him that's what I'm going to get

424
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,319
the maximum amount of seeds the other

425
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,000
option of course is to collect that

426
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,839
pollen bring it and then shake that bag

427
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,120
of pollen but like I said a moment ago I

428
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,120
do I have I will store pollen but I get

429
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,519
better results from not storing it

430
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,159
because coming straight from the plant

431
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,320
you don't lose anything uh there's no uh

432
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,919
static electricity doesn't kill anything

433
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,278
the cold the change the environment

434
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,559
stresses uh nothing kills any of that

435
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,639
pollen it's still 100% viable as it

436
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,559
comes off of the plant so that's the way

437
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,759
I would recommend doing it another thing

438
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,278
I'm going to touch on I don't know if

439
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,000
this is even yeah it is I wrote this on

440
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,399
my notes I just thought of this while I

441
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,480
was rambling one thing I've noticed and

442
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,440
this may just be no I've noticed this

443
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,920
I've seen this this is not this may Bro

444
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,360
Science cuz I don't have a lab coat but

445
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:35,439
I've seen this when I've got a male

446
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,800
plant and a female plant in the same

447
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,399
area maybe not even in the same room but

448
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,679
a room apart from each other I feel like

449
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,559
the girl plants get a little bit

450
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,879
stickier they get a little bit more

451
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,599
pistols I don't know if that mail plant

452
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,240
is putting off some sort of pheromone or

453
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,759
if he's saying hey ladies I'm over here

454
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,919
and I'm going to get in that room and

455
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,919
just a few days and I'mma Let It Go but

456
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:58,439
I feel like all the ladies in the room

457
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,278
they're they're getting hornier they're

458
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,519
expressing that they want pollination

459
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:04,519
more they get more pistols the pistols

460
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,440
just get more robust they do it a bit

461
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,919
little bit more quickly and they seem

462
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,800
like they want that pollen it's like

463
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:13,000
they know and that may sound crazy to

464
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,519
some people but if I've got a male plant

465
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,039
on this side of the door and a female

466
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,078
plant on this side of the door those

467
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:19,599
girls get more pistols it's like they're

468
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,039
they're just smelling each other I don't

469
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,440
know if the male makes more pollen

470
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,958
that's a good I just thought of that one

471
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,240
I was like well does the opposite happen

472
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,039
I don't know I've never paid attention

473
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,079
to that I'm going to have to do that

474
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,639
experiment you guys I want feedback back

475
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:32,679
in the comments we are on YouTube We're

476
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,600
on Spotify we're all over the place go

477
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:35,958
to YouTube would be your best bet go to

478
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,000
YouTube leave me some comments right

479
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,799
down below let me know if you agree or

480
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,759
disagree that having plants of the

481
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,838
opposite sex in separate rooms but not

482
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,959
able to contact each other does that

483
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,240
make them hornier do the females get

484
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,278
stickier do the guys get more pollen do

485
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,039
they build bigger loads uh let me know

486
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:53,919
what you think in the comments argue

487
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:56,278
right down there my favorite comment

488
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,919
will win a prize so that should help out

489
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,159
a little bit um so the main question is

490
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,278
is it better to store the pollen and

491
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,558
then pollinate them later or to have the

492
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:06,880
male just dust them I prefer to do the

493
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,160
mail just dusting them uh that but

494
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,640
that's if you want the whole freaking

495
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,798
room pollinated also because that's

496
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,919
going to go crazy that pollen will fly

497
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:16,720
everywhere it will be a Dusty mess and

498
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,000
every uh every pistol in the room every

499
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,959
Brack in the room will be seated so be

500
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,199
careful if that's what you're doing if

501
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,078
you want to just dust a few branches uh

502
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,919
Dustin area then of course get that bag

503
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,399
of pollen get that vial get out your

504
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,360
Q-tip your paintbrush however you want

505
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,000
to do it then paint up a few branches

506
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,159
that way but uh the way that I do it um

507
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,558
I put that dude in another room I get

508
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,360
him flowering uh I flower out the girls

509
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,240
at their specific times in their room

510
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,119
then I drag the boy into the room give

511
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,759
him a good shake at the right time then

512
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,839
here's a free tip excuse me for clearing

513
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,798
the throat so much not even going to

514
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:51,359
edit this episode uh live to drive is

515
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,879
what we're calling it but after I do

516
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,399
that pollination I wait uh five seven

517
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,039
maybe 10 more days just keep an eye on

518
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,400
that dude uh and then you'll see that

519
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,240
there's more pollen it's building up

520
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,679
it's starting to to fall again at that

521
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,880
point give them a good shake or cut the

522
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,480
top off even and go smack the lights and

523
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,720
let that pollen rain down onto your

524
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,400
plants or even take tops that have male

525
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,558
flowers on it with pollen and just rub

526
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,919
them all over the girl plants maximum

527
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,639
pollination all right I feel like I have

528
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,559
answered this question and then some uh

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,000

534
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:33,319
pack of seeds at iy

535
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:35,158

coupon codes for those free seeds let me

537
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,760
throw out a little reminder a little

538
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,279
update something that I was thinking

539
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,359
about here that uh probably should have

540
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,558
gone at the start of the show but I

541
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,759
didn't write it down I just thought

542
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:45,879
about it these coupon codes they do come

543
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,720
with expiration dates somebody asked if

544
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,159
they have to use that uh that coupon

545
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,798
code by that expiration date yes um

546
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,440
unfortunately I can't make those coupon

547
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,359
codes last forever uh because they do

548
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,759
they're in my computer system it's it's

549
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,759
technical issues technically and uh

550
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:02,759
budgeting and finances and things like

551
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:04,440
that but anyway I cannot extend or

552
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,839
change the expiration dates of those

553
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,400
coupon codes once they are issued so yes

554
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:11,480
please do use those uh quickly before

555
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,000
they do expire and if you uh missed it

556
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,519
send me a message I will help you out

557
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,960
this is the last disclaimer for that the

558
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,400
last chance for that but there is an

559
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,720
expiration date and that is real I can't

560
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,480
change that can't fix it um I just can't

561
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,279
have free seeds floating forever I just

562
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,159
can't that's hard to do um

563
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,599
accountability accounting wise so

564
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,159
they've got to have a uh expiration date

565
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,119
all right that's enough rambling let's

566
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,320
move on I've got one more great question

567
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,319
here this one also came from the growel

568
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:40,720
tab at I genetics.com this one came from

569
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:43,079
our new friend Tom nice to meet you Tom

570
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,000
Tom is quick and to the point it says

571
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:47,759
when picking a breeding project should

572
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,079
you top your male plants uh it's an

573
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,359
early shower I'm just pollinating her

574
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,879
sisters uh it's an F2 now so by doing

575
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,119
this would it become an

576
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,120
F3 um so there's a couple things here to

577
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,158
talk about should you top your m plants

578
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,119
I don't top my males uh I like him just

579
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,039
to make that big giant donkey dick

580
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,798
pollen sack up there just all that

581
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,558
pollen on that one giant top that's what

582
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,359
I prefer I don't top the males um it's

583
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:13,639
an early shower you're pollinating its

584
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,279
sister so you're saying by saying sister

585
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,679
did that come from the same batch of

586
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,839
seeds like there was a boy it pollinated

587
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,320
a girl that girl made seeds you grew

588
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,038
those seeds one's a boy one's a girl uh

589
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,279
that would equal boy brother and sister

590
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:28,640
to me and you said those are f2s by

591
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:30,519
doing this does it become an F3 abs

592
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,480
absolutely yes it does you've been

593

00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,079
top the male plants no I do not Top Male

598

599
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,639
then uh pollinating sisters to make F3

600

00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,799
um tell them how and why and show them

650
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,278
what it would look like uh teach them

651
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,000
that it's not a crime teach them that

652
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:35,519
we're not criminals teach them that we

653
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,839
smoke and we're peaceful and it actually

654
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,480
helps a lot of us in a medical way uh

655
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,558
teach them the business aspect of how

656
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,400
cannabis can be uh beneficial to the

657
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:46,480
entire nation to the entire Island um

658
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,759
anyway I I wish people in Australia

659
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,440
could have some legal cannabis and

660
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,879
anyway there's a person out there that's

661
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,038
listening that just needed that little

662
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,240
kick go do it bro go do it um what if

663
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:58,000
you were the person that could spark

664
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,440
legal cannabis in the whole nation of

665
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,960
Australia and get everybody smoking

666
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,558
wouldn't that be awesome all right

667
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,079
that's enough of a pep talk there is a

668
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:07,678
question it says story leading to a

669
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,278
question I like that that gives me some

670
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,120
clarity it says I had four plants in my

671
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:13,640
grow one of those intersects I already

672
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,678
know what you're going to say and

673
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,799
produced a small amount of flowers on

674
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,759
the lowers when I noticed I pulled it

675
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:22,759
out of the tent but the others got

676
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:25,759
pollinated and they are seated now here

677
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:27,319
comes the question my question is will

678
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,558
the seeds from the other plants have

679
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:33,000
interex issue or will there be some

680
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,038
feminized or regular seeds all right

681
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,240
this is a good common question this is

682
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,119
also one of my pet peeves so let's touch

683
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,240
on this one our friend is growing plants

684
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,199
one of those plants went intersects and

685
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,599
I love that you use the word intersects

686
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,319
on here that is the correct word um

687
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,959
thank you because the word her me is a

688
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,000
pet peeve Herm is cool her me bothers me

689
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,558
don't even know why bro so interx was

690
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,960
absolutely the correct word here this

691
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,319
plant through male and female parts

692
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,798
those male parts have now pollinated

693
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:03,519
other females in the room and the

694
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,558
question is what about these seeds are

695
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:08,519
they regular are they feminized are they

696
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:10,879
more Herms the answer is they are not

697
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:13,400
feminized seeds this is not how fem

698
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,919
seeds are made they will not be fem I

699
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,278
think about it this way we know that 50%

700
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,000
of that breeding project has intersex

701
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:21,839
traits in it we' have now bred it to

702
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,798
another plant that means that at least

703
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,678
50% of the breeding has got intersect

704
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,398
potential in that plant in that line of

705
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,000
seeds so they could be intersects they

706
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:33,359
could be good seeds they could grow some

707
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,720
amazing magic they could be awesome but

708
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,519
also they could be straight up

709
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,600
intersects or they could be weird

710
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,720
mutants but they are not feminized seeds

711
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,798
to be completely clear they are not

712
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,480
considered feminized what was done to

713
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:47,440
make them feminized to ensure that they

714
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,079
are female nothing and that's what we

715
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,200
call a feminize seed is a seed that has

716
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,278
been uh produced in a proper way that we

717
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,360
know and can guarantee that it's female

718
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,480
it's a long process there's work to it

719
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,319
that was not done so these are interex

720
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,159
bag seed that could be anything you can

721
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,278
grow these I recommend you grow them you

722
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,720
may find uh you may find the next hot

723
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:08,159
fire you could have the next chem dog

724
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,440
the next Girl Scout cookies in there or

725
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,480
you could have a bunch of interex trash

726
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,480
in there uh grow them see what you've

727
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,440
got don't give them away don't sell them

728
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,159
don't share them uh just grow them
