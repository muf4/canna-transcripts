www.opm.gov/openseason 420 so don't miss

8
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:32,160
that it has become a tradition that we

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,109
start this podcast off by talking about

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,509
what I am smoking today

11
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:39,059
I've been dabbing on lemon G batter from

12
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:42,178
apothecary farms the label says this has

13
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,828
68 point five percent THC and seventy

14
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,079
nine point one percent total

15
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,640
cannabinoids I'm cracking it open now so

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,719
I can get a fresh smell to give you an

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,268
accurate description

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,969
at first waft as I wave the container

19
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:56,429
past my nose it is oranges lemons and

20
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,230
candy it is really pungent on the lemon

21
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,179
side the candy comes in there there's a

22
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,858
hint of oranges in the background then

23
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,560
as the container gets closer to my face

24
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,140
it brings out a garlic and onion and

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,650
armpit sort of a thing this may sound

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,730
crazy but it is deliciously disgusting

27
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,920
it is something you put in front of your

28
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,020
nose and you go ooh that is grow away

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,240
bring that back oh that's so gross let

30
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:20,789
me smell that again ooh I like that it's

31
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,039
really really delicious ly disgusting I

32
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,500
can't stop dabbing it I really love it

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,540
the high from this stuff is obviously

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,579
tremendous because I can't quit talking

35
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,440
or talking about the concentrate itself

36
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,629
it feels like it goes straight to my

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,640
head it feels like I kind of have maybe

38
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:37,469
like a little bit of pressure right

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,329
above my eyebrows kind of squeezing in

40
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:40,650
on my temples a little bit it's got me

41
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,149
kind of in the zone it's got a little

42
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,520
bit of tunnel vision going on to it it

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,350
is obviously great podcasting

44
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,420
concentrate because I cannot stop

45
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:51,449
talking ladies and gentlemen boys and

46
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,480

47
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,180

48
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,460

deep into the show I like it when

00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,879
somebody discovers us and they go deep

109
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:13,548
and start listening to all of the old

110
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,769
episodes it's a little embarrassing

111
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,090
honestly but it is a time capsule and

112
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,769
I'm proud of it so I'm glad you were

113
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,179
listening to the old stuff and I love

114
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,319
that you are finding knowledge and that

115
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,579
you are appreciating it so you're

116
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,009
already pushing all the right buttons

117
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,990
this is a great message it continues to

118
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:28,668
say there's some

119
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,720
for everyone from the newbie all the way

120
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,668
to the ones that think they know

121
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,460
everything already and that is the goal

122
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:36,379
so thank you for noticing also the

123
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:38,329
quality is top-notch which is always

124
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,098

125
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:42,469
knowledge hey thanks a lot for that that

126
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:44,689
is a great way to start an email there

127
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,130
is more it goes on to say I also had a

128
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:48,740
question that I wanted to ask a

129
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:50,509
real-deal grower not a grower that is

130
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,189
about passing on bad or misguided

131
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:54,080
knowledge hey I appreciate that you know

132
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:55,728
I am all about doing a little bit of

133
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,019
research and not trying to pass on

134
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,848
[ __ ] knowledge because that

135
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:00,318
frustrates the crap out of me if you

136
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:02,120
listened to the last episode we had to

137
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,830
correct a couple of errors or

138
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,360
misinformation that people were given

139
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:06,800
and that is kind of what I'm here for I

140
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,479
want to spread the truth I don't to

141
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,129
encourage everybody to be positive about

142
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,139
cannabis so thanks for noticing that

143
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,149
there's more to that he says since you

144
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,310
always say to shoot you any questions I

145
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:18,439
do I encourage all of the questions it

146
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,550
creates amazing content for listeners I

147
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,259

151
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:28,908
there are probably 20 other people out

152
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:30,949
there that have this same question so

153
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:32,990
I'm helping you and hopefully a lot of

154
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,158

I am super rambley from those lemon Jie

157
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,788
dads let's try to keep me focused here

158
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:42,859
we go here is the question so I grow in

159
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:45,680
cocoa with an auto feed system I like it

160
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,030
so far I'm in a 4x4 tent under a 1,000

161
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,038
watt light you are cranking that light

162
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:51,168
that is pretty intense in there usually

163
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,538
I'd start my plants under a small t5

164
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:56,359
until they can take the 1k metal halide

165
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:58,129
dim down to 500 Watts then when they are

166
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,319
a couple of weeks away from flower I up

167
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:01,848
the power to 750 to give them a boost of

168
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,280
growth and to get them used to the

169
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:06,560
increased intensity so far that sounds

170
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,629
right this time when they are under the

171
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,639
750 one plant seems like she just

172
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:13,069
doesn't like the increased intensity at

173
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,560
all she droops really badly after about

174
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:17,270
10 to 12 hours should I not flower her

175
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,009
and just get rid of her I'd like to

176
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:21,649
flower very soon and this has been going

177
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:24,139
on for a week or longer I feel like she

178
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:26,239
might just be a weak seed and she's also

179
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,699
considerably smaller than all of the

180
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,650
other girls of the same age sorry for

181
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,598
the long winded email I do hope to hear

182
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:35,538
back from you from a fellow grower

183
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:36,829
signed Mitch alright let's talk about

184
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:38,689
this one a little bit there's something

185
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,589
that stood out to me these are from seed

186
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,509
you've got one runt that is not

187
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:44,099
forming up to speed I'm going to guess

188
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:45,899
that is probably you may be right that

189
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,450
is probably just a run it is probably

190
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:51,269
just not the most vigorous seedling ever

191
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,889
that does happen so you've got your runt

192
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:54,839
plant that is the main start of this

193
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,339
problem I think then when you ramped up

194
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,779
your lighting like you normally do which

195
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:59,399
is correct you shouldn't start those

196
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,539
small plants under that super intense

197
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,949
light because that will kind of roast

198
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,780
them that will overcharge them you don't

199
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:05,370
need that it's also I excessive and

200
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,569
expensive so you start them with a low

201
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,189
light you work your way up no when you

202
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:10,469
worked your way up you noticed that this

203
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:12,240
plant did not seem to like the increased

204
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,800
intensity so there are a couple of

205
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,780
things making that happen she's small

206
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,949
she didn't grow to the size of the other

207
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,389
plants I don't have a size comparison

208
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,279
because I don't have any pictures in

209
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:21,959
front of me here but I'm going to assume

210
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,469
that that plant is small enough to where

211
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,329
the light that it is receiving is far

212
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,800
more than it needs because it is smaller

213
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:30,419
than the rest of those plants who are

214
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,569
large enough to receive and

215
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,550
photosynthesize that much light so that

216
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:37,439
light is probably getting too much light

217
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,120
it is reaching it's a daily light

218
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,219
integral it's getting as much light as

219
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,509
it needs and it's saying I'm done and

220
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,130
it's just kind of shutting itself down

221
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,379
and it's taking a little break and

222
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:48,300
that's basically because you've got a

223
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,889
tiny plant that's getting a lot of light

224
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,449
and it's getting all the light that it

225
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,889
needs so it's just like hey I'm done

226
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,779
I've gotten what I need I'm gonna

227
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,189
basically if it were an animal it would

228
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,629
walk away from the food bowl and it

229
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:59,009
would go lay down somewhere and that's

230
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:00,449
what your plant is doing it's had enough

231
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:02,730
light it's gonna go take a little break

232
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,469
if it had one it would walk up to a

233
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,030
hammock smoke a joint and chill out for

234
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,880
a little while ooh that's weird would a

235
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:11,279
would it smoke a joint is that that's a

236
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,899
whole nother podcast is that cannibalism

237
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,919
if a cannabis plant rolls up the joint

238
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,569
and smokes it to relax that's

239
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,129
cannibalism right that's weird

240
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:18,629
anyway let's get back on track here I

241
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,230
told you guys that lemon G dab really

242
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,300
got to me

243
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,040
so my first suspicion is that that

244
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,900
seedling that grew smaller was just a

245
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,550
run maybe something happened to it and

246
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,109
it's very early stages of life that

247
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,300
stunted its growth but you got a run

248
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,550
somehow it was either a runt by genetics

249
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,620
or it was damaged early on it is a run

250
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,939
then you put it in the room with the

251
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,769
other plants and tried to increase the

252
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,780
white intensity and it was not prepared

253
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:42,149
for that so it is reacting to that it

254
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,230
will probably continue to grow slowly it

255
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:45,870
will never catch up with those other

256
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,909
plants your next question is should I

257
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,279
not flower this one and just get rid of

258
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:51,870
it I don't know what your garden looks

259
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,250
like I don't know what your space looks

260
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,480
like I don't know what the rest of the

261
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,549
plants look like I don't know

262
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,649
what your canopy looks like if you can

263
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:01,439
call that plant and still have a full

264
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:04,350
canopy and produce your expected harvest

265
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,810
your expected yield if you can meet your

266
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,310
medicine demands by calling that one

267
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:09,689
plant and still having the appropriate

268
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:11,399
sized harvest if you can meet your

269
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,050
whatever production needs that you have

270
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,578
set for yourself your production goals

271
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,649
if you can reach those by calling that

272
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:18,599
plant by all means get rid of it if that

273
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:20,820
one plant is going to make or break you

274
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,259
keep it maybe keep it off to the side

275
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
forever since it's already a runt

276
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:25,470
it'll just be off to the side it'll be

277
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,389
that plant in the corner feed it the

278
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,949
last of the nutrients water everything

279
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:30,750
else and give that one the crap at the

280
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:32,278
end it may not be the best plant but it

281
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,169
is another plant it's a little bit more

282
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,759
product a lot of people are making

283
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:37,169
concentrates anyway so if it's not the

284
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,039
prettiest the tightest buds you can

285
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:39,629
still squish it

286
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,948
you can still extract it you can still

287
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:43,470
do whatever you're going to do with it

288
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:45,569
if that plant is the one that is going

289
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,639
to put you over your numbers get rid of

290
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,100
it if you're in any illegal State and

291
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,259
that plant is not up to the performance

292
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,670
level of the rest of your plants get rid

293
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,259
of it but if you've got time and space

294
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:57,599
for that plant keep it around let it try

295
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,909
if you are in a tight space in a tight

296
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,199
position she needs to go that is where

297
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:03,269
you need to make a judgment call my

298
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:04,948
friend if your canopy is spool and the

299
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,690
rest of the plants look great get rid of

300
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:08,669
it if that one's not gonna reach the top

301
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,079
if you've got to lift it up on two or

302
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:11,429
three pots to make it taller and it's

303
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,799
gonna be a pain in the ass and cause you

304
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:15,929
problems and frustrate you get rid of it

305
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,879
try to look forward to about week four

306
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:19,948
or five and see if that plant is going

307
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,838
to be more frustration or if it's gonna

308
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:23,429
be more pleasure if it's gonna just piss

309
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,779
you off and that's the one plant in the

310
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:26,399
room that's causing all the problems

311
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:28,439
get rid of it we don't need that kind of

312
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,089
stuff around in the grow I don't know

313
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,010
your situation so it's kind of hard to

314
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,420
say I would probably just toss it I

315
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,948
don't need something that grows poorly

316
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:36,689
like that I would just get rid of it

317
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,799
when you're growing from seed and you've

318
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,300
got a little one like that you're

319
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,429
generally doing a Fino hunt so you

320
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,379
should expect some males and you should

321
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:45,299
expect some runts and some [ __ ] this

322
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,889
is your runty [ __ ] get rid of it you

323
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,539
already planned for this hopefully

324
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:49,139
that's what I would do I don't know your

325
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:51,088

00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:22,259
hey that is my exact goal I'm trying to

341
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:23,548
what do they say you give a man a joint

342

00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,438
stoned for the rest of your lives so

345
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:29,909
that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying

346
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,168
to keep the whole crews stone and now

347
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:32,548
that's your job dude now that you're

348
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:34,918
learning how to do it you've dedicated

349
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:36,480
yourself it's time to step up anyway I'm

350
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:38,338
glad that I've got you going for a long

351
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,199
time the message continues to say I

352
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,790
started listening to your podcast around

353
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:44,248
the time that grow compilations were

354
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:46,528
released I am now starting from episode

355
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:49,619
1 and I have managed to get 200 episodes

356
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:51,928
and man I love when people go back and

357
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:53,910
listen to the old episodes honestly it's

358
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:56,100
a little bit embarrassing cuz I was not

359
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:57,928
very good at podcasting now I am quite

360
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,970
comfortable on a mic it feels so weird

361
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:01,769
to hear the old stuff I'm sure everybody

362
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,040
who does recording and broadcasting says

363
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:07,289
that I digress the message says so I'm

364
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,719
not doing too bad you are a smart dude

365
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:12,389
and you are very easy to listen to even

366
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,160
with the American to UK accent barrier

367
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:15,539
hey thanks for listening to me man I'm

368
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,110
glad that the accent doesn't drive you

369
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:18,118
crazy

370
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,889
I hope it's easy to listen to some folks

371
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:22,589
with accents are hard to understand I

372
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,899
hope I'm doing a great job for you the

373
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:26,129
message continues with keep up the

374
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,379
amazing work and I will keep

375
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,149

help to spread a podcast and help us

379
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,069
grow also helps us spread the positive

380
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,528
message of cannabis so I appreciate that

381

have one request and I hope this is

383
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:46,588
something you could maybe dedicate an

384
00:12:43,798 --> 00:12:49,048
episode to would you be able to do an

385
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,939
episode on making crumble wax I'm

386
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:52,470
investing in the kit very soon and I

387
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:54,808
want to have your knowledge as well as

388

393
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:11,489

398
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:19,889

403
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,690
appreciate that this person started off

404
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,029
with a paragraph of compliments and then

405
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:37,170
they made a request that I cannot

406
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:39,419
fulfill I am NOT a BHO hash maker I am

407
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:42,870
NOT a crumble wacked maker that is not

408
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:45,689
my expertise that is not my wheelhouse

409
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:48,750
by any means I cannot safely and

410
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:51,390
effectively teach you how to make BHO

411
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:54,120
concentrates without feeling like I am

412
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:56,549
going to set you up to hurt yourself

413
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,019
that would be irresponsible of me to try

414
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:58,500
to teach you that I don't know what I'm

415
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,329
doing

416
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,860
first off you wouldn't come out with the

417
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,629
quality product if I taught you because

418
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,129
I don't know what I'm doing and second

419
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:06,929
you would hurt yourself you would

420
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:08,730
potentially hurt yourself and/or others

421
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,039
and I don't want to be responsible for

422
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,230
that so I just have to respectfully and

423
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,819
politely say dude that is not for me to

424
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,710
teach I don't know what I'm doing there

425
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,690
I have no problems admitting that I

426
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,240
don't know how to make pho I know how to

427
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,130
do with the basic ways but I do not know

428
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,840
how to teach you how to do it safely and

429
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,338
effectively without feeling like I'm

430
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,920
setting you up to hurt yourself and

431
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,810
you're my friend and I would feel like

432
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:32,399
[ __ ] if I ever hurt one of my friends or

433
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:35,129
if one of my friends caused a problem in

434
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,899
their life with my shitty advice so I

435
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:39,419
apologize that I cannot help you out

436
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,000
with your requests on making pho crumble

437
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:45,719
wax I can give you some advice my first

438
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,309
advice is be more careful than you think

439
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,930
you need to be everybody thinks that

440
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:50,939
they're good at [ __ ] everybody like you

441
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,439
said you do not have to worry you do

442
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,130
have to worry don't get overconfident

443
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,950
with volatile gases you can really hurt

444
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,659
yourself overconfidence is a big cause

445
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,550
of problems I'm not I don't know who you

446
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,990
are I don't know your science level I

447
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:06,120
don't know your level of thinking I'm

448
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,820
just saying don't get overconfident and

449
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,980
cause problems don't have a cellphone

450
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,600
around light switches and light bulbs

451
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,830
can cause problems when there's enough

452
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,409
butane in the air for a legal BHO

453
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,660
extraction facility in Colorado we must

454
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:23,850
be inspected by the fire department

455
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,679
there are several building inspections

456
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,960
and Fire Department inspections required

457
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,809
just to be allowed to run a hydrocarbon

458
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,790
extraction in a legal facility there are

459
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:35,429
reasons for that you can see on the news

460
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:37,289
about once it used to be more frequent

461
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:39,088
it used to be about every two weeks it

462
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:40,919
is slowed down now it's about every two

463
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:43,020
months you can read an article or you

464
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,789
catch an article online of some person

465
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,220
blowing their house up because they were

466
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:48,719
making BHO in their bedroom in their

467
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,839
basement somewhere they should not have

468
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,990
been so if you do decide to make pho

469
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,110
concentrates on your own please be extra

470
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:00,720
careful be scientific careful extra

471
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,089
think every step the smallest mistakes

472
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,810
caused the largest problems when you are

473
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:09,180
using hydrocarbons for extractions it is

474
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:11,969
also probably illegal to make

475
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,829
extractions where you are so I've got

476
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,528
several reasons why I have to politely

477
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:20,370
decline on giving you lessons on making

478
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:23,399
crumble wax or BHO also there are much

479
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,830
better techniques and products to focus

480
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,320
on making than crumble wax learn to make

481
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,820
diamonds and sauce if you're going to do

482
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,790
it if you're gonna put yourself in the

483
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,800
situation do it correctly and make the

484
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:37,980
diamonds and the sauce don't waste time

485
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:40,379
with the crumble wax that is so 2005 now

486
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,420
I am pretty sure that you are going to

487
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,950
go against my friendly advice and you

488
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,599
were going to make your own BHO

489
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,250
concentrates because you are an adult

490
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,379
and that is what you want to do and

491
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,419
there is no reason why I should stop you

492
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,700
do your thing I'm just saying I can't

493
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:55,259
help you too much but do your thing have

494
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,420
a great time I hope it goes very well

495
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:59,789
for you now let me try to give you a

496
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,528
couple of resources that may help you

497
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:03,958
out since I don't have any resources

498
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:06,509
from my experience our friends at the

499
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,178
dude grow show have done a great show on

500
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:11,640
making BHO extraction so you can check

501
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:14,130
out the dude grow show probably just

502
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,990
search for the dude grow show BHO

503
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,990
extraction and you will get a great

504
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,720
lesson from those guys then I would join

505
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:23,759
a few cannabis related forms and I would

506
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,709
join a bunch of groups and learn as much

507
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,410
as you can from those groups about

508
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,210
hydrocarbon extraction find people in

509
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:33,179
those groups that have experience and

510
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,039
ask them specific questions and learn

511
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,120
from people who have actually done it it

512
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,250
sounds like you're watching a lot of

513
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,019
YouTube videos and you were following a

514
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,640
lot of resources I hope they are able to

515
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,769
help you out more than I am because

516
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,620

517
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:48,450

518
