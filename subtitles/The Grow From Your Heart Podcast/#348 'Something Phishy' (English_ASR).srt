consume cannabis with a family member

18
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,929
which you've never smoked before maybe

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,489
you found out somebody in your family as

20
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,079
a cannabis consumer and you guys snuck

21
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,000
off and had one of them barbecue joints

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,649
together I love that sort of [ __ ]

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,090
whatever happened I hope you guys had a

24
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,920
great weekend I usually start these

25
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,410
episodes off by letting you know what I

26
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,469
am dabbing on right now I am loading up

27
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:54,839
a fresh dab of custom OGIS nectar from

28
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,289
Green Dot labs this is of course a combo

29
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,420
of Skittles and afghulis it is described

30
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,760
as assorted hard candies on the aroma

31
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,710
and flavor when I cracked open this

32
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,200
fresh jar of concentrates I made a

33
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,269
little noise like a little boy that just

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,820
got a fresh box at Ninja Turtles or some

35
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:14,548
[ __ ] I went ooh when I opened this this

36
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:17,219
gram of concentrates is beautiful this I

37
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,960
I really think this is a heavy gram

38
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,329
there's more than a gram of hash in here

39
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,298
this is super chunky lots of crystals

40
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,579
very little Terp liquid which is what I

41
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,618
prefer I'd prefer lots of crystals and a

42
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,569
very minimal amount of the turkey liquid

43
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,250
I get enough chirps just just enough to

44
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:35,099
add the flavor that's all I need this

45
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,420
gram is glorious caused me to make a

46
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,368
little Robin Williams noise when I

47
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,909
opened it so I'm getting myself a little

48
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:43,409
chunk of this custom oh geez nectar

49
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,780
scooped into my insert here I'm gonna

50
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,460
take an insert dab and then after that

51
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,960
we're gonna get into a podcast I think

52
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,728
we're gonna talk a little bit about CBD

53
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,618
and then we will probably read a news

54
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:54,060
article and then we may read a couple of

55
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:55,560
emails and then we're gonna wrap it up

56
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,500
and get out of here this is not gonna be

57
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,149
a super long episode but I wanted to

58
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,978
make sure to have a quality show

59
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,210
prepared for Monday because I haven't

60
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:04,978
missed a week you guys I've been doing

61
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,199
the show for close to five years I think

62
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:09,149
and I have not missed a Monday in five

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,770
years there was one Monday when I was

64
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,699
super sick I had a head cold I sounded

65
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,900
like [ __ ]

66
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,179
I wasn't a Monday but there was a show

67
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,640
coming up and I wasn't able to really do

68
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,989
a good show so I called the crew and I'm

69
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,699
sure you guys remember everybody came

70
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,159
over Adam Jesse and Mike all came over

71
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,869
and we recorded a hilarious podcast

72
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,340
while I was sick I basically sat at the

73
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,780
table and ran the equipment and

74
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,219
everybody talked over me for the whole

75
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,219
show but I have not missed a single

76
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:33,900
episode in approximately five years so I

77
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,699
had to make sure to come give you guys a

78
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,689
quality Monday show because I'm heating

79
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,829
the [ __ ] out of the banger while I'm

80
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,870
talking if you hear the torsion in the

81
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,219
background I apologize if I Sun slightly

82
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,689
distracted it's cuz I'm paying attention

83
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,340
to the torch in the nail I'm getting

84
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,859
this sucker nice and hot I feel like

85
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,269
it's almost there I just want to heat it

86
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,670
up just a little bit more than a little

87
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,110
actually a little black mark of an oil

88
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,179
stain on the banger I'm gonna heat it

89
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,500
until that goes away and then as soon as

90
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,110
that's gone it looks like it has

91
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,959
disappeared turn off the torch then I

92
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,180
drop the insert right into the banger

93
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,610
then I get a carb cap I place the carb

94
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,469
cap right on top of that and now I'm

95
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,060
just gonna let it sit here until I see

96
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,818
it actually starting to smoke a little

97
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,319
bit once the banger fills with a little

98
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,609
smoke and maybe a little too smoke comes

99
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,869
out of the top of the carb cap there it

100
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:33,630
goes that's what I'm gonna hit it so

101
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:37,859
let's debut guys dab with me that's like

102
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:40,199
the perfect size the first bull was

103
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:44,790
super thick nice and chunky then I got a

104
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:46,318
nice little backup pull off of that get

105
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:48,209
nicely medicated from that it's leaving

106
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,149
up like a UH

107
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,280
I taste Apple candies right away it

108
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,590
tastes like a sour apple Jolly Rancher

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,039
but it's kind of changing into something

110
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,239
sweeter and fruitier as it goes that's

111
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,068
gonna take a couple of seconds for that

112
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,930
one to work through my brain you guys

113
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:05,789
excuse me while my brain swims around

114
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,069
like a little goldfish in my head right

115
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:09,840
now I'm getting dad the [ __ ] out that

116
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:10,798
was a beautiful dab hey one thing I want

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,530
to mention while I'm high and just

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,030
rambly I see people taking dad videos on

119
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,488
Instagram and I love it keep doing your

120
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,529
big dads on Instagram but when you cap

121
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:21,629
the banger leave that [ __ ] carb cap

122
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,689
on there so I'm gonna grab my rake and

123
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:26,100
kind of just so that I can

124
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:28,469
myself a better idea what I'm seeing so

125
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,930
when you hit you put the carb cap on and

126
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,400
then you hit it right and then you're

127
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,750
gonna lift the carb cap off a little bit

128
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,339
to kind of carve it and let yourself

129
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,959
clear the rig and get that smoke when

130
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:39,109
you're when your lungs are full we do

131
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,109
that

132
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,680
you can hear the noises I'm doing it I

133
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,030
think I think it's coming through on the

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,030
mic so you pull and you get this right

135
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,230
you get this little a couple of moments

136
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,789
you lift the cap off to where you can

137
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,020
get oxygen through there so you can

138
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,460
clear the rig and get all that smoke

139
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,099
into your lungs and then you fill your

140
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:00,269
lungs in and you exhale then you go back

141
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,860
in and repeat the process write

142
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:03,899
something that I don't know why it

143
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,389
drives me [ __ ] crazy it just bugs the

144
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,789
[ __ ] out of me when you're exhaling

145
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,229
you're dab don't take the carb cap off

146
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,390
the banger just leave the carb cap on

147
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,670
there there's no reason to keep removing

148
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:16,439
the carb cap you're letting the heat

149
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,000
escape the whole idea of putting that

150
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,420
carb cap on there is to trap the heat

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,069
inside that nail inside that banger and

152
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,960
every time you lift the carb cap you're

153
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,430
allowing all that heat to leave so just

154
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,719
leave that carb cap on there yes I get

155
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,120
it you want to lift it up to pull this

156
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,220
to clear it but then put it back just

157
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,769
like it should sound like this and now

158
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,740
when I'm exhaling my carb cap is still

159
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:41,849
on the banger now I'm gonna go back in

160
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,780
and those little whistles that you hear

161
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,460
the little lift up the bang or the carb

162
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,559
cap to let air flow that's all you need

163
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,449
just a couple of just carb it don't

164
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,579
leave I don't know they think it's silly

165
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,740
to cap it trap that heat in there then

166
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,269
let the cap off let the heat escape then

167
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,889
try to recap it and reget that heat

168
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:01,049
going if you leave it in there your dab

169
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,029
will be better that's just my opinion

170
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,590
for some reason it drives me [ __ ]

171
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,049
nuts watching people take the cap off

172
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,549
and leave the cap off and exhale their

173
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,079
dab and look at the camera all silly and

174
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,490
blow a kiss and then put the cap on and

175
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,159
go back in just leave the cap on there

176
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,780
bro but now on the other hand when

177
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,130
you're done with the dab take the

178
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,839
[ __ ] carb cap off because when you

179
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,219
set that rig on the table or when you

180
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,750
try to set the rig on the table and the

181
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,550
carb cap falls off and lands in the

182
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,250
carpet and gets all that carpet fuzz

183
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,110
stuck to the sticky carb cap or even

184
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,180
worse when the carb cap rolls off and

185
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,538
lands on the [ __ ] tile floor and

186
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,490
shatters that's terrible so take the cap

187
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:38,009
off when you're done and set the cap

188
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,269
down on an oil slick pad or

189
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,589
pay attention to where people are

190
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:42,419
setting the tools so that you have just

191
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:43,829
like it one designated sticky spot don't

192
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,970
go sticky up the whole table pay

193
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:47,250
attention to how other people are doing

194
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,740
it but set the carb cap down then set

195
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,639
the rig down you guys if there is a mood

196
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,110
mat or some sort of a mat for the rig

197
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,419
try to set the rig on that mat because

198
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,750
some of the collectors and the heady

199
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,879
boys if you set your glass rig down

200
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,300
directly on the wooden table ooh

201
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,069
that's offensive to some people I don't

202
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,560
really care because I understand it's a

203
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,569
glass pipe that I bought that is likely

204
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,100
going to get broken but a lot of people

205
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,219
spend a lot of money on really nice

206
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,390
glass and this sound right here oh

207
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,340
that's a rig just touching a table

208
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:21,810
that's that's a hitman rig just send

209
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,429
down on a wooden table that sound drives

210
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,769
people nuts this is what they want to

211
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,420
hear you hear that now you didn't that's

212
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:29,879
cuz I set it down on a little mood mat

213
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,890
it's nice and smooth and protected so if

214
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,689
you see the mood mat try to utilize it

215
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,449
because your Hetty boyfriend's may get

216
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,889
frustrated with you if you do not that's

217
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,990
just a little tip you guys so that you

218
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:42,329
look cool the first time you go to the

219
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,759
social club and smoke with all the heady

220
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:46,740
boys what social club oh that's a great

221
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,029
segue into this news article that I've

222
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,160
got I've got a news article from the

223
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:52,889

224
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,140
second license social marijuana business

225
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,329
to open this fall as a vaping bar and

226
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,129
lounge this article is written by a

227
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:01,370
person named John Murray we're gonna get

228
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:03,689
right into it and it goes like this

229
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,000
Denver's licensing directors signed off

230
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:07,620
Friday on the city's second license for

231
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,019
a marijuana consumption area in a

232
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,500
business paving the way for a vaping bar

233
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:15,750
and lounge to open this fall the owners

234
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,430
of vape and play plan to open the 21 and

235
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,680
over social lounge and entertainment

236
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,120
venue in November or sooner depending on

237
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,329
the timing of a renovation of the

238
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,060
building at 1753 South Broadway

239
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:29,250
co-owner Taylor Rosen says the lounge

240
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,099
will be centered around a multi station

241
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,840
saloon style vape bar though customers

242
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,050
will have to bring their own marijuana

243
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,599
per the rules of Denver's 2016 voter

244
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,069
past initiative 300 so there's more to

245
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,110
that article but I think we got the

246
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,300
point Denver is opening a second

247
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,769
consumption bar this is great this will

248
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,139
be a place for tourists to go and

249
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,789
consume this will be a place for people

250
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:51,789
who live in apartments we are not

251
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:53,649
allowed to smoke

252
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:55,269
be able to go smoke there this will be a

253
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,500
cool social lounge we'll be able to have

254
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,329
events they said it's going to be an

255
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,100
entertainment venue that means we may

256
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,170
have music there that means we may have

257
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,850
live comedy there we may do podcasts

258
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:05,829
from there you never know what could

259
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,930
happen at a venue like this these places

260
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,180
are great and they said it's the second

261
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:11,859
place I can think of two others and I'm

262
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:13,899
not sure if I should say both of them

263
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,550
because that means one is unlicensed and

264
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:16,899
we go dab there and they may get in

265
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:19,209
trouble if I mention it

266
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:22,199
so I'm snitching on one of them if I say

267
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,250
- and I'm not sure if I want to do that

268
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,470
now that I'm thinking about it there are

269
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,570
several places where we go and consume

270
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,450
so I'm gonna click over to Google right

271
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:33,340
quick and see what the first place was

272
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,930
okay the first place is I've never even

273
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,639
been there so that means that the places

274
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:38,679
where I am going and dabbing you're not

275
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,750
supposed to be dabbing there but I

276
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,370
they don't stop me I go in and I sit

277
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,080
down and I just pull out the rig and

278
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,100
take dabs and nobody has ever said hey

279
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,379
bro you can't dive in here

280
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,720
but anyway the place where you are

281
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,789
allowed to dab is called the Coffee

282
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,330
joint that was the first legal and

283
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:57,069
officially licensed adult use

284
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,410
recreational cannabis lounge in Denver

285
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,240
Colorado so shout out to them once again

286
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:02,709

287
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,870

residents of the Denver area adults in

292
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,820
Denver visitors guess people have a safe

293
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:20,500
place to go consume all of the cannabis

294
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,690
that are allowed to go by at the

295
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,879
dispensaries now we just need for this

296
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,440
to spread through Colorado now so that

297
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,049
we can have lounges all over the place

298
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,140
and have safe access and safe places to

299
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:34,209

progress again you guys I like this also

301
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,230
let me rant about this if you were

302
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,909
working on legalizing cannabis

303
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,909
recreationally or medically in your area

304
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:45,129
make sure you include some sort of place

305
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,539
to consume your medicine or your

306
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:48,610
recreational cannabis when you're

307
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:50,679
writing the rules if you don't write it

308
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,230
into the rules from the beginning the

309
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:55,799
opposition will create rules for you and

310
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,570
we never like the rules they make for us

311
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,399
so that's super cool another smoke

312
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,800

313

315
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:07,309

316
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:10,129

317
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:14,029
talk about CBD I have more of a warning

318
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:16,399
about CBD products I was hanging out

319
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:18,889

320

323

really quickly and was really eager to

326
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,050
give her some CBD products me being Who

327
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,759
I am I was like what you got there can I

328
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:36,319
see the bottle and she politely gave me

329
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,600
the bottle I was just reading out of

330
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,430
curiosity the label looked a little

331
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,680
generic I looked like they just peeled

332
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:44,659
the label off of another product and put

333
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,709
their own shitty paper label around it

334
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:48,079
and tried to pass it off and just

335
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,900
replace something but the label said

336
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,629
that each capsule contained 100

337
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:56,299
milligrams of CBD it also said that it

338
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,669
had MCT oil which i think is just fancy

339
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:01,579
for coconut oil and then it also said

340
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:04,669
that it contained fish oil now as soon

341
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,350
as I saw the words fish oil I got super

342
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:08,209
suspicious so I asked her if I could

343
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,529
have a couple there were like a hundred

344
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,670
of them in the jar and she was super

345
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,769
sweet and she's like yeah take as many

346
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:14,089
as you want so I'm thinking yeah I'll

347
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:17,509
just pop them in the lid and get a

348
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:19,759
couple so I pop off the lid and it just

349
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:20,990
wreaked a fish oil and she's like take

350
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,129
as many as you want it was kind of a

351
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,110
large bottle you guys they're probably a

352
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:25,820
hundred of them in there so I dumped

353
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,440
that two or three for myself and I had

354
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,790
no intentions of eating them I if you

355
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,010
listen to the podcast a lot you know

356
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:33,500
that I'm not a CBD consumer I prefer

357
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:37,100
high THC the CBD seems to kind of ruin

358
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,870
my THC high so CBD isn't really for me

359
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,550
but I took a couple of them because I

360
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,529
just wanted to to play I wanted to see

361
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:43,609
what the heck she had because she just

362
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,539
pulled him out of her purse and was

363
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,279
passing him out they couldn't have been

364
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:48,139
very expensive the way she was sharing

365
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,490
them with everybody and the label looks

366
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:50,990
like she might have got them at like

367
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,029
Walmart or something by the looks of

368
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,769
this label cuz it didn't have any sort

369
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:57,289
of medical marijuana labeling it didn't

370
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:59,539
have any sort of warning it was just CBD

371
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:01,189
oil capsules is what I think it said it

372
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:03,139
said 100 milligrams each capsule and

373
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,110
they were gelatin caps and then I

374
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:09,399
flipped it around and it was fish oil

375
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:13,490
was the first ingredient listed and then

376
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:16,459
CBD oil and they did not define or give

377
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,289
any details about the CBD source so as

378
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,540
soon as I got away from the group they

379
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:19,919
didn't

380
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,360
to be rude and is cracking open and tell

381
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,039
this girl your product is [ __ ] but I

382
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,169
could tell her product was [ __ ] and I

383
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,049
just had a suspicion I cracked it open

384
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:31,279
and I smelled it and you guys I think

385
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:33,779
that they're just selling fish oil pills

386
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,329
there that's the only reason I can think

387
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:39,720
of why they would say there's fish oil

388
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:42,150
in there because why the [ __ ] else would

389
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,769
you put fish oil in CBD pills so I'm

390
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,539
thinking they're just relabeling some

391
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,879
fish oil pills and they're selling them

392
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:50,039
to this very sweet young lady who's very

393
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,350
gullible and very young and she's buying

394
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,419
them thinking that she's got CBD now the

395
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,399
added benefit to taking this fish oil is

396
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:57,839
it's probably giving her some sort of

397
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,459
physical benefit it's probably good for

398
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,440
her joints it may be good for her brain

399
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,240
it's probably good for all kinds of

400
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,060
stuff in her body and she's attributing

401
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,490
that to the magical effects of CBD

402
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:10,829
so she's not getting a placebo she's

403
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:15,180
getting an effect so she's going to keep

404
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:17,009
buying this product I can't prove to you

405
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:18,629
that there's no CBD in there I didn't

406
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:19,799
eat the pills I threw him away they kind

407
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:21,059
of melted in my car to be honest with

408
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,649
you after I cracked one of them open I

409
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,729
forgot about him in the car the other

410
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:26,699
two melted in the car

411
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,800
but I'm very suspicious of what they're

412
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,680
putting in that capsule and telling us

413
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,659
is CBD I don't think for the cost of

414
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,719
that bottle that could have been CBD I

415
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:38,819
don't think for how generous she was

416
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,410
with that bottle that those were CBD

417
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,450
pills cuz that would probably be really

418
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:45,149
expensive for a bottle of that big of a

419
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,190
hundred milligram CBD pills so what it

420
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,929
leads me I'm what I'm trying to say to

421
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:52,200
you guys is when you're buying CBD

422
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:54,929
products be very leery be very

423
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,060
suspicious of any CBD products right now

424
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:59,189
you guys try to find out about the

425
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,379
company you're purchasing from try to

426
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,720
find out the brand do some research on

427
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,669
the brand find out where their products

428
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,470
come from are they coming from America

429
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:09,209
are they coming from Canada are they

430
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,200
coming from the United States so I said

431
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,639
that one already are they come in from

432
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,560
China is what I'm getting out I didn't

433
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,110
want to say China first if it's coming

434
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,389
from China be afraid if it's coming from

435
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,789
Canada you're probably okay if it's

436
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:22,590
coming from America it's hard to say

437
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:24,719
what you're purchasing I would recommend

438
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:27,030
you buy your CBD products from a very

439
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,070
reputable vendor we had giddy up on the

440
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,850
podcast recently and he represents can

441
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,560
tech labs so I can stand behind that

442
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,000
there are also several other reputable

443
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,649
companies out there I'm not gonna throw

444
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,149
out a bunch of names cuz I haven't done

445
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,159
any research and as soon as I say a

446
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:41,809
brand name especially the two that are

447
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,939
on the tip of my tongue if I say those

448
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:45,649
I'm going to get ten emails about why I

449
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,389
shouldn't have said them so I'm not

450
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,730
gonna say anybody other than our friends

451
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:51,769
at can tech labs because giddyup was on

452
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,110
the show and I've actually seen those

453
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:56,120
products work it he gave me a few

454
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,980
samples of their CBD products and I pass

455
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,620
them out to people who needed them and I

456
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,629
did watch that product work

457
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,649
I saw it work for somebody I can't talk

458
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,970
too much about it because their

459
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:07,370
employment would probably frown upon

460
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,579
their CBD use but I got to see somebody

461
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,948
get relief from a CBD product so I can

462
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:15,379
recommend that one it's can techlabs and

463
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:17,899
they're based out of Oklahoma so big

464
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,490
shot it's a giddyup and his crew know

465
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,879
another thing I want to talk about is I

466
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:25,610
wonder what other people are taking that

467
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:28,039
they actually think is CBD what are they

468
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,209
buying if they're getting their CBD from

469
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,068
China if they're getting like a little

470
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:33,169
vial of tincture or a little medicine

471
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:35,179
bottle filled with some syrup that they

472
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:36,559
think is CBD I wonder what these people

473
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:39,349
are putting into their bodies how many

474
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,599
people are simply taking doses of fish

475
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,699
oil every day how many people are taking

476
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,290
water with a little drops of hemp oil in

477
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:47,179
it every day how many people are paying

478
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:49,309
good money and thinking that they're

479
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,958
treating themselves well and treating a

480
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,399
condition when they're actually being

481
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,528
duped into spending their money on a

482
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,600
product that could be causing them more

483
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:59,750
harm that scares the [ __ ] out of me you

484
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,909
guys even if the CBD isn't real even if

485
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,708
it's just fish oil that's shitty to do

486
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:05,750
to people but what else is in there

487
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,678
that's the super shitty part because I'm

488
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,169
not gonna say that

489
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,990
China is unscrupulous is that the word

490
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:14,630
unscrupulous scruple yeah try and I'm

491
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,679
not gonna but I mean they don't care

492
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,909
they're just trying to make some money

493
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,288
they're putting some [ __ ] in a bottle

494
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:20,209
and they're putting it in a box they put

495
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,828
a label on it they ship it off they have

496
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,419
no idea where it ends up or what its

497
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:23,928
gonna do to anybody they don't give a

498
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,659
[ __ ]

499
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:28,100
well they got paid so who knows what

500
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:30,169
they're putting in there do you remember

501
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:32,329
a long time ago Chinese toothpaste was

502
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:35,690
killing people so imagine like what

503
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:37,189
Chinese CBD might be all right guys I

504
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,259
think I've rambled on long enough about

505
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,659
that pay attention where your CBD comes

506
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:43,279
from find find of this source find out

507
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,870
learn about the company are they a

508
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,319
reputable company are they a piece of

509
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:46,969
[ __ ]

510
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:49,250
honey find out if they are American

511
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,829
Canadian Chinese who knows where they

512
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,839
could be from try to find out our friend

513
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:56,178
Scottie real will always remind you you

514
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,918
vote with your dollars man so pay

515
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,419
attention to where your CBDs coming from

516
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,190
don't give your money to a company that

517
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:03,080
doesn't give a [ __ ] about you and then

518
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,630
do give your money to a company that

519
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:08,210
actually cares and offers a quality

520
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,679
product all right you guys I said this

521
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,259
was gonna be a quick episode I'm already

522
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,570
creeping up on almost 20 minutes so

523
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,159
let's read one quick email this email

524
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:17,720
says hey Jeff I'm growing in my closet

525
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,940
for the first time and I was listening

526
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,470
to a veg podcast of yours talking about

527
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,379
turning off the lights and letting the

528
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,019
plants sleep during this time could I

529
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:30,619
also keep the fan off or is the fan okay

530
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:32,538
to run during that time thanks that's a

531
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,278
very good question I've recommended

532
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:35,990
giving your plants some sleep time a lot

533
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:37,759
of people like to run the plants I was

534
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,230
24 hours of a veg light so where do they

535
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,360
grow but I think the plants really like

536
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,500
some sleep time they do some processing

537
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,028
in the sleep I'm not gonna get too much

538
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,659
into Dex I'm trying to keep this short

539
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:49,069
also roots develop in the dark time you

540
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,450
get a lot of root growth at night so I

541
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:52,369
think a little bit of dark time is good

542
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,019
for the plants you really encourage them

543
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:56,028
growth and who doesn't want to nap

544
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:58,069
occasionally also illiterate whites cool

545
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:59,929
down save you some electricity save you

546
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:02,210
some bulb time it'll help ya now this

547
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:04,850
guy is asking should I leave the fan off

548
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:08,269
or can I keep that on during the dark

549
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:10,038
cycle I would leave the fan on during

550
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:11,899
the dark cycle you want airflow you're

551
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:14,450
gonna get more humidity as soon as those

552
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:16,308
lights go off the vapor pressure deficit

553
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,740
is going to change in that room the

554
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:20,269
relative humidity is going to spike it's

555
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,528
gonna go crazy in there you're not in

556
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:23,538
there so you don't notice it but it

557
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:26,210
happens every time the lights go off it

558
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:28,009
changes drastically in there so if

559
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,798
you've got that fan in there that will

560
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:32,990
help prevent any sort of bud mold and

561
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,579
powdery mildew and also those leaves

562
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,288
just like to move around the leaves want

563
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:37,490
to get rustled around all the time if

564
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:39,349
they you're not beating the [ __ ] out of

565
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,970
the plants with that fan if it's just a

566
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:43,638
nice rustle yeah go ahead and leave that

567
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,720
on I think that will like it maybe think

568
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:46,878
about turning it off and on

569
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,429
intermittently just have it come on for

570
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:51,469
maybe on for 15 minutes off for 15

571
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:54,019
minutes on for 15 off for 15 or

572
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,669
something like that that way if you've

573
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,288
got a couple of leaves it's always that

574
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:58,050
front row of plants right that front row

575
00:19:57,288 --> 00:19:59,759
right in front of the

576
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:01,139
they always leaves look just a little

577
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,460
bit shitty from getting beat up by the

578
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,320
by the fan there the win

579
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,150
that's the vapor pressure deficit

580
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,559
getting just thrown out of whack by that

581
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,030
fan maybe don't beat the [ __ ] out of

582
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,710
them all day maybe give them a little

583
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:12,509
bit of a rest so that they can actually

584
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,670
function so that those leaves can do

585
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:17,009
their duty you can have the vapor

586
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:21,000
pressure deficit correct around those

587
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:22,410
leaves for at least half the day but yes

588
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,880
if you want to leave that fan on if it's

589
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,990
not too strong if it's not whipping the

590
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,240
[ __ ] out of your plants if it's not

591
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,009
causing any problems yes leave it on a

592
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,579
little bit of stimulation is not a

593
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:31,200
problem

594
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:33,569
throughout the night cycle for those

595
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,069

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,339

00:24:07,019 --> 00:25:36,480
the shine

00:24:08,109 --> 00:25:36,480
