I've got a fun episode lined up for us

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,759
in today's podcast I'm going to talk

11
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,959
about taking care of incoming plants

12
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,799
many websites are selling rooted clones

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,840
and fresh Snips we're going to talk

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,959
about taking care of those let's jump

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,320
right into it I do have a website that

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,600
website is IR genetics.com at the top of

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,878
that website there is a row of tabs one

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,960
of those tabs does say grow help or grow

19
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,359
questions if you click on that tab you

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,280

21
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,359

00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,920

a coupon code for a free pack of seeds

30
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,158
at idirect tocom the question does start

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,200
off by talking about how they ordered

32
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,640
clones they received their clones they

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,439
looked a little bit rough because of the

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,118
weather uh they told me how they took

35
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:37,438
care of them which is exactly what I

36
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,719
would have done the way that they did it

37
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,758
so good job bro uh but then they do ask

38
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,118
a very important question so let's jump

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,840
into the question portion of this

40
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:49,239
message it says finally my question what

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,640
would you recommend folks do when

42
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,718
receiving Snips and rooted clones I know

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,519
this could help many people as I learned

44
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:57,718
the oldfashioned way excuse me I learned

45
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,599
the oldfashioned way which was trial and

46
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,640
error through taking losses and calling

47
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,679
it taxes of the game so this is a very

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,039
good question uh like we've talked about

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,280
many websites out there now are selling

50
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,400
rooted clones or fresh cuts there are a

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,400
lot of websites a lot of vendors a lot

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,920
of breeders are doing this of course my

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,920
fresh cuts are available at IR

54
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,719
redirect.sh they will not ship for

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,599
several days because it is super cold

56
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:38,120
here in my region today I think it is uh

57
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,318
0° uh if I put your clones in the mail

58
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,000
and 0 degrees they will not get to you

59
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,280
in one piece they will be toast they

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,039
well they will not be the opposite of

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,239
toast they will be ice they will be

62
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,519
frozen uh they will look like [ __ ] you

63
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,959
will be very mad and so will the Clones

64
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,000
so I'm going to wait until it's a little

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,640
bit warmer before I put any uh Clips any

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Snips any slips whatever you want to

67
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,559
call them or any rooted clones into the

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,919
mail putting anything with moisture like

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,158
that in in the mail right now is a bad

70
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,280
idea it will freeze it will rupture it

71
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:08,199
will die so um I am selling clones on

72
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,360
edirect decom there are many vendors

73
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,079
selling clones what do you do if you

74
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,239
order these Fresh Cuts in the mail you

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,719
order these rooted clones in the mail uh

76
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,280
you're paying a lot of money depends on

77
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,318
where you buy them depends on which Cuts

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,120
you're getting uh they do cost money and

79
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:22,839
money is expensive right now so I

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,759
understand that we want to have and I

81
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,400
want you to have the best success you

82
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,518
can when you do spend money on my

83
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,879
website with my product or even if

84
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,039
you're buying a clone from someone else

85
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,798
I still want you to have great success

86
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,878
so let's talk about this if you do buy

87
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,000
clones from a website we'll specifically

88
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,438
talk about I direct.com um some things

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
you should keep in mind and some things

90
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,239
that will help you out first of all I

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,919
spray my plants twice a week I've got a

92
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,759
very uh I've got a nice uh collection of

93
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,158
different pesticides of different um

94
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,959
efficacy might be the word that I'm

95
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,359
saying of different toxicity might be

96
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,560
the word I'm looking for um of different

97
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,680
gentleness and abrasiveness I've got a

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,199
nice array of pesticides that I have on

99
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,959
a shelf and I will mix those I usually

100
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,438
generally use two different pesticides

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,719
at a time multiple modes of attack will

102
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,639
uh definitely take out and prevent any

103
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,239
uh problems that may come in so I'm

104
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,639
spraying these plants twice a week with

105
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,720
a nice array of products to be straight

106
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,478
up with you some of them are not organic

107
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,280
if you're worried about 100% organic uh

108
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,240
let me know I will isolate a plant for

109
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,918
you maybe I'll dedicate one to just

110
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,400
organic sprays but I as a breeder in a

111
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,359
state where everybody grows and where

112
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,959
I'm around a lot of Growers

113
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,360
I don't treat with Strictly Organic

114
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,159
products I use a lot of different

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,240
pesticides fungicides I rotate my point

116
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,160
is these plants will be clean the Clones

117
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,478
will have been treated over time while

118
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,080
they're on the mother plant with a lot

119
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,639
of different products they will be clean

120
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,680
they will be Pest and Fung fungus free

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,560
that's something you can count on

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,759
because I spray today is uh Thursday I

123
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,120
sprayed today uh just a couple of hours

124
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,520
ago I sprayed some stuff on the Garden

125
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,560
today the lights are still off they need

126
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,439
to be turned on when I'm done recording

127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,360
here so the plants are sprayed quite

128
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:04,038
frequently uh to make sure there's no

129
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,560
pest no problems on those plants also uh

130
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,800
I've got several mother plants in the

131
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,478
garden I've got a couple of different

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,639
locations with different mother plants

133
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,599
which the Clones may come from randomly

134
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,800
uh those plants are tested like a sports

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,639
team I just picked somebody on the team

136
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,120
this plant here and this plant here and

137
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,600
they get hlvd testing that is hop and

138
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,759
vroid testing so I'm testing the plants

139
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,000
randomly to see if there is hlvd in the

140
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,000
room uh so far there is none so as long

141
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,879
as it stays clean there is no problem

142
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,600
the seeds and the Clones are hlvd free

143
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,879
uh if I do bring in a clone this is

144
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,199
something you should work on as well um

145
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,439
keep this in mind because this is not in

146
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,038
my notes this is something that just

147
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,439
came up in my brain if I receive a clone

148
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,719
from somebody whether it's a vendor

149
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,199
whether it's a bro whether it's a

150
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,720
stranger sending a gift if I buy a clone

151
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,160
from a dispensary if I get it from a

152
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,479
shady Craigslist deal that clone does

153
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,479
not go directly into my grow area that

154
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,800
clone grows into a quarantine isolated

155
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,318
area honestly that quarantine is right

156
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,560
here at this table this area is far

157
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,120
enough from any of my grow spaces that I

158
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,759
can put a plant here I can give it

159
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,519
enough light honestly I use studio

160
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,160
lights it's not I'm not trying to make

161
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,478
it grow rapidly and uh be a thriving

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,759
plant I'm making sure it doesn't have

163
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,478
bugs I'm watching it looking for powdery

164
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,080
mildew to pop up watching to see if I

165
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:20,360
see spidermites on it uh looking to see

166
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,359
if I see any thrips or uh fungus Nets

167
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,759
fly up out of the soil so as soon as

168
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,598
that plant gets here I get it on the

169
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,400
table get it comfortable then I will

170
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:29,000
spray it with I spray that thing with

171
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,038
some crazy pesticides two or three

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,720
different things make sure it's clean I

173
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,959
recommend you do that as well bring your

174
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,400
clones in put them in isolation even if

175
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,758
you get it from me even if you get it

176
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,879
from your other favorite breeder your

177
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,280
favorite vendor uh we all say we're

178
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:44,360
clean pretty girls have problems too so

179
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,559
make sure you're isolating these clones

180
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,800
when they come in treat them spray them

181
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,319
set them aside check on them uh look

182
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
under the underside of the leaves make

183
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,080
sure there's no bugs in there make sure

184
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,720
that plant is clean before you put it in

185
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,800
your general population we just don't

186
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,240
want to contaminate the rest of the grow

187
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,120
that's something I do it's something I

188
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,759
re recommend you do with the Clone as

189
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,160
well so we're checking for hlvd if I get

190
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,639
a cut that sh gets isolated also I will

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,560
take an immediate cut when it's big

192
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,918
enough uh you got to take some roots and

193
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,918
some plant material send that B that

194
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,560
that bad [ __ ] into my Farmer my friend

195
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,000
farmer Freeman that was harder to say

196
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,120
than it should have been I might need

197
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,079
more dabs but we send that test in

198
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,240
Farmer Freeman and they let us know that

199
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,478
they are hlvd free before they're put

200
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,400
into the regular population I've already

201
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,800
got the test here I've ordered them so

202
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,799
they're on deck they're in the grow

203
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,879
space uh all I've got to do is take the

204
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,879
samples and send it it takes priority

205
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,720
mail three maybe 4 days to get it there

206
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,199
depending on how busy they are he'll

207
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,759
test it within two to three days of

208
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,960
getting it I'll have an answer in less

209
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,000
than a week most of the time so that

210
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,839
plant can sit here it can chill it'll be

211
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,279
fine I don't want to get hlvd in the

212
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,399
room uh then what else is important

213
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,158
discrete shipping bro I send I send

214
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,318
everything uh either priority mail or

215
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:58,199
priority Express Mail the clips are just

216
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,199
coming priority mail to save you money

217
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,199
that's the budget cost eff way to do

218
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,560
things I get three clips for 50 60 maybe

219
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
40 bucks on some strains uh you get

220
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,158
three Fresh Cuts I go to the mother

221
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,280
plant and I [ __ ] cut that bad [ __ ]

222
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,158
off I wrap it in a wet paper towel put

223
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,478
it in a baggie put it in a priority

224
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:17,158
mailbox depending on the weather I may

225
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,800
add other things that's on another note

226
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:23,839
here but it is all in a priority mail or

227
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,400
sometimes a priority mail Express box

228
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,679
which I've been told is going to go away

229
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,478
the priority mail Express will disappear

230
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,320
they're always late Priority Mail

231
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,718
Express boxes are always late I get a

232
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,000
lot of refunds you guys get a lot of

233
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,000
refunds for those because those bad

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,519
[ __ ] are never on time you can get

235
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,399
those refunded if your product is not

236
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,278
delivered on time uh but the uh the

237
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,639
postal service has a hard time finding a

238
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,559
contractor to to deliver those on time

239
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,080
is what I've been told so that service

240
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,799
will disappear eventually it's all just

241
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,720
going to be priority mail so your plants

242
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:55,079
will all come that service which will

243
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,120
save some of you a few bucks but it's

244
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,759
discreet that's my point I don't write

245
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,879
[ __ ] ganja clones it doesn't say

246
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,319
roster Jeff Pot Farm or anything on

247
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,278
there uh depending on when we ship I

248
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,519
rotate the return address a few times

249
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,799
but it will come from a post office box

250
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,120
with a discrete return address on there

251
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,359
you won't know that it's even a clone

252
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
until you open it unless you're

253
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,519
expecting it but they are very discretly

254
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:20,278
shipped also I said a moment ago I'm

255
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,839
experimenting with it is cold it is cold

256
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:23,639
as [ __ ] is my unit of measurement right

257
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,760
now I think it's 0 degrees to be honest

258
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,759
with you I'm over here in a hoodie got

259
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,480
the heat cranked up uh there's a heater

260
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,399
vent right behind me it's really cold

261
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,920
over here but I've been putting those um

262
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,600
the glove warmers worked better they

263
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,719
were hotter but I bought some of those

264
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,879
reptile shipper warmer things I don't

265
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,600
think they get hot enough they don't

266
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,159
seem to keep the plants warm enough I'm

267
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,278
experimenting I've got the the Clone and

268
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,719
a thermal envelope with the reptile

269
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:50,120
warmers that are supposed to last 72

270
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,278
hours which should be long enough to get

271
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,360
it to you I'm experimenting but during

272
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:56,078
this cold time I'm going to take a break

273
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,560
uh but when it's not super cold I still

274
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,719
ship them with those glove warmers to

275
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,679
try to keep them warm for you so I'm

276
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,040
spraying them they're hlv tested

277
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,479
discrete shipping and I'm experimenting

278
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,599
with keeping them warm so that's the

279
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,200
basics of my shipping they get to you

280
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,278
now let's talk about how to take care of

281
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,519
these plants because that's what we're

282
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:13,838
supposed to be doing here let's say that

283
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,839
you order we're going to start with a

284
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,040
rooted clone most of the time the rooted

285
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,399
clones are uh somewhere between and it

286
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,439
depends on which clones you're buying

287
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,039
and how many of them but they start off

288
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,560
around a 100 bucks they work their way

289
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,078
up some are 250 uh there's one that is

290
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,759
quite pricey that I don't put up too

291
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:30,399
often if you want it get it cuz they

292
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,639
disappear quick quickly I I chicken out

293
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,720
and take it down so that's what happens

294
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,199
um where are we so you get a rooted cut

295
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,480
this rooted cut comes in the mail you've

296
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,399
got a priority mail Express box it comes

297
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,120
in the mail cut the Box open you pull

298
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,399
that bad [ __ ] out there's a thermal

299
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,159
envelope inside of there uh possibly

300
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,559
with a heat pack maybe even a sticker or

301
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,319
two depending on how much of a hurry I

302
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,679
was in when I packed it you get your

303
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,639
clone out you take it out of the baggie

304
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,958
uh carefully unwrap that root section

305
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,079
that's just in a paper a wet paper towel

306
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,919
uh unwrap that slowly now you've got a

307
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,120
clone that is just exposed it will have

308
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,479
long dangly Roots let me get to my notes

309
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,480
here cuz I know I wrote down stuff these

310
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,240
clones came most of the time so far I

311
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,959
may adjust to the plugs and the Dome and

312
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,680
tray thing here in the future if it's

313
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,399
easier for you guys let me know how you

314
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:18,719
feel I could do both um but these come

315
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,480
from an easy cloner a turbo cloner the

316
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
easy cloner is my preferred method of

317
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,519
cloning it's quick it's easy it's

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,240
reliable it gets long fat roots and the

319
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,839
best part is I don't have to use a dome

320
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,639
I [ __ ] hate the Clone domes the

321
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,519
humidity domes a pain in the ass uh it's

322
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,919
just such a learning curve you got to

323
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,759
[ __ ] with it every single day uh with

324
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,759
the Clone with the easy cloner you set

325
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,919
it forget it you check the ph and the EC

326
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,439
once a day and you're good to go so

327
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,719
these all come from an easy cloner

328
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,200
they'll have long roots and they'll be

329
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,240
dangling there's no the roots are just

330
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,800
free they're exposed they're not in any

331
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,000
sort of media they're wrapped in a paper

332
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,759
towel to stay safe during travel but

333
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,919
they're not in a clone plug they're not

334
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,799
in any dirt they're just it's a clone

335
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,278
with roots hanging off of it so you got

336
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,000
to be prep prepared for that when that

337
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:06,480
comes what I recommend I would get a

338
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,440
beer cup just your uh is it a 16 a 20 oz

339
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,278
beer cup your Red Solo Cup you guys you

340
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,000
know what I'm talking about bro uh just

341
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:14,078
get a beer cup poke a few holes in the

342
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,480
bottom of it three four holes take some

343
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,359
scissors stab it a few times uh light up

344
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,680
your poker heat up the poker stab it a

345
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,240
few times put some holes we don't want

346
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,319
it to get stagnant water we want it to

347
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,680
drain so you're going to take your cup

348
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,199
your beer cup you're going to poke a few

349
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,599
holes in it on the very bottom then

350
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:32,078
you're going to fill that with your

351
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,879
favorite your recommended light soil it

352
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,198
could be Light Warrior it could be ocean

353
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,439
Forest it could be happy frog it could

354
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:40,198
be a mixture of the three a soil that's

355
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,880
going to have plenty of drainage and not

356
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:43,599
a lot of nutrients in it we don't want a

357
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,838
lot of nutrients to burn this plant

358
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,199
already so you got a beer cup you've got

359
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,959
light soil at this point uh so the we'll

360
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:53,519
say that the roots are probably 2 and a

361
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,719
half three and a half maybe four inches

362
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,159
long depending on how long that clone

363
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,440
sat in the Clone or [ __ ] waiting for

364
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,120
me to we for weather to get right but

365
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,959
you got some Roots you're going to fill

366
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,399
that cup about 2/3 3/4 of the way

367
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,638
depending on how long the roots are and

368
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,879
how deep you want to go fill that cup up

369
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:12,519
with soil most of the way pack it kind

370
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,320
of not firmly but not tight just get it

371
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,919
in there to where so the roots have to

372
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,839
work their way through there but not

373
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,559
struggle I know that's a hard thing to

374
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,760
judge but you want it packed but not

375
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,559
stuffed so you got that bottom layers in

376
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,159
there I would start lowering the Clone

377
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,439
in there and sprinkle some dirt in there

378
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,399
at the same time what I want to happen

379
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,079
is I don't want the roots to get in big

380
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,559
ball and I don't want them to coil up I

381
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,919
want it to kind of make a spir Ral

382
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,958
around that new dirt that you're putting

383
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,399
in there so spir Ral that around there

384
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,599
so they've got some more to grow if you

385
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,000
ball them up they're going to grow and

386
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,519
get stuck into a big ball so slowly

387
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,559
lower that clone in there if you can get

388
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,919
the Clone this is hard to do I've gotten

389
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,159
very lucky a couple times you got a

390
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,240
little mound of dirt uh like a cone of

391
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,919
dirt inside your cup if you can lower

392
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,278
that clone in there if those roots will

393
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:57,039
spread over that clone over the top over

394
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:59,159
that cone that's so beautiful it's hard

395
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,879
to do it I feel super excited when I see

396
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,519
it happened but it's hard to make happen

397
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,240
anyway we want to spread those roots out

398
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,399
in this medium kind of far get them to

399
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,399
spread that's the best you can do then

400
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,639
fill that plant fill that cup with soil

401
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,480
until that plant is sturdy until it's

402
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,440
staying upright um so you're going to

403
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,800
have roots and then you're going to have

404
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,120
a little bit of stick you can go uh a

405
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,359
quarter a half inch maybe 3/4 of an inch

406
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,120
up that stick and bury that in there so

407
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,759
that it stays sturdy and stays tall

408
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,159
don't go too deep and don't go too tight

409
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,360
is my biggest suggestions if it's too

410
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,719
deep that the part that is buried will

411
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,639
have the potential to get some rot if it

412
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,120
stays too wet too long that part will

413
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,440
start to rot and get funky if you pack

414
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,000
it too tight The Roots can't grow so at

415
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,360
this point we've lowered our clone down

416
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,879
into the dirt we've carefully maneuvered

417
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,560
those roots to they're not in a ball not

418
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,000
in a big coil not in a spiral we've

419
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:49,278
spread them out the best we carefully

420
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,919
can without breaking them then we bury

421
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,439
that plant we don't go too deep we don't

422
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:54,159
want to go too deep to get the rot like

423
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,880
we just talked about we don't want to go

424
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,399
too tight now at this point we're going

425
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,320
to water this plant pack that soil in

426
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,320
there fairly smoothly now we need to

427
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,440
water this plant I would recommend

428
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,120
feeding this plant some microbes at this

429
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,959
time of course I'm going to say recharge

430
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,320
cuz I'm good friends with Scotty Reel

431
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,239
Big shout out to Scotty reel and the

432
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,560
dude grows crew but I would add some

433
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,159
recharge to your water and water this

434
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,359
plant don't give it too much nutrients

435
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:18,958
at this time depending on what you just

436
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,320
potted it into if you put it into

437
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,758
something inert then maybe give it some

438
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,800
very light veg nudes but if you're using

439
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,680
uh most of the fox Farm's products most

440
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,120
of the soil you could buy from the store

441
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,519
you're going to have plenty of nutrients

442
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,560
for a couple of weeks for this little

443
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,639
plant maybe a week or two to get it

444
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,439
started so um we've got our we fill the

445
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,000
cup then we put a little mound in there

446
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,759
we lower the roots onto the mound we

447
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,278
back fill it till it's filled up till

448
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,278
the plant is sturdy pack it in there

449
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:46,480
with our fingers water it with some

450
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,198
microbes when we water it it's going to

451
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,319
disrupt the soil the top soil is going

452
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,479
to get all [ __ ] up you're going to

453
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:52,198
have a hole you're going to have divots

454
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,240
or whatever kind of push that around

455
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,159
with your finger smooth that in and kind

456
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,240
of just pack it in tight enough to where

457
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,519
that plant stays sturdy now at this

458
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,680
point let me check my notes and make

459
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,720
sure we're doing all this according to

460
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:04,318
my notes cuz I haven't looked in a

461
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,480
minute water with microbes okay and then

462
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:09,000
at this point this is where I recommend

463
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,600
getting a clear beer cup if you can get

464
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,839
another clear cup I would put this right

465
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,000
on top don't poke any holes in this one

466
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,959
this is to trap the humidity inside that

467
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,519
plant we need that plant to have limited

468
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,119
air flow and maximum humidity inside of

469
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,759
that little Dome space uh right now that

470
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,480
plant needs to adjust to your new

471
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,278
environment so I would recommend just

472
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,720
put a little Dome over there and let

473
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,240
that Dome just rest over that plant um

474
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,519
it doesn't need to be there for too long

475
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,079
hopefully just a day or two until you

476
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,639
can tell that that plant kind of perks

477
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:39,919
out of its shipping stress it may look a

478
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,639
little pissed off when it comes out of

479
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,318
the box uh put that Dome over there and

480
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,639
let that Dome hang out on top of that

481
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:49,559
plant probably just 12 24 hours see see

482
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,318
what it does if the plant looks turgid

483
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,318
and stiff and it's sturdy and standing

484
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,679
up go ahead and take the Dome off if it

485
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:57,318
looks a little pissed off a little upset

486
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,198
leave that Dome there that will help

487
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:02,159
that plant adjust to its new life if it

488
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:04,480
kind of looks sad you can slowly take it

489
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,038
off and let it adjust slowly leave it on

490
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,519
for a few hours take it off for a few

491
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:09,279
minutes leave it on for a few hours take

492
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,160
it off for a couple more minutes

493
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,399
introduce it slowly that will help that

494
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:17,120
plant out so we got your clear cup uh on

495
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,038
top now I would place it under 186 or

496
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,038
more light what I mean by that is 18

497
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:26,078
hours of light 6 hours off or more you

498
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:28,558
can do uh 195 240 your preference but at

499
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,279
least 18 hours of light um and then I

500
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,119
would use use uh like a T5 light or a

501
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,720
light fluorescent light or just put it

502
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,159
off in the periphery of your big light

503
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,319
uh don't put it right under the big

504
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,640
light that may be too much light for it

505
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:43,759
we need enough light to keep it warm and

506
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,960
to generate humidity in that humidity

507
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,759
Dome is our main function right now keep

508
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,038
it warm and get some humidity going to

509
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,720
get it recovering uh to encourage root

510
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,839
growth once those roots start going the

511
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,880
plant will recover and it will be very

512
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,839
happy once that recharge hits it it'll

513
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,960
get some [ __ ] going so we've got it

514
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,759
covered we've got it under a good light

515
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,079
uh high humidity is really good at this

516
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:07,240
point they should recover quite quickly

517
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,798
I would consider a um a heat mat if your

518
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,038
room is cold maybe put it under a heat

519
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:13,679
mat if you don't have a beer cup maybe

520
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:15,519
you can create some sort of humidity

521
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,880
Dome with another vessel maybe some sort

522
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,879
of clear container uh but it' be a good

523
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,960
idea to cover it some sort of way just

524
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,240
to keep it uh you could take a like a 2

525
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,919
L soda bottle cut the bottom off set

526
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,839
that clean it out of course set that

527
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,440
right on top of there just to minimize

528
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,519
the air flow and the wind and the

529
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,159
outside environment to that plant uh

530
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,879
keep some heat some humidity in there I

531
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,480
keep saying those things but they want

532
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,559
it warm and moist that's going to help

533
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,519
your clone survive then introduce it to

534
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,158
your outdoor envir your your regular

535
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:46,158
growroom environment slowly so that is

536
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,039
the rooted plants uh they should be

537
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,200
pretty sturdy they came from that uh the

538
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:52,119
easy cloner they should have fat Roots

539
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,159
those should work quite well let me

540
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,558
review uh just cuz I did that quickly in

541
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,960
my own head fill the beer cup carefully

542
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,440
pot it carefully water with microbes put

543
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,079
it under light put a dome over that bad

544
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,600
[ __ ] and take care of it slowly and

545
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,158
take that Dome off uh slowly if you want

546
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,519
to introduce it to the environment

547
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,520
slowly now let's talk about the Fresh

548
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,759
Cuts I said before the Fresh Cuts are

549
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,879
definitely uh the more cost effective

550
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,640
the more affordable way if you're good

551
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,080
at rooting a cut this is the way to do

552
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,640
it uh usually they run from 440 to $60

553
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:25,639
for three Cuts sometimes if I have a lot

554
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll throw an extra one in there for you

555
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,720
they're all going to be the same cut

556
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,919
that way there's no confusion that whole

557
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,798
bag is the same thing let's talk about

558
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,520
these rooted Cuts they are fresh cuts

559
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,759
from the mother plant they do not have

560
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:39,720
Roots I want to be very clear about that

561
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:42,079
when we say Snips some people say slips

562
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,839
some people say Cuts uh there are no

563
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,439
roots that is your job I'm going to send

564
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,038
it to you and you if got to root it um I

565
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,159
will take Cuts if you send me Cuts I'm

566
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:52,759
just fine I can root those bad [ __ ]

567
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:54,400
uh This Is How We Do It um so the fresh

568
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,038
cuts come straight from the mother plant

569
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,000
once again a healthy mother plant is a

570
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,919
really important part of this they are

571
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,279
ready to put your easy cloner I

572
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,440
recommend the easy cloner the easy

573
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,399
cloner is real simple we'll talk about

574
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,080
that but they're also ready to put into

575
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,798
clone plugs uh the easy cloner let's

576
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,158
talk about that I'm going to go very

577
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:14,519
quickly uh I will do in the future if

578
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,640
you would like it uh request this in the

579
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:20,759
comments if you want full details on my

580
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,960
full stepbystep how I do clones uh in a

581
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,599
rapid router and dome environment or in

582
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,200
a in an easy cloner environment comment

583
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,038
if I get enough comments on it that you

584
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,319
guys need that guidance and advice to go

585
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,440
full [ __ ] details I'll do that in the

586
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:35,399
next episode or uh in an upcoming

587
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,120
episode but right now we're going to go

588
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,000
kind of quickly on how we do the Clones

589
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,759
but this is I recommend if you've got an

590
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,200
easy cloner you should know how to do it

591
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:44,000
but let's talk about how to do this so

592
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,120
you got the easy cloner the Clones are

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,319
going to come you're going to unwrap

594
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,798
them I would clip off the ends just give

595
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:52,798
them a fresh clip at the ends then um

596
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,839
dip them what do you dip them in your

597
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:58,000
favorite cloning gel I use the purple

598
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,240
clonex gel the purple clonex stuff is

599
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,079
reliable it works very well for me um

600
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,440
let me back up before we even do this

601
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,558
before we even take the Clones out of

602
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,840
the machine out of the [ __ ] package

603
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:12,278
set up the cloning machine 100% uh clean

604
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,519
the clone machine go clean it um however

605
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:15,119
you want to do it you could fill it with

606
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,079
bleach and rinse it out a bunch of times

607
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,798
you can fill it with boiling water you

608
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:22,319
can use fizan it could be brand new make

609
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,440
sure it is clean and sterile and use

610
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,399
good clean clone collars that's harder

611
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,200
to say than it looks so you got a fresh

612
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,640
clone machine it's all set up you've got

613
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,319
your water is in there you've got your

614
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,080
nutrients in there um the EC is right

615
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,278
the pH is correct we'll talk about that

616
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,960
in the upcoming episode it's bubbling

617
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:41,079
it's ready to go the Clone collars are

618
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,720
in there there's a light above it so at

619
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:44,879
this point you take the Clones out you'd

620
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,519
give them a fresh cut just cut the ends

621
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,400
off again brand new give them just trim

622
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,759
the ends just an eighth of an inch cut

623
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,798
those right off then dip those cuts

624
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:57,200
individually into your purple uh clone X

625
00:21:53,798 --> 00:22:00,200
clone gel clip them dip them then stick

626
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,440
them basically Ronco style bro set it

627
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,558
and forget it make sure to label these

628
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,320
clones some way I take a plastic plant

629
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,960
tag and I write the name and I put it

630
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,558
inside the neoprene collar where the

631
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,558
little Pac-Man bites I stick it right in

632
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:14,278
there with the Clone so I've got a label

633
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:16,359
all the time so the easy cloner it's

634
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:19,319
real easy set up the cloner is the most

635
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:21,558
important part clip it dip it stick it

636
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:25,399
put it in the Clone collar label it and

637
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:29,440
let it ride um let those sit um in about

638
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:32,720
24 hours then after 24 hours adjust your

639
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,080
EC your pH and at this point I would

640
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
also add some stuff called clear res

641
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:39,678
follow the instructions on the clear res

642
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,360
bottle why did I tell you to wait 24

643
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,960
hours to adjust the ph and the EC

644
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,479
because all that purple [ __ ] that you

645
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,038
dipped your clones in is going to fall

646
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,519
off your clones or get washed off the

647
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,798
Clones into the water it is now most of

648
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,879
that is in your water now is a good time

649
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:56,759
to adjust the ph and the EC instead of

650
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,120
before if you're using the yellow uh

651
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,640
clonex the piss stuff the clone solution

652
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,158
that goes in the cloner it looks like P

653
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,919
in my opinion uh if you're using it in a

654
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:10,440
cloner or in the plugs I recommend a

655
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,880
solution of 0.9 to 1.1 EC that range is

656
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,038
perfect one is right where you want to

657
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,559
be 0.9 will get you there 1.1 will be

658
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,038
acceptable but I recommend use the

659
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,319
yellow clonex gel or the yellow clonex

660
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,119
solution pour it into your water Stir It

661
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:25,759
Up use an EC meter until it says one

662
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,278
that's right where you want to be that's

663
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,038
what you want your cloner or your

664
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:32,038
solution to measure at

665
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,558
so you got your EC at one the pH I would

666
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:38,079
go about 62 if you can get it to 62 that

667
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,278
would be ideal uh clone pH solution uh

668
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,960
the EC is

669
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:42,319
controversial uh I'm going to tell you

670
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,600
another Secret at the end of the show

671
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,000
follow exactly what that secret says

672
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,558
that will get you there every time so

673
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,278
the cloner is easy set it up uh put the

674
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:53,759
nutrients in there get it running have

675
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,319
it prepared then clip them dip them

676
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,558
stick them label them let it ride for 24

677
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,599
hours then get in there with your EC

678
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,918
meter in your pH pin adjust the EC and

679
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,678
the pH properly and then pour in some

680
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:06,520
clear res and you are good to go with

681
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,840
the clone machine I'm going to take a

682
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:11,079
quick drink and then we're going to talk

683
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,439
about how to do it with your clone plugs

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,200
plugs let's keep going speaking of plugs

698
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,640
I said we were going to talk about how

699
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,480
to take care of your clones in the Clone

700
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,320
plug environment let's jump right into

701
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,599
that let's just say you got some

702
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:54,398
unrooted Cuts in the mail and it is time

703
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,678
to get these bad dogs into some cloners

704
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:58,798
here's how we're going to do it first of

705
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,000
all I recommend you soak your clone

706
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,038
plugs whatever plugs you bought uh if

707
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,640
they're rapid rooters if they're another

708
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,720
brand that I can't even think of the

709
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,159
[ __ ] name of right now I recommend

710
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,640
you fill a vessel uh with water and then

711
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:15,480
you make an EC of 1.0 with that yellow

712
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,919
piss looking uh clonex solution not the

713
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,200
purple one the yellow one is what we

714
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,399
want this time uh use your EC meter uh

715
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,519
you don't have the plugs in there yet

716
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:24,678
you got water uh you got your EC meter

717
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,558
you're adding the solution you're

718
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,200
stirring and making it to get to 1.0 if

719
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:31,038
you go too high add more water you could

720
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,519
just fix it that way that's a way to do

721
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,000
this then um I would even pH the water

722
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,200
at this point uh pH that water to about

723
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,880
62 is is probably where you want to do

724
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,720
it I'm going to give you a hint in a

725
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,080
little while with the exact pH that's

726
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,480
what you're going to want to use so soak

727
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,558
your plugs with the pH uh clone X

728
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,000
solution uh you got the water drop all

729
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,759
the plugs in there now the plugs are in

730
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,159
there take them out one at a time put

731
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,440
them in that clone tray if that's what

732
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,640
you're doing this is the Clone tray

733
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,000
method is what I'm talking about so at

734
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,278
this point you got your plugs soaked

735
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,798
we're going to do the same thing we did

736
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:03,319
before we're going to clip the ends off

737
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,038
of them we're going to dip them in the

738
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:08,000
purple solution and then we're going to

739
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,679
dip them into those clone plugs uh the

740
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,319
Clone plugs are about this tall do not

741
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,278
stick your clone through the bottom of

742
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,240
it I'm going to use a pen and my fingers

743
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,079
as a demonstration here I like to go so

744
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,038
if the Clone plug is this tall I'm going

745
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,158
to say that is we're just going to make

746
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,038
up numbers because I want this to be um

747
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,399
visible uh usable for people who are not

748
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:29,519
watching for people who are just

749
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:31,319
listening I think that clone plug is

750
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,960
about an inch tall maybe an inch and a

751
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:36,359
half tall um I would go if it's an inch

752
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,798
tall I would go 3/4 of an inch into that

753
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,359
plug let's go 3/4 of the way into the

754
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:43,599
plug don't stick your clone all the way

755
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:45,839
out of the bottom that will not live you

756
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,918
need some room for that bad dog to grow

757
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:51,158
some Roots so go about 3/4 of the way in

758
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:54,038
there if that clone plug is an inch tall

759
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,640
go 3/4 of an inch into there maybe just

760
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:57,440
over half of an inch we want to leave

761
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,919
some room for those roots to grow in

762
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,640
there but also we need need plenty to

763
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,080
support that plant cuz it's going to be

764
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,679
living in there it's got to be tall

765
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,918
enough or deep enough to support the

766
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,919
height of that plant so clip them dip

767
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,120
them stick them also you guys here's

768
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,759
another tip when you're taking clones if

769
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:13,199
you've got big leafy cuts that you're

770
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,679
taking don't feel free to cut the

771
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,399
fingers off of those leaves I cut them

772
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,360
right at the knuckles where it gets so

773
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:20,798
the leaves taper they go fatter fatter

774
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,000
fatter and then at some point they start

775
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,918
to go skinnier right where they start to

776
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,720
go skinnier you could chop that [ __ ] off

777
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,600
if you're making a clone we don't need

778
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,519
all that vegetative part in our clone

779
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:32,158
dome in the cloning machine just trim

780
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:33,440
the fingers off your clones I grab them

781
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,520
from the bottom and pull it up and just

782
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,038
give them a little haircut I do it super

783
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,679
quickly I'm real good at it at this

784
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:39,798
point so if you get a clone in the mail

785
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:41,880
from me and it's been all [ __ ]

786
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:43,038
mohawked uh there's several reasons

787
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,080
behind this it's so that when they're in

788
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,480
the cloner they're not overlapping and

789
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,678
touching and creating moisture and

790
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,200
little uh microclimates between each

791
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,159
other which will cause problems in the

792
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,759
long run so clip them dip them uh clean

793
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,240
up the ends of them then stick them into

794
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,879
your clone uh your clone plug then let

795
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,679
me make a quick recommendation if you're

796
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,159
going to put three clones in a clone

797
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,320
tray I also recommend if you've got more

798
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,000
plants that you can get clones from I

799
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,599
would recommend filling this tray the

800
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,240
best you can the reason for that is the

801
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:15,398
amount of humidity in this Dome will be

802
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,558
affected by the amount of plants inside

803
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:18,798
that Dome as well just a small piece of

804
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:21,119
advice it will help you keep the

805
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,278
humidity up in there if you've got more

806
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,119
plants in there so at this point we've

807
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,880
got our clone it's been clipped it's

808
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,599
been dipped it's been hair cuted it's

809
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,080
been stuck into the cloner or into the

810
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:35,158
uh the uh the plug uh 3/4 half to 3/4 of

811
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,879
the way we put a little bit of the

812
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,880
leftover remember that solution we

813
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,360
dunked our clone plugs in earlier

814
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,080
hopefully you didn't throw it away put a

815
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:44,519
little bit of that in the bottom of your

816
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,240
clone tray uh we've got the insert with

817
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,278
the plugs in it and that goes into a

818
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,359
tray put a little bit of that solution

819
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:52,440
into the tray we want to buy ourselves

820
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,839
some moisture to make humidity in this

821
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,399
tray and this Dome is what we're going

822
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,278
to do so just a little bit maybe just

823
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,558
splash enough in there just to cover the

824
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,319
bottom so it's not dry just cover that

825
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,678
bottom eventually that moisture is going

826
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,960
to come up to the top and become

827
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,360
humidity and fall back down also I want

828
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,000
to take now this is what I'm going to do

829
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:12,479
I'm going to take the Dome the lid to

830
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,119
this tray I'm going to cover and close

831
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,399
all the plugs all the holes on that

832
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,038
thing I'm going to cover all the vents

833
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:18,359
is the word I'm looking for going to

834
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,158
cover all the vents then I'm going to

835
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:22,240
get a spray bottle and I'm going to

836
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,840
spray the inside of that Dome so it's

837
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,200
nice and Misty it looks like it got all

838
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,678
humid already I'm going to set myself up

839
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,440
ahead of time here and just Mist it and

840
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,278
get some water in there then I'm going

841
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,919
to put that on top of that tray now I've

842
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,240
got my freshly cut clones and they're

843
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,480
all labeled let me back up a step let's

844
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,798
[ __ ] remember to label each and every

845
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,640
one of these clones very carefully uh

846
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,200
like I said before I use the plant tags

847
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,519
just a long tall skinny plant tag write

848
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,679
the name of the plant on there and stick

849
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,880
it right behind that plug inside that

850
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,720
tray that way you can't get any mixups

851
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,799
you know that every plant's got a tag in

852
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,360
there so label them now we put the Dome

853
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:00,879
on there we've got a dome a tray filled

854
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:02,918
with cuts waiting to get rooted this

855
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,600
point I would put this Dome under like a

856
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:08,519
T5 light or a light what are they called

857
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,678
a an LED light I forgot what an LED was

858
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:14,359
uh put these put the Dome under a nice

859
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:17,278
light and put it on 24 hours of light if

860
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:20,199
you can 186 would be acceptable 24 hours

861
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:23,159
would be best so you got your Dome uh

862
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,798
also maybe put that on a heat mat uh the

863
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,519
heat mat will help you out be careful

864
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:29,599
not to barbecue the Clones I've seen so

865
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,200
many people people uh just boil in

866
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,639
barbecue clones you don't want it that

867
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,240
hot you want it warm not boiling so um

868
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,600
let me make sure I've got my notes here

869
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,720
cuz I'm just rambling and trying to get

870
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,240
this out of my head um spray the Dome

871
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,480
cover the Dome put it on the heat mat

872
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,278
put it under the light let that ride for

873
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,079
about 4 days you're not going to have to

874
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:51,359
check on that for three or four maybe

875
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:53,319
five or six days look at it visually uh

876
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,278
tap that D if there's no humidity in the

877
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:57,319
dome you need to open it and create some

878
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,798
humidity maybe spray in there or check

879
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:01,278
on the moisture level of those plugs but

880
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:03,759
you should be able to walk by and look

881
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,720
at it and there should be humidity built

882
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,079
up on that Dome tap it the humidity will

883
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,038
fall off look through the Dome at that

884
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,638
point and look into the plugs look at

885
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,720
the color of the plugs you'll start to

886
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:16,759
tell that they look dry do they look

887
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,278
moist do they look wet you'll be able to

888
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:21,679
tell by looking at them by the color of

889
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:24,000
the plugs we want to keep them moist but

890
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,919
not dripping and not soggy but they need

891
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,359
to be wet all the way through from top

892
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,120
to bottom so if you see those Clon plug

893
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:33,439
starting to get dry what I recommend

894
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,479
take that same solution we made earlier

895
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,880
the 1.0 solution of the clonex solution

896
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,079
pH at 6.2 6.4 or check the thing I'm

897
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,120
going to tell you for the absolute

898
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,359
detail in a minute put some of that in a

899
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:48,759
spray bottle just a basic your spray

900
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:51,439
bottle right and spray those plugs until

901
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:53,038
they're nice and moist again and then

902
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,000
cover them back up and then put them

903
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:58,000
back under that light leave them there

904
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,759
just like that for about 7 Days around

905
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,440
day seven you can start cracking those

906
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,158
vents a little bit more and a little bit

907
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,519
more once you're comfortable with the

908
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,080
vents all the way open then you can

909
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,159
start taking the Dome off take the Dome

910
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,158
off for 15 minutes a day put it back on

911
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,360
for the rest of the day take it off for

912
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,720
30 minutes the next day 45 minutes

913
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,479
slowly increase your interval until you

914
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,558
start seeing those roots growing out of

915
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,240
those plugs you will see them uh they'll

916
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:23,440
start getting fat healthy Roots if you

917
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,839
do this correctly at which time then you

918
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,558
can plop those into a beer cup and treat

919
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,398
them just like the other cuts that I was

920
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:32,759
talking about let me check my notes here

921
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,798
um slowly open the domes and increase

922
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,599
the interval until roots are developed

923
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,359
is what I got now here's where I'm going

924
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,480
to tell you about the secret that I keep

925
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,519
hinting about I have got a Discord

926
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,360
server it is the IR Army Discord server

927
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,359
there will be a link in the show notes

928
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:50,599
and in the video description there's

929
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,319
also a link on my website IR

930
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:55,519
genetics.com it says Discord click on

931
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:58,000
there it will take you to my Discord

932
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,679
server a lot of people are overwhelmed

933
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,038
and confused by Discord it's not as

934
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,360
challenging as it looks I'm going to

935
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:03,359
open it right now on my computer here

936
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,599
