Department officials said retailers

58
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:06,409

66
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:21,078
owners of the two impacted businesses

67
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,298
summit wellness which operates as Denver

68
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,310
rec Denver recreational dispensary and

69
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:28,310
sacred seed confirmed they were removing

70
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,878
products from their store shelves it's

71
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,218
true

72
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,018
Denver rec owner James Monaco told the

73
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:34,818
Denver Post about the recall we're

74
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,319
working through the process and we'll

75
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:38,598
have a statement on our Twitter feed

76
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,280
later tonight the sacred seed recall

77
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:42,318
apparently was the result of pesticides

78
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,519
a rogue employee secretly applied in the

79
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,518
middle of the night without permission

80
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,109
CEO Jeremy Kilbourne told the Post now

81
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,280
is that just an excuse you guys or do

82
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:50,540
you think that that really happened do

83
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,549
you think they really had a rogue

84
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,798
employee go in the grow rooms in the

85
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:57,349
middle of the night and spray pesticides

86
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,760
now that pesticide had to be in the damn

87
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:00,199
building for that dude to put in the

88
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,000
sprayer it means he had to go to the

89
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,500
store he had to buy a pesticide he had

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,359
to drive to work he had to wait for

91
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,650
everybody else to leave he had to mix

92
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,780
that [ __ ] up and then he had to spray

93
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,789
this [ __ ] on the plants I'm not gonna

94
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,949
like call them out and say [ __ ] but

95
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:15,370
I might say that I'm not completely sure

96
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:18,619
I completely buy that whole story

97
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:21,379
because how would they know that a rogue

98
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,599
employee did that if nobody ever said

99
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:26,810
anything until the [ __ ] was tested and

100
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,009
found spray on it like did they just go

101
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,719
oh yeah that was that time that that guy

102
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,858
did that they didn't know that I feel

103
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,299
like they just made that up the more I

104
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:35,659
talk about it the more I feel like they

105
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:37,939
are just using that as a cop-out anyway

106
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:41,418
I want to get back into the article the

107
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:43,340
next paragraph lists all of the origin

108
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:45,019
are mcf numbers on all of the products

109
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,259
that are recalled because I don't feel

110
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:49,430
the need to read all of these numbers

111
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:51,138
90% of my audience is not in Colorado

112
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,879
anyway so most of you guys don't have

113
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,519
any of these products if you bought

114
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,289
mahatma products you may want to contact

115
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,688
the dispensary where you got them and

116
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:01,459
you may want to get a refund so i'm

117
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:03,198
going to continue it says as in the

118
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,789
city's prior marijuana recall return

119
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,530
products cannot be sold until additional

120
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:09,078
testing clears them of residues of the

121
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,359
disallowed pesticides the businesses

122
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,400
also have the discretion to destroy them

123
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,409
we're in a state of shock Kilburn said

124
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,239
we pulled everything off of our shelves

125
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:19,098
self quarantined our grow and our

126
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,750
product we don't wholesale so no one has

127
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:22,550
our product out there except the small

128
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,038
amount of trim for processing the

129
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,110
product subject to the recall had been

130
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:29,000
tested at Muhammad Mahatma concentrates

131
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,980
in Denver which was already under

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,959
recall issued September 8th for its own

133
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,090
products that had tested positive for

134
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,589
pesticides that state agriculture

135
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:39,049
officials have not cleared for the use

136
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:40,549
on cannabis the city's inquiry of

137
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,009
Mahatma extended to several businesses

138
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,050
that send it marijuana trimmings for

139
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:47,000
processing into edible concentrates such

140
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,470
as wax and shatter which are then

141
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,290
returned or distributed to different

142
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,600
stores as a result of the first recall

143
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,610
Mahatma beacon pesticide testing on all

144
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,950
marijuana trimmings that arrived in its

145
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,050
Denver facility it was that testing that

146
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,209
found pesticides in the latest recalled

147
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,949
products Gilbert said Mahama

148
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:05,599
informed him of the test results and the

149
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,639
company immediately contacted officials

150
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,379
at the Colorado marijuana Enforcement

151
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,029
Division we're going to be getting a

152
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,769
tested and figuring out the extent of

153
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:14,869
damage and destroying materials or

154
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:15,259
throwing it out however environmental

155
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,209
help

156
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:19,969
however environmental health wants us to

157
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:22,639
do Kilbourne said we're reeling we're

158
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,440
reeling right now Kilburn said the

159
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,449
sacred seed employee responsible for the

160
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,339
pesticide misuse had left on Tuesday and

161
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:31,039
offered an explanation in a resignation

162
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:33,560
letter he said I'm so sorry we had a

163
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,450
minor bug problem and I was concerned we

164
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,519
were going to lose the crop Kilburn said

165
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:40,250
of the lighter not only did we tell him

166
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,649
not to use those pesticides we had sent

167
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,418
him on to and two others to specialized

168
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:46,699
pesticide handlers training through the

169
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:49,490
Colorado Department of Agriculture it

170
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:51,409
was unclear how Dan rec learned of the

171
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,509
test results Denver inspectors said they

172
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,090
only found application log books for the

173
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,589
past 30 days at Dan ray and the business

174
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:01,939
that older ones had been destroyed

175
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:04,039
reports show this is weird a letter of

176
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:05,719
resignation with an apology and

177
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,460
destroyed evident evidence this is

178
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,919
turning into a cannabis soap opera this

179
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:11,389
is kind of neat the CDA issued a list

180
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,370
earlier this year of products it says

181
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:15,139
can be used on marijuana because the

182
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,000
drug is illegal under federal law no

183
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,709
pesticide is specifically approved for

184
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,478
use on cannabis but some label

185
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,799
restrictions are so broadly written that

186
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,139
using the chemical would not violate

187
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,850
them federal law mandates that no

188
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,279
pesticide may be used in a manner that

189
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,870
is not consistent with its label most

190
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,000
marijuana growers are not well informed

191
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,879
about pesticide use and the rules behind

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,259
them CDA CDA officials have said so what

193
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,209
appears to solve a problem in a

194
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:41,089
greenhouse could actually be a violation

195
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:42,769
of law pesticides are regulated by the

196
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:44,719
US Environmental Protection

197
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:48,769
see and it offers no information about

198
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,460
marijuana because the drug is illegal so

199
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:54,318
now we are not able to test pesticides

200
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,448
on cannabis to find out the long-term

201
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,520
effect to find out how long that product

202
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,840
stays in the cannabis to find out how

203
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,329
much of it actually makes it to the

204
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,339
concentrate it's illegal to test these

205
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:06,109
pesticides on cannabis in the way that

206
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:09,408
we need to do it to find what combats

207
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,900
are our problems because cannabis is

208
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:12,918
federally illegal I'm sure you guys know

209
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,469
where I'm headed with this right the

210
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:16,899
solution to this problem right I'm sure

211
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,909
you guys all want to say it with me

212
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:21,228
legalize cannabis then we can test this

213
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:22,639
[ __ ] properly and we'll solve this

214
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:25,098
problem just legalize it they can make

215
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,139
money off of the testing labs would make

216
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:30,139
money there's another avenue of revenue

217
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,519
right there so there are more products

218
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:34,129
being recalled you guys because of

219
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,870
pesticides Mihama concentrates is

220
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,610
actually taking it upon themselves to

221
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,340
start testing everything that comes in

222
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,050
before they run it before they do the

223
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:44,508
extraction process they were testing all

224
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,090
the material that comes in I give kudos

225
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,560
to Mahatma that is a bold step and that

226
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:50,179
is a brave thing to do they have to pay

227
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,680
for the testing which costs money and

228
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,269
then they're also going to lose

229
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,829
clientele because anything that does

230
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:57,620
come back with the contaminate and it

231
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:59,810
cannot be ran so big shout out to

232
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,028
Mahatma you guys if you're coming to

233
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,949
Colorado to buy products I want you to

234
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:06,079
feel safe and this is what we're doing

235
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,028
to make you feel safe we're making sure

236
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,098
there are not ridiculous pesticides in

237
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:12,848
here and they mentioned that Department

238
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:15,978
of Agriculture applicators training

239
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:18,319
course in this article if you are

240
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:22,129
growing cannabis I recommend that you go

241
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,229
and read your state's pesticide

242
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,028
applicators training manual or

243
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:27,680
certification manual whatever it is it

244
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:29,389
varies state by state but your

245
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,709
Department of Agriculture in your state

246
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:35,180
will have a an applicators training

247
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,278
guide or a certification guide or

248
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,199
something go read it you will learn so

249
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,570
much about pesticides about pesticide

250
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,908
use about pesticide safety you will

251
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,920
learn that most of these products are

252
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:47,838
all derived from the same thing and they

253
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:51,049
are mixed with other carrier agents and

254
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,330
that alone will be a useful tool in your

255
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:55,370
ganja growing arsenal

256
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,980
I do in the future plan on doing an

257
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,139
integrated pest management episode I've

258
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,670
got two people lined up that I want to

259
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,199
have on that show and getting them here

260
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:05,240
at the same time has been a challenge I

261
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,250
may just do two separate episodes and

262
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,360
get them both on separate episodes all

263
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,440
right that was the news article that I

264
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,120
wanted to read you guys I want to keep

265
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,070
you guys updated on what's going on here

266
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,570
in Denver or up in Denver I'm not in

267
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,760
Denver but here in Colorado up in Denver

268
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,920
about 100 miles south of Denver you guys

269
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,629
but I want to keep you going updated on

270
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,539
what's going on let you know how this

271
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:25,879
pesticide drama has been going and I

272
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:27,829
wanted to kind of give props to Mahatma

273
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:29,899
concentrates for just stepping up their

274
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,520
game they're testing everything now they

275
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,049
found out they had a problem instead of

276
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,340
trying to hide it they're like hey we

277
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:36,109
[ __ ] up and look what we're gonna do

278
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,790
we're gonna test everything it's gonna

279
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,129
make a lot of people accountable and I

280
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:42,500
like the way that this industry is

281
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:44,000
moving all right I do want to talk about

282
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,710
one more thing you guys this is just

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,289
going to be a short episode this is just

284
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,759
a bonus Thursday episode I wanted to get

285
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:51,709
that news article out but since I'm here

286
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:55,159
recording I want to talk about something

287
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,620
that I saw a few days ago while I was at

288
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,939
a consultation a lot of times when I go

289
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,190
to a consultation that people will have

290
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,830
a problem that they need corrected but

291
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,210
sometimes they just want me to observe

292
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,310
what they're doing and see what we can

293
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,810
improve or make easier for them that

294
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:11,419
will make their cannabis crop come out a

295
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:13,039
little bit better so um I want to tell

296
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:15,860
you guys a little something about what I

297
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,809
saw at a consultation with a client a

298
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,190
few days ago and I just want to kind of

299
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:20,689
correct this and I don't know if you're

300
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,850
doing this wrong or if you could be

301
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,200
doing this better but I'm sure that

302
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,440
there are a couple people out there who

303
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,000
will benefit from this so I was just

304
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,190
watching this guy work in his garden I

305
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,509
just showed up at his house I was like

306
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,650
what's up man I know you need help let's

307
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,539
go check it out and we walked out there

308
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,039
and he said I saved all my chores for

309
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,360
when you got here and we're just gonna

310
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,219
do my gardening and I was like that

311
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,600
sounds great and so I helped him out a

312
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,120
filled some buckets and we did what we

313
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,700
did and I watched him now the first

314
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,919
thing this dude did that I corrected was

315
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,530
this guy gets a five gallon bucket and

316
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:53,149
He pours his nutrients into a glass to

317
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,709
measure and then he pours all the

318
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:58,100
nutrients into the five gallon bucket

319
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:00,320
you guys you cannot do that um I will

320
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,629
explain why I am NOT a scientist but I

321
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,370
know why these are the reason that

322
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:06,230
they're sold in different bottles so if

323
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,799
you go by I'm just gonna use advanced

324
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,509
nutrients

325
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,000
it's the product that it's popped up in

326
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:13,159
my mind they've got they've got a flower

327
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,320
a they've got a flower bee and then

328
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,449
there's like a bloom booster and then

329
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,278
there's like a flavor booster advanced

330
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,320
nutrients has so many bottles the reason

331
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,769
those are all sold separately is because

332
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:28,459
if they put those products all into one

333
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:31,070
container ah the elements in there will

334
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:33,649
bond that's why we need to add those

335
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,300
products to water and never mix them

336
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,309
together concentrate those are very

337
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:39,559
concentrated products you're only adding

338
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:41,750
a few milliliters to 5 gallons of water

339
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,219
so the first thing I'm gonna say is fill

340
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,990
up your container that you're going to

341
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,600
mix into probably a five gallon bucket

342
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,180
filled out with water first preferably a

343
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,009
reverse osmosis water but we can't all

344
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,528
do that so fill your five-gallon bucket

345
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:56,659
with water always fill it with water

346
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:59,088
first then add the nutrients to the

347
00:11:56,659 --> 00:12:01,730
water never mix nutrients without water

348
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:03,260
they are buffered they are sold

349
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,970
separately for a reason they are

350
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,919
buffered and chelated and they are not

351
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,980
meant to be mixed in concentrate

352
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,929
together so the best I can recommend is

353
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,430
to either mix them into a 1 gallon

354
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:15,559
pitcher so that if you do make a mistake

355
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:17,659
you don't waste 5 gallons of water or

356
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:19,759
just mix the nutrients one at a time

357
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:21,740
into your 5 gallon bucket but never pour

358
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,360
them in concentrate form into a

359
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,639
container together that is not a good

360
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,800
thing you're causing problems already so

361
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,659
fill your bucket get a pitcher of water

362
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:32,449
from that bucket mix your nutrient

363
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:33,980
solution into the pitcher use a quality

364
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,180
measuring device you guys go get

365
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,250
something from the gross store or a

366
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:39,828
scientific store the stuff you use for

367
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,690
your kitchen is close but it is not

368
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:43,699
going to be as accurate as something you

369
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,920
could get from the gross store and do

370
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,300
not use something from the kitchen and

371
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,889
then put it back in the kitchen you

372
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,689
can't use the same [ __ ] you've got to

373
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:52,278
have a dedicated one for your grow you

374
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,360
don't want to be mixing your whatever

375
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:55,159
kind of food you're mixing you're

376
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,169
measuring out your vanilla extract and

377
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:58,519
the same damn measuring device that

378
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:59,360
you're mixing up your nutrients don't do

379
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,980
that that's tacky

380
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,509
and it's unsanitary it's either gonna

381
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,278
get you sick or your plants sick don't

382
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:06,289
[ __ ] with that go get some some

383
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:07,909
dedicated stuff so measure really

384
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:10,778
carefully you guys be accurate with your

385
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:12,919
measurements if it says 25 milliliters

386
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:14,838
ok well here's something I should say if

387
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,969
the bottle says 50 milliliters probably

388
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,860
use half of that to start I have never

389
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,980
needed to use as much as recommended on

390
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,840
the bottle the

391
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,190
nutrient companies want you to buy more

392
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,620
if they recommend that you use a little

393
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,060
bit extra so you don't always have to

394
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,649
use as much as it says start with maybe

395
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:29,219
a half two thirds and work your way up

396
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,289
from there

397
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,840
but measure carefully if you're trying

398
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:36,209
to put in 25 milliliters measure 25

399
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,830
milliliters write it down so that if

400
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,889
something goes wrong you know next time

401
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,480
that 26 or 27 isn't what you did 25 is

402
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:44,850
what you did and it either worked or it

403
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,710
did not so 25 is your number to go to

404
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,080
next time and adjust from there so

405
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,340
measure carefully like I just said take

406
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,960
notes all the time I should always

407
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,009
remind you guys to take notes always

408
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,780
take notes when you're growing cannabis

409
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,519
it's the only way you know what you did

410
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,079
and what you didn't do and what worked

411
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,059
and what didn't work I know you're gonna

412
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,230
think I'll remember doing that you're

413
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,639
growing cannabis which means you're

414
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,990
probably smoking cannabis which means

415
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,080
you're gonna forget so write that [ __ ]

416
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,879
down so now you've got everything

417
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,550
measured right you've taken a pitcher of

418
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,169
water you've poured your grow a into a

419
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:15,419
small measuring device dump that into

420
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:17,159
the pitcher pour B into the measuring

421
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,159
device dump that in the pitcher all your

422
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,629
additives put that into there then clean

423
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,100
out your measuring device you guys go

424
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:24,929
clean it right now before you do

425
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,129
anything else go clean it all right so

426
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:28,649
now you've got a pitcher dump that

427
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:30,419
pitcher into your five gallon bucket

428
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:33,769
with water in there so now you've got

429
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:35,759
five gallons of perfectly mixed water

430
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,049
yeah if you do make a mistake all you

431
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,159
gotta do is dump out that pitcher and

432
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:39,539
then just start fresh of course you

433
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,159
wasted your nutrients but you didn't

434
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:42,360
just dump out five gallons of water you

435
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:44,519
don't have to wait for a five-gallon

436
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,740
bucket to refill it'll help you out if

437
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,059
you're using reverse osmosis water you

438
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,399
just saved even more because when you

439
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,869
make reverse osmosis water there's a lot

440
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,459
of water that gets thrown away so it's

441
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,009
hard to it's hard to waste water when

442
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,200
you're using reverse osmosis water let's

443
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:00,090
see um so now you've got your bucket

444
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,980
it's filled with your nutrient solution

445
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:05,759
it's filled with water now it's time to

446
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,620
test the pH I've seen people adjust the

447
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,169
pH of their water before they add the

448
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,539
nutrients which is a fail because you're

449
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:14,519
going to pH it and then put [ __ ] in it

450
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:16,349
yeah so once you've got all of your

451
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,809
nutrients in there every single nutrient

452
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,540
that is when you adjust the pH use pH up

453
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:24,299
or pH down to correct it write it down

454
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:27,149
you guys write down the pH if you get it

455
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:30,509
at 6.5 write it down if you get it at

456
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:31,889
6.3 write that down if it's 6.7 write it

457
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:32,850
down if you're in hydro you're going

458
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,370
lower

459
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,620
I'll write it the [ __ ] down so that when

460
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,110
you see those plants doing something you

461
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,278
know if you were right or wrong with

462
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,230
your measurement and you have a

463
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,600
reference for where to go to next time

464
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,730
you can't make adjustments if you don't

465
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,990
know what you did last time so now we've

466
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,670
got our nutrients mixed up in a

467
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,659
five-gallon bucket we've got it properly

468
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:56,429
pH to about 6.5 we wrote that down we

469
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:59,399
wrote down how much nutrients we've used

470
00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:01,138
now it's time to water each plant

471
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,389
you guys when you go watering the plants

472
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,799
this is something that I saw my my

473
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:06,990
client do the other day he poured the

474
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,028
water directly in the center of the pot

475
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,759
right over the stalk right into the

476
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:13,740
middle of the dam plan um if you're

477
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,839
using enough water that'll work but

478
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,909
here's what I would recommend it is

479
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,160
wiser and more healthy for the plant to

480
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:22,139
start on the outer edge of the plant

481
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,730
because the roots that are newer and

482
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,159
fresher and growing and searching for

483
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,690
water are those outer roots so you want

484
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,179
to get the outer perimeter of the dirt

485
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,889
wet the inside of the root zone there

486
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:34,109
the water will work its way in because

487
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:36,060
the roots will pull it there so think

488
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,159
about a cannabis plant let's envision a

489
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:40,169
cannabis plant standing there out in a

490
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,879
field by itself or with other friends

491
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:43,979
whichever you got a cannabis plant

492
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,688
standing there the leaves hang off of it

493
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,039
in sort of like a tent shape if you

494
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:48,719
think about it it's like a tent it's

495
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,299
protecting the inside of that plant from

496
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,069
moisture so when the rain hits it if

497
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:54,688
rain comes down from the sky rain hits

498
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:56,849
the plant and it's being brought out to

499
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:59,099
the outer edge of the plant hardly any

500
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,889
water will land on the ground near the

501
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,060
stalk of that plant because all the

502
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:06,209
leaves are pushing it out to the

503
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:09,298
perimeter so I kind of believe that a

504
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:11,610
plant will grow as wide as its root mass

505
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,500
will allow it so if you water the outer

506
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,029
edge of that pot then your plants gonna

507
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,099
grow wider because it's gonna feel like

508
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:18,568
it's getting more water also that

509
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,668
whiteness of the plant should kind of

510
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:22,859
represent the root mass so when the rain

511
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,538
comes down the rain will drip off of the

512
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,009
plant and fall right at the perimeter of

513
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:27,929
the plant and that's where those roots

514
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:29,609
are in my opinion and so it'll drink

515
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:31,380
that right up and it also if you water

516
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:33,058
the outside of that it'll keep your

517
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,409
roots active so don't go dumping the

518
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:36,210
water right in the middle of the pot

519
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:37,799
kind of try to water around the outer

520
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,450
edge I mean you're gonna want to soak

521
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:41,639
the soil anyway but make sure you get

522
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,929
that outer area wet that's that's the

523
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,530
important part not right there in the

524
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,559
middle

525
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:48,178
one good way to do that you guys if you

526
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,579
have time and I hope you do make a

527
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,440
little mound around your stock just grab

528
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:54,298
a handful of the soil in the in the pot

529
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,890
and just kind of make a little a cone

530
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:57,599
Euler shape like a mound around the

531
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,370
stock so that when you water the water

532
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,259
runs down that and runs towards the

533
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:04,229
edges of the pots that's what I would

534
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:06,058
recommend so my point is trying to get

535
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,980
the water to the outer edge of the pot

536
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:09,119
not so much in the center so that's a

537
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,440
couple of things that I saw at a

538
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,538
consultation that I thought I would

539
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,048
share with you guys also you guys clean

540
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:17,700
up after yourselves umm don't do

541
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:19,650
something tomorrow that could be done

542
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,240
today because when you start getting

543
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,100
lazy as a grower that's when you fall

544
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,019
behind that's when [ __ ] gets messy when

545
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:27,240
[ __ ] gets behind and messy is when you

546
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:28,889
have problems when you're growing on a

547
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,750
professional level and you're trying to

548
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,159
have professional quality buds for

549
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,990
yourself and your clients and your

550
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,460
patients and whatever you whoever else

551
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,200
you're growing for you need to be in

552
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,298
there every day you need to be diligent

553
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,980
you need to be on top of [ __ ] nothing

554
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:43,168
can wait until tomorrow if it needs to

555
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,630
be done today you should probably get in

556
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:46,919
there and do it today because plants are

557
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,840
only alive if you think about it your

558
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,809
plants are only alive they're in flower

559
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,099
for nine weeks that's 63 days plants

560
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:56,339
only live for about a hundred days

561
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,719
indoors maybe 120 150 at the most so

562
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:59,759
you've only got a hundred and fifty days

563
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,950
why not make every single day for your

564
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,839
plant count right your patients will

565
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,669
know it your flowers will show it in the

566
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,279
end it'll be well worth your time just

567
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:09,450
get in there and do that [ __ ] um let's

568
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,700
see I want to talk a little bit about

569
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:14,220
defoliation a little bit I've been

570
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,740
experimenting with defoliation what that

571
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,319
is is just going and taking off all of

572
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,630
the big fan leaves early and flower I

573
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,849
put two plants side by side the same

574
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,110
exact strain I used a Jeff Shoji because

575
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:28,168
it's something I'm very familiar with

576
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:31,678
and I tore off all of the fan leaves on

577
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:33,630
one plant odd about a week into flower I

578
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,210
all of the fan leaves if there was a pea

579
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,950
deal I cut that leaf off at the PD all

580
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,110
right at the stem so this plant looked

581
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,419
completely naked it was just a bunch of

582
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:43,649
buds up a stick there were no leaves and

583
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,788
the one next to it looks like a big

584
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,580
leafy pot plant

585
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:49,470
um as time went on the leaves grew back

586
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:52,199
you guys I went and cut those leaves off

587
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:54,450
again I did it about every seven to ten

588
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,808
days I was in there cutting off major

589
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,999
amounts of leaf off of these plants

590
00:19:56,808 --> 00:20:00,980
uh it started growing so much leaf

591
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:02,659
toward week six that it looked just like

592
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,429
the plant next to it that I had never D

593
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,259
foliated it was spitting out a lot of

594
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:07,580
leaf but I kept cutting him off there

595
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:10,069
his little tiny leaves just trying to

596
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:12,408
grow out um I wasn't getting too crazy

597
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:16,759
it was my first time trying it but I

598
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:18,470
noticed that the lower buds got chunkier

599
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,509
I didn't think it would work that way

600
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,129
because my opinion has always been that

601
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:23,778
those bigger leaves were the solar

602
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:26,628
collectors they got off the light from

603
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:29,509
my plant they gave the plant energy um I

604
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:31,668
may have to experiment more with this

605
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:33,378
defoliating I've noticed they get a

606
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:35,659
little better airflow the plants seem to

607
00:20:33,378 --> 00:20:38,178
be just happier when I cut down a lot of

608
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:41,149
the leaf so you guys if you have some

609
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,710
leaves that are shadowing a bud or if

610
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:44,778
your plant looks a little bit too leafy

611
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,610
I encourage you to choose one plant in

612
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:48,648
your garden and maybe experiment with a

613
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:49,819
little bit of extreme defoliation you

614
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,589
don't have to go extreme if you don't

615
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:54,378
want to but if you want to the plants

616
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:56,418
will handle it you guys um I think I got

617
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,609
on the one plant that I did not

618
00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:00,860
defoliate it was in a seven gallon pot I

619
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:04,008
got five and a half ounces of Jeff SOG

620
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:06,678
in the plant that was d foliated I got

621
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:08,028
six and a quarter so that's three

622
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,528
quarters of an ounce which is not a

623
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:12,138
whole lot of a difference when you go

624
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:13,970
buy a whole room but that's still 21

625
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:15,498
grams of cannabis just by cutting off

626
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,028
some leaves and I did everything else

627
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:20,118
the same you guys the plants looked very

628
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:21,499
similar up until that moment so that's a

629
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:23,298
little bit of defoliating if you guys

630
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:24,589
have any comments or if you want to know

631
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:25,849
more about that let me know that's just

632
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:26,359
something I was playing with in my

633
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:27,949
garden

634
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,859
and I thought I would share it with you

635
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,960

00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,849
on a future episode

656
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,279
the reason that I want you guys to leave

657
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:15,049
comments and give me a 5-star rating is

658
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,299
because that's what moves me up in the

659
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:19,099
ranks and iTunes and if I move up in the

660
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,230
ranks and iTunes more people will see

661
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:23,419
the show they'll put my my logo up there

662
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,799
in the hot [ __ ] section somewhere and

663

664
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,700
listen and then more people will learn

665
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,990
