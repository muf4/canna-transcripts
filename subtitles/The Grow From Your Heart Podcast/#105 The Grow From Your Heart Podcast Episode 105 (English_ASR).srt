45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,420
the news article talk about it something

46
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:46,450
weird happened here recently in Colorado

47
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,189
Snoop Dogg has signed a deal with live

48
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,439
well a dispensary he'll appear in

49
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:52,809
Colorado to produce a strain of cannabis

50
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:55,599
and market this cannabis under the Snoop

51
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,618
Dogg name at live well now that sounds

52
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,938
like a really cool thing but wills

53
00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,640
looking at me and shaking his head kind

54
00:01:57,938 --> 00:02:01,739
of to the side kind of like yeah if you

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,390
guys have heard the show in the past

56
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,399
we've reported about Live Well putting a

57
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,709
whole bunch of shitty-ass pesticides in

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,598
their cannabis if you come to Colorado

59
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:12,128
and you shop it live well you'll be

60
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,658
disappointed because it's pretty much

61
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:14,769
like going to the shittiest street

62
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:17,560
dealer you can ever find

63
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,630
and buying the shittiest dirt weed you

64
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,759
can find for way too much money and it

65
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:24,639
always seems old like old weed

66
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,530
yeah yeah just old and it's probably

67
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:32,349
because they're using pesticides and low

68
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:34,030
quality grow times so I think it's

69
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,430
really weird that Snoop has come and

70
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,110
done a deal with the shittiest like

71
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,750
they've got the reputation for being the

72
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,240
shittiest dispensary in Colorado soups

73
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,009
publicist or publishing or public people

74
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,379
should have done a lot more research on

75
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:51,609
this [ __ ] this is a fail on publicists

76
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,689
yeah it's their fault that guy failed

77
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,940
they should have done a little more work

78
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:57,099
and I'm also curious I am NOT a law

79
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,719
expert but snoop is not a Colorado

80
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,849
resident how is snoop able to

81
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,530
participate in a Colorado cannabis

82
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:03,789
business I'm very curious about that so

83
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,469

110
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,729

00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:00,189
dude you brought some great looking

112
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:01,389
pieces with you man the piece right in

113
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:06,039
front of me is is that called Illuminati

114
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:07,689
or is that this is haterade alright very

115
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:09,459
special okay that's a good that's a good

116
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:11,439
random question where did these names

117
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,270
come from big blast night the color of

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,379
the glass yeah whoever the company that

119
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,199
makes it or the person that pulls it

120
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:21,819
okay each one there's like glass alchemy

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:25,300
mountain glass arts and then tapi tubes

122
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:26,319
en el burro here in Denver okay just

123
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,030
bunch of different companies that pull

124
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,480
different colors and they name it

125
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,979
whatever they

126
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,720
there's a few that go across the board

127
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,610
like blue Stardust is one that every

128
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,140
company most likely has okay but then

129
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,699
there's a few I can't think of any off

130
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:39,550
the top of my head but that are just

131
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:41,649
specifically a company made them okay so

132
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,850
is this a common color or is this poor

133
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,109
it's a pretty common one yeah all right

134
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,300
all right so what's the difference

135
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,030
between haterade slime and Illuminati

136
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,590
Illuminati is UV reactive Illuminati

137
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,059
have to just like hater a pretty much

138
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:54,250
little bit more on the yellow side

139
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,509
probably but is UV reactive so when you

140
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,920
hit it with the UV light he glows

141
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:58,329
it's hope it's pretty neat I've got a

142
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,699
little Pandey from shout out to ghost

143
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:02,319
cat glass with some UV in it all right

144
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:09,729
and then slime of course is a little

145
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:11,290
it's like white in it sometimes how you

146
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,610
stretch it and pull it all right so you

147
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,350
guys we're already learning we learned

148
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,520
the difference Illuminati glasses really

149
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,350
cool you guys it's real hip if you're

150

290
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,259
shout-out to [ __ ] glass here because he

291
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,870
was one of the first in my opinion to

292
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,039
start using this and he even posted

293
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,480
about it a while ago I was when before

294
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,278
even bangers were a thing it was emails

295
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,778
when he nails were a big thing he was

296
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,179
one of the first people to start going

297
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,259
back to the original female joint as

298
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:18,059
opposed to the male joint that people

299
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,208
were using for dabbing because he

300
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:23,039
noticed the trend of people using

301
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:24,750
attachments and dramas and stuff and

302
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,730
everything so he I remember him making a

303
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,049
post about it everything about you know

304
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,240

back to just this blah blah blah and he

306
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,940
was one of the first people in my

307
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:34,439
opinion to really you know I was

308
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,880
completely do that when I first saw him

309
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,230
going back to the female joints I was

310
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,850

00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,559
and two leaves around it and then it

329
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,840
seals up and coming out of the clear

330
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,609
sealed part is three pieces of bamboo

331
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,620
the taller pieces the mouthpiece and

332
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,600
then it's got to beautifully detailed

333
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,909
leaves go just one one beautifully

334
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,200
detailed leaf coming up the side it's

335
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:27,759
pretty fresh looking piece that's that's

336
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,080
a really stylish looking rig yeah it's

337
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,549
one of my favorites for sure I can see

338
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,530
why yeah does it hit well with that

339
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:36,639
skinny mouthpiece oh yeah phenomenally

340
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:38,649
cool sounds like a champ yeah so we got

341
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,620
to give shoutouts to mongrel to combo

342
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:45,459
and I forgot one guy whitey I forget why

343
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,720
people called me whitey all the time I'm

344
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,100
writing these names down so that we can

345
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,180
give a huge shout out at the end make

346
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,580
sure all these glassblower just get a

347
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:53,889
bunch of love alright so what are these

348
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,660
three of your favorites in my collection

349
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:56,679
yeah oh yeah these are probably three my

350
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:58,539
favorites of my collection for sure I've

351
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:02,379
got a couple more Klein's got a couple

352
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:04,179
more pieces by him I've got the wyoming

353
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:06,460
angler but these are like my daily

354
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:09,729
drivers one of the anglers yeah I guess

355
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:13,389
check those crazy some of the teeth make

356
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,220
me nervous about a sharp yeah scares me

357
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:17,199
I work with more the functional clear

358
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,480
prototype class for myself it's more my

359
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,920
thing so since we're talking about your

360
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,330
glass I'm gonna brag about my new rig

361
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:23,949
I've got this Hitman over here it's

362
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,920
actually hitman Sampson collab

363
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,720
it's got basic hitman yeah yeah it's got

364
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:30,069
a basic hitman sidecar design but then

365
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,269
it's got this sweet girl what do you

366
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,270
call that color greenish turquoise

367
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:43,059
definitely a custom sort of things I've

368
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:46,750
never seen lately I really love that I

369
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:48,639
like the clear glass that's made by like

370
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,710
a like a brand that's known like hitman

371
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,990
because I have nothing against these

372
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,850
rigs but when you buy one of these the

373
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,620
functions sometimes is questionable

374
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,840
definitely I've seen friends of ours

375
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,840
spend thousands of dollars on a rig and

376
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,009
if you put four milliliters too much

377
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,320
water in it you're gonna get in your

378
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:07,090
mouth and if you put five milliliters

379
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,379
too short you get a dry dab and you

380
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,970
choke for days and I love that these

381
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:12,039
production rigs that are made the same

382
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,600
all the time I love that I know what I'm

383
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,099
getting when I buy them and if I break

384
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,470
it I can write I don't want to break it

385
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,480
but if I do I can replace that fairly

386
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,579
easily just go to the hitman store which

387
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,009
is illusions around here

388
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:25,198
just grab one off the shelf exactly

389
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:27,269
you're not out $1,000 right right and if

390
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:29,188
you break this this is artwork this is

391
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,230
art as well but this is this took much

392
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:33,599
this is a proto art well this one is a

393
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,089
only one the only Safari special that's

394
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,949

these rigs on there why am i ringing

403
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:57,480
that's so weird that the MacBook is

404
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:59,220
ringing decline that [ __ ] alright so if

405

you're on a podcast put all your [ __ ] on

406
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,199
airplane mode that's that's my advice to

407
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:05,548
you where the shits were why I was

408
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:06,778
talking about rigs right all right dude

409
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:08,188
right on for bringing thousands of

410
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:09,208
dollars worth of glasses and table that

411
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:13,019
is freaking awesome I'm gonna have to

412
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:15,958
grab a torturers let's talk about the

413
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,220
bang so everybody I talked about dabbing

414
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,109
off the nail you guys I like the nail

415
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,449
because I can hook the titanium nail up

416
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,850
to the email the nails that I use are

417
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:25,618
usually titanium they go on to a male

418
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,540
joint that points up you drop the nail

419
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:30,178
on to there or you put your other dome

420
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:32,428
type nail inside there like our buddy

421
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:34,558
was talking about this dude decided to

422
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:37,230
flip back to the female joint because he

423
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:39,418
saw the trend of accessories and what

424
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,909
we're calling bangers coming out so

425
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:43,230
there's a guy everyone calls him qwave

426
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:45,838
but I think it's actually pronounced

427
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:49,319
khwab and I don't I'm not even sure if I

428
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:54,389
go back and forth on it on how I hear

429
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:57,719
you so qwave is more comfortable khwab

430
00:14:54,389 --> 00:15:00,028
sounds a little fancier yeah so anyway

431
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,129
there's a guy named quad who made what

432
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:04,619
we call the banger it's got a male joint

433
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:06,749
that goes into your rig it's got a

434
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:08,369
female joint and then it comes straight

435
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:09,749
up and then it curves out to there are

436
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:13,048
multiple different angles available you

437
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:15,689
get it at 90 or 45 probably other angles

438
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:18,298
as well but then it's got just a basic

439
00:15:15,688 --> 00:15:23,668
it looks like a small it looks like the

440
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:26,850
lid to your chapstick but it's clear

441
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:28,350
it's made out of quartz and so you heat

442
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,939
that [ __ ] up and then you let it cool

443
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,528
and you drop your dab in there and the

444
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:33,838
theory and I believe it is that the

445
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:35,110
quartz is giving a much cleaner more

446
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,140
flavorful hit

447
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,110
yes compared to the titanium and I

448
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:43,689
really agree with it my problem is I'm a

449
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,800
little clumsy and I I'm gonna break that

450
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,110
and you got to keep that a little bit

451
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,179
cleaner it's definitely more that

452
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,039
maintenance having a banger with a tie

453
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:53,199
you know you can get it real dirty and

454
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,528
then just get it hot and hit it with a

455
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,329
little brushes for the grill even almost

456
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:59,708
as little steel wool steel wool type

457
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:00,849
things right and get it fresh and clean

458
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,099
but with a banger once it gets dirty

459
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,050
it's a it's dirty and if you want to

460
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,399
keep it clean you got to do the it's got

461
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:17,588
to keep q-tip in it every time for every

462
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:19,000
youth q-tip Texans worth so that's a

463
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:20,140
banger you guys basically a banger is

464
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,970
made out of quartz a lot of were made

465
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:23,740
out of glass I don't see a problem with

466
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,240
davon Adam the glass piece but it's not

467
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,709
gonna taste as good it's not gonna last

468
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,269
as long it's gonna break after heating

469
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,099
and cooling so long the quartz is better

470
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:32,139
quality you can use anything quartz art

471
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,000
I definitely one of the two yeah and if

472
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:35,470
you're getting maybe ceramic the Halen

473
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,089
honey holes are great if you're going

474
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,680
for something made out of quartz the

475
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:41,560
Halen troughs are amazing and those are

476
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:42,879
also the quaff banger banger knockoffs

477
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:44,619
are cool if you trust your artist

478
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,809
neither vendor trust where your stuff is

479
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,759
coming from China / China that's where I

480
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:50,409
was heading up no China glass it's made

481
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,149
by little kids that aren't using proper

482
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:55,269
protection is there a difference in the

483
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:56,350
glass um it's really hard to tell but

484
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:58,328
yeah there is a definitely a difference

485
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,769
in there's quartz qualities and the

486
00:16:58,328 --> 00:17:01,479
Chinese manufacturers are definitely

487
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,129
gonna be using much lower quality cords

488
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,509
as cheap as they can face cheap as they

489
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:06,419
can find because it's just some douche

490
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:10,119
over here trying to make money just

491
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,319
exploiting the market right and you're

492
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,000
definitely gonna find lower grade

493
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:15,039
Chinese made quartz is gonna be much

494
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,140
lower rate than american-made just like

495
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,209
titanium exactly because they sound like

496
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,009
a bunch of snobby douches when we talk

497
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:22,539
about getting a quality nail but that's

498
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:24,849
your health you're heating this product

499
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:25,959
up to I don't even know how many degrees

500
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,308
I don't have to burn the [ __ ] out of

501
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,779
yourself and you're putting your

502
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:30,339
medicine on there you're putting your

503
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:32,440
hash on there and you're smoking

504
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:34,480
directly into your lungs so whatever's

505
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,220
in that you're you're gonna dab it if

506
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,140
it's something that puts off some sort

507
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,610
of gas or has an oil on it or some kind

508
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,040
of [ __ ] you're gonna dab that right

509
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:43,359
along with your Earl so get a quality

510
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:45,819
nail that's super important to me

511
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,799
definitely yeah so q-tip tank kids have

512
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:48,990
done dabbing with your banger

513
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,609
you gotta heat that [ __ ]

514
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,589
clean it out with a q-tip right well you

515
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:54,029
don't even heat it the the in theory is

516
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:55,829
that if you get the good you get a good

517
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:57,420
temperature where it's not too hot so

518
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:59,129
you're done dab and you get your good

519
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,050
temperature you got to do it pretty much

520
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,250
immediately after you grab a q-tip you

521
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,779
wipe the inside there should be like a

522
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,279
little bit of a not a puddle but some

523
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:06,599
wetness in there you get it quick enough

524
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,710
it'll clean it out look good as new

525
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,349
you're good to go you don't even got to

526
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,579
heat it up like this nail for example I

527
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:12,990
was trying to do it this good nails

528
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:17,039
couple weeks old now all right you know

529
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:23,359
it's still yeah but on this one you can

530
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:23,359
see I have it in the q-tip check exactly

531
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,230
yeah that's always in there heating that

532
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,220
sure yeah if you take it out then you

533
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,420
can heat it up right after you dad

534
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,700
thought I work too but that's not gonna

535
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,320
that's also gonna like burn it and heat

536
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,450
like it burns it a little bit so the

537
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,369
q-tip tech is definitely like the ideal

538
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,870
I guess it's just okay so it's catching

539
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:41,879
on I saw you saying something on

540
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,199
Facebook about q-tip tech the q-tip

541
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,750
thing I'll have a problem the q-tip tech

542
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,929
it's these new q-tip holders as well I

543
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,058
find hilarious $300 glass to hold it in

544
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,470
there's there's some janky ones you'll

545
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:54,420
see going for like a hundred and fifty

546
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,920
dollars and it's literally it's

547
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,570
literally a shot glass for you people um

548
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,550
it's a shot glass that a glassblower

549
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,869
made and put some color on and some of

550
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:03,210
these guys are putting absolutely no

551
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:04,709
time into it you can tell and they put

552
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,720
him up Rotch and they go for like 150

553
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,539
there was one I will say the one that

554
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,519
started the whole hype on it was a a

555
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:13,200
two-stroke and sleek lab that they

556
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,299
posted and I think they kind of posted

557
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,769
it as a joke originally and then they

558
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,329
and then they got a ton of hype behind

559
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:21,359
it and so they decided to auction it off

560
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:22,919
and they went for $2,200 holy SH and I'm

561
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,558
not don't get me wrong I mean this [ __ ]

562
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,000
was amazing these two-stroke and sleek a

563
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:28,710
phenomenal glass artist and her work

564
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,420
goes I mean their work is expensive but

565
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,100
at the end of the day it was it was a

566
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,600
shot glass q-tip holders what they were

567
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:38,308
selling is the thing to hold q-tips you

568
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,779

569
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:41,549
whole q-tip holder thing blew up

570
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,808
overnight it's insane you can do

571
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:45,089
something with that kind of money you

572
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:50,308

584
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,360
didn't make it as a q-tip holder when I

585
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:17,650
first started uh probably my first after

586

680
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:20,879
while but everybody was everybody was

681
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:22,829
huge and it definitely I don't say it

682
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,950
pop but it definitely deflated a little

two books they're uh yeah it's really

690
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:44,129

artists and everything it was before

694
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:51,089
there was really a glass scene type of

695
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,230
thing it was just kind of like this was

696
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:54,388
how you found there was no Instagram

697
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,769
this was later these were the heavy

698
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:57,209
artists at the time and anybody in that

699
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,009

705
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:11,369
documentary that was the biggest I think

706
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:13,079
I watched that my freshman year in

707
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:14,189
college and I was already into glass

708
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,569
that's what we watched it but we were

709
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,139
more into me my roommate had a bunch of

710
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:22,829
roars we had like roars and 51/50 AMG's

712
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,129

any interest in glass or art or just

730
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:03,649
culture in general anymore it's just a

731
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,029
really it's just a great great film if

732
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,200
you're into cannabis culture and yeah

733
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:07,819
looking for something that you want to

734
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,990

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,440
that it's not just another weed movie

738
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,820
it's awesome and it's really cool with

739
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,529
that one because that was only four

740
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:21,019
years ago that that documentary was like

741
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:23,569
produced and made and um let out and

742
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:25,460
it's just crazy to see how far they've

743
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:29,029
last industry the market has come from

744
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,710
2011 to 2015 where in 2011 you know kind

745
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:32,359
of this underground scene that like

746
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,009
right there was nothing on it really

747
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:35,689
until this documentary came out and then

748
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:37,400
um you know like at the time in the

749
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,779
documentary I believe Scott Debbie his

750
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,570
most expensive piece at the time was

751
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:43,339
$18,000 like that's that's a crazy

752
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:45,619
amount of money obviously for a piece

753
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:48,079
but now Scott Debbie is selling pieces

754
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:50,089
for I mean 18 of 23,000 I mean that's

755
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,679
nothing that's everyday yeah he's got a

756
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:53,539
hundred thousand dollar pieces going out

757
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,039
so so what I wanted to ask you what

758
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:57,109
makes the market do that kind of [ __ ]

759
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,940
what makes an artist and the market jump

760
00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:00,709
up and down and then like we said

761
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,080
earlier elbow the guy that makes a dyno

762
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,360
rigs he shot up huge for a little while

763
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,460
and then one day everyone's just selling

764
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,969
their elbows on Instagram for stupid

765
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,380
Chia

766
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,670
what makes [ __ ] go like that in the

767
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,920
glass market well I definitely think

768
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,330
what happened what Instagram definitely

769
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,420
helps I mean Instagram is a huge part of

770
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:20,599
like who's doing you know what who's

771
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:22,190
what in the glass world I guess if

772
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,299
they've got you know lots of followers

773
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,090
on there people are gonna think they're

774
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:28,549
like oil brothers for example Matt Bogle

775
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:31,069
and he's he's good he's really good but

776
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:32,720
his first rig that he put up for sale it

777
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,889
was a little coil pot of green mini rig

778
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,329
and it sold for like eight hundred

779
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,440
dollars at auction and it was like his

780
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:39,859
first rig that he ever sold

781
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,000
cuz yeah the hype thing but um I guess

782
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:42,589
with the market what happened was like

783
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,140
everybody all of a sudden started

784
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:46,490
getting into it and it built really fast

785
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,500
like it went from nothing to something

786
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:51,859
like in a year mothership prices were

787
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,029
quadrupling just because I really don't

788
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:54,829
know what it was it just become like it

789
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:55,940
people started finding out about it I

790
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:58,189
guess it wasn't all of a sudden an

791
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,600
underground thing that it was like you

792
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,650
know people had instagrams they get to

793
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,109
show their stuffs people were buying

794
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,030
more stuff okay and then everyone when

795
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:06,409
the market peaked everyone was like oh

796
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:08,029
man like kind of like a stock market

797
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,200
almost it's like a stock market crash if

798
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:11,029
you want to think about it like that

799
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,039
where you know everyone's like oh go

800
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,569
sell sell sell buy buy buy right yeah

801
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,950
and you know when mothership is like

802
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:17,569
now's the time to sell the mother ships

803
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,610
and so everybody sells their ships or I

804
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,109
guess elbow in this example everybody

805
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:22,789
had the bronto's and they were like my

806
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:23,839
number I bought mine for two thousand

807
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:25,509
dollars for example I bought it from

808
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:29,889
illusions two thousand dollars brand-new

809
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:31,579
sold it about six months later for

810
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,960
seventeen hundred dollars and I

811
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:34,490
struggled selling it for that you know

812
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,620
sand yeah and it was usually like knit

813
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,420
before that had no problem I definitely

814
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:40,609
bought mine at the peak of the the peak

815
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,750
of the height yeah it was like right

816
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:44,029
when I came down for vacation for the

817
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,869
first time a little rig yeah sweet

818
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,670
definitely loved that thing

819
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:48,709
yeah but uh but I think definitely

820
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,990
people they see what the rigs are going

821
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,549
for retail wise and so they're like okay

822
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,319
that's retail I'm gonna they put a high

823
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:55,190
price on it and it goes for a little bit

824
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,419
more and then eventually it's gonna

825
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,769
build up to a point and then people are

826
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,700
gonna be like [ __ ] that I'm not paying

827
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:00,230
that anymore

828
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,430
so the price will start going down and

829
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,529
then all of a sudden everybody starts to

830
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,460
sell their rigs trying to oh [ __ ] I got

831
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:05,569
rid of this now while they're still

832
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,210
still worth something

833
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:09,829
and then that and itself decrease she

834
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,049
appreciates the value a little bit yeah

835
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:13,490
so it's a little interesting it's funny

836
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:15,589
to see the mothership hype I saw the

837
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:19,609

995
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:52,548
art oh yeah I want to give a big shout

996
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,250
out to somebody who will never hear this

997
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:56,538
but my buddy Ian ah I'm not even gonna

998
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,220
say his real name but he's in he's a

999
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:59,359
glassblower he's not on Instagram he's

1000
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,069
not even like that he's kind of he

1001
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,199
doesn't want notoriety he just wants to

1002
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:05,240
make glass and be a glass artist but uh

1003
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,590
that dude tried to teach me how to blow

1004
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,849
glass and it wasn't his fault that I

1005
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:09,889
couldn't learn it was totally my fault

1006
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:11,960
there I'm good at several things and

1007
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:12,409
blowing glasses is definitely not one of

1008
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,378
them

1009
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:16,909
I got a fiberoptic burn I burned my foot

1010
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:18,889
I don't know how I burned my foot I

1011
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:21,849
don't know what burned me inside and

1012
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:23,720
burn my damn foot I am NOT meant to blow

1013
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:25,398
that's all the people that can a

1014
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,928
shout-out to Ian for trying to teach me

1015
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:31,069
and shout-out to the raging glass crew

1016
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:32,148
that tried to tolerate my dumb ass it

1017
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,090
only took me like two attempts to

1018
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:36,319
realize this is not for me yeah it's hot

1019
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:39,559
you guys if you want to blow glass you

1020
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,840
better yeah and you got to get in that

1021
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:43,820
fire yep just get in there you gonna get

1022
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,500
just there's no you can't hesitate no

1023
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,500
stopping you keep going keep that

1024
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:54,769
respect I understand why glass is so

1025
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:56,358
expensive do an excellent all glass to

1026
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:57,650
it in itself is expensive too that's a

1027
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:58,579
big thing that people a lot of things I

1028
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,740
think a lot of people don't think about

1029
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:03,019
is sometimes you can get like a rod of

1030
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:04,819
slime like a just a couple ounces of

1031
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:07,219
slime just a single little color rod can

1032
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,530
cost like 15 bucks or just a little

1033
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:10,909
wrong yeah yeah and then how many Rhino

1034
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:13,040
they break in they killed sometimes when

1035
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:14,839
you make of those how many what

1036
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,320
percentage of your work will break in

1037
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,960
the kiln you know on a good day like

1038
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:24,289
I'll get like 20% breakage but on an

1039
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,820
average day it's like 50% it'll just be

1040
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,320
like not as like in the kiln but it'll

1041
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,700
like it'll break while I'm making it or

1042
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,260
it'll some a piece of it'll break

1043
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:32,838
to make a new piece like my bass will

1044
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,400
break cuz acute angles will kill ya if

1045
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:36,650
you have an acute angle on glass when it

1046
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,389
when it cools down it cracks if the

1047
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,920
seals not perfect there's air pockets

1048
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:41,779
there's just so many little little

1049
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,369
things that go into it right cools down

1050
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,380
quicker than one piece if it's too thick

1051
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:48,200
it's crazy those little details are the

1052
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:52,220
things that the china glass that right

1053
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:53,899
yes work exactly they were proper anneal

1054
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:55,639
cycles they don't lose proper seal so

1055
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,660
you could you know some of their seals

1056
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:00,289
you could just push it with your thumb

1057
00:35:56,659 --> 00:36:02,000
and it'll fall off oh [ __ ] by American
