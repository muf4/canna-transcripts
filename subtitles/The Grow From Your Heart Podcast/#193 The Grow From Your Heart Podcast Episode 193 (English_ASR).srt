00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,969
cannabis was actually written by John

80
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:18,939
Ingold of the Denver Post the headline

84
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,819
recreational marijuana stores for

85
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,230
selling to minors during underage

86
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:30,759
compliance stings across the state

87
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,280
according to colorado department of

88
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,259
revenue authorities in Denver and Pueblo

89
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,789
working with regulators from the state

90
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:39,519
marijuana Enforcement Division have

91
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,319
conducted 20 undercover stings in which

92
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,500
they see whether a store will sell pot

93
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,509
to someone under 21 16 of the compliance

94
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,800
checks have occurred in Denver home to

95
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:51,129
most of the state's recreational

96

marijuana stores so far no store has

97
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:55,990
sold to someone under 21 in the checks

98
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,418
so they sent Undercovers around to

99
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,040
dispensaries to go try to buy weed and

100
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:01,689
they sent people that warrant 21 and

101
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,150

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,560
the people that own these businesses do

106
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,450
not want to risk their businesses by

107
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,000
selling to somebody under 21 there are

108
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:18,430

119
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:39,459
results show that strong efforts are

120
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:42,129

marijuana stores can sell to registered

125
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,490
patients under 21 a recreational stores

126
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,560
can only sell to those over 21 and must

127
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,090
check identification stores that are

128
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,470
found selling to someone underage could

129
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:04,349
have their license suspended or revoked

130
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:06,940
or face a fine up to $100,000

131
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,979
it says here medical marijuana stores

132
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:11,019
can sell to registered patients under 21

133
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:13,389
if you are a Colorado resident near a

134
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:16,180
medical marijuana patient that's under

135
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:17,530
21 by then you can go to the medical

136
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,540
marijuana stores as long as you have

137
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:21,849
your card you go to the

138
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,140
shops if you're under 18 to get medical

139
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,720
marijuana you have to be seen by two

140
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,979
doctors I believe it could be under 21

141
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,600
as well I think it's under 18 if you're

142
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,129
under 18 you have to be seen by two

143
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,280
doctors at the same time and they both

144
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:35,350
have to approve your medical marijuana

145
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:36,729
evaluation so that's that's one of the

146
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,590
little why they mentioned that people

147
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,620
under 21 can get into some shops only

148
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:42,939
the medical shops so it continues it

149
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,829
wraps up with we are pleased with the

150
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:47,379
results and we'll continue to monitor

151
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:51,669

152
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:53,139

167
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,920
all right I've got one more piece of

168
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:22,209
news that I found really interesting and

169
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,670
then we're gonna go ahead and get into

170
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:26,799
the grow lesson with Jesse this one is

171
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:31,180
from the Denver Post written by David

172
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,949
Magoo yeah it says Colorado's 40 casinos

173
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,560
and hundreds of others including the

174
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:37,569
gaming Mecca in Las Vegas are bound by

175
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,339
the same money reporting rules that have

176
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:41,139
made banks reluctant to let legal

177
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:43,779
marijuana businesses open bank accounts

178
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,029
federal authorities now say that means

179
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:48,549
casinos can keep anyone associated with

180
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:50,500
legal weed enterprise from dispensary to

181
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,470
grow operations away from gambling

182
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,660
tables anywhere in the country and if

183
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,370
they do allow them to play casinos must

184
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,140
file the same suspicious activity

185
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,420
reports banks must file whatever they

186
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,709
handle money derived from pop profits

187
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,080
according to the Financial Crimes

188
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:08,709
enforcement network a division of the US

189
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:10,419
Department of the Treasury FinCEN's

190
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:12,639
guidance applies to all financial

191
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,550
institutions covered under the fence and

192
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,439
regulations including casinos Vincennes

193
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,319
public affairs director Steven Hudak

194
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,790
told the Denver Post so this is going

195
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,649
out all my friends I'd like to go party

196
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,600
in Vegas and have a good time we need to

197
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:27,639
quit wearing our brand shirts and we

198
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,680
can't talk about what we do if we are in

199
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,639
the cannabis industry

200
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,649
[Music]

201
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,259
goes on to say because the government

202
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:37,509
says casinos are financial institutions

203
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:40,139
like banks they must have stringent anti

204
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:43,088
Mundi money laundering programs in place

205
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:45,220
filing suspicious activity reports RSA

206
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,990
RS to crack down on money laundering by

207
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,570
criminal and terrorist organizations is

208
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,278
not new for casinos what is new is that

209
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,920
it now extends to the legal marijuana

210
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,269
trade while fin sent in February

211
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,039
announced how banks could work with

212
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,570
legal marijuana businesses the

213
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,689
government only now realized that

214
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,490
extends to casinos that's in any casino

215
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,550
in the country whether in Colorado

216
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,709
Atlantic City or Las Vegas on land on

217
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:11,049
water or on sovereign American Indian

218
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:13,000
soil so casino and the Las Vegas Strip

219
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:14,769
would by law have to pay attention to

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,458
the owner of a marijuana dispensary in

221
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:20,078
Colorado who heads there to gamble is it

222
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,000
that trippy isn't that weird so if

223
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:23,620
you're from Colorado you go there and

224
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
you're kind of looking like you got some

225
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,169
loot because you own a dispensary and

226
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,750
you're trying to treat your employees

227
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:32,469
you are now suspicious and your money

228
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,149
will be reported so currently 22 states

229
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,949
have legalized the sale of medical

230
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,250
marijuana and to Colorado and Washington

231
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:40,899
have legalized recreational sales

232
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:44,589
Colorado and 41 other states have some

233
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:46,509
form of legal casino gambling the news

234
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:48,640

235
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:50,828
conference directed at curtailing money

236
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,679
laundering has stopped state regulators

237
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:55,629
and the casino industry in its tracks

238
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,399
the Colorado Division of Gaming was

239
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:59,139
unaware of the FinCEN guidance

240
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,720
spokeswoman Cameron Lewis told the

241
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:03,720
post-event division management will be

242
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,920
taking this matter under discussion

243
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,420
similarly the Colorado Gaming

244
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,039
Association the trade group that

245
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:11,319
represents the state's casinos was

246
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,939
unaware of the requirement to my

247
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,339
knowledge we have not been contacted by

248
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,040
fencin regarding any issues dealing with

249
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:21,220
marijuana suppliers executive director

250
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:23,139
Louis Rice said Mike banks casinos must

251
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,310
know their customer and have some

252
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:29,379
knowledge of their source of funds oh

253
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:31,149
I've been to casinos and nobody in there

254
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,208
gave a [ __ ] what my source of funds was

255
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:35,620
they had no idea how to tell as far as

256
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:38,919
they could tell I worked at a shoe store

257
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,389
like they had no idea so unless you're

258
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:42,169
going in there with your brand shirt on

259
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:45,080
unless your shirt says I make

260
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:46,429
or the big green dispensary then you

261
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,009
should be cool but be careful if your

262

263
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:53,149

276
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:23,750

277
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,310
industry keeps close to track of

278
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,139
gamblers through a variety of methods

279
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,669
including high roller clubs frequent

280
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:31,250
player programs and other in-house

281
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:32,509
incentives casinos must comply with the

282
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,490
government's guidance on filing

283
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,559
suspicious activity reports said Jim

284
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:39,350
Dowling an anti Monday money laundering

285
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,000
consultant their alternative is not to

286
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,529
conduct a financial transaction with

287
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,419
these individuals who were involved

288
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,909
directly or indirectly in the mj--

289
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:48,529
business at Dowling a former IRS agent

290
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:50,500
who is also an adviser on money

291
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,549
laundering issues to the White House

292
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,679
because marijuana is illegal under

293
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:55,969
federal law Vincennes requirements for

294
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,679
doing business with the marijuana

295
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,120
industry modified how financial

296
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,319
institutions are to file si RS SARS

297
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,519
suspicious activity reports is what that

298
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,840
means the reports must now reflect that

299
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,909
clients are in states where marijuana

300
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,460
sales for allowed so if you win a big

301
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:14,990
jackpot and you are gonna show your ID

302
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,220
and your ID because you've shown it

303
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,180
you're 21 if you collect a big a

304
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,519
surprise the idea is gonna show Colorado

305
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:23,779
is your home state on there and they're

306
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,000
gonna make note of that they're gonna

307
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:28,699
fill out a suspicious activity report on

308
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,139
your ass the marijuana specific reports

309
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,360
would either identify the cannabis

310
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:33,850
related business or employee as legally

311
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,019
operating under appropriate guidelines

312
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,899
identify them as one conducting some

313
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:40,519
suspicious activity or as one where the

314
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,350
casino has ended its banking

315
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,329
relationship in order to maintain an

316
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:48,409
effective anti money laundering

317
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,759
compliance program the 7 page guidance

318
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:52,009
also notes a number of red flag

319
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,470
scenarios that would require a bank or

320
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:56,059
casino to file an SAR including for a

321
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,220
customer depositing cash

322
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,809
that smells like marijuana who might be

323
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,690
trying to conceal involvement in

324
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:03,949
marijuana related business activity so I

325
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,080
mentioned that earlier and I honestly

326
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,820
hadn't read that paragraph they're

327
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,110
paying attention if your weed smells if

328
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,780
your money smells like weed

329
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,149
they are flagging it something for all

330
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:15,529
of us to think about maybe you just have

331
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:16,759
your herb and your money in the same

332
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,049
pocket you know and then you end up

333
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,870
going to the bank and you make a deposit

334
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:23,689
and that money reeks like herb if you

335
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,159
got the dank so be careful be careful if

336
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,340
you're in Vegas be careful if you're at

337
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:30,049
the bank just be careful they're looking

338
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,269
for more and more ways to build the case

339
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:33,829
on people now all right I think that's

340
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,199
enough news for the day I'm gonna take a

341
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,300
couple of fat dabs and I will be right

342
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,250
back with a grow lesson with our buddy

343
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:46,719
Jesse hang tight while I smoke down

California it was supposed to be

366
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:43,519
California but I just took some dabs and

367
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,959
my lips and lungs and throat or not

368
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,058
cooperating what's up guys we're back

369
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,198
with Jesse we got him here to teach us

370
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:57,259
some gross stuff I almost said your last

371
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:58,758
name again we're gonna get right down to

372
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:00,379
it we're doing some outdoor growing and

373
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,688
Jesse's here to teach us how to do it

374
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:05,058
this is his third visit I hope you've

375
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:06,678
been paying attention in the last

376
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:08,269
episode or not the last episode the last

377
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:11,028
time jessie was here sorry weird AB the

378
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:13,578
[ __ ] out it seems like we just hired to

379
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:17,149
come on to like Oh extra hi alright the

380
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:19,729
last ever listening they can hear me

381
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:23,059
so we're talking about security soil

382
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,460
strain selection T's will talk about T's

383
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:27,349
a little more today top feeding we're

384
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,200
gonna talk about topping and training a

385
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,000
little bit more so what's going on you

386
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,339
said we've got about 25 days until we

387
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,360
flower right at this point right yeah 25

388
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:40,790
30 hopefully 30 days before that this

389
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,269
stretch period is like really noticeable

390
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:48,379
and stuff you know that for lack of

391
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:49,730
scientific terms how many excuse me how

392
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:55,059
many days until you think we see that

393
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:57,830
stretch period so then we won't see

394
00:15:55,059 --> 00:16:02,088
little bud sites forming for probably 40

395
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:06,100
days ish that's outside so yeah that

396
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:11,029
really depends on strange and even

397
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:15,470
location on a certain property can you

398
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:17,088
know change flowering types of stuff if

399
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,610
there's like a structure or true your

400
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:21,140
stuff like that I've you know seen a

401
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,709
plant start flowering a little bit

402
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:26,480
earlier in one spot as opposed to you

403
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:29,359
know same piece of property countered

404
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,350
feet away Wow just from one tree or yeah

405
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,820
this what this was a garage okay

406
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,870
what about what do we do about a street

407
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,850
light I know I just kind of went off

408
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,830
topic here but there how much your

409
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:45,830
streetlights gonna [ __ ] up our flowering

410
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:49,220
streetlights so I I don't know I've

411
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:51,259
heard the street lights messed them up

412
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,980
you know we have really full moon

413
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:59,810
sometimes I've always really deeply

414
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,970
wondered this myself but I don't know

415
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:05,629
okay I would assume it's trained

416
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,818
specific myself yeah some strains are

417
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,230
much more resistant to firming from

418
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,629
light leaks or whatever you want to call

419
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,959
it for sure the harder in because are

420
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:26,539
probably gonna go a little be a little

421
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:29,210
more resistant to [ __ ] up cases now I

422
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:32,119
have seen a back porch light the plant

423
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,130
interrupts the light cycle this was a

424
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:37,639
plant sitting in a container just like

425
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,559
on the dudes back porch and it totally

426
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,919
heard out but the light was a lot more

427
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:45,079
direct you know it wasn't you know 30

428
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:50,330
feet away and across you know the street

429
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:52,369
or something like that so yeah so I'd

430
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:54,349
love to hear some of some input from

431
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:56,869
some you know listeners on that topic

432
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:58,939
yeah so it's like you almost have to do

433
00:17:56,869 --> 00:18:00,469
a light depth if you have an outside

434
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,110
light some wire like a street light near

435
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,909
your backyard or whatever II was

436
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:06,709
actually talking about his street lights

437
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:09,559
are probably gonna [ __ ] up his flowering

438
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,690
cycle for sure I told him jokingly this

439
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:20,808
is not real advice don't do this I told

440
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:23,150
him to get a pellet gun that is a

441
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:26,288
solution to it yes for sure I don't know

442
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:28,159
if that's the one I would advise

443
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:30,519
replacing that bulb the city's gonna

444
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:34,210
wonder what

445
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:36,759
yes 25 days we'll start seeing it seeing

446
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,190
a stretch phase a little bit after that

447
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:47,250
we'll start seeing our buds when should

448
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:51,390
we start changing to a flowering feed I

449
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:54,490
switch over each plant individually I

450
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:56,650
always when I do switch to a flowery

451
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:00,519
feet and make a ritual out of Dino given

452
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:04,450
like their first high peak a top

453
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:06,190
dressing and everything a little you

454
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:10,090
know I still be able nitrogen at that

455
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:13,870
point the outdoor plants just seem to

456
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:18,429
use more nitrogen okay I am helping with

457
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:19,959
a light depth and we're using bottled

458
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:25,690
nutrients because they're container

459
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:29,319
plants with the concrete floor in in in

460
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:32,799
the greenhouse and I really feel like

461
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:35,169
this cycle we're about to harvest it was

462
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,549
nitrogen deficient or just screaming for

463
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,430
more nitrogen the whole time

464
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:40,930
and like I couldn't really quit quite

465
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,500
figure out what it was because it wasn't

466
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,910
just yellow about for anything but I

467
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,769
feel the Sun makes them want to grow

468
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,390
taller stalling I don't know if they're

469
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:53,769
like I have any scientific evidence

470
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,970
behind this and you know that's what

471
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:58,029
they're supposed to get a medium

472
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,100
nitrogen to grow tall so once you get

473
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:01,809
nitrogen deficient at that phase you're

474
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:03,279
pretty much Sol you're gonna be chasing

475
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:06,819
it the whole time that's what we call it

476
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,829
chasing it you said when you first feed

477
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:10,779
them those flowering nutrients you want

478
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:12,579
to give them P and K phosphorus and

479
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:14,440
potassium you guys those are the things

480
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:17,019
you want to switch to just to for the

481
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,740
new guys lots of calcium to play if

482
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:22,569
you're using dry supplements go you know

483
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,430
go pretty heavy on that moisture show

484
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,990
for Easter meal

485
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,308
[Music]

486
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:31,130
just seems to help produce bigger

487
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:36,649
flowers outside big big flowers needs

488
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:38,510
lots of calcium so lots of nitrogen I've

489
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,850
got a friend who's growing some plants

490
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:42,789
that are I I'm not like being shady I

491
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:45,409
really do have a friend what's up Adam

492
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:46,789
he's got some doors I haven't seen him

493
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,860
he keeps saying that the bottom leaves

494
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:50,480
are all yellowing up but the tops of his

495
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:52,669
plants look fine they are in containers

496
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,920
he keeps them outdoors he feeds and

497
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,570
bottled nutrients do you think he's just

498
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,769
nitrogen deficient since he's outside

499
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:03,259
yeah your nitrogen lets you grow you

500
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:04,429
know also both sides of containers he's

501
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:08,089
in little containers and there's no

502
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:10,519
sauce you know that's the when the plant

503
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:14,379
starts just now you know it just started

504
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,379
well I guess I could start wherever but

505
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,970
small pots are are hard to do outside of

506
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,769
Star Trek's I like to keep them watered

507
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:26,150
adequately that's a problem he's having

508
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:28,609
yeah and keeping the the root zone cool

509
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:33,350
the temperature on those black pots can

510
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:37,399
get quite a bit higher than put them in

511
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:39,079
front door maybe 2 feet tall from the

512
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,790
last pictures I saw there about 18

513
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:43,099
inches 2 feet tall

514
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:46,700
I seriously probably go for like some 40

515
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:58,969
gallon spot smart pots that's 25 to 40

516
00:21:46,700 --> 00:22:00,529
go and those little pots the bigger pots

517
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,970
cuz you're gonna have to feed a lot of

518
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,289
water cuz it's gonna get hot out there

519
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,910
it's already getting hot my buddies go

520
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:07,720
to water it was a hundred degrees here

521
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,130
today I'm sure by the time he woke up

522
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,390
that plant was thirsty as [ __ ] then I

523
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,330
bet he had to water it again at some

524
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,259
point another thing you could do is

525
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:19,589
mostly on the plant

526
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:23,749
some kind of organic mulch don't get

527
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:27,058
that stuff that's really heavily tied it

528
00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:28,829
yeah that's the dye washes off and it

529
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:32,460
might get into your container and pot

530
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:37,259
doesn't like dice another thing you can

531
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:40,259
do this trip systems and then another an

532
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:44,970
easy fix is white panda plastic wrapped

533
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:48,179
around the pot white side out the color

534
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:50,399
of it yeah all right you talked about

535
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,480
light deprivation earlier and I kind of

536
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:55,498
skipped right over that some people

537
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,450
might not know what a light dep is so

538
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,669
light depth can be a real pain in the

539
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,259
ass it's honestly my opinion it's a lot

540
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,429
of work it's a lot of work so what

541
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:05,548
you're doing is you're taking a plant

542
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:06,840
that's outside and you basically have to

543
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:09,690
trick it every night to make you think

544
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:12,480
that it's nighttime by putting it a lot

545
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,489
of people will build a greenhouse an

546
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,440
arch shaped greenhouse hoop house type

547
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:18,329
of thing and then you basically pull a

548
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,369
tarp over it or some sort of cover over

549
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:22,230
it at the same exact time every night

550
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:25,259
just like you would turn off your lights

551
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,399
in your indoor grow the lights will go

552
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:28,769
and then every morning at the same

553
00:23:26,398 --> 00:23:30,118
morning you uncover that [ __ ] so that

554
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:31,499
it's just like it's in the grow room

555
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:33,658
getting the lights turned off and turned

556
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:35,278
on and it thinks it's the season for it

557
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,350
to flower so that's basically light if

558
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,259
there's several ways to do it you can

559
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:41,819
bring the plants in but basically it's

560
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:43,769
covering it that way as a light

561
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:46,230
deprivation it's forced flowering your

562
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:49,460
outdoor plants manipulating that

563
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,460
physically manipulate

564
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:56,930
it's a lot of work it's a lot of

565
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:59,600
commitment so outdoor grilling is not as

566
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,519
easy as people would think not at all so

567
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,569
we covered we cover the light depth we

568
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,460
talked about that we're talking about

569
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:07,939
feeding a little bit getting my buddy's

570
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,650
leaves greener so we're talking about

571
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,269
chasing the nitrogen go heavy on the

572
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,100
nitrogen guys I reck I always recommend

573
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:14,809
be careful with it but it sounds like

574
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:16,459
you found if you're outdoors that plants

575
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:17,960
good how likely are we gonna burn it

576
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,610
outdoors do you think that the sunshine

577
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,670
and the natural everything is gonna help

578
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:25,069
us prevent [ __ ] up you know it

579
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,370
depends on your container this is one

580
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:31,509
good thing about being in the ground

581
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:34,599
it's a little more forgiving I feel like

582
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:37,279
[Music]

583
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:40,250
you know if you have a lot of water you

584
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,730
know there's a lot of sunlight and a lot

585
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:48,109
of photosynthesis is going on so you

586
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:50,390
know let's be careful clue you know

587
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:53,000
don't just you know alright three times

588
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:56,600
as much because the the stone guy in the

589
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,720
theory guy you know please don't do that

590
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:02,569
but you know work into it but you had

591
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,850
enough for this outdoor plants use a lot

592
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:08,539
of nitrogen instead of just flooding at

593
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:10,279
one time flood it decently and then let

594
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:11,779
it dry and then flood it again and then

595
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:14,269
really pay attention to it don't just

596
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:15,859
try to go and super soak that [ __ ] cuz

597
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:20,809
you'll drown it she'll die for sure

598
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:22,809
that's there's I think there's a

599
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,279
difference between watering and feeding

600
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:27,919
even though a lot of people consider

601
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,700
that the same act as far as just dumping

602
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,999
water on a plan

603
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:35,119
when I feed a plant I still water at

604
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:37,889
first and then I apply the feed to it

605
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:40,199
you know same outdoors with the t's and

606
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:41,819
anything like that that's something that

607
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,739
a lot of the new growers probably

608
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,178
haven't ever even considered instead of

609
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:48,450
just you can do this this is indoor and

610
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:50,639
outdoor I feed my plants with nutrients

611
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,679
every Monday all of my plants my mother

612
00:25:50,638 --> 00:25:54,418
plants my veg plants just Monday it's

613
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,269
you know it's the easy data pick you

614
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,709
don't forget got it all figured out and

615
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:00,959
get the Monday ritual how you feed

616
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:03,328
everything I will

617
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:05,129
I feel the - Reza's I walk through and

618
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,928
water each plant in the flowering room

619
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:08,608
with a little bit of fresh water just

620
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:10,259
just enough to get it you know Wakely

621
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,668
give it a drink and then I go hit the

622
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:13,169
other rooms and then I come back and

623
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:14,909
then I mix up the nutrients for you true

624
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:17,159
them and go back and get them the first

625
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:18,839
watering is just enough to kind of kind

626
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,459
of moisten the topsoil like it doesn't

627
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:21,778
go very deep I don't think but it kind

628
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:24,179
of gives the plant a chance to wake up

629
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:26,368
helps the nutrient flow through better

630
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:29,009
you know but my theory was I don't

631
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:30,868
always want to wake up and have a meal I

632
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:33,389
don't want to put yeah I don't want to

633
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:36,118
start with a steak I want to have some

634
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:38,578
water in my throat up and get moving to

635
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:41,788
wake up and then have some food and some

636
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:44,668
oatmeal or some whatever yeah so wake up

637
00:26:41,788 --> 00:26:46,378
let him enjoy the day so I guess we

638
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:49,200
should talk about feeding stuff what are

639
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:52,678
you putting in your tea right now um I'm

640
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:57,419
going a heavy with kelp meal alfalfa

641
00:26:52,679 --> 00:27:00,469
meal and that the Mexican bat guano the

642
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:02,820
tea I'm gonna make tomorrow actually

643
00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:03,558
I'll make it tomorrow I'll play it on

644
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:06,328
Tuesday

645
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm gonna put seabird guano in it for

646
00:27:06,328 --> 00:27:19,909
the first time okay start

647
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:54,500
I don't really have been eating a lot of

648
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:56,540
sunshine been swimming in the ocean yeah

649
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,059
if you're lucky might catch me there

650
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:05,359
maybe sometimes Jesse's down there you

651
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:08,319
know some people ya know GT heavy

652
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:16,359
moisture meal I don't put that in a

653
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:22,069
t-top dress I apply that to the soil

654
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:25,299
okay clogged up you guys gonna want to

655
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:27,289
know what I said azomite is what it was

656
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:29,599
that's something I've never really uh

657
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:32,029
messed around with clients just easier

658
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,279
anything like that or top dressing or

659
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:36,379
anything like that okay I put I put it

660
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,059
in initially in the soil yeah okay

661
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,740
that's I've usually seen it mixed in the

662
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:41,149
super soil but yeah if I didn't get it

663
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,900
in there maybe I could try now is what

664
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,750
I'm hoping for

665
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,450
deeper worm castings in your tea

666
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:51,019
[Music]

667
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:52,610
basically larger for yourself if I

668
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:53,869
wanted to just try some teas I could do

669
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:55,519
a five-gallon bucket if I'm a new

670
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:57,919
listener I could just do the five-gallon

671
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,990
bucket put some water in there about 3/4

672
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,880
of the way dechlorinated water now our

673
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:06,349
water if you can if you're making tea

674
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:10,100
you know you got a little aquarium pump

675
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:12,319
so our air pumps okay so we got a do but

676
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:14,359
about two days before you use this water

677
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,269
fill up your reservoir and put your air

678
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:19,159
pump in there not your pump put the

679
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:21,690
[Music]

680
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,519
yeah put your air stones in there keep

681
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,470
the pump on a shelf safe and dry that's

682
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,759
electric put their stones in there and

683
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,230
just bubble the [ __ ] out of that water

684
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,359
for as long as you can and you want to

685
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,650
get you want to stir it a lot of times

686
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:33,869
is what's happening essentially because

687
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:36,060
you're trying to bring all the chlorine

688
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:37,769
and anything else there's all kinds of

689
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:40,619
[ __ ] the pueblos water you want all that

690
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:43,319
to evaporate out so bubble it up a lot

691
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:44,969
before you use it and then use that same

692
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:46,559
water just leave Dara Snowden there

693
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:51,839
right let it keep it above one or in

694
00:29:46,559 --> 00:30:00,779
your molasses 15 mils per gallon 50 or

695
00:29:51,839 --> 00:30:19,679
50 15 tbsp okay about two shot glasses

696
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:23,269
worth for a five gallon bucket we've got

697
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,269
our tea we've got our molasses in there

698
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:30,029
yeah I don't do exact measurements on

699
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:40,680
that five gallon bucket I do like nice

700
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:42,119
little double-handed handful okay okay

701
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,740
so like two cups is what I think we're

702
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,059
looking at three or four cups means the

703
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,640
most there depends on how big your hands

704
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,750
are if you have homemade compost or you

705
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,420
got a cool neighbor or something like

706
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:55,559
that that that'll work and Lou the worm

707
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,850
castings or together together warm poop

708
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:00,480
oh man you're golden

709
00:30:56,849 --> 00:31:03,269
put that warm tea in there yeah what

710
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,910
else are we putting we get the kelp the

711
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:08,450
kelp meal yeah um I've been I've been

712
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,460
kind of starting slow on that

713
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,710
I've used it before but I've never used

714
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,490
it in teas and stuff so read some stuff

715
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:18,650
this binary now I'm going nuts with it

716
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:22,839
right now let's see for five gallons to

717
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:25,880
say if how they do like a quarter cup

718
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm sure you could probably go more I've

719
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:32,900
never seen a good healthy tea

720
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,970
Virna plan so if you guys want to read a

721
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,700
lot of these ideas there's a book called

722
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,569
we talked about it in a few shows ago

723
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,610
the folks that call it's called true

724
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:42,019
living organics by the Rev check that

725
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:43,549
out I recommend that shout out to the

726
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:44,779
Rev they don't pay me to say that or

727
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:47,089
anything he just writes a book that's

728
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:50,000
exactly what we're talking about so if

729
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:52,189
if you want a lot of their step-by-step

730
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,509
teas their directions how to make them

731
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,299
there are certain teas for certain

732
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:58,970
phases he's got teased for seedlings veg

733
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:00,799
plants late fetch plants early flowers

734
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,170
he's got a tea for every day of the week

735
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:09,529
in there they're pretty elaborate some

736
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:10,970
of them they're very effective those

737
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:12,680
teas are the way to go it looks like a

738
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,750
lot the Rev gross and gorgeous weed I

739
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,150
don't know that I've ever smoked any TLO

740
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:23,319
weed that's not what I do

741
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:23,320
Jesse shake it like you're in Colorado

742
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:30,279
some of my dad's or whatever

743
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:36,339
I saw a meme of myself a Rasta Jeff mean

744
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:36,339
yeah says droves began Akoni smokes bhl

745
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:42,529
sure some dabs or if I happen to have a

746
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,940
fresh crop of some lemon Jeff or

747
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,470
whatever will hol get down on that I

748
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,299
just want to taste your TLO weed I want

749
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,220
to see if what the heights are about you

750
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,859
know I'd like to come to your plants

751
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:56,240
yeah yeah I'm just knows he's like that

752
00:32:51,859 --> 00:33:00,279
you can come see mine yeah thanks for

753
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,740
putting that out there for us alright

754
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:04,670
earlier you set a drip line yeah that's

755
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,620
a brilliant idea

756
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:09,230
for outdoors you're gonna want a water

757
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:10,879
often if you could set up a little

758
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,440
miniature drip line it's not that hard

759
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,059
you need a large res to hold your water

760
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,129
a resin

761
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:16,329
or that is not gonna get algae funked

762
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:17,980
it's gonna be something designed to hold

763
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:22,058
water don't be a cheapskate on this part

764
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:25,509
yeah sometime clean in lines often yeah

765
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:27,339
I need a pump like I don't even remember

766
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:28,899
how many gallons per hour pump but

767
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,668
depends on how many plants in how many

768
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:33,008
lines but then you just need a splitter

769
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:34,870
and then like octopus hose coming out of

770
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:36,878
that and one thing to each plant and a

771
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:38,258
spike and you just put that spike right

772
00:33:36,878 --> 00:33:40,778
in the dirt near the center of the plant

773
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:42,970
and set a timer on the pump and every

774
00:33:40,778 --> 00:33:45,849
however often you have it come on water

775
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:49,110
will magically flow from your reservoir

776
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:52,689
to your plants so all you got to do is

777
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:54,758
turn on that pump one time hit a timer

778
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,440
see how long it takes for those plants

779
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,929
to get an adequate amount of water and

780
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,190
then hit stop when they're well they're

781
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:02,649
good and then set your timer for that

782
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:04,119
much time on every morning so right

783
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:05,798
whatever time you see the Sun peak up

784
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:06,158
boom seven o'clock that timer should

785
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:08,139
come on

786
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,568
boom [ __ ] water your plants for you

787
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:12,849
right away and if it never does build up

788
00:34:10,568 --> 00:34:18,579
to an adequate amount you need more drip

789
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:21,639
emitter heads yeah yeah more water

790
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:23,950
delivery in a nutshell I use the kind of

791
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,710
gravity system but it's a little bit

792
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:27,969
larger scale so yeah yeah yeah you can

793
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,260
always put your Reds at the top of the

794
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:33,068
hill and run your lines down the hill

795
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:37,119
basically without a really fancy still

796
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:39,969
anointing to open and close the tank you

797
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:43,780
don't have actual or too good of control

798
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:45,730
over it so just just by the pump in a

799
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:50,200
you know 55-gallon barrel or something

800
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:52,960
like that yeah then when you can almost

801
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:59,108
make your tea in that barrel you can

802
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:01,750
that would be good for the pantyhose all

803
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:02,949
of the ingredients we talked about to

804
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,480
put in our tea and do a thing a

805
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:06,309
pantyhose and just tie it into a knot so

806
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,079
that you just made a giant tea bag and

807
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:09,279
then just drop that inside there and let

808
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,140
that bubble around in there and you're

809
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,880
gonna get a bunch of foam up on top of

810
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:14,318
your tea we didn't mention that we kind

811
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,550
of did a little bit but once you get all

812
00:35:14,318 --> 00:35:17,500
those ingredients in there let it bubble

813
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,640
let it stew for about 24 hours when

814
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,449
you're making tea we kind of skip that

815
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,659
step

816
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:23,629
put it set it in a container I've seen a

817
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:24,980
lot of guys buy

818
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:38,358
little Rubbermaid containers that a

819
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:40,068
five-gallon bucket inside of I love

820
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:41,568
gonna want the they have to know who

821
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:44,838
grows weed at Walmart in all the stores

822
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:46,909
cuz we buy the most random [ __ ] in bulk

823
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:52,639
no I need how many do I need I need I

824
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:54,379
need 33 of them like really yes the

825
00:35:52,639 --> 00:36:20,690
whole room is gonna look if I have one

826
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:22,608
that's off yep get rid of my pervert man

827
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:24,460
alright we talked about tees kind of

828
00:36:22,608 --> 00:36:26,929
randomly drip line would be a good idea

829
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:29,000
to research that be careful with it but

830
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:30,469
it's such a great idea if you can get it

831
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,369
figured out get it going

832
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:36,169
yeah if you've got a real job and you

833
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:38,150
know you got rocks and you're you know

834
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,548
you couldn't plant in the ground even in

835
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:43,940
grounds are great if you're having

836
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:48,650
watering issues you know you can't water

837
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:50,599
them enough drip line line you can get a

838
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:54,740
real simple setup at Harbor Freight I

839
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:57,440
believe for like less than 30 bucks I

840
00:36:54,739 --> 00:37:00,169
want to say thanks so less than 30 bucks

841
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,420
for a drip on do this why am I not doing

842
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:08,568
that it halls my rooms

843
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:10,608
I think hand feeding is personal yeah my

844
00:37:08,568 --> 00:37:14,058
plants every day I don't like McKenna

845
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:15,348
mcmechen eyes dreams eternal state of

846
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:17,790
the art when it comes to marijuana

847
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:19,350
growth I feel state of the art is

848
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:25,949
that just lets you know you probably

849
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:28,139
don't want anything to do with it here's

850
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:31,289
a weird question how do I adjust the pH

851
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:32,759
of my tea or whatever without [ __ ] up

852
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:33,509
the micro life or do I even need to

853
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,210
worry about it

854
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,890
I don't you don't you just all that

855
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,659
stuff and there is going to do what it

856
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:42,690
needs to do and be at the pH it needs to

857
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:44,269
be at yeah otherwise you may destroy it

858
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:48,179
right that's the theory I've gone on

859
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:50,610
even putting things like stuff that's

860
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:52,769
derived from Leonard ight putting that

861
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,329
in your tea you can just watch it to

862
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:56,460
kill it like right in front of you found

863
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:58,199
on the foam and it just excuse me can't

864
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:05,780
see it to fall the can yeah yeah oh yeah

865
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:10,169
okay there's some cow max yeah so okay

866
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:12,060
liquids into your teas is a just a

867
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,610
touchy area if you want your tea to stay

868
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:16,440
alive it's that's why you're mixing up a

869
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,660
TDI just to avoid that example one

870
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,769
greeting it I can recommend is called

871
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:26,009
sea green it's great for teas don't

872
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:28,110
apply it when you start the brew you

873
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,150
apply it after you're done when you're

874
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,370
about to apply it to the plant see green

875
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:36,460
yeah what is sea green that sounds like

876
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:40,750
some kelp [ __ ] yeah fish based kelp

877
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:43,570
so pretty low in peak a kind of like too

878
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:46,599
concentrated TM wow so nice a good start

879
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:48,720
yeah what's the fox farm product that is

880
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:53,139
a good tee starter you know it's one of

881
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:55,809
microbrewery I believe it's either it's

882
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:56,170
either big on its [ __ ] I'm gonna google

883
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:58,090
it

884
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:02,940
yeah I've actually used this a couple

885
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:05,079
but it was pretty neat had some samples

886
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,670
it's one of those original three that

887
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,739
Fox farms put out remember when they

888
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:11,590
first started there were three yeah I

889
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:13,779
think it's Tiger about oh okay okay

890
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:16,000
nevermind and I'm taking us somewhere

891
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,320
else one of those original three and

892
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,590
they've changed their website all up -

893
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,100
hey one of those original three can't

894
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:28,030
find it not here I'm trying to talk to

895
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:31,630
was a great one for making a tea I'm

896
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:35,200
looking another general hydroponics

897
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:36,640
floral assist plus is pretty good for

898
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:45,250
making some teas

899
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:45,250
[Music]

900
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:57,479
check that out it could be time one of

901
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:59,099
these three the tiger bloom grow big or

902
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,510
big bloom the Rev recommends in this

903
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,619
book heavily sorry guys I didn't mean to

904
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,580
rant on that for no reason because I

905
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:06,420
couldn't even find the correct answer

906
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:07,769
now I feel silly that's a good base for

907
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,539
it see you can add that one to the tea

908
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:11,039
and feel safe but yeah read what you're

909
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:12,509
putting in there yeah I'll get the revs

910
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,800
book look for the revs book I'll let you

911
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,810
borrow it come on over here you can use

912
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,940
it teeming with microbes Oh Stu

913
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:24,539
yeah oh that's a good one too teeming

914
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:46,050
with microbes hey listen to the show you

915
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:51,900
would appreciate this scientific story I

916
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:53,789
just I can look at the plant hungry has

917
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,829
to [ __ ] wants to outside or lost its

918
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:57,599
ball yeah it's deployed I could tell

919
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:59,579
that about my plants do it either needs

920
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,110
water it's too hot in here and [ __ ] it

921
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:03,110
needs to get fed or it's time to harvest

922
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,980
[Music]

923
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:15,599
babies so we've got good soil we've got

924
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:17,820
good teas big pots for bigger plants

925
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,009
we'll talk about a drip line that sounds

926
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,470
like a good project to work on got about

927
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:25,080
25 days 30 days from now until we're

928
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:26,369
gonna go into flower so we could top

929
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,420
them we could train them a little bit

930
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:28,679
right if we want to get out there and

931
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,280
play with the plants for sure

932
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:35,399
I've topped three or three three or four

933
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,350
times five times six different plants

934
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,019
yeah so you've got some dragon in plants

935
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:41,299
now like nine

936
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:42,769
heads coming off of them my personal

937
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,880
plans for a little behind this year

938
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:49,639
because of work obligations but you know

939
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,840
the little tiny guys with like like just

940
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:54,259
dragon heads

941
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:59,030
so hydras yeah hydras I'm experimenting

942
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:01,490
with low stress training this year some

943
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:03,350
bamboo soft I just kind of pulled them

944
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:05,089
down a little bit so grab some of the

945
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:06,619
tops of the plants and just bend them

946
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:09,140
down yeah so that we can get a little

947
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:10,400
more light to spaces give give the heads

948
00:42:09,139 --> 00:42:10,940
a little more space to breathe right

949
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,280
yeah

950
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,809
airflow guys don't try to trap your for

951
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,440
plants like Jesse said in a few episodes

952
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:17,210
ago

953
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,220
don't try to trap them between the shed

954
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,960
the house and the garage and the fence

955
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:22,279
give them plenty of air or you're gonna

956
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,990
end up with moldy buds and the plants

957
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,000
know when they're crowded they can feel

958
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:26,989
it the roots the roots grow if you got

959
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,219
him in the dirt the roots will touch

960
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:29,899
each other and they'll be like there's

961
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:33,019
another plant here and they won't grow

962
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,730
into that plant or maybe well maybe

963
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:38,210
you'll choke the other one out I read on

964
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:40,969
old on a pop forum some Tom Hill wrote

965
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:45,110
years ago about how the plant will never

966
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:47,000
grow wider then it's been the mass of

967
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:48,740
his fruit structure right so

968
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,099
experimented with that a little bit last

969
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:54,559
year and noticed quite a bit of

970
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:56,630
difference and needless to say my my

971
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,759
holes this year were a lot bigger

972
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,610
circumference than they had been in

973
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,960
previous years okay that's I've been

974
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,730
telling my buddy Tony kind of the same

975
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,199
thing he likes the when he looks in a

976
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,000
grow room and looks on pictures online

977
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:10,039
when he sees just a bunch of tall skinny

978
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,329
plants so he's asking me how to do that

979
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:12,829
and I was like just keep them in small

980
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:14,059
small containers and that way they're

981
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:15,710
sure I told them essentially the same

982
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:16,969
thing I was like if you're wide you got

983
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,769
to branch out a little more you get a

984
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,959
spread your legs if you're tall you just

985
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:22,530
stand real

986
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,269
together in for sure same idea awesome

987
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:26,710
cool so what do we need to look for we

988
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:29,199
can have any problems right about now or

989
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:36,159
anything coming up what's - and [ __ ]

990
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:38,739
animals that help actually buddy of a

991
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:43,420
buddy I heard about a bear incident and

992
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:44,858
a bag of blood milk so he's lived in

993
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:51,760
bear country his whole life he should

994
00:43:44,858 --> 00:43:53,348
know better you know the only thing to

995
00:43:51,760 --> 00:44:00,400
keep a bear out of your garden is

996
00:43:53,349 --> 00:44:04,119
[ __ ] nothing no I don't want to spray

997
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,400
that new crop so it's you know here

998
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:08,530
locally in southern Colorado it's been

999
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,889
real humid like like lots of rain this

1000
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:13,330
year which is a good thing

1001
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:15,699
[ __ ] I think this is the first day we've

1002
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:18,159
hit a hundred degrees all summer yeah no

1003
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:22,588
I mean yeah and the plants are noticing

1004
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:24,969
that - I very much chose to [ __ ] me -

1005
00:44:22,588 --> 00:44:27,159
this big mop on my head it's like we're

1006
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:30,819
not asking all day yeah it's like I got

1007
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:32,588
one on my chin so not quite as dense as

1008
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,730
yours but I still in the face man oh

1009
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:38,529
that drives me nuts

1010
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:42,338
so the humidity is you know potentially

1011
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:45,000
could be I I haven't had any issues I

1012
00:44:42,338 --> 00:44:48,279
didn't sound like a dick when I stepped

1013
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,858
outside Oh [ __ ] feasible is that

1014
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,530
ridiculous I mean oh no not at all I

1015
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:55,779
don't hesitate to do that also gets

1016
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:57,490
go to Lowe's and be that guy buying for

1017
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,769
fans and put one in each corner of your

1018
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:01,119
garden folks you don't see come up don't

1019
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:02,409
make them all look like a comic-con

1020
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,569
turned oh when they're turning all at

1021
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:06,099
the same time synchronized make them all

1022
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,480
go at random if you can put two at

1023
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:09,309
different speeds and make them turn all

1024
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,630
different times it's what you want you

1025
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:12,610
want to stir the air you don't want to

1026
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:15,550
just move it around you want to stir it

1027
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:20,200
when its moist around here last year I

1028
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:21,820
had a hard time there was a real good

1029
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:24,879
breeding season last year - it seemed

1030
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:26,890
like and I had a hard time getting the

1031
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,670
soil to dry out so I could get teased to

1032
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:31,509
it and stuff so you know if that's an

1033
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:35,769
issue you're having

1034
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:40,330
I used fans however I should just top

1035
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:47,409
dressed but you know do both I could see

1036
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:50,769
that as a potential issue yeah spider

1037
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:53,319
mites I suppose yeah this is a good time

1038
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:55,719
of year for the hydro shop if you go to

1039
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,940
the dispensary wherever your clones came

1040
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:00,639
from we talked about that Indiana pop

1041
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:04,119
open people's indoor gardens around here

1042
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,799
so I'm sure you know depending on where

1043
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:07,150
your plants came from treat your plants

1044
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,220
with neem oil guys you got plenty of

1045
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,840
time if you're outdoors the spider read

1046
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:14,699
I've always thought spider mites were

1047
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:18,300
like extraordinarily easy to

1048
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:22,710
to beat outdoors so just really just

1049
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:25,829
loose pretty neem oil there's a product

1050
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:29,608
called Kapow it's just like essential

1051
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:32,250
oils and stuff like that um some of this

1052
00:46:29,608 --> 00:46:34,529
Sierra natural science products it

1053
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,750
probably worked for a braid yeah a lot

1054
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:38,339
of those products that's what I use a

1055
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:41,039
lot of their stuff um

1056
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:42,509
the mighty wash you know let's just do

1057
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,509
you not deionized water

1058
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,560
it's not called mighty one what's the

1059
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,910
word light in there

1060
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,039
I forget the new name but it's mighty

1061
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:52,059
washing tomorrow I liked it because you

1062
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,739
knew what it was right

1063
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:57,029
[Music]

1064
00:46:54,739 --> 00:47:00,439
I've heard things good things about

1065
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:03,599
liquid ladybugs but never had to use it

1066
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,670
about just some ladybugs or some praying

1067
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,099
mantis or some predatory mites praying

1068
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:12,170
mantis I had them hang around plants for

1069
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:15,930
a whole season it's pretty cool

1070
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:17,849
ladybugs it's a great picture up outside

1071
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:19,828
because there's no real way to contain

1072
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:22,410
them they like to leave unless you got

1073
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:23,510
something up in cages I've always found

1074
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:26,219
them if you use them in your grow room

1075
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:28,670
it's just basically fodder for your fans

1076
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,669

[Music]

1079
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,869
sound like a good outdoor girl lesson

1080
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,889
we're right about 30 minutes sweet how

1081
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:45,390
long until you think you need to come

1082
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:47,549
back and give us a heads up on what's

1083
00:47:45,389 --> 00:47:53,309
going on

1084
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:55,019
a couple more weeks I don't know 25 days

1085
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:57,329
till flowering so maybe you will come

1086
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:58,409
back maybe right at the start or maybe a

1087
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:04,519
little bit in and see what you're gonna

1088
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:06,989
yeah for sure cool cool they really do

1089
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:10,009
you really Oh STUV my comments are about

1090
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:12,869
outdoor grow lessons like what's next I

1091
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:19,830
haven't checked them out I tried to on

1092
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:21,359
stitcher so speaker used to - yes I

1093
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:22,710
found the place to go for the comments

1094
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,910
it's really an obscure place it has

1095
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,110
nothing to do with the rest of my

1096
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:26,879
episodes you have to go to a certain

1097
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,930
little tab deep and find it but once you

1098
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,970
get there then they're all there it's

1099
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:31,980
kind of weird if you leave it on an

1100
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:33,799
episode previous and I don't look at

1101
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,269
that episode I won't see the comment so

1102
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,580
leave them on either the main page if

1103
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:40,800
you can find it or on episode 13 is

1104
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:41,569
where I check for comments it just makes

1105
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,310
it easy

1106

areas open here in City Limits they were

kind enough to open

1156
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:05,400

the Brickyard is actually a hookah bar

1269
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:14,318
right now we're trying to get city

1270
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:16,599
council to give us the ordinance to turn

1271
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:19,119
this place into a social cannabis club

1272
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:21,700
but so far the city has been hesitant to

1273
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,650
do that so what we've decided to do

1274

1310

1312
01:00:01,659 --> 01:00:06,759
keep this place safe for us as a

1313
01:00:03,909 --> 01:00:09,068
community that's what we do right cuz

1314
01:00:06,759 --> 01:00:10,269
we're all adults awesome see nobody

1315
01:00:09,068 --> 01:00:12,219
should be there's a bunch of people here

1316
01:00:10,268 --> 01:00:13,868
that are all I'm gonna say everyone's 21

1317
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:15,699
or up there probably I don't want to

1318
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:17,619
guess how old people are but there's a

1319
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:18,848
nice age range here and everybody's

1320
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:20,890
friendly we're all having fun there's

1321
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:23,440
nothing gonna happen here the only thing

1322
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:29,409
I am worried about my biggest fear is

1323
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:30,730
police interaction that is the only

1324
01:00:29,409 --> 01:00:32,558
thing I'm worried but I don't want to be

1325
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:34,599
the I don't want to be the one breaking

1326
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,329
the law I've been to City Council and

1327
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:39,430
I'm trying to say listen there they're

1328
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:42,490
coming in there to our city and they're

1329
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:44,169
buying marijuana and they're going and

1330
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:46,598
sitting in our parks they're driving our

1331
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:48,639
streets they're parking in this Kota

1332
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:52,480
Sachs why not just give them some place

1333
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:53,949
to come to sit down enjoy you know I'm

1334
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,440
some company of some people maybe they

1335
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:58,598
don't know maybe they do know just to

1336
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,980
play a game of pool play something great

1337
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:02,528
on the jukebox that they've been waiting

1338
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:04,630
to hear I mean it doesn't matter this is

1339
01:01:02,528 --> 01:01:06,369
a social atmosphere and why are they

1340
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:10,349
stopping us from having this kind of

1341
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:10,349
atmosphere yeah I agree completely

1342
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:16,690
cannabis dispensaries every direction

1343
01:01:14,289 --> 01:01:18,220
ten minutes from here you can get to a

1344
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:20,019
dispensary but there is nowhere to smoke

1345
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:21,848
it exactly I've got friends that run

1346
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:25,838
work manage they all have dispensaries

1347
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:27,548
and they say a lot of their recreational

1348
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:30,130
customers are actually coming from Texas

1349
01:01:27,548 --> 01:01:31,750
so those people have nowhere to smoke it

1350
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:34,088
you can try to smoke it in your hotel

1351
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:35,349
but if you're only here for a day people

1352
01:01:34,088 --> 01:01:36,518
are shaking their heads like no can't

1353
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:39,190
smoke in the hotel did you get have

1354
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:40,419
experience you want to come grab a mic

1355
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:42,220
for a second I'll let you talk on a mic

1356
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:43,750
this is my buddy Adam he's from out of

1357
01:01:42,219 --> 01:01:44,828
state he's been on the show once or

1358
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,088
twice we kind of just derailed the

1359
01:01:44,829 --> 01:01:47,619
structure the show but [ __ ] it it's

1360
01:01:46,088 --> 01:01:49,088
going well yeah we came from out of

1361
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:51,099
state and that was one of the main

1362
01:01:49,088 --> 01:01:54,278
things we were worried about is finding

1363
01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:56,798
a 420 friendly hotel we did have to look

1364
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:58,550
on Craigslist and actually find one and

1365
01:01:56,798 --> 01:01:59,949
then once we found one it definitely was

1366
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:03,170
the one that I wanted the kids staying

1367
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:04,609
so you're talking about feeling safe and

1368
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:07,760
having a place to use cannabis safely

1369
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:09,710
the only hotel in town that was safe to

1370
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:15,290
use cannabis is not exactly the place

1371
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:15,889
where I wanted to bring me my wife that

1372
01:02:15,289 --> 01:02:17,090
makes sense

1373
01:02:15,889 --> 01:02:19,869
dude thanks for being on the show all

1374
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:22,280
the time thanks for coming out tonight

1375
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:23,750
yeah that's what people are driving

1376
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,010
around they're like she said hanging out

1377
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,809
at the park which is not cool that's

1378
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:28,220
where we take our children and I know

1379
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,299
the park is a cool place to go smoke

1380
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:30,409
weed but that's where I want to be able

1381
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,850
to take my daughter I don't want to be

1382
01:02:30,409 --> 01:02:33,829
hanging out with her throwing a frisbee

1383
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:34,400
and her having to watch you take a DAB

1384
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:36,019
in the car

1385
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,970
well you're right you know the great

1386
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:39,980
thing is is that you know if you wanted

1387
01:02:37,969 --> 01:02:41,659
to take the kids down to the park that's

1388
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:43,369
not too far from here you know you can

1389
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:45,649
let them do their swimming thing and

1390
01:02:43,369 --> 01:02:48,440
come up and enjoy the adult activities

1391
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:50,119
you know a distance away I mean this is

1392
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,590
a community thing in marijuana shouldn't

1393
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:53,900
be something that we should definitely

1394
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:56,150
fear you know I have a lot of my

1395
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,590
customers that come in to have a a drink

1396
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:58,910
next door when their kids at soccer

1397
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:01,100
practice there's nothing wrong with that

1398
01:02:58,909 --> 01:03:03,139
you just mentioned the drink next door

1399
01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:05,449
you do run legends the bar next door yes

1400
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:07,039
do you think that's going to affect City

1401
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:08,899
Council's decision and letting you open

1402
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,829
this as a smoking establishment well I

1403
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:15,559
hope not I hope they don't judge me on

1404
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:17,929
my performance in either place I mean

1405
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:20,150
you know I ran a great bar for four

1406
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:21,919
years and I don't hope that they don't

1407
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:24,470
have a problem with that

1408
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,909
I don't know how I feel about that I

1409
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:27,379
should mention that I really appreciate

1410
01:03:25,909 --> 01:03:28,849

responsible regulation of cannabis on

1427
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:11,329

1428
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:14,360

1429
01:04:11,329 --> 01:04:16,099

what you do who you are for now we can

1432
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:28,159
just call me Li and I'm a local business

1433
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:32,240
person I run a couple of businesses here

1434
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:35,329
in Pueblo and I want to make my first

1435
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:40,899
appearance about a couple of messages

1436
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:40,900
that I have and the first one is that

1437
01:04:40,929 --> 01:04:50,359
Pueblo has an opportunity to steer its

1438
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:54,260
future and its revenue through the

1439
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:58,420
industry and it's up to citizens to take

1440
01:04:54,260 --> 01:05:00,440
that opportunity and responsibility

1441
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:06,909
misty looks like she needs to speak to

1442
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:13,579
you grow it into a future for the city

1443
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:17,989
and the second message is it's not all

1444
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:21,549
about the dispensary model there are all

1445
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:25,719
kinds of satellite companies and

1446
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:27,010
industries that go along with marijuana

1447
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:32,869
[Music]

1448
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:37,610
that should be developed and long term

1449
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:39,889
industry brought to the area I'm gonna

1450
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:41,090
have to take a break and take a drink go

1451
01:05:39,889 --> 01:05:42,469
for it we'll let Gary talk for a moment

1452
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:44,350
you have anything to add it out Gary as

1453
01:05:42,469 --> 01:05:47,329
part of the committee for the

1454
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:49,059
responsible regulation of cannabis yeah

1455
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:52,909
I do actually

1456
01:05:49,059 --> 01:05:54,769
with misty situation they're telling her

1457
01:05:52,909 --> 01:05:57,049
that she needs a permit that doesn't

1458
01:05:54,769 --> 01:05:59,719
exist so she can't open so she has the

1459
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:02,180
permit but the permit doesn't exist so

1460
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:05,149
my feeling on it that that's completely

1461
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:07,179
illegal it's certainly you know not in

1462
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:10,490
the spirit of city government right it's

1463
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:12,109
it's ridiculous but you know the rules

1464
01:06:10,489 --> 01:06:13,789
governing private clubs are pretty

1465
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:16,019
specific you know and there are a couple

1466
01:06:13,789 --> 01:06:19,769
here already

1467
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:21,840
like the VFW in the American Legion and

1468
01:06:19,769 --> 01:06:23,610
those places are private clubs they

1469
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,680
allow smoking of cigarettes and things

1470
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:27,870
like that that you normally couldn't do

1471
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:29,909
in a regular bar but they do it every

1472
01:06:27,869 --> 01:06:32,190
day not to mention that those are great

1473
01:06:29,909 --> 01:06:34,920
clubs and they are very well maintained

1474
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:39,059
and they're very organized and they're

1475
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:40,800
recognized you can smoke in here well

1476
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:42,239
and there's never been any issues with

1477
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,160
any of those places even though they're

1478
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:46,769
outside the norm you see what I mean

1479
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:49,019
there's really no grounds for them to

1480
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:51,690
say that this can't happen we can comply

1481
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:54,210
with the Clean Air Act right I mean so

1482
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:55,829
what there's no basis for it except that

1483
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,780
they won't write a regulation and issue

1484
01:06:55,829 --> 01:07:00,119
a permit I should mention that they did

1485
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:03,210
just allow shops or not shops but

1486
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:05,250
businesses for you to open and Medicaid

1487
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:06,690
or recreate in the county with outside

1488
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:12,449
of the city limits but right inside of

1489
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:13,980
our County I know that hurt me I just

1490
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:16,349
feel like you know people now we're

1491
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:18,210
gonna see the potential but not that I'm

1492
01:07:16,349 --> 01:07:19,860
knocking anyone who wants to open a

1493
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:21,599
cannabis club that's a social club for

1494
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:24,240
people to go to because I think that

1495
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:27,269
there is a need for it and all of our

1496
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:28,439
communities I was a little disappointed

1497
01:07:27,269 --> 01:07:32,759
I've been open for a month and a half

1498
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:35,099
two months because I'm afraid to get in

1499
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,660
trouble yeah I'm afraid to break the

1500
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:39,650
rules I wanted to everything right right

1501
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:42,179
right yeah so you are closed right now

1502
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:43,829
outside the door pacing back and forth

1503
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:53,369
you just checked two of my friends IDs

1504
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:56,789
that came in speaking of rules

1505
01:07:53,369 --> 01:08:00,269
one of the basic rallying cries that

1506
01:07:56,789 --> 01:08:02,340
everybody can understand is that we want

1507
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:05,400
to be regulated in the same way that

1508
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:07,740
alcohol is we want the same kind of

1509
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,108
oversight we want the same kind of

1510
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:13,269
regular brandy

1511
01:08:10,108 --> 01:08:14,710
regulations we're all about public

1512
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:18,670
safety

1513
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:21,460
we just want common sense people making

1514
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:23,829
the rules instead of people that have

1515
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:27,520
nothing to do with the industry and

1516
01:08:23,829 --> 01:08:29,469
that's what to see our RC is trying to

1517
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,359
do right now that's why I'm part of it I

1518
01:08:29,469 --> 01:08:33,039
try to be the young influencer that's

1519
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,069
the dabber that's the smoker that's the

1520
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:37,390
grower I try to bring that to the table

1521
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:38,950
absolutely and you know that's what's

1522
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:41,048
great we have a great diversity between

1523
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:43,509
all of us I mean we're we're kind of at

1524
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:45,939
in the whole movement and this is a

1525
01:08:43,509 --> 01:08:49,500
movement that I think that is necessary

1526
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:51,909
in our society what we've seen with

1527
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,579
Pueblo and the City Council and their

1528
01:08:51,909 --> 01:08:56,858
moratorium is that first of all the

1529
01:08:54,579 --> 01:09:00,250
dispensaries sprung up on the outside of

1530
01:08:56,859 --> 01:09:01,509
town right so what Pueblo is

1531
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,399
experiencing and now they've allowed

1532
01:09:01,509 --> 01:09:05,500
smoking clubs so that will spring up so

1533
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:08,979
what Pueblo is experiencing as a city is

1534
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:11,560
all of the ill effects that that brings

1535
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:13,539
with none of the benefits to offset it

1536
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,219
they don't have any regulatory control

1537
01:09:13,539 --> 01:09:17,859
because they're not in the city they

1538
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:19,689
don't receive any tax revenue at all but

1539
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:22,900
they're still getting smokers staying

1540
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:25,358
here smokers in the park coming through

1541
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:27,849
our city they're leaving because you

1542
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:31,088
know what's great is this 30 miles north

1543
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:33,489
of me you can go and you can smoke you

1544
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:34,600
just can't buy marijuana so basically

1545
01:09:33,488 --> 01:09:36,909
they're stopping here and they're going

1546
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,319
this is awesome town they're all right

1547
01:09:36,909 --> 01:09:39,939
where do I go smoke and they're going

1548
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,310
Colorado Springs go ahead and go to

1549
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:46,329
Colorado Springs speakeasies places like

1550
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:48,460
that and that just took revenue out of a

1551
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:58,329
lot of people's hands I'm talking Taco

1552
01:09:48,460 --> 01:10:02,230
Bell you know yeah they're just leaving

1553
01:09:58,329 --> 01:10:03,670
and going to Colorado Springs yeah so we

1554
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:04,959
can sell a product right outside the

1555
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:08,140
city limits and then they drive away

1556
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,850
right I mean there's no reason that with

1557
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:11,260
as many places as there are in the

1558
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:12,820
county already there's no reason to not

1559
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:15,710
allow them in the city it's just it's

1560
01:10:12,819 --> 01:10:17,719
just ridiculous it's

1561
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:19,819
pointless all right there are just as

1562
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:21,310
many cannabis users probably more in

1563
01:10:19,819 --> 01:10:23,559
city limits

1564
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:32,719
everybody here live in city limits

1565
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:34,760
everybody nods yes you know we've seen

1566
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:40,159
some progress lately right they've just

1567
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:41,810
allowed the grow operations concentrate

1568
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:44,960
manufacturers they give them the mic and

1569
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:45,950
edibles manufacturers the City Council

1570
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,180
has just passed that

1571
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:48,439
Misty's husband's asking for a

1572
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,180
microphone I'll pass it to them and let

1573
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:50,409
him introduce themselves

1574
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:53,300
[Music]

1575
01:10:50,409 --> 01:10:54,680
hi my name is Greg and I'd like to say

1576
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:57,650
you know you guys were talking about the

1577
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:59,739
revenue aspect of this and everybody

1578
01:10:57,649 --> 01:11:02,179
looks at it as a business hacks best

1579
01:10:59,738 --> 01:11:04,099
aspect of it which it is a business

1580
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:05,719
aspect of it but when you guys are

1581
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:08,690
talking about Pueblo and like you guys

1582
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:10,340
talked about Pueblo County and all that

1583
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:12,649
stuff and they're making revenue out

1584
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:15,289
there well the city's hurting for some

1585
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:18,139
revenue as well so the taxes that the

1586
01:11:15,289 --> 01:11:19,909
city would make off of these taxes that

1587
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:23,600
you would get for opening these clubs

1588
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:25,819
that you're gonna revenue inflate the

1589
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,250
city taxes I think they forget about

1590
01:11:25,819 --> 01:11:30,679
looking into that situation as well so

1591
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:33,350
it's not only a business prospect for

1592
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:36,289
the personal owners or the personal

1593
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:38,000
people that are trying to make a profit

1594
01:11:36,289 --> 01:11:41,000
or trying to make a business that works

1595
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,340
it would also help the city and the city

1596
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,340
is also going to benefit off of these

1597
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:48,440
prospects that are coming about so if

1598
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:50,510
they can just let things happen the way

1599
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:52,669
they're supposed to happen it's already

1600
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:54,199
been voted in it's already been the way

1601
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:56,779
it's supposed to be it's already been

1602
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:58,849
around us so if they can make this

1603
01:11:56,779 --> 01:12:01,099
happen it would only benefit the city as

1604
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:03,650
well as the people are trying to make

1605
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:07,310
this happen to benefit themselves as

1606
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:11,929
well so for as it out of business aspect

1607
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:16,360
it would help the city and the state as

1608
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:16,360
well as the people that are trying to

1609
01:12:16,539 --> 01:12:23,019
but you know I'm moral right now sorry I

1610
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:27,449
because I have a question for you in a

1611
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:30,869
second I you know I the way I feel about

1612
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:32,159
it is is that more that this should be a

1613
01:12:30,869 --> 01:12:34,170
place of socialism

1614
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:37,500
well how many how long has people than

1615
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:40,680
saying a combined smoke you know we're

1616
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:43,350
the drug that they're so afraid of

1617
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:45,869
that's called marijuana is something

1618
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:48,990
that people actually hang out and do

1619
01:12:45,869 --> 01:12:52,170
great things with and socially hanging

1620
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:53,909
out and being people and I just I wish

1621
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:55,890
that they would just see that that's

1622
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:57,989
what it is a social environment one of

1623
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:59,910
the reasons that the City Council said

1624
01:12:57,989 --> 01:13:01,679
they don't want to open places like this

1625
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:03,659
is because if the police our fire

1626
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:05,490
department did have to come here they

1627
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:07,050
would walk in and there's so much smoke

1628
01:13:05,489 --> 01:13:08,429
in the room that they would be too high

1629
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:10,380
to do their jobs and they would be

1630
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:13,020
unable to perform Greg you're not a pot

1631
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:15,119
smoker are you he said no sir I didn't

1632
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:18,150
given the mic back for that are you high

1633
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:19,109
being in here he said no sir and shook

1634
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:21,960
his head you've been here the whole time

1635
01:13:19,109 --> 01:13:23,489
right hour and a half or so he's not

1636
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,569
high you guys so if you're paramedics

1637
01:13:23,489 --> 01:13:28,590
are getting high if the cops are getting

1638
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:31,259
high that's on their own time that's not

1639
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:33,300
from being in here first sir so that

1640
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:37,320
excuse sucks find a new excuse you guys

1641
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:39,409
I just want to break in and say that we

1642
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:43,920
have the situation that we're facing

1643
01:13:39,409 --> 01:13:47,909
because the municipality did not seek

1644
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:50,730
the citizens input before these laws

1645
01:13:47,909 --> 01:13:54,119
were put into place so we had a

1646
01:13:50,729 --> 01:13:56,639
situation where the people making the

1647
01:13:54,119 --> 01:14:00,239
laws were not the people in the smoking

1648
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:04,980
community and one of the things that the

1649
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:08,519
see our our seed is a vehicle for the

1650
01:14:04,979 --> 01:14:10,769
public to interface with this government

1651
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,900
and I just want to break in and say that

1652
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:15,900
yeah that's what sparked the CRC this

1653
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:19,019
will be given information on how to

1654
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:21,689
interface with us sometime doing the

1655
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:23,250
program yeah I will do an intro and an

1656
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:24,960
outro tags on this and I'll make sure to

1657
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:27,060
get all the Facebook information all the

1658
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,739
website anything there is thank you I'll

1659
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,570
get all that on there try to keep up

1660
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:31,109
with all that stuff so when is the next

1661
01:14:30,569 --> 01:14:32,759
stop

1662
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:34,439
what can the City Council the city

1663
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,000
members here do can we go to City

1664
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:36,578
Council meetings and try to talk and try

1665
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,519
to just show

1666
01:14:36,578 --> 01:14:42,938
presents to help get these places open

1667
01:14:38,519 --> 01:14:47,530
absolutely the public is invited to City

1668
01:14:42,939 --> 01:14:49,989
Council meetings once I believe it's

1669
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:52,779
twice a month is every other month every

1670
01:14:49,988 --> 01:14:55,328
other Monday every other Monday citizens

1671
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:59,078
can come out they can sign up to speak

1672
01:14:55,328 --> 01:15:03,099
to the council they can ask questions

1673
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:06,338
and basically make themselves make

1674
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:09,279
themselves heard to the people that are

1675
01:15:06,338 --> 01:15:11,229
affecting their lives every day that's

1676
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:12,368
not just here in Pueblo you guys you can

1677
01:15:11,229 --> 01:15:14,949
do that wherever you are if there's an

1678
01:15:12,368 --> 01:15:16,088
issue not just cannabis but if you want

1679
01:15:14,948 --> 01:15:17,588
to support cannabis if you have

1680
01:15:16,088 --> 01:15:19,510
something in your local region that you

1681
01:15:17,588 --> 01:15:20,800
need fixed go to City Council start

1682
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:22,659
finding out the steps you can take to

1683
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,010
get it on a ballot to talk to sometimes

1684
01:15:22,658 --> 01:15:25,478
all you have to do is talk to a council

1685
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:27,070
member and they will solve a problem for

1686
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:29,679
you we had a local issue here recently

1687
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:31,179
they got a little blown up and a city

1688
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,248
council member called the guy that had

1689
01:15:31,179 --> 01:15:35,199
the problem and he said hey here's the

1690
01:15:33,248 --> 01:15:37,569
solution and that's all it took was for

1691
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:38,648
them to talk so maybe all you need to do

1692
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:40,299
is get with the right City Council

1693
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:42,729
people everybody I'm is kind of snicker

1694
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:45,479
into this room I don't know if we should

1695
01:15:42,729 --> 01:15:45,479
say any of that stuff

1696
01:15:45,569 --> 01:15:49,358
the City Council meetings wherever you

1697
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:51,039
are and contribute be part of that you

1698
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:55,809
can't [ __ ] and complain if you don't do

1699
01:15:51,038 --> 01:15:58,358
something about it what we've done so

1700
01:15:55,809 --> 01:16:01,208
far with the CRC working you know on

1701
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:02,588
Misty's behalf is we've gone to one City

1702
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:05,260
Council member the only one we could get

1703
01:16:02,588 --> 01:16:06,939
an appointment with and our proposal at

1704
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:09,489
that time was they want to put this on

1705
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:11,679
the ballot for recreational and medical

1706
01:16:09,488 --> 01:16:14,618
sales within the city limits but they

1707
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:16,118
want a tax on that all right so they

1708
01:16:14,618 --> 01:16:18,158
want that on the ballot in November

1709
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:20,558
so we're cool with that but we want them

1710
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:22,148
to go ahead with the club rules right so

1711
01:16:20,559 --> 01:16:23,649
we went in there suggesting that maybe

1712
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:25,749
you could put the clubs on the ballot as

1713
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:29,039
you want to in November but in the

1714
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:31,628
meantime issue us a provisional permit

1715
01:16:29,038 --> 01:16:33,639
so that when people go to vote in

1716
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:36,458
November they can vote based on actual

1717
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:38,498
facts the actual operation of this

1718
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:40,059
business for a few months and we were

1719
01:16:38,498 --> 01:16:41,148
you know willing to accept a 30-day

1720
01:16:40,059 --> 01:16:43,550
permit you notice

1721
01:16:41,149 --> 01:16:46,010
just to show them how this business

1722
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:49,010
would operate and and we were told now

1723
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:51,168
well they steered us to why don't we try

1724
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:53,539
to get this moved up on the agenda but

1725
01:16:51,168 --> 01:16:56,118
we've hit a stone wall with that so now

1726
01:16:53,538 --> 01:16:58,668
we're asking for both we're asking for a

1727
01:16:56,118 --> 01:17:00,799
provisional permit and we want this on

1728
01:16:58,668 --> 01:17:03,229
the agenda now rather than in November

1729
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,878
and that you know that's really where we

1730
01:17:03,229 --> 01:17:07,489
are and that's what we need support with

1731
01:17:04,878 --> 01:17:10,038
we need you to call we need you to email

1732
01:17:07,488 --> 01:17:11,928
your City Council members and tell them

1733
01:17:10,038 --> 01:17:15,378
that we want this on the agenda and we

1734
01:17:11,929 --> 01:17:18,559
want some places open now so we can see

1735
01:17:15,378 --> 01:17:22,189
how it works before we vote it's working

1736
01:17:18,559 --> 01:17:24,800
well tonight Gary Gary will take the

1737
01:17:22,189 --> 01:17:26,449
responsibility of emailing me all of the

1738
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,159
phone numbers and email addresses and I

1739
01:17:26,448 --> 01:17:38,569
will tweet them Facebook them so that

1740
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:40,368
all the iGrow culturalism everywhere you

1741
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:41,958
are if you have legal cannabis and you

1742
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:43,518
don't like what you have you can you can

1743
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:45,229
fix it if you don't have legal cannabis

1744
01:17:43,519 --> 01:17:47,059
you can fix it let's get it going

1745
01:17:45,229 --> 01:17:50,929
everywhere legalized the world is my

1746
01:17:47,059 --> 01:17:53,239
opinion I agree so you look like it

1747
01:17:50,929 --> 01:17:55,779
something profound about to say I was

1748
01:17:53,238 --> 01:17:57,078
just gonna say that one thing that

1749
01:17:55,779 --> 01:18:00,198
Puebloans

1750
01:17:57,078 --> 01:18:03,259
and Coloradans in general should be

1751
01:18:00,198 --> 01:18:06,678
embracing is their ability and their

1752
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:11,570
right to produce their own medicine this

1753
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:15,078
is going unaddressed basically since the

1754
01:18:11,569 --> 01:18:18,788
laws have been enacted and it's so much

1755
01:18:15,078 --> 01:18:22,398
cheaper to produce your measure

1756
01:18:18,788 --> 01:18:24,859
you know what you've got there's so many

1757
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:28,849
other benefits and things you can do

1758
01:18:24,859 --> 01:18:34,128
with the whole plant as opposed to just

1759
01:18:28,849 --> 01:18:37,429
having the buds that you get at retail

1760
01:18:34,128 --> 01:18:39,469
and I just wanted to throw that in the

1761
01:18:37,429 --> 01:18:42,578
juice your leaves can make tea out of

1762
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:45,408
the roots there's so many great things a

1763
01:18:42,578 --> 01:18:46,639
lot of that on the educational you know

1764
01:18:45,408 --> 01:18:48,348
I don't think that a lot of people I

1765
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:50,659
think that they see that word marijuana

1766
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:53,539
as a fear factor and I hope that on the

1767
01:18:50,658 --> 01:18:55,849
27th of this month here at the Brickyard

1768
01:18:53,539 --> 01:18:57,739
people are gonna come in that are so

1769
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:59,000
curious that they want to get that close

1770
01:18:57,739 --> 01:19:00,889
but they don't want the smoke around

1771
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,140
they want knowledge and they want to

1772
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:04,760
know about it and that's exactly what

1773
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:06,380
we're gonna do on the 27th or so on the

1774
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:08,180
27th I don't know if we've talked about

1775
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:09,739
this very much yeah on the 27th here at

1776
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:11,450

1787
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:34,100
the honest-to-god truth I wouldn't have

1788
01:19:32,779 --> 01:19:36,500

you know trying to drum up business

1820
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,390
memberships things like that and you

1821
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:50,690
know we want to create you know after we

1822
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:54,079
get Misty's problem solved we want to go

1823
01:20:50,689 --> 01:20:57,199
forward with an organization that can be

1824
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:59,119
an activist for cannabis related

1825
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:01,159
businesses in the community and the

1826
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:03,529
cannabis community in general

1827
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:06,289
and you know from us smokers from

1828
01:21:03,529 --> 01:21:11,329
medical users recreational users for

1829
01:21:06,289 --> 01:21:13,340
everybody and we see the influence we

1830
01:21:11,329 --> 01:21:20,019
have already as a small just forming

1831
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:23,840
group and we see the huge vacuum of

1832
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:25,760
influence on the local county and state

1833
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,860
level that there really needs to be an

1834
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,050
organization that's pushing for those

1835
01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:31,670
interests because there really isn't one

1836
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:34,340
right in different chapters you know

1837
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:36,739
like I know that Lee was talking about

1838
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:39,079
possibly having his own group of you

1839
01:21:36,739 --> 01:21:40,849
know north and I think that that's an

1840
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:43,340
awesome thing and that's an awesome idea

1841
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:47,060
to have someone that you can rely on in

1842
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:49,340
a statewide you know community that we

1843
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:51,289
need live you know 2530 minutes away but

1844
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:52,909
we have someone we can connect with out

1845
01:21:51,289 --> 01:21:55,579
there if we needed to I think that's

1846
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:58,639
awesome we definitely we definitely want

1847
01:21:55,579 --> 01:22:03,699
to go statewide with your organization

1848
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:06,560
and one of the reasons goes back to

1849
01:22:03,699 --> 01:22:11,029
about the satellite businesses around

1850
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:13,990
the marijuana industry and a an

1851
01:22:11,029 --> 01:22:17,199
organized group can go out and court

1852
01:22:13,989 --> 01:22:20,840
industry that can bring long-term jobs

1853
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:23,840
there needs to be a distribution club

1854
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:26,630
between Denver and the Front Range

1855
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:29,270
there isn't one now and nobody's going

1856
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:31,930
out to court these businesses nobody's

1857
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:34,700
going out to court the production of

1858
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:38,329
packaging all kinds of businesses that

1859
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:41,569
could be a hub in Pueblo and on the

1860
01:22:38,329 --> 01:22:43,489
Front Range and we need jobs here we

1861
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:45,949
don't want the big corporate [ __ ]

1862
01:22:43,489 --> 01:22:47,809
coming in here either we want to keep

1863
01:22:45,949 --> 01:22:50,269
this local we want to keep this a

1864
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:52,160
Colorado thing you know what I mean well

1865
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:53,990
I don't I don't want these big

1866
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:56,029
corporations from California and New

1867
01:22:53,989 --> 01:22:57,710
York and these billionaires to come here

1868
01:22:56,029 --> 01:22:59,239
and scoop something up they you know

1869
01:22:57,710 --> 01:23:01,039
maybe a guy that's starting with two

1870
01:22:59,239 --> 01:23:02,630
hundred thousand you know what I mean I

1871
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:07,668
don't want I think that it's gonna suck

1872
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:10,458
if we just get bought out Colorado

1873
01:23:07,668 --> 01:23:14,148
and what's not here is the level of

1874
01:23:10,458 --> 01:23:18,078
education that makes those people

1875
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:20,449
comfortable investing in what we've got

1876
01:23:18,078 --> 01:23:23,808
going and and we take it upon ourselves

1877
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:27,648
as citizens and as business owners to

1878
01:23:23,809 --> 01:23:31,309
start this group to to educate people

1879
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:34,550
and bring that level of education up to

1880
01:23:31,309 --> 01:23:37,219
where it's not a dirty investment

1881
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:40,519
anymore something that's above the board

1882
01:23:37,219 --> 01:23:44,630
something that's appreciated for what it

1883
01:23:40,519 --> 01:23:47,149
is it takes good management to run any

1884
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:49,578
company not just one in the marijuana

1885
01:23:47,149 --> 01:23:52,010
industry I just think my biggest fears

1886
01:23:49,578 --> 01:23:54,978
is that we're gonna have another you

1887
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:56,809
know another company come in here and

1888
01:23:54,979 --> 01:23:57,918
they're going to bring all of them a

1889
01:23:56,809 --> 01:23:59,630
young millions in and they're gonna

1890
01:23:57,918 --> 01:24:01,639
bring their corporate people and their

1891
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:03,288
workers from other states to move to

1892
01:24:01,639 --> 01:24:05,479
Colorado to work their big grows in

1893
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:07,849
their big plants I mean that just I

1894
01:24:05,479 --> 01:24:10,070
think that that's a fear for a lot of

1895
01:24:07,849 --> 01:24:11,689
Coloradoans that this is gonna become a

1896
01:24:10,069 --> 01:24:15,139
corporate thing because there is money

1897
01:24:11,689 --> 01:24:16,429
to be made in cannabis those of us in

1898
01:24:15,139 --> 01:24:21,078
the cannabis industry with small

1899
01:24:16,429 --> 01:24:22,849
cannabis businesses but I see why I have

1900
01:24:21,078 --> 01:24:24,648
a seed company I breed seeds I have a

1901
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:25,159
seed company that's well known and does

1902
01:24:24,649 --> 01:24:27,709
all right

1903
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:29,328
but I see there was just me and I don't

1904
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:31,698
know enough about it recently a member

1905
01:24:29,328 --> 01:24:33,859
of Monsanto was part has become part of

1906
01:24:31,698 --> 01:24:35,748
a dispensary team and that's got a lot

1907
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:41,498
of us small-timers kind of scared

1908
01:24:35,748 --> 01:24:41,498
shitless right so squeezed out instantly

1909
01:24:41,828 --> 01:24:46,099
the people that work with small

1910
01:24:44,029 --> 01:24:52,309
businesses like us know we offer that

1911
01:24:46,099 --> 01:24:53,569
loving [ __ ] just like you can get the

1912
01:24:52,309 --> 01:24:55,519
same thing at Applebee's at every

1913
01:24:53,569 --> 01:24:56,988
Applebee's that you go to but when you

1914
01:24:55,519 --> 01:24:59,119
come over to a different restaurant

1915
01:24:56,988 --> 01:25:00,198
that's homegrown you get a different

1916
01:24:59,118 --> 01:25:01,788
atmosphere and you get a different feel

1917
01:25:00,198 --> 01:25:04,279
I agree with that yeah but I still don't

1918
01:25:01,788 --> 01:25:07,969
think you know that I don't know I'm

1919
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:09,800
willing to put it out there with the big

1920
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:11,479
companies coming in here and we have

1921
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,309
people that can do it right now you know

1922
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:14,360
what I mean that it just seems like

1923
01:25:13,309 --> 01:25:15,829
there's a niche on it but you have

1924
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:18,828
enough dollars in your pocket and it's

1925
01:25:15,828 --> 01:25:20,319
deep enough things are gonna be changing

1926
01:25:18,828 --> 01:25:21,849
drastically over the next

1927
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:23,769
years this is gonna be totally different

1928
01:25:21,849 --> 01:25:26,139
so if you bring a cannabis business here

1929
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:28,060
please utilize our talent that's here

1930
01:25:26,139 --> 01:25:29,859
don't bring your own your own staff that

1931
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:31,900

01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:45,908
will will approve this I'm going to

1938
01:25:44,109 --> 01:25:48,368
bring a small gross setup here to the

1939
01:25:45,908 --> 01:25:52,078
Brickyard and set it up here over there

1940
01:25:48,368 --> 01:25:52,078
in that corner is my intention people

1941
01:25:52,109 --> 01:25:56,948
bring a grow height a little 4x4 grow

1942
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,300
hut with a 600 watt maybe a thousand

1943
01:25:56,948 --> 01:26:01,089
watt light in that [ __ ] in a few live

1944
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:12,010
plants over there in the corner for a

1945
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:15,190
few hours and for my part in that I plan

1946
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:18,789
to do a presentation about the health

1947
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:22,118
and holistic side of not only marijuana

1948
01:26:18,789 --> 01:26:25,000
but of several different botanicals a

1949
01:26:22,118 --> 01:26:28,179
lot of people know but marijuana may be

1950
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:33,849
good for medicine but they're not quite

1951
01:26:28,179 --> 01:26:36,158
sure how and one of the things that on a

1952
01:26:33,849 --> 01:26:40,119
business level I tell my clients is that

1953
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:44,229
most pharmaceutical products are

1954
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:47,170
synthesized from or based on a botanical

1955
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:51,578
that you can find in nature and so once

1956
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:57,569
you know that you can start to help

1957
01:26:51,578 --> 01:27:00,969
yourself to affect your health situation

1958
01:26:57,569 --> 01:27:05,710
affect your health situation I'm sorry

1959
01:27:00,969 --> 01:27:10,000
and so I'll be talking about how you can

1960
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:13,000
use marijuana and other botanicals as

1961
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:17,050
medicine we'll have some samples to give

1962
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:23,050
out we'll have medical personnel on hand

1963
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:26,170
to answer questions and try to bring a

1964
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:27,110
level of understanding about the medical

1965
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:28,279
uses of marijuana

1966
01:27:27,109 --> 01:27:30,809

you probably know me already

1999
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:23,340
from Texas we need guys like that are

2000
01:29:21,539 --> 01:29:25,590
articulate and do the research and can

2001
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:27,750
speak while we're bit misty is running a

2002
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:30,270
business and I'm breeding seeds you guys

2003
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:32,220
doing the research so what is our main

2004
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:33,900
goal on the 27th are we just trying to

2005
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:35,850
educate them what we trying to show them

2006
01:29:33,899 --> 01:29:37,379
that this isn't scary this is gonna be a

2007
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:39,890
smoke-free environment

2008
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:41,819
27 is there an age limit

2009
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:43,829
you know we kind of talked about it

2010
01:29:41,819 --> 01:29:45,149
we're gonna have live plants here we

2011
01:29:43,829 --> 01:29:47,850
might need to be careful I think that I

2012
01:29:45,149 --> 01:29:49,349
think that we're focusing on adults and

2013
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:51,539
I think that in our society right now

2014
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:53,250
we're considering adults 21 years of age

2015
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:54,810
okay even though you can go and you can

2016
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:55,289
fight for your country at the age of 18

2017
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:57,300
right

2018
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:59,069
what bothers me a little bit but in our

2019
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:00,840
society right now I think that we need

2020
01:29:59,069 --> 01:30:03,149
to abide by the rules and I think this

2021
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:06,750
is 21 up I don't want to teach a 16 or

2022
01:30:03,149 --> 01:30:07,439
17 year olds out of your plant focus on

2023
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:10,640
other things

2024
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:13,409
it is the adults responsibility to take

2025
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:15,390
knowledge home and share that with their

2026
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:18,930
children so absolutely we're trying to

2027
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:21,660
start from the parents and the adults

2028
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:23,579
the pillars of the community and have

2029
01:30:21,659 --> 01:30:27,359
that knowledge trickle down into the

2030
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:29,819
next generation which is gonna view this

2031
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:33,539
industry as something that has always

2032
01:30:29,819 --> 01:30:36,509
been there so we need to make their

2033
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:39,930
impression and their opportunity in

2034
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:41,820
their future in this industry something

2035
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:44,670
that's gonna make them want to stay on

2036
01:30:41,819 --> 01:30:48,659
the front range and not just run away to

2037
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:50,130

2038

01:32:06,989 --> 01:32:11,880
1027 South Boulevard so something that

2071
01:32:10,109 --> 01:32:13,829
way to frame this just as a final

2072
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,739
thought is right now the city of Pueblo

2073
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:18,659
is proposing a half cent sales tax to

2074
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:20,189
pay for police and fire who's gotten

2075
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:21,889
their fingernails in here that's weird

2076
01:32:20,189 --> 01:32:27,419
[Music]

2077
01:32:21,890 --> 01:32:30,270
so why couldn't we have smoking clubs

2078
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:34,350
and their taxes fun the police and fire

2079
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:36,180
seven another half cent sales tax has

2080
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:37,740
anyone proposed that to them no they're

2081
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:39,119
worried about their firefighters and

2082
01:32:37,739 --> 01:32:40,590
their police officers let's give them a

2083
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:48,720

2099
01:33:31,409 --> 01:33:37,189

2100
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:37,190
wants to come take a big dab

2101
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:42,969
[Music]

2102
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:45,279
I'll just put this mic in a mic stand

2103
01:33:42,969 --> 01:33:51,460
you're gonna hear a thump guys sorry

2104
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:54,488
about that should be producing their own

2105
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:57,550
meds I can't stress that enough if

2106
01:33:54,488 --> 01:34:00,549
you've got a closet if you've got any

2107
01:33:57,550 --> 01:34:03,010
locked space you can produce

2108
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:07,420
high-quality meds you don't you don't

2109
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:12,760
have to you can use a dispensary or

2110
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:17,529
retail outlet sometimes but the whole

2111
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:21,070
idea of having legal marijuana is so

2112
01:34:17,529 --> 01:34:23,079
it's accessible to everyone and it's

2113
01:34:21,069 --> 01:34:27,279
such an easy plant to grow it's a

2114
01:34:23,079 --> 01:34:30,640
[ __ ] weed and you know a lot of our

2115
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:33,039
interest and a lot of our focus is gonna

2116
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:41,440
be on education on how to produce your

2117
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:44,859
own marijuana growing your own makes you

2118
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:47,859
it slows you down take time or slow down

2119
01:34:44,859 --> 01:34:49,899
and and and take care of things besides

2120
01:34:47,859 --> 01:34:53,889
just what's going on with everyday life

2121
01:34:49,899 --> 01:34:56,259
like if I've only been growing for a

2122
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:58,179
couple years and it does it really it's

2123
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:00,039
like meditation in a way you know and in

2124
01:34:58,179 --> 01:35:02,050
it was one of those things that I didn't

2125
01:35:00,039 --> 01:35:04,448
know about I was a gamer I've had fish

2126
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:06,429
and all all those things stopped when I

2127
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:08,859
started growing you know it took over my

2128
01:35:06,429 --> 01:35:11,429
life so you can't rush a pot plant no

2129
01:35:08,859 --> 01:35:14,769
you can't hold out and it it brings

2130
01:35:11,429 --> 01:35:17,800
understanding of other other things in

2131
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:20,230
your life believe it or not will

2132
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:24,340
parallel what you're doing in the

2133
01:35:20,229 --> 01:35:28,389
growing phase for insight it's a place

2134
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:31,659
for stimulation you can continue your

2135
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:35,090
education it's there's so many benefits

2136
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:37,220
in getting involved in something new

2137
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:41,150
something you always did you always

2138
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:43,940
smoke but you never could quite make the

2139
01:35:41,149 --> 01:35:46,729
leap we're gonna try to make it easier

2140
01:35:43,939 --> 01:35:49,639
for everybody to get growing in purple

2141
01:35:46,729 --> 01:35:51,829
and and I'm sure Jeff will attain to

2142
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:55,490
this that you learn something every day

2143
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:56,539
growing there's it never stops because

2144
01:35:55,489 --> 01:35:57,920
if you don't learn something every day

2145
01:35:56,539 --> 01:36:00,829
than your girl gets old and you're never

2146
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:02,750
having and I'm that guy that always

2147
01:36:00,829 --> 01:36:04,369
strives to get to the next level well

2148
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:06,140
you seem like a fairly fit and healthy

2149
01:36:04,369 --> 01:36:08,119
kind of guy do you think that growing

2150
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:09,619
your own cannabis has contributed to you

2151
01:36:08,119 --> 01:36:11,059
paying a night I know you're a farmer

2152
01:36:09,619 --> 01:36:12,979
you grow other fruits and vegetables

2153
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:15,860
does it contribute to you taking better

2154
01:36:12,979 --> 01:36:18,169
care of yourself as a as a being I'm so

2155
01:36:15,859 --> 01:36:21,199
glad you asked that question

2156
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:26,750
for the past month I've been working on

2157
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:30,500
a surface mind out and right and so for

2158
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:33,649
six hours a day I move for hundreds we

2159
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:36,680
do about two tons a day of marble

2160
01:36:33,649 --> 01:36:40,359
granite rocks laughs and you know it's

2161
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:44,000
such a beautiful setting up there in Rye

2162
01:36:40,359 --> 01:36:46,369
we can we can smoke there we can we can

2163
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,770
kick it but the work is hard and I

2164
01:36:46,369 --> 01:36:51,970
wouldn't be able to do that work if

2165
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:55,460
these myths about marijuana was true I

2166
01:36:51,970 --> 01:36:58,460
even smoked a pack a week of cigarettes

2167
01:36:55,460 --> 01:37:03,039
believe it or not so don't buy into all

2168
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:06,319
the stereotypes about you've got to be

2169
01:37:03,039 --> 01:37:07,630
unfit because you use marijuana it's

2170
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:18,469
just not true

2171
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:20,090
thanks for coming Greg if you were a

2172
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:22,010
lazy pothead like they claim you

2173
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:29,360
wouldn't be able to work in a mine I'd

2174
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:30,530
never into Lee after he was working one

2175
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:33,019
day I happened to be stopping at the

2176
01:37:30,529 --> 01:37:34,909
same gas station this dude was covered

2177
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:36,680
and dust from head to toe he looked like

2178
01:37:34,909 --> 01:37:38,539
he had just been buried and dug out of

2179
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:40,340
the dirt that man was doing work that

2180
01:37:38,539 --> 01:37:42,079
day he looked burnt - he looked fried

2181
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:44,350
that was a man that had spent his day

2182
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:47,439

2183
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:50,770

2185
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:57,040
got a little plot of land and I use that

2186
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:59,979
plot to show people how much produce you

2187
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:04,810
can produce yourself in a small area

2188
01:37:59,979 --> 01:38:08,709
last year girl Pueblo donated over 2000

2189
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:09,580
pounds of fresh produce to the Salvation

2190
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:13,029
Army

like the page there's a lot of

2197
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:35,770
information we give not only on growing

2198
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:38,050
produce but on producing marijuana as

2199
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:39,220
well take care of yourselves guys here's

2200
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:41,110
something I want to mention it's kind of

2201
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:42,640
random Gary just took a gigantic dab and

2202
01:38:41,109 --> 01:38:44,259
I'm gonna put him on the spot I heard

2203
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:46,840
you say that since you've moved to

2204
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:48,310
Colorado you've gotten off of a lot of

2205
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,860
the medications you were taking and you

2206
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:52,480
have lost 10 pounds per month since

2207
01:38:50,859 --> 01:38:56,229
you've moved here is that accurate it is

2208
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:57,250
and I can see it now that we've hang we

2209
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:58,419
hang out a little more frequently I

2210
01:38:57,250 --> 01:39:01,539
could definitely see it start shipping

2211
01:38:58,420 --> 01:39:02,859
off you yeah it's uh I was I have a

2212
01:39:01,539 --> 01:39:05,439
three fused vertebrae in my neck

2213
01:39:02,859 --> 01:39:07,689
cervical spine it's a really bad spot

2214
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:09,869
you know real painful all the time like

2215
01:39:07,689 --> 01:39:12,909
sleeping is painful sitting this painful

2216
01:39:09,869 --> 01:39:16,960
standing walking is painful so when I

2217
01:39:12,909 --> 01:39:18,279
moved here I had quit my last job

2218
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,960
because at the end of the day I was

2219
01:39:18,279 --> 01:39:22,300
unable to get out of the chair like

2220
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:22,659
literally unable to chair I had to have

2221
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:26,050
help

2222
01:39:22,659 --> 01:39:27,670
getting to my car so I just quit and you

2223
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:28,960
know started doing the freelance thing

2224
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:31,029
did that for about six months it was

2225
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:36,220
going really well and I decided to

2226
01:39:31,029 --> 01:39:38,979
relocate here and when I got here and

2227
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:41,079
had access to cannabis regularly I

2228
01:39:38,979 --> 01:39:43,149
stopped taking I was taking six

2229
01:39:41,079 --> 01:39:47,199
hydrocodone a day I stopped taking all

2230
01:39:43,149 --> 01:39:50,479
of them within thirty days of being here

2231
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:52,099
you know I can be more active I can be

2232
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:57,500
more productive I'm a full-time student

2233
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:59,870
working on the MBA at a CSU and you know

2234
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:02,899
I get my schoolwork done faster my

2235
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:04,550
grades have improved everything you have

2236
01:40:02,899 --> 01:40:05,389
lost 10 pounds a month steadily since

2237
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:07,520
I've been here

2238
01:40:05,390 --> 01:40:09,050
and made some changes in my diet and

2239
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,570
that's actually accelerated now so

2240
01:40:09,050 --> 01:40:12,710
compared to from when I first had you we

2241
01:40:11,569 --> 01:40:14,359
had Jonah podcast you've been on a

2242
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:16,609
couple of our shows you were on Episode

2243
01:40:14,359 --> 01:40:19,069
four of the agriculture podcast this is

2244
01:40:16,609 --> 01:40:22,250
I think 17 or 18 ish so we've been

2245
01:40:19,069 --> 01:40:25,399
cranking about your thought process is

2246
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:27,050
longer and you can speak longer when I

2247
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:29,269
think that's probably from switching

2248
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:32,690
pills to cannabis exactly you're a

2249
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:34,700
little more with us you know that really

2250
01:40:32,689 --> 01:40:36,589
focuses in like on the smoking club

2251
01:40:34,699 --> 01:40:40,039
thing right how many people are out

2252
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:42,319
walking around high on pills you look at

2253
01:40:40,039 --> 01:40:44,329
the numbers of people prescribed pain

2254
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:48,710
medication yeah that's gotta be a lot of

2255
01:40:44,329 --> 01:40:50,090
[ __ ] people bottle of some kind of

2256
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:51,439
pain medicine that they were just given

2257
01:40:50,090 --> 01:40:55,310
that they don't need that the doctors

2258
01:40:51,439 --> 01:41:07,159
kind of and it states use this 90% of

2259
01:40:55,310 --> 01:41:09,920
all the pharmaceuticals uses 90% of that

2260
01:41:07,159 --> 01:41:13,130
and if the rest of the world gets

2261
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:16,250
headaches and and has back pains but

2262
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:19,430
they don't but they don't go to

2263
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:22,369
pharmaceutical route do they do they not

2264
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:25,480
still use natural stuff I mean and that

2265
01:41:22,369 --> 01:41:30,800
goes I'm glad you asked that and so uh

2266
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:33,409
there's a practical example you go to

2267
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:35,119
the doctor you get a scrip for and be

2268
01:41:33,409 --> 01:41:36,118
kind of an adapter or something like

2269
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:41,729
that for

2270
01:41:36,118 --> 01:41:42,658
issue and it's got a high risk of

2271
01:41:41,729 --> 01:41:46,079
dependence

2272
01:41:42,658 --> 01:41:49,878
it's got terrible side effects and that

2273
01:41:46,078 --> 01:41:53,969
doctor could very well have told you

2274
01:41:49,878 --> 01:41:57,300
Larry everything the exact same thing

2275
01:41:53,969 --> 01:41:59,760
with no side effects is you're not gonna

2276
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:04,019
get hooked on it but no one wants to

2277
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:06,780
chew on no damn root anymore man pop

2278
01:42:04,019 --> 01:42:11,248
into pills done can make a tea with it

2279
01:42:06,779 --> 01:42:14,998
you can compress you can bake it into a

2280
01:42:11,248 --> 01:42:19,019
cake and have that cake which at night

2281
01:42:14,998 --> 01:42:23,128
and excuse me at that time and so across

2282
01:42:19,019 --> 01:42:28,199
the across the medical board across the

2283
01:42:23,128 --> 01:42:32,158
scale of illnesses there are botanicals

2284
01:42:28,198 --> 01:42:36,299
that affect those illnesses in a

2285
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:39,299
positive way and my core company is

2286
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:42,659
called nonstop wellness and that's what

2287
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:46,168
non-stop wellness does is empowers

2288
01:42:42,658 --> 01:42:49,078
people with the information they need to

2289
01:42:46,168 --> 01:42:51,779
affect their health outside of

2290
01:42:49,078 --> 01:42:54,929
traditional medicine and I've been here

2291
01:42:51,779 --> 01:42:57,628
in Pueblo for four years now I've run a

2292
01:42:54,929 --> 01:43:02,819
doctor's office that provided access to

2293
01:42:57,628 --> 01:43:06,628
the red card registry and provided a lot

2294
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:09,958
of services to people with serious

2295
01:43:06,628 --> 01:43:14,788
illnesses illnesses like bone cancer

2296
01:43:09,958 --> 01:43:18,929
like multiple sclerosis skull bro stirs

2297
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:24,898
you have to excuse me you're good even

2298
01:43:18,929 --> 01:43:28,828
arthritis ocular pressure across the

2299
01:43:24,899 --> 01:43:32,999
board and there are specific strains of

2300
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:35,988
cannabis or other botanicals that under

2301
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:39,689
proper proper medical super-fit

2302
01:43:35,988 --> 01:43:44,639
supervision have just as high

2303
01:43:39,689 --> 01:43:47,979
success outcomes as their pharmaceutical

2304
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:49,600
counterparts do you work with the

2305
01:43:47,979 --> 01:43:50,889
principle of hot and cold herbs so if

2306
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:55,770
you give me valerian you got to give me

2307
01:43:50,890 --> 01:44:00,160
something cool to work well exactly and

2308
01:43:55,770 --> 01:44:04,300
some herbs are cooling herbs some heat

2309
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:07,649
the body and so mint versus cinnamon

2310
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:13,590
would be a good example of of those two

2311
01:44:07,649 --> 01:44:17,199
working at opposite good heart health

2312
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:23,020
absolutely and so the the heating herbs

2313
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:26,229
are effective with things like people

2314
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:30,390
who are cold who have chills

2315
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:38,439
the cooling herbs lower blood pressure

2316
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:44,820
and even something as simple as a tepid

2317
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:49,509
bath versus hot bath versus a cold bath

2318
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:53,500
can have a positive effect on a wide

2319
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:56,650
range of illness and I'm speaking

2320
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:59,229
generally because I'm not trying to give

2321
01:44:56,649 --> 01:45:02,289
any health advice I'm just trying to

2322
01:44:59,229 --> 01:45:03,250
point people in the right direction it's

2323
01:45:02,289 --> 01:45:05,710
alright I didn't need to see your

2324
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:07,840
medical degree dr. Lee we got you man I

2325
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:15,220

2326
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:16,449
buzzed and different plants and stuff

2327
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:17,560
like that and like you were saying

2328
01:45:16,449 --> 01:45:19,599
earlier if you want to learn to grow you

2329
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:21,220
don't have to grow marijuana growing is

2330
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:23,860
growing you know like getting out there

2331
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:25,690
in the garden will alleviate the stress

2332
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:27,880
that you have in your life absolutely

2333
01:45:25,689 --> 01:45:29,949
you know if you if you live in a state

2334
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:31,810
where you can't grow get out there and

2335
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:34,179
start a garden grow corn grow tomatoes

2336
01:45:31,810 --> 01:45:35,740
you know tomato plant is just about the

2337
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:37,119
same except for you can actually eat the

2338
01:45:35,739 --> 01:45:43,960
fruit Tony's gonna argue with you that

2339
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:45,099
well yeah responsibility every morning

2340
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:46,510
with it you got to play with the dirt

2341
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,070
you got to get rid of bugs you gotta

2342
01:45:46,510 --> 01:45:50,710
learn when to harvest it's all the same

2343
01:45:48,069 --> 01:45:54,670
principle different plant the whole

2344
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:59,319
works on the agricultural principle and

2345
01:45:54,670 --> 01:46:02,949
even for you religious people biblical

2346
01:45:59,319 --> 01:46:06,279
principles become clear when you grow

2347
01:46:02,949 --> 01:46:09,130
things and so you know you may hear

2348
01:46:06,279 --> 01:46:10,779
someone say nip it in the bud or or they

2349
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:12,789
want to get down to the root of

2350
01:46:10,779 --> 01:46:16,689
something but until you've grown

2351
01:46:12,789 --> 01:46:20,140
something and experienced a growth cycle

2352
01:46:16,689 --> 01:46:22,869
a lot of things just aren't clear people

2353
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:25,119
were meant to have that relationship

2354
01:46:22,869 --> 01:46:30,220
with the earth and it's been sorely

2355
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:34,090
neglected excuse me neglected by the

2356
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:37,840
past couple of generations absolutely

2357
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:39,670
yeah we've taken the taking the plants

2358
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,869
out of the ground we ground them up and

2359
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:45,480
we've made little pills that are mixed

2360
01:46:40,869 --> 01:46:48,760
with a whole bunch of other you know

2361
01:46:45,479 --> 01:46:50,109
other countries where people eat fruit

2362
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:52,539
and vegetables all day long they don't

2363
01:46:50,109 --> 01:46:53,799
have the cancers craps and tumors and

2364
01:46:52,539 --> 01:46:59,319
craps that we have here they're not

2365
01:46:53,800 --> 01:47:03,239
obese they're not crazy the problem is

2366
01:46:59,319 --> 01:47:07,689
in our government what happens is our

2367
01:47:03,239 --> 01:47:11,229
elected officials are bought by the

2368
01:47:07,689 --> 01:47:13,029
corporate interest and you know there's

2369
01:47:11,229 --> 01:47:16,769
a very good chance that Barack Obama

2370
01:47:13,029 --> 01:47:20,170
will become part of the staff of

2371
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:22,750
Monsanto when he leaves office that's

2372
01:47:20,170 --> 01:47:26,710
the kind of tricks they pull in in

2373
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:31,840
government and he's appointed several

2374
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:36,189
people that have taken away our right to

2375
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:41,159
be informed about what we buy it at

2376
01:47:36,189 --> 01:47:41,159
retail for our bodies

2377
01:47:41,210 --> 01:47:46,340

really is I mean it can be it can be a

2403
01:48:57,289 --> 01:49:01,460
lot of heavy lifting involved you know

2404
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:02,630
if you're even doing like aquaponics or

2405
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:05,270
stuff like that it can be like

2406
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:06,890
construction and you know it really is

2407
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:08,930
good to grow as a person that way you

2408
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:11,090
learn a lot about different things that

2409
01:49:08,930 --> 01:49:12,739
don't even have to do with growing that

2410

2415
01:49:21,109 --> 01:49:23,929
everyone involved it really is that's a

2416
01:49:23,238 --> 01:49:27,289
great point

2417
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:30,680
and and and to that point I also want to

2418
01:49:27,289 --> 01:49:32,719
kind of debunk another myth that goes

2419
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:35,329
hand-in-hand with that people say you

2420
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:37,579
smoke and then you gotta eat you get the

2421
01:49:35,329 --> 01:49:40,399
munchies and so you get fast but that's

2422
01:49:37,579 --> 01:49:43,100
not what's what's happening at all what

2423
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:46,009
happens is you smoke marijuana and it

2424
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:48,160
raises your metabolism and people

2425
01:49:46,010 --> 01:49:51,000
identify that with

2426
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:53,769
but it's it's not hunger it's your body

2427
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,500
opportunity for you to get moving and

2428
01:49:53,770 --> 01:50:02,170
it's your body telling you that it's

2429
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:03,609
switching from using food to burning fat

2430
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:05,590
somebody told me if I brush my teeth

2431
01:50:03,609 --> 01:50:07,689
right after I smoke I won't get the

2432
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:16,029
munchies I don't know if I tried it or

2433
01:50:07,689 --> 01:50:19,089
not if you normally get the munchies

2434
01:50:16,029 --> 01:50:21,849
smokeable on the brush your teeth as a

2435
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:23,110
new grower as a new grower since you're

2436
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:25,570
paying attention your plants now do you

2437
01:50:23,109 --> 01:50:26,559
pay attention to your pH a little bit

2438
01:50:25,569 --> 01:50:28,119
more because you gotta pay you said

2439
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,280
aquaponics I assume that it takes a lot

2440
01:50:28,119 --> 01:50:31,630
of pH adjustment yeah think about what

2441
01:50:30,279 --> 01:50:40,989
you're putting into yourself and your

2442
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:41,980
own personal pH balance when you work

2443
01:50:40,989 --> 01:50:44,199
with the plants and feed them properly

2444
01:50:41,979 --> 01:50:46,569
and love them they grow and look healthy

2445
01:50:44,199 --> 01:50:47,920
and I can only imagine I've seen what

2446
01:50:46,569 --> 01:50:49,269
happens when I feed my plants a shitty

2447
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:52,750
nutrient and that's what I think of when

2448
01:50:49,270 --> 01:51:00,130
I eat a Snickers bar make fat buds from

2449
01:50:52,750 --> 01:51:01,569
eating a Snickers bar yeah the proper

2450
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:02,800
carbo load would be a good idea I'm

2451
01:51:01,569 --> 01:51:06,909
gonna take a DAB who's got something to

2452
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:09,070
say I mean I met you the same night that

2453
01:51:06,909 --> 01:51:12,939
I met Jeff you know which was that which

2454
01:51:09,069 --> 01:51:14,859
was at another dab association type bar

2455
01:51:12,939 --> 01:51:17,229
or gathering and I mean dude you look

2456
01:51:14,859 --> 01:51:19,000
great since then so I mean any anybody

2457
01:51:17,229 --> 01:51:22,779
trying to tell you that marijuana's is

2458
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,359
not working as some cue fat yeah I mean

2459
01:51:22,779 --> 01:51:27,369
dude I've smoked pot pretty much all my

2460
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:30,670
life my parents both smoked smoked pot

2461
01:51:27,369 --> 01:51:33,369
they grew up hot maybe it's my mom my

2462
01:51:30,670 --> 01:51:35,920
Hobbit metabolism but I highly doubt it

2463
01:51:33,369 --> 01:51:38,140
you know it's one thing I can't I don't

2464
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:41,020
eat until I smoke pot yeah that's that's

2465
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:43,300
one of the things you know we'll get a

2466
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:44,920
bag and I won't eat three or four hours

2467
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:47,619
afterwards just because I want to be

2468
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:49,210
able to enjoy my high I'm one of those

2469
01:51:47,619 --> 01:51:51,250
people that if I get in the shower or if

2470
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:53,260
I eat a burger or something like that

2471
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:55,119
I'm done it's done it's gone you know

2472
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:56,560
and then I'm going back into my bag and

2473
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:58,000
you're never you're not gonna get high

2474
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,989
after that you know it's right wait as

2475
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:04,929
long as I right

2476
01:51:58,988 --> 01:52:07,238
don't think that hunger pains are gonna

2477
01:52:04,929 --> 01:52:21,248
kill them and that's that's not that's

2478
01:52:07,238 --> 01:52:24,669
not the case law if you just and it's

2479
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:26,380
also a something to do with my hands I

2480
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:30,560
just get bored you know I need some

2481
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:34,418
chips or some you gotta grab a whole

2482
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:34,419
[Music]

2483
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:51,969
there's all kind of stuff to do to Rhian

2484
01:52:47,578 --> 01:52:55,538
yourself to have better habits and it's

2485
01:52:51,969 --> 01:52:58,868
it's it's a tough proposition but it's

2486
01:52:55,538 --> 01:53:02,529
worth it in the end and so growing

2487
01:52:58,868 --> 01:53:06,670
things and growing things is a great way

2488
01:53:02,529 --> 01:53:08,288
to do that there's plenty of grow

2489
01:53:06,670 --> 01:53:09,998
lessons coming up from this show and

2490
01:53:08,288 --> 01:53:11,319
already given on this show so absolutely

2491
01:53:09,998 --> 01:53:13,809
don't be afraid we'll teach you how to

2492
01:53:11,319 --> 01:53:15,670
grow up plenty of great weed something I

2493
01:53:13,809 --> 01:53:17,619
want to mention be hungry once in a

2494
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:19,538
while there are plenty of hungry [ __ ]

2495
01:53:17,618 --> 01:53:22,179
people and plenty of places don't have

2496
01:53:19,538 --> 01:53:24,248
it as well as you do hungry see what

2497
01:53:22,179 --> 01:53:26,559
that's like quit being a whiny [ __ ] all

2498
01:53:24,248 --> 01:53:28,149
the time be hungry feel that and when

2499
01:53:26,559 --> 01:53:33,610
you're like damn I'm hungry you'd be a

2500
01:53:28,149 --> 01:53:43,359
little hungry just once better often

2501
01:53:33,609 --> 01:53:46,448
almost 70% of the population in my house

2502
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:48,698
yeah yeah so Adam stands in front of the

2503
01:53:46,448 --> 01:53:51,388
freezer puts his head in there and fans

2504
01:53:48,698 --> 01:53:51,388
himself - cool

2505
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:59,389
you put your feet in a pan of ice water

2506
01:53:56,229 --> 01:54:03,039
just a few points to kind of kind of

2507
01:53:59,389 --> 01:54:05,270
kind of refocus we want the same kind of

2508
01:54:03,039 --> 01:54:08,479
representation that we've already got

2509
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:12,070
for alcohol we don't want anything new

2510
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:15,589
we don't want anything fancy we also

2511
01:54:12,069 --> 01:54:20,359
want the citizens to be involved in in

2512
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:23,779
the law making part of the industry we

2513
01:54:20,359 --> 01:54:27,259
also want the government to understand

2514
01:54:23,779 --> 01:54:29,809
that the people voted for marijuana and

2515
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:32,960
they didn't vote for bans they didn't

2516
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:37,039
vote for moratoriums and we have that

2517
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:40,819
sisters situation because people just

2518
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:44,899
didn't get involved and so see our RC

2519
01:54:40,819 --> 01:54:48,559
that's the organization that we've

2520
01:54:44,899 --> 01:54:52,579
started to interface with our government

2521
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:56,239
and be a part of the laws that are gonna

2522
01:54:52,579 --> 01:54:58,429
affect you so you may as well get

2523
01:54:56,238 --> 01:54:59,988
involved yeah you can't complain about

2524
01:54:58,429 --> 01:55:04,369
the rules if you did not help make them

2525
01:54:59,988 --> 01:55:06,379
when you had the chance did create the

2526
01:55:04,369 --> 01:55:08,059
marijuana board they passed that and

2527
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:15,920
I've applied to be a kudos to them for

2528
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:22,190
that they acted fast on that to us on

2529
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:28,149
the show adversarial to us the situation

2530
01:55:22,189 --> 01:55:32,559
is just no one has has stepped up to

2531
01:55:28,149 --> 01:55:38,479
feel the need for citizen participation

2532
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:41,390
and that's happened we welcome anyone

2533
01:55:38,479 --> 01:55:47,179
who wants to be a part and

2677
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:36,010
fun some dying from a DAB but here in

2678
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:36,960
just a minute we're gonna get a party

2679
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:39,340
started

2680
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:40,840
it's a rainy day here in Colorado I'm

2681
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:42,730
hanging out relaxing listening to the

2682
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:45,069
sound of the rain and thunder I've been

2683
02:04:42,729 --> 02:04:46,179
wondering what to put on the show it's

2684
02:04:45,069 --> 02:04:47,500
been a few days since I put out an

2685
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:49,390
episode and I messed up the rhythm by

2686
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:51,460
putting out a show on Saturday but I'm

2687
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:55,660
back on schedule with number 19 so

2688
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:57,789
thanks for joining me gosh I think I've

2689
02:04:55,659 --> 02:05:00,220
recovered from that dab last night over

2690
02:04:57,789 --> 02:05:04,119
to the 710 cup award ceremony in Denver

2691
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:06,490
the 710 cup is a hash festival it's kind

2692
02:05:04,119 --> 02:05:09,099
of a competition there were about 50

2693
02:05:06,489 --> 02:05:11,170
entries in the hash contest what they do

2694
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:13,539
is the hash makers enter their hash

2695
02:05:11,170 --> 02:05:16,600
already their concentrate already broken

2696
02:05:13,539 --> 02:05:18,159
down into small samples so I think there

2697
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:20,920
were 50 contestants which means they had

2698
02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:23,920
to turn in 50 samples those entries are

2699
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:25,810
then assigned a number and they make a

2700
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:28,659
little kit for each of the judges so

2701
02:05:25,810 --> 02:05:30,850
you're given a little like a pencil box

2702
02:05:28,659 --> 02:05:32,829
full of samples labeled one through 50

2703
02:05:30,850 --> 02:05:34,270
and you basically go through and you

2704
02:05:32,829 --> 02:05:37,600
spend a couple of days smoking each

2705
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:39,970
sample and you judge them by flavor

2706
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:41,500
texture appearance there's a nice little

2707
02:05:39,970 --> 02:05:42,880
list of things that we judge them on I

2708
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:45,159
was not part of the judging this year I

2709
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:47,470
did it last year this year I did not do

2710
02:05:45,159 --> 02:05:48,880
any of the judging but you go and you

2711
02:05:47,470 --> 02:05:51,159
judge all the stuff and then you turn in

2712
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:53,319
your judging all your paperwork's and

2713
02:05:51,159 --> 02:05:55,510
then on Saturday night last night they

2714
02:05:53,319 --> 02:05:57,309
announced all of the winners and they do

2715
02:05:55,510 --> 02:06:00,190
it by numbers to keep it anonymous so

2716
02:05:57,310 --> 02:06:02,890
that way nobody knows which sample is

2717
02:06:00,189 --> 02:06:04,869
which so I did not attend the Friday or

2718
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:05,239
Saturday portions of the event I was

2719
02:06:04,869 --> 02:06:06,679
only

2720
02:06:05,238 --> 02:06:10,098
able to make it up to the award ceremony

2721
02:06:06,679 --> 02:06:11,719
at Quixote's on Saturday night but that

2722
02:06:10,099 --> 02:06:14,059
part was tons of fun the party kicked

2723
02:06:11,719 --> 02:06:16,399
off with a marijuana comedian

2724
02:06:14,059 --> 02:06:18,139
I was a little dabbed out and distracted

2725
02:06:16,399 --> 02:06:20,118
by conversation when they introduced him

2726
02:06:18,139 --> 02:06:21,319
so I did not catch his name and I

2727
02:06:20,118 --> 02:06:23,389
honestly didn't pay too much attention

2728
02:06:21,319 --> 02:06:24,738
to most of his set I had bumped into a

2729
02:06:23,389 --> 02:06:26,659
bunch of friends hadn't seen in a while

2730
02:06:24,738 --> 02:06:28,038
we kind of got into conversation I

2731
02:06:26,658 --> 02:06:29,448
apologized to the comedian for not

2732
02:06:28,038 --> 02:06:31,550
paying any attention I feel a little

2733
02:06:29,448 --> 02:06:33,439
rude about that but you know what I was

2734
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:35,510
there for a party so after the comedian

2735
02:06:33,439 --> 02:06:38,448
there was an award ceremony where Sean

2736
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:40,039
Tron took home most of the awards we'll

2737
02:06:38,448 --> 02:06:42,439
go over a full list of the award winners

2738
02:06:40,038 --> 02:06:44,029
just a little bit so there's a funky jam

2739
02:06:42,439 --> 02:06:46,339
band that played a Grateful Dead cover

2740
02:06:44,029 --> 02:06:47,899
that I really appreciated they played a

2741
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:50,029
version of shakedown Street that I

2742
02:06:47,899 --> 02:06:51,799
thought was pretty damn awesome I get to

2743
02:06:50,029 --> 02:06:54,649
visit with a bunch of friends and I only

2744
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:56,659
see it for 20 or 710 events and to top

2745
02:06:54,649 --> 02:06:58,998
it all off I stuck around to hear a few

2746
02:06:56,658 --> 02:07:01,129
songs from old school rappers Slick Rick

2747
02:06:58,998 --> 02:07:03,380
food Slick Rick was wearing more gold

2748
02:07:01,130 --> 02:07:05,449
than I've ever seen I've seen full rap

2749
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:07,460
groups not wearing as much gold and

2750
02:07:05,448 --> 02:07:07,759
bling a Slick Rick had if he could get

2751
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:10,578
it

2752
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:13,130
diamond and gold watch he had his rings

2753
02:07:10,578 --> 02:07:17,569
were bigger than most people's pendants

2754
02:07:13,130 --> 02:07:19,940
he had the links in his gold chains were

2755
02:07:17,569 --> 02:07:23,808

02:08:02,779 --> 02:08:08,420
the award ceremony went fairly smoothly

2778
02:08:04,998 --> 02:08:10,788
I was just ran by Mike fro and Ryan Rua

2779
02:08:08,420 --> 02:08:12,319
Connolly from grassroots and they did a

2780
02:08:10,788 --> 02:08:14,759
hell of a job so I also want to give a

2781
02:08:12,319 --> 02:08:16,739
big shout out to Big D

2782
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:19,320
D was given a Lifetime Achievement Award

2783
02:08:16,739 --> 02:08:21,179
from the 7:10 community I was great to

2784
02:08:19,319 --> 02:08:24,029
see somebody honored and for his

2785
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:25,500
dedication and his work in the community

2786
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:27,029
and not just for his hash making skills

2787
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:29,310
he's received plenty of awards for that

2788
02:08:27,029 --> 02:08:30,809
it was good to see him get an award just

2789
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:32,340
for being a good dude that was well

2790
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:34,230
overdue

2791
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:36,539
the part of the event I saw was great

2792
02:08:34,229 --> 02:08:38,219
during one of Slick Rick songs the whole

2793
02:08:36,539 --> 02:08:40,109
sound system was dead for a couple of

2794
02:08:38,220 --> 02:08:41,909
minutes and they had to figure out what

2795
02:08:40,109 --> 02:08:43,739
went wrong to get the show started again

2796
02:08:41,909 --> 02:08:45,029
so I was kind of curious how you know

2797
02:08:43,739 --> 02:08:46,229
he's kind of a superstar I was kind of

2798
02:08:45,029 --> 02:08:48,029
curious how he would handle it but he

2799
02:08:46,229 --> 02:08:49,379
just waited it out he stood on stage to

2800
02:08:48,029 --> 02:08:50,550
kind of cool it down it was hot in there

2801
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:55,140
I think he took a minute to catch his

2802
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:58,079
breath and cool down it was hot in there

2803
02:08:55,140 --> 02:08:59,789
so after that first band played he got

2804
02:08:58,079 --> 02:09:02,850
really hot by the time Slick Rick came

2805
02:08:59,789 --> 02:09:04,470
up it was way too hot for me so after a

2806
02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:06,480
couple of his songs I took a final dab

2807
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:10,320
and I headed out and that was mostly my

2808
02:09:06,479 --> 02:09:12,000
7:10 cup experience I said we do a

2809
02:09:10,319 --> 02:09:14,099

2810

02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:28,289
was blueberry plus Grape Ape

2879
02:12:24,890 --> 02:12:30,300
these are pluses not times so these are

2880
02:12:28,289 --> 02:12:33,300
not bred together these are two strains

2881
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:35,159
that were blended together their blends

2882
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:37,770
not crosses is what I think I'm trying

2883
02:12:35,159 --> 02:12:41,609
to say so there were two special Awards

2884
02:12:37,770 --> 02:12:43,560
for the 2014 7:10 cup one of the awards

2885
02:12:41,609 --> 02:12:45,719
was the People's Choice Award and guess

2886
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:47,760
who that one went to that went to the

2887
02:12:45,719 --> 02:12:50,579
health center which is Sean Tron once

2888
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:53,190
again with number 37 the pre Jilly and

2889
02:12:50,579 --> 02:12:55,859
then drumroll please first place overall

2890
02:12:53,189 --> 02:12:58,469
you may be able to predict this one it

2891
02:12:55,859 --> 02:13:01,439
went to guess who Sean Tron once again

2892
02:12:58,469 --> 02:13:02,760
with the health center number 37 pre

2893
02:13:01,439 --> 02:13:10,889

that's really cool of them to do there

2914
02:13:57,930 --> 02:14:01,890
was a scare that the competition was not

02:13:59,250 --> 02:14:02,969
going to happen this year and I'm glad

2916

happen I apologize I'm getting a

product I use my oil slick every single

2967
02:15:50,930 --> 02:15:53,900
day I've got a big oil slick pad that I

2968
02:15:52,579 --> 02:15:56,479
like to set a couple of my favorite

2969
02:15:53,899 --> 02:15:58,339
glass pieces on I got a couple of my

2970
02:15:56,479 --> 02:16:01,009
favorite glass rigs on the oil slick pad

2971
02:15:58,340 --> 02:16:02,510
I've got a carb cap on there I've got my

2972
02:16:01,010 --> 02:16:04,760
favorite concentrate sitting on the oil

2973
02:16:02,510 --> 02:16:06,560
slick pad I know that my concentrates

2974
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:08,060
not going to stick to the oil slick pad

2975
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:10,910
I know that I'm not gonna leave a bunch

2976
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:12,890
of sticky rings on my table it's a place

2977
02:16:10,909 --> 02:16:14,539
to keep my stuff kind of organized it's

2978
02:16:12,890 --> 02:16:16,369
a nice little dedicated spot is what I

2979
02:16:14,539 --> 02:16:17,359
feel like and also you hear this sound

2980
02:16:16,369 --> 02:16:17,630
right here I don't know if you can hear

2981
02:16:17,359 --> 02:16:19,789
it

2982
02:16:17,630 --> 02:16:21,590
that's a rig hitting a table that's just

2983
02:16:19,789 --> 02:16:25,310
sending a rig down on a table here's a

2984
02:16:21,590 --> 02:16:26,539
rig sitting down on a slick bed they

2985
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:27,830
made a little noise because I set it

2986
02:16:26,539 --> 02:16:29,569
down really hard it was out of my reach

2987
02:16:27,829 --> 02:16:31,399
but I mean did it I'd much rather

2988
02:16:29,569 --> 02:16:32,750
centered on the oil slick pad than the

2989
02:16:31,399 --> 02:16:35,569
wooden table it just feels a little

2990
02:16:32,750 --> 02:16:37,159
better for my rig one side sticks to the

2991
02:16:35,569 --> 02:16:39,440
table real well so it won't slide around

2992
02:16:37,159 --> 02:16:41,269
then the other side is nice and nice and

2993
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:43,550
soft and your dabs won't stick to it

2994
02:16:41,269 --> 02:16:45,019
get yourself an oil slick pad also quit

2995
02:16:43,549 --> 02:16:45,888
carrying your hash around and fold it up

2996
02:16:45,019 --> 02:16:48,260
parchment paper

2997
02:16:45,888 --> 02:16:50,388
that doesn't look classy at all bro get

2998
02:16:48,260 --> 02:16:52,819
yourself a oil slick container they make

2999
02:16:50,388 --> 02:16:54,799
them in every color so have some class

3000
02:16:52,819 --> 02:16:57,138
it's an oil slick products step up the

3001
02:16:54,799 --> 02:16:58,759
game a little bit alright guys feels

3002
02:16:57,138 --> 02:17:00,679
like I need a dab so I'm gonna take a

3003
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:02,239
quick dab and we will work our way into

3004
02:17:00,679 --> 02:17:03,950
a little bit of news hang tight for just

3005
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:06,299
a minute

3006
02:17:03,950 --> 02:17:09,090
alright guys I'm back on the microphone

3007
02:17:06,299 --> 02:17:10,590
after way too many fat dabs is speaking

3008
02:17:09,090 --> 02:17:12,450
away too many fat dabs I want to

3009
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:14,279
recommend another podcast I think you

3010
02:17:12,450 --> 02:17:16,529
guys should be listening to the Adam

3011
02:17:14,279 --> 02:17:18,210
Dunn show I know it seems weird that I'm

3012
02:17:16,529 --> 02:17:19,738
advertising another podcast that may be

3013
02:17:18,209 --> 02:17:21,928
considered a competitor but I don't see

3014
02:17:19,738 --> 02:17:24,750
that as a competition in any way at all

3015
02:17:21,929 --> 02:17:26,808
I would be doing you a disservice if I

3016
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:29,340
did not recommend that I'm done show

3017
02:17:26,808 --> 02:17:32,308
specifically go back and listen to the

3018
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:33,478
all about dabs episode 2 &amp; 3 and really

3019
02:17:32,308 --> 02:17:35,849
pay attention to what those guys are

3020
02:17:33,478 --> 02:17:38,010
talking about about what we're doing to

3021
02:17:35,849 --> 02:17:39,840
ourselves health-wise with dab some of

3022
02:17:38,010 --> 02:17:42,779
that stuff may be interesting to you it

3023
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:44,818
may reduce your dad intake I'm known for

3024
02:17:42,779 --> 02:17:46,710
taking some [ __ ] huge dabs Ravine for

3025
02:17:44,818 --> 02:17:49,590
being a dab monster for love and loving

3026
02:17:46,709 --> 02:17:52,018
to take a lot of dabs that episode has

3027
02:17:49,590 --> 02:17:55,308
changed my dab intake and my approach to

3028
02:17:52,019 --> 02:17:58,380
dabbing a little bit those two episodes

3029
02:17:55,308 --> 02:17:59,789
I'm not anything I'm just more conscious

3030
02:17:58,379 --> 02:18:01,018
and I think that we should all be a

3031
02:17:59,790 --> 02:18:02,939
little bit aware of what we're doing to

3032
02:18:01,019 --> 02:18:04,139
our bodies and what we are potentially

3033
02:18:02,939 --> 02:18:08,010
doing to ourselves I'm not trying to

3034
02:18:04,138 --> 02:18:10,858
scare you but listen to the episodes of

3035

3052
02:18:43,799 --> 02:18:47,488
here we are

3053
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:52,559
Colorado study pegs annual pod demand at

3054
02:18:47,488 --> 02:18:55,289
a hundred and thirty metric tons goddamn

3055
02:18:52,558 --> 02:18:57,539
you smoke a lot of weed Colorado a state

3056
02:18:55,290 --> 02:19:00,059
produced study has included that high

3057
02:18:57,540 --> 02:19:02,069
taxes and fewer stores are keeping

3058
02:19:00,058 --> 02:19:03,629
Colorado Medical Marijuana consumers

3059
02:19:02,068 --> 02:19:05,728
from switching to the recreational

3060
02:19:03,629 --> 02:19:08,129
cannabis market a trend that if

3061
02:19:05,728 --> 02:19:09,670
continues will have a major impact on

3062
02:19:08,129 --> 02:19:11,949
the state's predicted Marilyn

3063
02:19:09,670 --> 02:19:13,450
tax windfall the study released

3064
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:15,189
Wednesday found that out-of-state

3065
02:19:13,450 --> 02:19:17,139
visitors make up nearly half of the

3066
02:19:15,189 --> 02:19:19,360
recreational marijuana sales in the

3067
02:19:17,138 --> 02:19:20,949
Denver area and 90% of recreational

3068
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:23,079
sales and mountain resort communities

3069
02:19:20,950 --> 02:19:25,300
tourists though account for only about

3070
02:19:23,079 --> 02:19:27,700
7% of the annual demand for marijuana

3071
02:19:25,299 --> 02:19:30,808
and the state which the study estimates

3072
02:19:27,700 --> 02:19:33,939
at a hundred and thirty point three

3073
02:19:30,808 --> 02:19:36,188
metric tons that's a lotta weed dude I

3074
02:19:33,939 --> 02:19:43,960
can't even fathom a hundred and thirty

3075
02:19:36,189 --> 02:19:47,019
point three metric tons I was in Denver

3076
02:19:43,959 --> 02:19:50,169
driving yesterday for that 7/10 Cup my

3077
02:19:47,019 --> 02:19:51,850
past dispensary that's right there there

3078
02:19:50,170 --> 02:19:53,379
in downtown Denver and there were a

3079
02:19:51,850 --> 02:19:55,329
group of people that were obviously from

3080
02:19:53,379 --> 02:19:57,069
out of state because they were gathered

3081
02:19:55,329 --> 02:19:58,180
in front of the sign of the dispensary

3082
02:19:57,069 --> 02:19:59,949
and they were taking turns taking

3083
02:19:58,180 --> 02:20:01,930
picture of each other throw in there a

3084
02:19:59,950 --> 02:20:03,220
local gang sign up in front of the

3085
02:20:01,930 --> 02:20:06,189
dispensary sign I found it entertaining

3086
02:20:03,219 --> 02:20:09,399
I take it for granted we here in

3087
02:20:06,189 --> 02:20:10,930
Colorado we've forgot Blake we just go

3088
02:20:09,399 --> 02:20:12,489
to the weed store buy some weed or we

3089
02:20:10,930 --> 02:20:13,329
don't most of us are probably growing

3090
02:20:12,489 --> 02:20:15,850
our own by now

3091
02:20:13,329 --> 02:20:17,978
they said that 50% of the recreational

3092
02:20:15,850 --> 02:20:19,989
sales is from people from out of state

3093
02:20:17,978 --> 02:20:21,340
my buddy Kevin that's on the show

3094
02:20:19,989 --> 02:20:22,750
sometimes he works at a shop he says

3095
02:20:21,340 --> 02:20:25,870
most of the people are from Texas

3096
02:20:22,750 --> 02:20:28,809
so most of that's gone to Texas it

3097
02:20:25,870 --> 02:20:30,700
sounds like one quarter at a time so

3098
02:20:28,809 --> 02:20:33,369
I'll continue with the article the study

3099
02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:35,470
finds total marijuana demand to be much

3100
02:20:33,370 --> 02:20:38,590
larger than previously estimated the

3101
02:20:35,469 --> 02:20:40,329
study's author write in their report the

3102
02:20:38,590 --> 02:20:42,189
reason the authors conclude is that

3103
02:20:40,329 --> 02:20:44,950
previous studies have underestimated the

3104
02:20:42,189 --> 02:20:47,829
level of demand from heavy users the new

3105
02:20:44,950 --> 02:20:50,140
study finds that the top 22 percent of

3106
02:20:47,829 --> 02:20:52,539
marijuana users in Colorado account for

3107
02:20:50,139 --> 02:20:55,539
nearly 67 percent of the total demand

3108
02:20:52,540 --> 02:20:58,330
the bottom 50 poor four percent users

3109
02:20:55,540 --> 02:21:00,370
account for only about four percent of

3110
02:20:58,329 --> 02:21:01,989
demand my lips are all sticky you guys

3111
02:21:00,370 --> 02:21:04,870
can hear it that's from the big fat dab

3112
02:21:01,989 --> 02:21:06,939
I took think about that if my lips are

3113
02:21:04,870 --> 02:21:08,500
sticky how far down into that sticky

3114
02:21:06,939 --> 02:21:10,780
shake is that all in my throat is that

3115
02:21:08,500 --> 02:21:11,889
all of my lungs because I felt it on my

3116
02:21:10,780 --> 02:21:13,150
teeth the other night that kind of

3117
02:21:11,889 --> 02:21:15,250
freaked me out it made me start thinking

3118
02:21:13,149 --> 02:21:18,459
about this that's just a weird random

3119
02:21:15,250 --> 02:21:20,680
side note so this just said 22% of

3120
02:21:18,459 --> 02:21:22,489
marijuana users in Colorado account for

3121
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:25,489
nearly 67

3122
02:21:22,489 --> 02:21:28,340
percent of the total demand I'm not a

3123
02:21:25,489 --> 02:21:29,959
mathematician or a math magician but 20

3124
02:21:28,340 --> 02:21:32,870
if there's a hundred people smoking all

3125
02:21:29,959 --> 02:21:35,779
this weed 22 of them are smoking sixty

3126
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:37,311
seven percent all that weed that's funny

3127
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:38,960
to me there there are some serious

3128
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:40,851
hardcore pockets or are there people

3129
02:21:38,959 --> 02:21:43,729
doing what we call the dispensary flip

3130
02:21:40,851 --> 02:21:45,110
or they go on and get in there outs then

3131
02:21:43,729 --> 02:21:47,299
are they taking it around and doing what

3132
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:48,771
they can do I don't even want to

3133
02:21:47,299 --> 02:21:51,069
encourage or talk about that but a lot

3134
02:21:48,771 --> 02:21:53,271
of that is probably that unfortunately

3135
02:21:51,069 --> 02:21:54,590
the prevalence of heavy users in

3136
02:21:53,271 --> 02:21:57,860
Colorado is higher than the national

3137
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:59,329
average the authors right so it says the

3138
02:21:57,860 --> 02:22:01,101
department feels it is important to

3139
02:21:59,329 --> 02:22:02,601
understand marijuana usage and the

3140
02:22:01,101 --> 02:22:04,370
demand in the state to effectively

3141
02:22:02,601 --> 02:22:06,710
manage production within the regulated

3142
02:22:04,370 --> 02:22:08,660
industry Colorado Department of Revenue

3143
02:22:06,709 --> 02:22:10,759
executive director Barbara Brawl said in

3144
02:22:08,659 --> 02:22:13,521
a statement the marijuana Enforcement

3145
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:15,979
Division said it used survey results

3146
02:22:13,521 --> 02:22:18,200
demographic data research literature and

3147
02:22:15,979 --> 02:22:20,869
Colorado specific specific primary

3148
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:22,811
source data to compile the study I'm

3149
02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:24,891
kind of curious because they don't ah

3150
02:22:22,810 --> 02:22:26,539
they're not supposed to be taking our

3151
02:22:24,890 --> 02:22:28,159
information when we go in we show them

3152
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:30,860
our ID at these right shops but they

3153
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:32,601
don't photo copy your ID they're not

3154
02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:34,340
supposed to be taking any notes on who's

3155
02:22:32,601 --> 02:22:36,650
in there so I'm a little curious where

3156
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:37,819
this data came from I'd like to find out

3157
02:22:36,649 --> 02:22:41,350
more about that if anybody's listening

3158
02:22:37,819 --> 02:22:43,970
that has input on how they got that info

3159
02:22:41,351 --> 02:22:46,909
if you have input on how they got that

3160
02:22:43,970 --> 02:22:48,220
info tweet me message me at hydro

3161
02:22:46,909 --> 02:22:50,539
culture on Twitter

3162
02:22:48,220 --> 02:22:52,640
agriculture on Facebook or I grow

3163
02:22:50,540 --> 02:22:55,820

3164
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:56,989
email me a long stuff I would appreciate

3165
02:22:55,819 --> 02:22:58,699
it so I don't know where they got that

3166
02:22:56,989 --> 02:23:00,949
they're not supposed to be copying our

3167
02:22:58,700 --> 02:23:05,360
data Colorado specific primary source

3168
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:07,431
data anyway among the most significant

3169
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:08,989
conclusions listed in the report few

3170
02:23:07,431 --> 02:23:10,521
people are switching from shopping at

3171
02:23:08,989 --> 02:23:11,750
medical marijuana dispensaries to

3172
02:23:10,521 --> 02:23:13,940
shopping at recreational marijuana

3173
02:23:11,750 --> 02:23:17,899
stores well no [ __ ] it's more expensive

3174
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:19,310
there the study concludes that the study

3175
02:23:17,899 --> 02:23:20,931
concludes that could be because of

3176
02:23:19,310 --> 02:23:23,090
higher taxes for recreational marijuana

3177
02:23:20,931 --> 02:23:25,760
and fewer available outlets discouraging

3178
02:23:23,090 --> 02:23:28,340
switching oh no [ __ ] you charges 25%

3179
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:29,601
extra a Colorado resident is gonna go

3180
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:30,960
and get their car that costs you a

3181
02:23:29,601 --> 02:23:32,970
hundred bucks at one time

3182
02:23:30,959 --> 02:23:34,889
see I get your red card and save all

3183
02:23:32,969 --> 02:23:37,619
that money to save all the money like if

3184
02:23:34,889 --> 02:23:38,909
you shop twice the cost of the doctor

3185
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:39,630
and then every time you go after that is

3186
02:23:38,909 --> 02:23:41,488
just a bonus

3187
02:23:39,629 --> 02:23:43,559
so the retail demand is derived

3188
02:23:41,488 --> 02:23:45,510
primarily from out of state visitors and

3189
02:23:43,559 --> 02:23:47,519
from customers who previously purchased

3190
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:50,130
from the Colorado plaque in gray markets

3191
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:51,899
the study's authors write the trend

3192
02:23:50,129 --> 02:23:53,339
though has major implications for the

3193
02:23:51,898 --> 02:23:55,108
state's marijuana tax revenue

3194
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:57,510
predictions for revenue from the

3195
02:23:55,109 --> 02:24:00,329
recreational marijuana tax once reached

3196
02:23:57,510 --> 02:24:03,029
as high as thirty five million dollars

3197
02:24:00,329 --> 02:24:05,100
for the first six months of 2014

3198
02:24:03,029 --> 02:24:06,930
instead including numbers released

3199
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:09,090
Wednesday form a tax collections the

3200
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:12,059
state has brought in only about fourteen

3201
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:13,799
point seven million so far the summers

3202
02:24:12,059 --> 02:24:16,500
here I bet we're gonna increase that

3203
02:24:13,799 --> 02:24:18,358
number through the summer and April

3204
02:24:16,500 --> 02:24:21,779
probably boosted a month and got them

3205
02:24:18,359 --> 02:24:23,309
all excited because a lot of weed so

3206
02:24:21,779 --> 02:24:25,290
medical marijuana sales meanwhile

3207
02:24:23,309 --> 02:24:27,299
continue to outpace recreational sales

3208
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:29,069
through May medical marijuana

3209
02:24:27,299 --> 02:24:30,840
dispensaries had done nearly a hundred

3210
02:24:29,068 --> 02:24:32,430
and sixty five million dollars of sales

3211
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:35,040
compared with the ninety million dollars

3212
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:36,689
from recreational stores tax revenue

3213
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:38,460
from medical marijuana sales though has

3214
02:24:36,689 --> 02:24:39,238
amounted to slightly less than five

3215
02:24:38,459 --> 02:24:41,309
million

3216
02:24:39,238 --> 02:24:43,469
trading system more people who are using

3217
02:24:41,309 --> 02:24:45,269
cannabis medically can access their

3218
02:24:43,469 --> 02:24:47,459
medicine without paying higher taxes is

3219
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:49,680
not a bad thing said Taylor West a

3220
02:24:47,459 --> 02:24:53,549
spokeswoman for the National cannabis

3221
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:55,500

3222
02:24:53,549 --> 02:24:57,509
Post let me go find another related

3223
02:24:55,500 --> 02:25:00,209
article there's a leak here I think I

3224
02:24:57,510 --> 02:25:03,689
just gotta go back yeah they talked

3225
02:25:00,209 --> 02:25:06,419
about 130 metric tons of pot how heavy

3226
02:25:03,689 --> 02:25:07,920
is that state of Colorado estimates that

3227
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:09,600
its annual demand for marijuana is a

3228
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:11,579
hundred and thirty point three metric

3229
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:14,609
tuan tons about how heavy is a hundred

3230
02:25:11,579 --> 02:25:16,770
and thirty metric tons anyway it's the

3231
02:25:14,609 --> 02:25:19,318
equivalent of two hundred and eighty

3232
02:25:16,770 --> 02:25:21,810
seven thousand two hundred and fifty

3233
02:25:19,318 --> 02:25:22,198
nine pounds as I'm making any more clear

3234
02:25:21,809 --> 02:25:24,750
to you

3235
02:25:22,199 --> 02:25:26,460
me neither that's also such a mammoth

3236
02:25:24,750 --> 02:25:28,139
number that context doesn't come

3237
02:25:26,459 --> 02:25:29,809
naturally but thankfully the cannabis

3238
02:25:28,139 --> 02:25:32,309
crackpot data team is here for you

3239
02:25:29,809 --> 02:25:34,648
Colorado's annual marijuana demand is

3240
02:25:32,309 --> 02:25:36,420
heavier than a space shuttle or a blue

3241
02:25:34,648 --> 02:25:38,670
whale but not quite as heavy as a

3242
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:41,189
locomotive so yes it's a lot of wheat

3243
02:25:38,670 --> 02:25:42,629
how heavy is a hundred and thirty metric

3244
02:25:41,189 --> 02:25:43,790
tons they've given us a little graph

3245
02:25:42,629 --> 02:25:47,569
here

3246
02:25:43,790 --> 02:25:51,101
a hippopotamus weighs about 3,300 pounds

3247
02:25:47,569 --> 02:25:55,489
with that big ugly Mustang dia sculpture

3248
02:25:51,101 --> 02:25:59,060
that weighs 9,000 pounds a school bus

3249
02:25:55,489 --> 02:26:02,360
weighs 25,000 pounds bulldozer weighs

3250
02:25:59,060 --> 02:26:04,310
7,000 pounds of b-2 bomber is a hundred

3251
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:07,250
and eighty-five thousand pounds of blue

3252
02:26:04,310 --> 02:26:11,299
whale is two hundred and fifty thousand

3253
02:26:07,250 --> 02:26:14,060
pounds annual estimated Colorado

3254
02:26:11,299 --> 02:26:16,219
Marijuana demand two hundred and eighty

3255

seven thousand two hundred and fifty

3256
02:26:16,219 --> 02:26:23,239

like this

3282
02:27:12,829 --> 02:27:17,239
Thomas Beckley and John evic I'm

3283
02:27:15,229 --> 02:27:18,859
guessing on that we're on cloud nine

3284
02:27:17,239 --> 02:27:21,351
when we spoke with them on the morning

3285
02:27:18,860 --> 02:27:23,150
of July 8th an unbelievably bustling

3286
02:27:21,351 --> 02:27:26,690
cloud nine with electricity in the air

3287
02:27:23,149 --> 02:27:28,459
and cash in the registers we've had

3288
02:27:26,690 --> 02:27:30,290
about 400 people in four hours said

3289
02:27:28,459 --> 02:27:32,509
Beckley and odor at top-shelf cannabis

3290
02:27:30,290 --> 02:27:35,061
in Bellingham Washington we opened it

3291
02:27:32,510 --> 02:27:36,739
exactly through the news we saw that we

3292
02:27:35,060 --> 02:27:38,601
were the first shop to open in the state

3293
02:27:36,739 --> 02:27:42,469
of Washington congratulations guys

3294
02:27:38,601 --> 02:27:44,510
Friday you pretty stoked said the owner

3295
02:27:42,469 --> 02:27:45,890
of top shelf I'm not gonna murder your

3296
02:27:44,510 --> 02:27:48,290
name again I apologize for doing that

3297
02:27:45,890 --> 02:27:50,149
I'm not good with these names this is so

3298
02:27:48,290 --> 02:27:52,790
new and we're lucky just to get open and

3299
02:27:50,149 --> 02:27:54,469
that was a huge task right now traffic

3300
02:27:52,790 --> 02:27:56,960
is flowing smoothly and we're thankful

3301
02:27:54,469 --> 02:27:58,670
for that top shelf served around a

3302
02:27:56,959 --> 02:28:00,979
thousand grams of legal retail marijuana

3303
02:27:58,670 --> 02:28:03,229
to more than 400 customers in the first

3304
02:28:00,979 --> 02:28:05,239
four hours of business on July 8th

3305
02:28:03,229 --> 02:28:07,670
Beckley said after referencing his

3306
02:28:05,239 --> 02:28:11,090
in-house tracking system since the shops

3307
02:28:07,670 --> 02:28:13,069
median per gram price is $12.50 that

3308
02:28:11,090 --> 02:28:15,950
makes for roughly twelve thousand five

3309
02:28:13,069 --> 02:28:18,319
hundred dollars in sales for those four

3310
02:28:15,950 --> 02:28:25,010
hours or about three thousand dollars

3311
02:28:18,319 --> 02:28:27,199
per hour the line right now has dwindled

3312
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:28,880
down a little bit Beckley said tonight

3313
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:31,070
when everybody's off work I think will

3314
02:28:28,879 --> 02:28:32,629
be twice as much as it was earlier the

3315
02:28:31,069 --> 02:28:34,190
top shelf owners made international news

3316
02:28:32,629 --> 02:28:36,350
earlier this week when they talked

3317
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:37,730
publicly about using about possibly

3318
02:28:36,351 --> 02:28:39,500
using one of their crab boats are

3319
02:28:37,729 --> 02:28:41,180
renting a helicopter to transport their

3320
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:43,670
marijuana stock from Bremerton to

3321
02:28:41,181 --> 02:28:45,230
Bellingham to expedite the process of

3322
02:28:43,670 --> 02:28:47,899
finally opening their doors for their

3323
02:28:45,229 --> 02:28:50,539
first legal retail sale that grant an

3324
02:28:47,899 --> 02:28:52,129
elaborate plan didn't work out not using

3325
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:53,660
it because we ran into some aviation

3326
02:28:52,129 --> 02:28:55,000
rules and we couldn't go on the water

3327
02:28:53,659 --> 02:28:57,469
because of the Coast Guard

3328
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:59,060
Beckley said the FAA and the Coast Guard

3329
02:28:57,469 --> 02:29:00,649
told us they wouldn't recommend trying

3330
02:28:59,060 --> 02:29:02,779
it oh I bet these guys would have gotten

3331
02:29:00,649 --> 02:29:04,579
their whole stock taken from them that

3332
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:05,960
would have been shitty out of it funny

3333
02:29:04,579 --> 02:29:08,569
and shitty at the same time it would've

3334
02:29:05,959 --> 02:29:09,619
been like a movie so anyway one of the

3335
02:29:08,569 --> 02:29:12,199
owners I can't say his name properly

3336
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:14,510
evic iva CH attributed their smooth

3337
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:16,159
launch on July 8th to a couple factors

3338
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:18,050
including his request for a smaller

3339
02:29:16,159 --> 02:29:19,760
manifest for their weed delivery which

3340
02:29:18,049 --> 02:29:21,709
allowed them to count 50 something bags

3341
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:24,860
of marijuana before starting sales

3342
02:29:21,709 --> 02:29:27,469
instead of counting 2,200 bags the shops

3343
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:28,748
bio track THC plan of sale equipment and

3344
02:29:27,469 --> 02:29:30,639
software

3345
02:29:28,748 --> 02:29:32,680
even given all the excitement Tuesday

3346
02:29:30,639 --> 02:29:34,358
morning top-shelf cannabis actually

3347
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:36,880
opened its doors a few minutes after 8

3348
02:29:34,359 --> 02:29:38,828
a.m. our door opened at 8:03 a.m. he

3349
02:29:36,879 --> 02:29:40,748
said because complying and working with

3350
02:29:38,828 --> 02:29:43,328
the state is the number one priority

3351
02:29:40,748 --> 02:29:45,340
even over customer service which yeah

3352
02:29:43,328 --> 02:29:48,100
that's got to be the truth so they have

3353
02:29:45,340 --> 02:29:49,059
their Washington stores are open so

3354
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:51,609
anybody

3355
02:29:49,059 --> 02:29:53,559
I think 21 and over can go buy cannabis

3356
02:29:51,609 --> 02:29:56,170
there I was looking at a few other

3357
02:29:53,559 --> 02:29:58,840
articles the price per gram there you're

3358
02:29:56,170 --> 02:30:00,279
looking at paying between 15 and 25

3359
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:02,049
dollars a gram just depending on what

3360
02:30:00,279 --> 02:30:05,078
strain and what shop some of the top

3361
02:30:02,049 --> 02:30:06,488
shelf stuff it seems like the trend well

3362
02:30:05,078 --> 02:30:08,559
is that a lot of these shops were

3363
02:30:06,488 --> 02:30:11,350
selling two gram packages so you're

3364
02:30:08,559 --> 02:30:12,818
getting two grams of the same strain and

3365
02:30:11,350 --> 02:30:15,760
it was already sealed he didn't get to

3366
02:30:12,818 --> 02:30:17,350
look at it there's got a jar on the

3367
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:18,728
Shelf there like they've got there

3368
02:30:17,350 --> 02:30:19,988
several jars I'm just gonna make up

3369
02:30:18,728 --> 02:30:21,849
names it got headband they got Sour

3370
02:30:19,988 --> 02:30:23,379
Diesel they got Bubba cush on the in

3371
02:30:21,850 --> 02:30:25,059
jars they probably had six or seven

3372
02:30:23,379 --> 02:30:26,259
eight or ten strains lined up in jars

3373
02:30:25,059 --> 02:30:28,059
you can look at those and you're like I

3374
02:30:26,260 --> 02:30:30,039
want the Sour Diesel and they give you a

3375
02:30:28,059 --> 02:30:32,828
pre weighed bag of Sour Diesel that was

3376
02:30:30,039 --> 02:30:36,489
2 grams and it was costing about $45

3377
02:30:32,828 --> 02:30:37,930
plus tax about 40 plus tax in a lot of

3378
02:30:36,488 --> 02:30:40,629
places it just depends on where he went

3379
02:30:37,930 --> 02:30:43,449
and what strain you were looking for I'm

3380
02:30:40,629 --> 02:30:45,578
looking for more information on yeah

3381
02:30:43,449 --> 02:30:47,590
pre-tax was twenty nine dollars and

3382
02:30:45,578 --> 02:30:49,299
ninety two cents post tax was forty

3383
02:30:47,590 --> 02:30:51,760
dollars and that was the price for two

3384
02:30:49,299 --> 02:30:53,708
grams of a strain called sweet Lafayette

3385
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:58,539
but I scroll down there are pictures of

3386
02:30:53,709 --> 02:31:01,180
some people's tweets $13 a dram at this

3387
02:30:58,539 --> 02:31:05,079
spa twenty five to twenty seven dollars

3388
02:31:01,180 --> 02:31:06,520
for two grams at this place here's what

3389
02:31:05,078 --> 02:31:09,398
one of the first customers bought a two

3390
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:11,109
gram package cost them forty dollars

3391
02:31:09,398 --> 02:31:14,948
plus tax they don't have a picture of

3392
02:31:11,109 --> 02:31:16,658
the receipt on here with taxes it looks

3393
02:31:14,949 --> 02:31:19,180
like two grand bags are coming to fifty

3394
02:31:16,658 --> 02:31:21,488
four dollars so that's a little bit

3395
02:31:19,180 --> 02:31:23,590
pricey hopefully it'll come down but you

3396
02:31:21,488 --> 02:31:25,059
know there's nothing encouraging them to

3397
02:31:23,590 --> 02:31:27,068
lower their prices they're selling

3398
02:31:25,059 --> 02:31:28,299
plenty of weed already so it's probably

3399
02:31:27,068 --> 02:31:30,398
gonna stay like that for a little while

3400
02:31:28,299 --> 02:31:32,498
so I've got a couple more stories coming

3401
02:31:30,398 --> 02:31:34,629
from Washington since they just launched

3402
02:31:32,498 --> 02:31:35,318
their shops this one's kind of

3403
02:31:34,629 --> 02:31:37,538
entertaining

3404
02:31:35,318 --> 02:31:38,889
it says Seattle's City Attorney bought

3405
02:31:37,539 --> 02:31:40,520
weed for his enjoyment

3406
02:31:38,889 --> 02:31:42,318
Denver's did not

3407
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:44,149
when Seattle's lawn recreational pot

3408
02:31:42,318 --> 02:31:46,728
shop cannabis City opened its doors on

3409
02:31:44,148 --> 02:31:48,708
July 8 seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes

3410
02:31:46,728 --> 02:31:50,148
was fourth in line and no not the Pete

3411
02:31:48,709 --> 02:31:51,799
hauled you're thinking this is not the

3412
02:31:50,148 --> 02:31:55,219
comedian not the guy with the big funny

3413
02:31:51,799 --> 02:31:57,199
teeth that had the TV show not him yes

3414
02:31:55,219 --> 02:31:59,418
he bought some marijuana for posterity

3415
02:31:57,199 --> 02:32:02,720
but he also bought some for personal

3416
02:31:59,418 --> 02:32:04,369
enjoyment pretty bold homes that's funny

3417
02:32:02,719 --> 02:32:06,798
because this guy just wrote the phrase

3418
02:32:04,369 --> 02:32:08,930
pretty bold homes and it sounds like

3419
02:32:06,799 --> 02:32:12,199
he's being a gangster pretty bold homes

3420
02:32:08,930 --> 02:32:14,748
anyway most important takeaway here is

3421
02:32:12,199 --> 02:32:16,189
that today marijuana sales became legal

3422
02:32:14,748 --> 02:32:18,259
and I'm here to personally exercise

3423
02:32:16,189 --> 02:32:19,488
myself this new freed up holds told

3424
02:32:18,259 --> 02:32:22,039
media on Tuesday

3425
02:32:19,488 --> 02:32:23,809
I bought two two grand bags of OG pearl

3426
02:32:22,039 --> 02:32:25,668
which was recommended I'm keeping one

3427
02:32:23,809 --> 02:32:27,109
bag for posterity and one bag for

3428
02:32:25,668 --> 02:32:28,369
personal enjoyment at some point when

3429
02:32:27,109 --> 02:32:30,168
it's appropriate so this dude just

3430
02:32:28,369 --> 02:32:31,009
admitted he's gonna puff down two grams

3431
02:32:30,168 --> 02:32:32,658
that's pretty nice

3432
02:32:31,009 --> 02:32:35,270
hopefully he shares with a good friend

3433
02:32:32,658 --> 02:32:37,279
they have a good laugh customer vivian

3434
02:32:35,270 --> 02:32:39,680
McPeak who happens to be the executive

3435
02:32:37,279 --> 02:32:42,680
director of seattle Hempfest said he was

3436
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:45,318
proud of his city attorney I've been

3437
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:47,838
terribly proud of our city attorney I'm

3438
02:32:45,318 --> 02:32:49,668
inherently proud r/c attorney has played

3439
02:32:47,838 --> 02:32:51,529
a groundbreaking role in making this

3440
02:32:49,668 --> 02:32:54,109
happen the shift in public policy

3441
02:32:51,529 --> 02:32:56,060
McPeake told a reporter he's backing up

3442
02:32:54,109 --> 02:32:58,189
his words and is going to take some big

3443
02:32:56,059 --> 02:33:01,398
nice long deep talks at home I think

3444
02:32:58,189 --> 02:33:03,318
it's all right Holmes bold move got us

3445
02:33:01,398 --> 02:33:05,238
wondering did Denver city attorney Scott

3446
02:33:03,318 --> 02:33:07,100
Martinez buy any marijuana for personal

3447
02:33:05,238 --> 02:33:10,009
or professional reasons On January 1st

3448
02:33:07,100 --> 02:33:12,350
if I bought any no I have not bought any

3449
02:33:10,009 --> 02:33:15,139
on January 1st or since then Martinez

3450
02:33:12,350 --> 02:33:16,430
told the cannabis on July 8th oh by the

3451
02:33:15,139 --> 02:33:18,198
way I didn't mention this article comes

3452
02:33:16,430 --> 02:33:20,029
once again from the cannabis thank you

3453
02:33:18,199 --> 02:33:21,498
but I do know Pete there city attorney

3454
02:33:20,029 --> 02:33:23,629
has elected and he campaigned on the

3455
02:33:21,498 --> 02:33:25,279
issue Martinez his point is

3456
02:33:23,629 --> 02:33:27,319
straightforward well he was appointed

3457
02:33:25,279 --> 02:33:29,390
city attorney by Denver Mayor Michael

3458
02:33:27,318 --> 02:33:31,850
Hancock Holmes was elected by the people

3459
02:33:29,389 --> 02:33:33,769
of Seattle as an elected official he

3460
02:33:31,850 --> 02:33:35,418
certainly has it different well he's an

3461
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:38,060
elected official so I wouldn't comment

3462
02:33:35,418 --> 02:33:39,798
on what his path is Martinez said but we

3463
02:33:38,059 --> 02:33:42,198
both have an obligation to uphold the

3464
02:33:39,799 --> 02:33:44,299
law and I know what an important job it

3465
02:33:42,199 --> 02:33:46,520
is and wishing him the best as he goes

3466
02:33:44,299 --> 02:33:48,890
forward in this new time for Seattle and

3467
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:50,509
Washington Martinez said Holmes had

3468
02:33:48,889 --> 02:33:52,158
visited Colorado and has seen legal

3469
02:33:50,509 --> 02:33:53,319
recreational marijuana industry in

3470
02:33:52,158 --> 02:33:55,359
action previous

3471
02:33:53,319 --> 02:33:57,459
Washington's opening day of retail sales

3472
02:33:55,360 --> 02:33:58,840
on July 8th we certainly share

3473
02:33:57,459 --> 02:34:00,819
information because it's important to

3474
02:33:58,840 --> 02:34:02,890
share best practices especially as we're

3475
02:34:00,819 --> 02:34:04,690
on the forefront of a unique legal issue

3476
02:34:02,890 --> 02:34:07,000
Martinez said he's a smart guy

3477
02:34:04,690 --> 02:34:08,890
well-educated he's got a big job ahead

3478
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:13,420
of him we're going to continue that

3479
02:34:08,890 --> 02:34:14,890
sharing of information so the city

3480
02:34:13,420 --> 02:34:18,670
attorney bought some pot right and then

3481
02:34:14,890 --> 02:34:22,029
I got a scroll back because right after

3482
02:34:18,670 --> 02:34:25,629
that there was another article that came

3483
02:34:22,030 --> 02:34:27,909
out and the headline is and I'm sorry

3484
02:34:25,629 --> 02:34:29,859
I'm going slower my internet is slow

3485
02:34:27,909 --> 02:34:31,780
right here right now it says no pot

3486
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:34,920
allowed at the office Seattle City

3487
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:36,851
Attorney cops - breaking the rules so

3488
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:38,920
Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes

3489
02:34:36,851 --> 02:34:40,870
admitted he broke a drug-free workplace

3490
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:42,579
rule and he brought marijuana on the

3491
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:43,840
first date when he bought marijuana on

3492
02:34:42,579 --> 02:34:46,030
the first day of legal sales in

3493
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:47,710
Washington state all just been a big

3494
02:34:46,030 --> 02:34:49,120
supporter of the legal marijuana wand he

3495
02:34:47,709 --> 02:34:50,949
says he wanted to be one of the first

3496
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:52,301
customers in Seattle's cannabis City on

3497
02:34:50,950 --> 02:34:55,301
Tuesday to honor what he called a

3498
02:34:52,300 --> 02:34:57,129
tectonic shift in policy he says he then

3499
02:34:55,300 --> 02:34:59,199
bought the to honor he brought the two

3500
02:34:57,129 --> 02:35:01,899
unopened packages back to City Hall

3501
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:03,521
before taking them home the next day the

3502
02:35:01,899 --> 02:35:05,289
city's personnel Department issued a

3503
02:35:03,521 --> 02:35:06,909
memo reminding employees it can't have

3504
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:08,761
marijuana that are on if when they're on

3505
02:35:06,909 --> 02:35:11,319
official business or at city offices

3506
02:35:08,761 --> 02:35:13,030
holds issued an apology Friday and City

3507
02:35:11,319 --> 02:35:14,619
volunteered to donate three thousand

3508
02:35:13,030 --> 02:35:16,480
dollars to the downtown emergency

3509
02:35:14,620 --> 02:35:19,240

3514

02:35:31,870 --> 02:35:37,210
cannabis City and he's got a big grin on

3517
02:35:34,629 --> 02:35:40,089
his face looking at the weed like huh

3518

for ten to fifteen days

3554
02:37:04,590 --> 02:37:09,040
Washington home to amazon.com Microsoft

and Starbucks became the second state

3556
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:12,311
after Colorado to prevent the sale of

3557
02:37:10,690 --> 02:37:14,319
marijuana for recreational use

3558
02:37:12,310 --> 02:37:16,539
voters in both states approved the

3559
02:37:14,319 --> 02:37:19,750
ballot initiatives in 2012 Colorado

3560
02:37:16,540 --> 02:37:21,790
retailers began sales in January this

3561
02:37:19,750 --> 02:37:23,530
guy said growers didn't receive licenses

3562
02:37:21,790 --> 02:37:25,391
in time to produce enough marijuana for

3563
02:37:23,530 --> 02:37:26,950
the stores opening this week the plants

3564
02:37:25,390 --> 02:37:29,770
take three to four months to mature he

3565
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:31,690
said Washington issued 90 licenses to

3566
02:37:29,771 --> 02:37:33,221
pot growers and processors as of last

3567
02:37:31,690 --> 02:37:35,200
week according to Brian Smith a

3568
02:37:33,220 --> 02:37:37,270
spokesman for the Washington State

3569
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:39,960
Liquor Control Board an agency charged

3570
02:37:37,271 --> 02:37:42,370
with regulatory regulating the industry

3571
02:37:39,959 --> 02:37:44,079
so they didn't get their gross sent up

3572
02:37:42,370 --> 02:37:46,471
in time and they had to open up and

3573
02:37:44,079 --> 02:37:51,851
guess what not enough reefer

3574
02:37:46,470 --> 02:37:55,930
welcome to the pot world with 11 pounds

3575
02:37:51,851 --> 02:37:58,060
that's not that small talk like any

3576
02:37:55,931 --> 02:38:02,500
hustler should move through 11 pounds in

3577
02:37:58,060 --> 02:38:03,909
a week what he doing okay so they're

3578
02:38:02,500 --> 02:38:05,440
sold out of weed at some places and

3579
02:38:03,909 --> 02:38:08,021
they're saying right here that 2 grams

3580
02:38:05,440 --> 02:38:10,470
is going for forty six dollars and 77

3581
02:38:08,021 --> 02:38:12,600
cents that's a little pricey

3582
02:38:10,469 --> 02:38:14,818
all right I've got one more little piece

3583
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:17,130
of news that comes from Washington they

3584
02:38:14,818 --> 02:38:19,139
put out a press release thing there was

3585
02:38:17,129 --> 02:38:21,539
a whole bunch of answers to Washington

3586
02:38:19,139 --> 02:38:23,129
weed sale six questions answered there's

3587
02:38:21,540 --> 02:38:25,680
one question that I found interesting

3588
02:38:23,129 --> 02:38:26,818
that I could share with you guys it says

3589
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:28,500
how much can I buy and this is

3590
02:38:26,818 --> 02:38:30,750
Washington keep that in mind because the

3591
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:33,478
laws are different Colorado I found this

3592
02:38:30,750 --> 02:38:35,309
interesting because in Colorado they

3593
02:38:33,478 --> 02:38:36,420
forgot to write this law and so now

3594
02:38:35,309 --> 02:38:39,898
they're trying to figure this out now

3595
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:41,340
and in Washington they've put it in

3596
02:38:39,898 --> 02:38:43,738
there correctly at the beginning so it

3597
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:45,329
says how much can i buy state law allows

3598
02:38:43,738 --> 02:38:48,750
the sale of up to an ounce of dried

3599
02:38:45,329 --> 02:38:52,228
marijuana 16 ounces of pot infused

3600
02:38:48,750 --> 02:38:54,238
solids 72 ounces of pot infused liquids

3601
02:38:52,228 --> 02:38:56,369
which would be teachers or solves I

3602
02:38:54,238 --> 02:38:57,898
would assume SABS whatever you want to

3603
02:38:56,370 --> 02:39:00,359
call that that liquid [ __ ] you rub in

3604
02:38:57,898 --> 02:39:01,889
that I don't I don't like it it doesn't

3605
02:39:00,359 --> 02:39:04,050
do much for me but 7 grams of

3606
02:39:01,889 --> 02:39:05,849
concentrated marijuana like hashish 2

3607
02:39:04,049 --> 02:39:08,099
adults over 21 whether you're a

3608
02:39:05,850 --> 02:39:10,079
Washington resident or not but there

3609
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:11,909
isn't expected to be any infused food or

3610
02:39:10,079 --> 02:39:13,620
drink available right away as of last

3611
02:39:11,909 --> 02:39:15,869
week the Liquor Control Board had not

3612
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:18,300
issued any licenses to processors for

3613
02:39:15,870 --> 02:39:20,160
those products or approved any edibles

3614
02:39:18,299 --> 02:39:23,009
for sale some stores are talking about

3615
02:39:20,159 --> 02:39:25,920
limiting customers to 1/2 gram package

3616
02:39:23,010 --> 02:39:26,430
each to make sure there's enough for

3617
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:28,079
everyone

3618
02:39:26,430 --> 02:39:32,488
to buy some which appears to be what

3619
02:39:28,079 --> 02:39:33,809
happened on the first day of sales a lot

3620
02:39:32,488 --> 02:39:36,359

3621

3623
02:39:38,750 --> 02:39:43,318

two weeks I stopped feeding it to my

3682
02:41:41,478 --> 02:41:44,538
flowering plants about week four cuz I

3683
02:41:43,189 --> 02:41:47,119
feel like they've gotten enough by then

3684
02:41:44,539 --> 02:41:50,899
but all the way up to week four

3685
02:41:47,119 --> 02:41:52,939

3696
02:42:10,039 --> 02:42:14,869
computer somebody typed it I promise you

3697
02:42:11,869 --> 02:42:16,850
it exists who remembers the episode

3698
02:42:14,869 --> 02:42:19,550
where we gave thanks to mr. Marc Emery

3699
02:42:16,850 --> 02:42:21,770
bara Camry is guy who was in federal

3700
02:42:19,549 --> 02:42:23,509
prison in America and he actually did

3701
02:42:21,770 --> 02:42:25,220
not commit any crime in my opinion he

3702
02:42:23,510 --> 02:42:28,148
was a Canadian guy he was shipping seeds

3703
02:42:25,219 --> 02:42:30,010
across the world and

3704
02:42:28,148 --> 02:42:32,019
the Canadian authorities and the

3705
02:42:30,010 --> 02:42:33,819
American authorities United and they

3706
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:36,780
extradited him to America and they put

3707
02:42:33,819 --> 02:42:39,520
his ass in prison he actually served

3708
02:42:36,780 --> 02:42:42,100
let's see one thousand five hundred and

3709
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:44,859
ninety days which guess what that means

3710
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:49,180
he was officially his sins ended July

3711
02:42:44,859 --> 02:42:51,010
ninth he's not home yet there's a bunch

3712
02:42:49,180 --> 02:42:53,109
of crap you gotta go through once you

3713
02:42:51,010 --> 02:42:55,600
get out of prison and you're not a US

3714
02:42:53,109 --> 02:42:57,430
citizen so I'm gonna read something this

3715
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:59,020
is from a Marc Emery's blog this

3716
02:42:57,430 --> 02:43:02,109
actually comes from cannabis culture

3717
02:42:59,020 --> 02:43:03,220
calm a lot of it is written by his wife

3718
02:43:02,109 --> 02:43:05,050
Jodi I've been paying a lot of attention

3719
02:43:03,219 --> 02:43:06,909
to what's going on with Marc through his

3720
02:43:05,049 --> 02:43:08,319
Twitter his wife Jodi updates the

3721
02:43:06,909 --> 02:43:09,879
Twitter for him quite often and he was

3722
02:43:08,319 --> 02:43:12,069
actually a lot of internet access in the

3723
02:43:09,879 --> 02:43:15,789
prison he was in so I'll quit rambling

3724
02:43:12,069 --> 02:43:17,978
and here is by Marc Emery written Monday

3725
02:43:15,790 --> 02:43:20,229
June 30 is with a few updates from Jodi

3726
02:43:17,978 --> 02:43:22,389
Emory's spattered in there I'll let you

3727
02:43:20,228 --> 02:43:24,219
know when those happen so this says this

3728
02:43:22,389 --> 02:43:26,949
is my last blog from the terminals of

3729
02:43:24,219 --> 02:43:30,219
the US Bureau of Prisons my sentence was

3730
02:43:26,950 --> 02:43:33,250
four five years which would be 1825 days

3731
02:43:30,219 --> 02:43:35,889
and I earned all 235 days on my eligible

3732
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:37,659
good content conduct credit so my sense

3733
02:43:35,889 --> 02:43:39,039
officially ends at one thousand five

3734
02:43:37,659 --> 02:43:42,700
hundred and ninety days which is

3735
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:44,470
Wednesday July 9th on Thursday July 10th

3736
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:47,439
the u.s. immigration picks me up and

3737
02:43:44,469 --> 02:43:50,829
takes me to the private for-profit geo

code is seven one three seven five I

3782
02:45:44,828 --> 02:45:50,609
will try to remember to tweet that I'm

3783
02:45:47,559 --> 02:45:50,609
writing a note to tweet that

3784
02:45:52,670 --> 02:45:56,250
all right sorry that took second to

3785
02:45:54,659 --> 02:45:57,450
write the note so you can send letters

3786
02:45:56,250 --> 02:45:58,709
have encouraged me you can send him all

3787
02:45:57,450 --> 02:46:00,659
kinds of letters don't send him anything

3788
02:45:58,709 --> 02:46:02,669
[ __ ] stupid it's a prison come on

3789
02:46:00,659 --> 02:46:04,170
be smart please but you can send him

3790
02:46:02,670 --> 02:46:07,649
letters so you can send him mom

3791
02:46:04,170 --> 02:46:09,931
like anything he might want to read hope

3792
02:46:07,649 --> 02:46:12,600
I'm not passed the time so mark

3793
02:46:09,931 --> 02:46:14,101
continues and he says my understanding

3794
02:46:12,601 --> 02:46:15,870
is that I'll be dropped off ultimately

3795
02:46:14,101 --> 02:46:17,610
at the border in Windsor Ontario I'm

3796
02:46:15,870 --> 02:46:20,341
thinking sometime between August 10th

3797
02:46:17,610 --> 02:46:22,170
and August 25th that's a month after his

3798
02:46:20,341 --> 02:46:24,420
release date but we have no way of

3799
02:46:22,170 --> 02:46:25,290
knowing for sure you'd think that you

3800
02:46:24,420 --> 02:46:27,390
think that would be a straightforward

3801
02:46:25,290 --> 02:46:29,490
process taking a few days at most but

3802
02:46:27,390 --> 02:46:31,739
LaSalle is a for-profit G EO group

3803
02:46:29,489 --> 02:46:33,630
Detention Center and thus they're making

3804
02:46:31,739 --> 02:46:36,119
money for every day I am there and

3805
02:46:33,630 --> 02:46:37,709
because the Canadian government is

3806
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:39,450
involved these bureaucrats have a

3807
02:46:37,709 --> 02:46:40,979
tendency to be slower than they ought to

3808
02:46:39,450 --> 02:46:42,990
be so I may need your help in providing

3809
02:46:40,979 --> 02:46:45,420
motivation for them to repatriate me

3810
02:46:42,989 --> 02:46:47,851
back to Canada on a more reasonable and

3811
02:46:45,420 --> 02:46:51,450
timely schedule the former Canadian

3812
02:46:47,851 --> 02:46:53,040
Conrad Conrad black got out of Coleman

3813
02:46:51,450 --> 02:46:55,409
federal prison in Florida last year he

3814
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:57,780
was given he was driven straight forward

3815
02:46:55,409 --> 02:47:00,619
to Miami and able to go immediately to

3816
02:46:57,780 --> 02:47:03,480
Toronto on a flight with his wife

3817
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:06,091
Barbara me oh that was extraordinarily

3818
02:47:03,479 --> 02:47:07,800
not the least of which because Conrad

3819
02:47:06,091 --> 02:47:09,931
black is not even a Canadian citizen

3820
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:11,909
anymore it has never happened to any

3821
02:47:09,931 --> 02:47:13,140
other Canadian in the US prison no doubt

3822
02:47:11,909 --> 02:47:16,021
his friendship with former Prime

3823
02:47:13,140 --> 02:47:17,609
Minister Brian Mulroney and others got

3824
02:47:16,021 --> 02:47:19,561
him an instant express immigration

3825
02:47:17,610 --> 02:47:21,210
approval back to Canada but it shows a

3826
02:47:19,560 --> 02:47:23,459
clear unfairness that a man who

3827
02:47:21,209 --> 02:47:25,260
renounced his Canadian citizenship so he

3828
02:47:23,459 --> 02:47:27,569
could be lured in the British House of

3829
02:47:25,261 --> 02:47:29,909
Commons gets treatment far beyond what

3830
02:47:27,569 --> 02:47:32,369
any actual Canadian citizen like myself

3831
02:47:29,909 --> 02:47:33,869
currently receives from the Canadian

3832
02:47:32,370 --> 02:47:35,820
government I say like myself that's what

3833
02:47:33,870 --> 02:47:38,040
Mark wrote I am NOT Canadian I'm an

3834
02:47:35,819 --> 02:47:41,069
American I'm from California but from

3835
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:43,710
Colorado now I get no connections in the

3836
02:47:41,069 --> 02:47:46,351
high places long drawn-out delayed route

3837
02:47:43,709 --> 02:47:49,560
to it unceremonious drop-off in Windsor

3838
02:47:46,351 --> 02:47:51,960
Ontario at that not even to my home in

3839
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:54,119
Vancouver sorry mark right strangely in

3840
02:47:51,959 --> 02:47:55,560
long sentences and I'm hi know cuz she

3841
02:47:54,120 --> 02:47:57,570
flied for me back to the airport of my

3842
02:47:55,560 --> 02:47:59,369
choice alongside my wife like Conrad my

3843
02:47:57,569 --> 02:48:01,319
point being if they could get non

3844
02:47:59,370 --> 02:48:03,030
Canadian Conrad's paperwork ready in

3845
02:48:01,319 --> 02:48:05,520
advance to get to Toronto immediately

3846
02:48:03,030 --> 02:48:06,360
upon his US federal prison release they

3847
02:48:05,521 --> 02:48:08,790
could have mine ready

3848
02:48:06,360 --> 02:48:09,690
- last I checked I am still a Canadian

3849
02:48:08,790 --> 02:48:12,841
citizen

3850
02:48:09,690 --> 02:48:14,761
so then Jody updated she says July 11th

3851
02:48:12,841 --> 02:48:16,530
update the following information is not

3852
02:48:14,761 --> 02:48:18,690
completely accurate because mark is not

3853
02:48:16,530 --> 02:48:20,341
Atlas L he is at chances Parish

3854
02:48:18,690 --> 02:48:21,511
Detention Facility stay tuned for

3855
02:48:20,341 --> 02:48:24,000
updates as they come

3856
02:48:21,511 --> 02:48:25,560
then mark continues at any rate once I

3857
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,239
arrived in LaSalle I will be given an

3858
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:28,979
alien number and Jody will update this

3859
02:48:27,239 --> 02:48:32,360
blog to indicate well my eight number is

3860
02:48:28,979 --> 02:48:34,229
but you see my a number in this blog

3861
02:48:32,360 --> 02:48:36,450
I've been told that you can actually

3862
02:48:34,229 --> 02:48:37,949
send me messages over the phone or by

3863
02:48:36,450 --> 02:48:39,420
calling a phone number which doesn't is

3864
02:48:37,950 --> 02:48:41,940
no good anymore some won't even bother

3865
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:43,470
reading it the receptionist will deliver

3866
02:48:41,940 --> 02:48:45,870
messages okay gonna skip all this

3867
02:48:43,470 --> 02:48:47,600
because Isis by phone cards and I can

3868
02:48:45,870 --> 02:48:51,301
call out without limits on phone time

3869
02:48:47,601 --> 02:48:54,630
it's not quite a prison okay but he's

3870
02:48:51,300 --> 02:48:56,279
not there anymore he says done with my

3871
02:48:54,629 --> 02:48:57,449
official u.s. sins but I still can't

3872
02:48:56,280 --> 02:49:00,391
leave until they take me so it's

3873
02:48:57,450 --> 02:49:02,460
purgatory of sorts I get my a number I'm

3874
02:49:00,390 --> 02:49:03,959
also assigned by deportation officer I

3875
02:49:02,459 --> 02:49:06,989
will fill out my temporary passport

3876
02:49:03,959 --> 02:49:08,819
information I have my photo taken I'll

3877
02:49:06,989 --> 02:49:11,399
fill out my forms and my deportation

3878
02:49:08,819 --> 02:49:13,319
officer fills in his bar and afterwards

3879
02:49:11,399 --> 02:49:16,319
it's on to the Canadian Consul in Dallas

3880
02:49:13,319 --> 02:49:18,239
Texas a fellow by the name of - a fellow

3881
02:49:16,319 --> 02:49:19,890
by the name of David Martinez once I am

3882
02:49:18,239 --> 02:49:22,199
at LaSalle Jody will post that phone

3883
02:49:19,890 --> 02:49:24,390
number here which she can't do because

3884
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:26,221
he of course didn't make it there all

3885
02:49:24,390 --> 02:49:27,899
the communication between LaSalle and

3886
02:49:26,220 --> 02:49:30,209
the Canadian Consul in Dallas who

3887
02:49:27,899 --> 02:49:32,069
liaisons to his boss and Ottawa is done

3888
02:49:30,209 --> 02:49:33,989
electronically so that ought to be done

3889
02:49:32,069 --> 02:49:37,170
quickly that is within days but I'm

3890
02:49:33,989 --> 02:49:38,909
certain that precipitous actors in

3891
02:49:37,170 --> 02:49:40,979
Ottawa could choose to be deliberately

3892
02:49:38,909 --> 02:49:42,690
slow lazy or obstructive simply because

3893
02:49:40,979 --> 02:49:44,399
it's me and the Harper government is

3894
02:49:42,690 --> 02:49:46,351
hardly eager to have me back in Canada

3895
02:49:44,399 --> 02:49:48,239
that is where many supporters can

3896
02:49:46,351 --> 02:49:52,409
influence events should this procedure

3897
02:49:48,239 --> 02:49:54,181
get unduly tardy they need all of you to

3898
02:49:52,409 --> 02:49:55,890
call one of those three locations or all

3899
02:49:54,181 --> 02:49:56,670
three locations for several several

3900
02:49:55,890 --> 02:49:59,489
hours a day

3901
02:49:56,670 --> 02:50:01,200
urging an end to any questionable delays

3902
02:49:59,489 --> 02:50:02,789
if they should happen but we will see

3903
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:04,920
just be ready to help if you are so

3904
02:50:02,790 --> 02:50:06,841
inclined what's the government paperwork

3905
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:08,341
is completed and my temporary passport

3906
02:50:06,841 --> 02:50:10,860
is done the hi NS people at LaSalle

3907
02:50:08,341 --> 02:50:13,620
merely need to book my flight then take

3908
02:50:10,860 --> 02:50:15,630
me to Alexandria Louisiana and fly me to

3909
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:17,840
Detroit Michigan and escort me over the

3910
02:50:15,629 --> 02:50:20,179
border point into Windsor Ontario

3911
02:50:17,840 --> 02:50:21,889
however many US and prison Canadians

3912
02:50:20,180 --> 02:50:23,568
have waited weeks for their flights to

3913
02:50:21,889 --> 02:50:25,908
be booked because the prisons make more

3914
02:50:23,568 --> 02:50:28,219
money the longer we are there but then

3915
02:50:25,908 --> 02:50:30,139
again let us be optimistic and hope that

3916
02:50:28,219 --> 02:50:31,969
big can hope that a big campaign to urge

3917
02:50:30,139 --> 02:50:34,879
my speedy return will prove to be

3918
02:50:31,969 --> 02:50:36,260
unnecessary this is getting a little

3919
02:50:34,879 --> 02:50:37,789
long there's only a little bit more guys

3920
02:50:36,260 --> 02:50:38,960
thanks for paying attention this is Mark

3921
02:50:37,790 --> 02:50:41,989
Henry we're talking about so it's worth

3922
02:50:38,959 --> 02:50:44,148
listening to this facility we don't get

3923
02:50:41,988 --> 02:50:45,529
outside much but I can buy items from

3924
02:50:44,148 --> 02:50:46,459
the commissary daily I can't take

3925
02:50:45,529 --> 02:50:47,988
anything with me

3926
02:50:46,459 --> 02:50:49,549
he's just talked about the place he

3927
02:50:47,988 --> 02:50:50,568
thinks he's going to which I won't even

3928
02:50:49,549 --> 02:50:52,639
read it because he didn't get to go

3929
02:50:50,568 --> 02:50:55,189
there if you want to send me anything

3930
02:50:52,639 --> 02:50:57,078
tell me get comfortable comfortable upon

3931
02:50:55,189 --> 02:50:58,279
my arrival and during my hopefully short

3932
02:50:57,078 --> 02:51:00,529
stay you can use your credit card to

3933
02:50:58,279 --> 02:51:02,869
send me $20 or $30 to help pay for my

3934
02:51:00,529 --> 02:51:05,479
phone calls and I'll thank you all and

3935
02:51:02,869 --> 02:51:07,578
buy food and clothes refer to my a

3936
02:51:05,478 --> 02:51:09,379
number refer my name and a number when

3937
02:51:07,578 --> 02:51:11,539
he gets jodeo posted she's done that

3938
02:51:09,379 --> 02:51:12,920
we've read that part I believe all US

3939
02:51:11,540 --> 02:51:14,479
credit cards will work but I hope the

3940
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:17,090
Canadian credit cards will be okay too

3941
02:51:14,478 --> 02:51:19,039
because that's all Joey has this guy's

3942
02:51:17,090 --> 02:51:21,318
he's out of prison and he's still locked

3943
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:23,329
up and still in prison which sucks the

3944
02:51:21,318 --> 02:51:24,709
prison he was in was much better than

3945
02:51:23,328 --> 02:51:26,420
where they're putting it down for this

3946
02:51:24,709 --> 02:51:27,259
temporary time so he's got a [ __ ]

3947
02:51:26,420 --> 02:51:29,449
deal with that [ __ ]

3948
02:51:27,260 --> 02:51:30,770
after he's supposed to be up he says

3949
02:51:29,449 --> 02:51:32,479
when I'm finally placed on the plane to

3950
02:51:30,770 --> 02:51:35,630
Alexandria Louisiana and flown to

3951
02:51:32,478 --> 02:51:37,818

3953
02:51:37,818 --> 02:51:41,988

03:03:48,468 --> 03:03:53,478
really frustrated with the entire

4227
03:03:49,939 --> 03:03:55,578
situation said AJ hash car AJ he's also

4228
03:03:53,478 --> 03:03:57,108
known to me as AJ hashman that's what I

4229
03:03:55,578 --> 03:03:59,270
would always call him so I said I saw a

4230
03:03:57,109 --> 03:04:06,379
sh card I just said hash car because it

4231
03:03:59,270 --> 03:04:07,998
seemed like it worked they came in and

4232
03:04:06,379 --> 03:04:10,310
the machine which we were utilizing to

4233
03:04:07,998 --> 03:04:13,189
make water hash was not food not a food

4234
03:04:10,309 --> 03:04:15,588
safe machine food safe machines to make

4235
03:04:13,189 --> 03:04:17,898
water hash do not exist they deemed the

4236
03:04:15,588 --> 03:04:19,638
water hash that we were making unfit for

4237
03:04:17,898 --> 03:04:22,519
human consumption even though nobody has

4238
03:04:19,638 --> 03:04:23,988
gotten sick from our hash the Department

4239
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:25,158
of Environmental Health verified that

4240
03:04:23,988 --> 03:04:27,618
there haven't been any reports of

4241
03:04:25,158 --> 03:04:29,509
illness yet but a food safety inspection

4242
03:04:27,619 --> 03:04:31,100
was the reason for the recall ash car

4243
03:04:29,509 --> 03:04:32,779
has been using a modified washing

4244
03:04:31,100 --> 03:04:35,059
machine to activate his water hash a

4245
03:04:32,779 --> 03:04:37,039
common practice in this industry to get

4246
03:04:35,059 --> 03:04:39,318
the centrifugal action that is essential

4247
03:04:37,039 --> 03:04:40,549
to the water hash that Ashgar also known

4248
03:04:39,318 --> 03:04:43,878
for his popular marijuana

4249
03:04:40,549 --> 03:04:45,319
meet-and-greets in Denver Colorado some

4250
03:04:43,879 --> 03:04:47,239
great parties he hasn't been able to do

4251
03:04:45,318 --> 03:04:48,288
them anymore because the Denver Police

4252
03:04:47,238 --> 03:04:50,658
have actually been shutting those

4253
03:04:48,289 --> 03:04:53,689
parties down because we're smoking

4254
03:04:50,658 --> 03:04:55,699
cannabis and not drinking alcohol anyway

4255
03:04:53,689 --> 03:04:58,219
the article says my business partner and

4256
03:04:55,699 --> 03:04:59,689
I both have culinary backgrounds food

4257
03:04:58,218 --> 03:05:01,878
service backgrounds and we look at water

4258
03:04:59,689 --> 03:05:04,279
hash as a concentrate not a food ash car

4259
03:05:01,879 --> 03:05:06,859
said but they say as soon as you start

4260
03:05:04,279 --> 03:05:09,600
working with it with the food has the

4261
03:05:06,859 --> 03:05:11,279
intent or the end result it is food

4262
03:05:09,600 --> 03:05:12,689
which I kind of agree with that you know

4263
03:05:11,279 --> 03:05:14,488
it's got to be food we're going to keep

4264
03:05:12,689 --> 03:05:16,109
that hash that's the active ingredient

4265
03:05:14,488 --> 03:05:18,389
that we're searching for so it's got to

4266
03:05:16,109 --> 03:05:20,068
be clean it's gonna be food great in

4267
03:05:18,389 --> 03:05:22,588
June ash card received a variance from

4268
03:05:20,068 --> 03:05:24,538

4269

food safe alternative and he purchased a

4270
03:05:24,539 --> 03:05:28,439

03:05:26,129 --> 03:05:29,819
satisfy their regulations in the

4272
03:05:28,439 --> 03:05:31,619

4334
03:08:01,049 --> 03:08:03,979
like to know that I'm sending people

4335
03:08:04,340 --> 03:08:08,670
advertising dollars are going the right

4336
03:08:07,079 --> 03:08:11,069
direction alright let's get down to a

4337
03:08:08,670 --> 03:08:13,440
grow lesson a few weeks ago we cut some

4338
03:08:11,069 --> 03:08:15,149
clones we germinated seeds and then we

4339
03:08:13,440 --> 03:08:16,860
put those seedlings and clones into cups

4340
03:08:15,149 --> 03:08:19,260
to let them develop roots so it's

4341
03:08:16,860 --> 03:08:20,730
probably the time schedule I've been on

4342
03:08:19,260 --> 03:08:22,560
it's probably past time to get those

4343
03:08:20,729 --> 03:08:25,020
into pots and start the vegetative phase

4344
03:08:22,560 --> 03:08:26,639
I apologize a little behind schedule

4345
03:08:25,021 --> 03:08:30,271
have had a lot of podcasting to try to

4346
03:08:26,639 --> 03:08:31,770
cram in anyway let's talk about the size

4347
03:08:30,271 --> 03:08:33,210
pots we're gonna use I like to go

4348
03:08:31,771 --> 03:08:35,909
straight into the pots that I'm going to

4349
03:08:33,209 --> 03:08:38,310
finish in like the pan what I transplant

4350
03:08:35,909 --> 03:08:42,090
into now from the cups is going to be

4351
03:08:38,310 --> 03:08:43,500
our finished pots we were in cups we're

4352
03:08:42,090 --> 03:08:45,149
gonna go into pots using your pot size

4353
03:08:43,500 --> 03:08:46,860
is important is an important thing to

4354
03:08:45,149 --> 03:08:48,989
consider I like to run my test plants in

4355
03:08:46,860 --> 03:08:51,300
three gallon pots and my big plants in

4356
03:08:48,989 --> 03:08:52,889
seven gallon pots some of you guys like

4357
03:08:51,299 --> 03:08:54,539
to go even bigger but for an indoor crop

4358
03:08:52,889 --> 03:08:57,389
you think of seven gallon pot is plenty

4359
03:08:54,540 --> 03:09:00,330
large enough if you're going outside you

4360
03:08:57,389 --> 03:09:02,159
can go it's 50 to 100 I've seen 250

4361
03:09:00,329 --> 03:09:03,989
gallon pots outside earth pots but

4362
03:09:02,159 --> 03:09:06,450
treacle on that baby shoot is going to

4363
03:09:03,989 --> 03:09:08,369
the ground I think anyway I think I'm

4364
03:09:06,450 --> 03:09:10,021
rambling three or five gallon pots are

4365
03:09:08,370 --> 03:09:11,490
great for vegging plants for a few weeks

4366
03:09:10,021 --> 03:09:13,380
and then flowering I don't like to let

4367
03:09:11,489 --> 03:09:15,719
them veg in three gallop aughts for

4368
03:09:13,379 --> 03:09:17,069
longer than like 45 days or so well

4369
03:09:15,719 --> 03:09:18,898
Sublette start to get too big for that

4370
03:09:17,069 --> 03:09:20,429
they'll get a little bit root bound

4371
03:09:18,898 --> 03:09:22,439
so if you want to vet your plants for

4372
03:09:20,429 --> 03:09:24,658
more time to get a bigger plant to

4373
03:09:22,439 --> 03:09:28,408
bigger buds usually larger pots if I

4374
03:09:24,658 --> 03:09:30,238
want to run a fast crop I run about 16 3

4375
03:09:28,408 --> 03:09:32,158
gallon pots under a thousand watt light

4376
03:09:30,238 --> 03:09:33,509
these are usually from seed if I'm

4377
03:09:32,158 --> 03:09:35,279
running like a little tester crop is

4378
03:09:33,509 --> 03:09:38,549
what I do that for if I'm running a

4379
03:09:35,279 --> 03:09:40,168
production crop I'll put between 4 &amp; 6 7

4380
03:09:38,549 --> 03:09:42,239
gallon pots under a thousand watt light

4381
03:09:40,168 --> 03:09:44,728
depending on the strain if they get

4382
03:09:42,238 --> 03:09:46,588
taller and thinner I'll put six of them

4383
03:09:44,728 --> 03:09:50,278
if they're like bushier plants like I'll

4384
03:09:46,588 --> 03:09:54,568
say dog I only put four lemon Jeffrey

4385
03:09:50,279 --> 03:09:56,129
I'll put six just gets taller than it

4386
03:09:54,568 --> 03:09:58,288
does wide so I'll put six of them under

4387
03:09:56,129 --> 03:09:59,759
there and pull a pretty nice harvest

4388
03:09:58,289 --> 03:10:01,259
about a pound and a half from 6 lemon

4389
03:09:59,759 --> 03:10:05,600
Jeffrey plants in seven gallon pots

4390
03:10:01,259 --> 03:10:07,638
under a thousand watt light of course

4391
03:10:05,600 --> 03:10:10,168
[Music]

4392
03:10:07,638 --> 03:10:12,269
from four of them but I have to let it

4393
03:10:10,168 --> 03:10:15,059
veg just a little bit longer maybe like

4394
03:10:12,270 --> 03:10:17,039
two weeks more and then just that's the

4395
03:10:15,059 --> 03:10:19,168
difference in the pot size and the veg

4396
03:10:17,039 --> 03:10:25,109
times and how many pots that's where you

4397
03:10:19,168 --> 03:10:27,270
start doing that kind of done correctly

4398
03:10:25,109 --> 03:10:31,969
the smaller plants take less time to veg

4399
03:10:27,270 --> 03:10:31,969
but I like the production from a gallon

4400
03:10:32,988 --> 03:10:42,118
they just seem to take off the they grow

4401
03:10:36,418 --> 03:10:45,388
larger and flower in their growth phase

4402
03:10:42,119 --> 03:10:46,799
in flower limited by plant counts so a

4403
03:10:45,388 --> 03:10:48,778
few larger pots is better for the

4404
03:10:46,799 --> 03:10:50,639
medical growers if you have a small grow

4405
03:10:48,779 --> 03:10:52,679
space of course use smaller pots if you

4406
03:10:50,638 --> 03:10:54,238
have room for larger pots go for the

4407
03:10:52,679 --> 03:10:55,888
larger pots you can experiment and see

4408
03:10:54,238 --> 03:10:57,929
what and why and how it all works best

4409
03:10:55,888 --> 03:11:01,048
for your needs and your environment how

4410
03:10:57,929 --> 03:11:02,759
much herb you need how often you need it

4411
03:11:01,049 --> 03:11:04,199
what strains you're gonna grow those are

4412
03:11:02,759 --> 03:11:09,109
all things that are gonna kind of decide

4413
03:11:04,199 --> 03:11:11,459
this stuff for you excuse my dad cough I

4414
03:11:09,109 --> 03:11:12,719
record a podcast animals here watching

4415
03:11:11,459 --> 03:11:14,609
me record he's like dude how do you even

4416
03:11:12,718 --> 03:11:15,868
record with that many dad's going on I

4417
03:11:14,609 --> 03:11:17,068
recorded some stuff with him I'll make

4418
03:11:15,869 --> 03:11:18,119
another episode out of that we got a

4419
03:11:17,068 --> 03:11:20,509
little out of hand and just started

4420
03:11:18,119 --> 03:11:22,979
rambling so anyway I'm doing that again

4421
03:11:20,509 --> 03:11:24,600
once you've chosen your pot size it's

4422
03:11:22,978 --> 03:11:26,439
time for a good soil I like a nice

4423
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:27,819
fluffy soil

4424
03:11:26,440 --> 03:11:30,120
to perlite in it I had plenty of

4425
03:11:27,819 --> 03:11:32,409
amendments so I buy a fairly inert soil

4426
03:11:30,120 --> 03:11:33,761
if you have access to a good drawer

4427
03:11:32,409 --> 03:11:35,140
supply store than I recommend starting

4428
03:11:33,761 --> 03:11:36,551
with something like roots organic

4429
03:11:35,140 --> 03:11:37,869
centrally mixed number four something

4430
03:11:36,550 --> 03:11:40,750
similar to that these are all create

4431
03:11:37,870 --> 03:11:42,431
starters I use a recycled and amended

4432
03:11:40,750 --> 03:11:43,750
soil mix that can get a little complex

4433
03:11:42,431 --> 03:11:46,060
and it can make it hard to diagnose

4434
03:11:43,750 --> 03:11:47,591
problems if one comes up so I recommend

4435
03:11:46,060 --> 03:11:49,239
learning with the basic soil and organic

4436
03:11:47,591 --> 03:11:52,710
bottled nutrients unless you have

4437
03:11:49,239 --> 03:11:55,869
experience with farming horticulture

4438
03:11:52,709 --> 03:11:57,369
education once you understand the basics

4439
03:11:55,870 --> 03:11:59,021
of the plants we can make a super soil

4440
03:11:57,370 --> 03:12:01,000
mix and work on eliminating the bottle

4441
03:11:59,021 --> 03:12:02,351
feeds but for now let's keep it simple

4442
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,671
and develop a good understanding of

4443
03:12:02,351 --> 03:12:06,101
these plants that's where we want to

4444
03:12:03,671 --> 03:12:07,690
start so you've got some you got some

4445
03:12:06,101 --> 03:12:09,940
pots we've got some small plants that

4446
03:12:07,690 --> 03:12:11,530
are in cups let's get those babies into

4447
03:12:09,940 --> 03:12:15,239
the big girl pots and then we'll talk

4448
03:12:11,530 --> 03:12:17,471
about feeding for the vegetation phase

4449
03:12:15,239 --> 03:12:19,810
babies and cups is really gonna help out

4450
03:12:17,470 --> 03:12:21,250
make it easy to transplant I fill my

4451
03:12:19,810 --> 03:12:22,690
pots with soil and I pack it in there

4452
03:12:21,250 --> 03:12:24,220
slightly tight I just press it down with

4453
03:12:22,690 --> 03:12:25,989
my hands and I don't pack it so tightly

4454
03:12:24,220 --> 03:12:27,671
that the roots can't dig through but I

4455
03:12:25,989 --> 03:12:28,931
do want to pack it tightly enough to

4456
03:12:27,671 --> 03:12:30,550
where the plants gonna have plenty of

4457
03:12:28,931 --> 03:12:32,739
support once I bury that roof all in

4458
03:12:30,550 --> 03:12:34,171
there if the soil is packed too lightly

4459
03:12:32,739 --> 03:12:36,341
you'll know because as soon as you water

4460
03:12:34,171 --> 03:12:37,720
the water's gonna run right through the

4461
03:12:36,341 --> 03:12:39,101
dirt and the soil is gonna cave in and

4462
03:12:37,720 --> 03:12:41,171
then you'll have to refill in there but

4463
03:12:39,101 --> 03:12:43,210
anyway fill your pots about two inches

4464
03:12:41,171 --> 03:12:44,950
from the top or more for bigger pots we

4465
03:12:43,209 --> 03:12:47,079
want to save some space for watering a

4466
03:12:44,950 --> 03:12:48,790
seven gallon pot will take a gallon of

4467
03:12:47,079 --> 03:12:50,171
water or more and that needs some space

4468
03:12:48,790 --> 03:12:52,181
in your pot and a three gallon pot

4469
03:12:50,171 --> 03:12:54,579
you'll easily take half a gallon up to a

4470
03:12:52,181 --> 03:12:56,190
gallon so save yourself some space so I

4471
03:12:54,579 --> 03:12:58,511
get the pot mostly full and I dig out

4472
03:12:56,190 --> 03:13:01,091
fed a large handful of soil out of the

4473
03:12:58,511 --> 03:13:02,710
center of the pot I set the clone in the

4474
03:13:01,091 --> 03:13:05,290
cup it's still in the plastic cup right

4475
03:13:02,709 --> 03:13:07,239
now for a minute I set that cup in the

4476
03:13:05,290 --> 03:13:09,190
spot where the clone is gonna go and I

4477
03:13:07,239 --> 03:13:10,780
backfill the dirt around the cup this

4478
03:13:09,190 --> 03:13:12,159
makes a perfect little spot for the

4479
03:13:10,780 --> 03:13:17,171
clone to fill without disturbing the

4480
03:13:12,159 --> 03:13:19,030
roots I do not leave the cup on the

4481
03:13:17,171 --> 03:13:21,370
clone only for that one second while I

4482
03:13:19,030 --> 03:13:23,950
was making an indention I don't leave

4483
03:13:21,370 --> 03:13:25,511
the cup I only uh I only use it to make

4484
03:13:23,950 --> 03:13:26,921
a little space with the clone once I've

4485
03:13:25,511 --> 03:13:29,290
got the perfect little space in there

4486
03:13:26,921 --> 03:13:30,760
mean for my clone

4487
03:13:29,290 --> 03:13:34,030
pull that cup out what's a clone in it

4488
03:13:30,760 --> 03:13:35,590
and then I hold the cup upside down with

4489
03:13:34,030 --> 03:13:37,780
my hand on top of the cup with the clone

4490
03:13:35,590 --> 03:13:39,460
coming out like between my middle and

4491
03:13:37,780 --> 03:13:44,920
ring finger when I flip the cup upside

4492
03:13:39,459 --> 03:13:46,359
down give it a little squeeze and then

4493
03:13:44,920 --> 03:13:50,219
usually just squeeze it and shake it

4494
03:13:46,360 --> 03:13:52,870
until the clone slides out of the cup

4495
03:13:50,219 --> 03:13:54,340
try not to disturb the roots and that

4496
03:13:52,870 --> 03:13:56,740
soil ball that come right out if they're

4497
03:13:54,340 --> 03:13:59,409
just shaking it'll come out that little

4498
03:13:56,739 --> 03:14:01,059
ball perfectly into that perfect little

4499
03:13:59,409 --> 03:14:02,559
spot that we just made it should be the

4500
03:14:01,059 --> 03:14:05,469
same shape as the cup since you just

4501
03:14:02,559 --> 03:14:08,819
make it so just set it right down in

4502
03:14:05,469 --> 03:14:10,020
there when the cup comes off falling out

4503
03:14:08,819 --> 03:14:12,250
[Music]

4504
03:14:10,021 --> 03:14:13,960
just stay calm you could drop dirt and

4505
03:14:12,250 --> 03:14:15,521
[ __ ] just don't drop the plant just

4506
03:14:13,959 --> 03:14:17,439
focus on getting that tiny little root

4507
03:14:15,521 --> 03:14:18,720
ball into that hole that we just made

4508
03:14:17,440 --> 03:14:21,610
and everything should be just fine

4509
03:14:18,719 --> 03:14:23,319
so now you've taken a cup you flipped it

4510
03:14:21,610 --> 03:14:24,610
upside down then little baby plants

4511
03:14:23,319 --> 03:14:26,409
falling out you got a handful of dirt

4512
03:14:24,610 --> 03:14:34,090
you're holding your new [ __ ] life

4513
03:14:26,409 --> 03:14:45,010
right there in your hand right in there

4514
03:14:34,090 --> 03:14:49,870
and now the whole plant I just put the

4515
03:14:45,010 --> 03:14:59,340
new freshly planted plant and you just

4516
03:14:49,870 --> 03:15:00,490
kind of camouflage the upright and

4517
03:14:59,340 --> 03:15:03,540
carefully

4518
03:15:00,489 --> 03:15:06,879
label your newly potted plant label

4519
03:15:03,540 --> 03:15:12,040
that's not labeled if the couple is well

4520
03:15:06,879 --> 03:15:13,750
labeled comes off the cuff' is still in

4521
03:15:12,040 --> 03:15:15,370
there sometimes that helps I'd sometimes

4522
03:15:13,750 --> 03:15:16,719
I just use the cup but once in a while I

4523
03:15:15,370 --> 03:15:21,430
knock the cup out and they get confused

4524
03:15:16,719 --> 03:15:23,229
so that sucks and I keep working until

4525
03:15:21,430 --> 03:15:25,239
all of my new babies are in pots once

4526
03:15:23,229 --> 03:15:26,590
everything is potted is what I'll feed

4527
03:15:25,239 --> 03:15:29,350
them and make sure to get the pots

4528
03:15:26,590 --> 03:15:31,329
thoroughly wet so you've got a crop a

4529
03:15:29,350 --> 03:15:33,460
freshly transplanted planted babies

4530
03:15:31,329 --> 03:15:35,379
under the lights and now that's pretty

4531
03:15:33,459 --> 03:15:37,149
much the beginning of the vegetative

4532
03:15:35,379 --> 03:15:38,750
growth phase it's time to mix up some

4533
03:15:37,149 --> 03:15:42,979
nutrients and feed them

4534
03:15:38,750 --> 03:15:45,409
first full veg nutrients I'm soil grower

4535
03:15:42,979 --> 03:15:46,969
so I pretty much focus on a dirt garden

4536
03:15:45,409 --> 03:15:50,450
if you're running a hydro garden we're

4537
03:15:46,969 --> 03:15:51,889
gonna hydro guy on the show here in the

4538
03:15:50,450 --> 03:15:58,220
future and have him teach you guys some

4539
03:15:51,889 --> 03:16:00,559
stuff I recommend mixing your nutrients

4540
03:15:58,219 --> 03:16:05,599
in a five-gallon bucket using accurate

4541
03:16:00,559 --> 03:16:08,059
measuring device for your nutrients on

4542
03:16:05,600 --> 03:16:09,739
it for small applications for larger

4543
03:16:08,059 --> 03:16:11,209
stuff there's a pint glass that is

4544
03:16:09,739 --> 03:16:12,709
marked with milliliters and a few other

4545
03:16:11,209 --> 03:16:14,989
measurements you can find those at your

4546
03:16:12,709 --> 03:16:16,669
local hydro shop I found a half gallon

4547
03:16:14,989 --> 03:16:19,430
pitcher that fits perfectly into my five

4548
03:16:16,670 --> 03:16:24,110
gallon bucket I've learned to mix my

4549
03:16:19,430 --> 03:16:25,850
nutrients into that pitcher instead of

4550
03:16:24,110 --> 03:16:28,280
mixing my nutrients directly into a

4551
03:16:25,850 --> 03:16:30,260
five-gallon bucket you don't want to

4552
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:32,120
pour out five gallons of water when you

4553
03:16:30,260 --> 03:16:34,399
mess up mixing your nutrient feed that's

4554
03:16:32,120 --> 03:16:36,410
a lot of water to pour down the drain so

4555
03:16:34,399 --> 03:16:38,389
fill your pitcher 3/4 of the way with

4556
03:16:36,409 --> 03:16:43,069
water add your nutrients of choice to

4557
03:16:38,389 --> 03:16:45,709
the pitcher nutrient ocula and some good

4558
03:16:43,069 --> 03:16:47,629
enzymes specifically I would use 50

4559
03:16:45,709 --> 03:16:50,209
milliliters of botanic air pure blend

4560
03:16:47,629 --> 03:16:52,969
pearl fetch soil formula is my base I

4561
03:16:50,209 --> 03:16:54,979
would use OGT or great white shark as my

4562
03:16:52,969 --> 03:16:57,439
mykos which is your inoculant and I

4563
03:16:54,979 --> 03:17:00,859
would use 15 milliliters of hydros I'm

4564
03:16:57,440 --> 03:17:02,300
as my enzymes so in my garden I would

4565
03:17:00,860 --> 03:17:04,190
add a little bit of liquid karma and a

4566
03:17:02,299 --> 03:17:04,759
few other supplements but they're not

4567
03:17:04,190 --> 03:17:08,750
required

4568
03:17:04,760 --> 03:17:11,239
I had sweet to feed my beneficials for

4569
03:17:08,750 --> 03:17:20,479
extra vitamins and amino acids and

4570
03:17:11,239 --> 03:17:24,350
vitamin B also required but I like to

4571
03:17:20,479 --> 03:17:25,879
spoil my plants after about a week the

4572
03:17:24,350 --> 03:17:28,069
next week I'll feed cal-mag and

4573
03:17:25,879 --> 03:17:30,589
potassium silicates and then I run most

4574
03:17:28,069 --> 03:17:32,270
of the botanic here botanic air pure

4575
03:17:30,590 --> 03:17:34,340
blend ProLiant when I run bottled

4576
03:17:32,270 --> 03:17:36,800
nutrients botanic air is not a sponsor

4577
03:17:34,340 --> 03:17:38,930
but I've been most satisfied with

4578
03:17:36,799 --> 03:17:41,299
botanic hair and organic hair more than

4579
03:17:38,930 --> 03:17:41,870
any other bottle feed that's that's just

4580
03:17:41,299 --> 03:17:44,269
my opinion

4581
03:17:41,870 --> 03:17:45,980
I ran to advance nutrients I've ran the

4582
03:17:44,270 --> 03:17:47,909
Aurora Seoul synthetics which produce

4583
03:17:45,979 --> 03:17:52,140
some super tasty products

4584
03:17:47,909 --> 03:17:55,229
I ran psycho which was probably not my

4585
03:17:52,140 --> 03:17:58,260
favorite I've ran a bunch of them I've

4586
03:17:55,229 --> 03:17:59,489
ran to the Fox farms basic stuff I've

4587
03:17:58,260 --> 03:18:01,620
done a lot of feats I've done something

4588
03:17:59,489 --> 03:18:03,420
I can't even remember them all anyway

4589
03:18:01,620 --> 03:18:05,220
you can find a pretty good pre-made

4590
03:18:03,420 --> 03:18:07,440
botanic hair feature on their website

4591
03:18:05,219 --> 03:18:09,420
I'll try to remember to post some of my

4592
03:18:07,440 --> 03:18:11,040
notes of the feeding programs feeding

4593
03:18:09,420 --> 03:18:13,290
programs for that somebody tweeted me to

4594
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:15,271
remind me a hydro culture I've got this

4595
03:18:13,290 --> 03:18:22,260
paper here in front of me so hopefully

4596
03:18:15,271 --> 03:18:25,079
that'll remind me mix up your bottled

4597
03:18:22,260 --> 03:18:26,940
feeds in a small container of water but

4598
03:18:25,079 --> 03:18:28,469
don't ever mix your nutrients together

4599
03:18:26,940 --> 03:18:30,510
without plenty of water

4600
03:18:28,469 --> 03:18:33,449
don't pour like a shot glass the

4601
03:18:30,510 --> 03:18:35,250
measuring device don't pour the veg

4602
03:18:33,450 --> 03:18:37,530
stuff and then don't pour enzymes into

4603
03:18:35,250 --> 03:18:39,750
the same shot glass at the same time mix

4604
03:18:37,530 --> 03:18:41,370
those two water the followed stuff is

4605
03:18:39,750 --> 03:18:43,649
sold in separate bottles to prevent

4606
03:18:41,370 --> 03:18:45,030
bonding of specific elements so always

4607
03:18:43,649 --> 03:18:47,670
mix into water once your picture is

4608
03:18:45,030 --> 03:18:48,989
mixed put that into the five-gallon

4609
03:18:47,670 --> 03:18:51,360
bucket and fill it up the rest of the

4610
03:18:48,989 --> 03:18:52,969
way once the bucket is full you need to

4611
03:18:51,360 --> 03:18:57,090
adjust the pH of your feed solution

4612
03:18:52,969 --> 03:18:59,939
adjust your pH to 6.5 using pH down it's

4613
03:18:57,090 --> 03:19:01,560
unlikely that your pH is too low make

4614
03:18:59,940 --> 03:19:03,569
sure you calibrate your pH meters

4615
03:19:01,560 --> 03:19:04,949
frequently that's always a good idea so

4616
03:19:03,569 --> 03:19:06,659
you got a bucket full of nutrient

4617
03:19:04,950 --> 03:19:09,300
solution that has been pH adjusted to

4618
03:19:06,659 --> 03:19:11,190
6.5 we've got our freshly transplanted

4619
03:19:09,299 --> 03:19:12,779
babies under a light the next thing we

4620
03:19:11,190 --> 03:19:17,310
got to do is pour the feed into the

4621
03:19:12,780 --> 03:19:19,170
plants so oh I hope you've got a some

4622
03:19:17,310 --> 03:19:20,851
type of saucer or something to catch the

4623
03:19:19,170 --> 03:19:23,430
runoff on your plants also likes it your

4624
03:19:20,851 --> 03:19:25,650
plants and a saucer or a tray if you

4625
03:19:23,430 --> 03:19:27,420
don't have something like that sometimes

4626
03:19:25,649 --> 03:19:29,760
I used a I've got a Rubbermaid tray

4627
03:19:27,420 --> 03:19:31,079
that'll fit three three gallon pots in

4628
03:19:29,760 --> 03:19:32,969
there perfectly so I can just pour water

4629
03:19:31,079 --> 03:19:34,950
into the plants and then it'll drain

4630
03:19:32,969 --> 03:19:36,779
right into there if not you're gonna end

4631
03:19:34,950 --> 03:19:38,070
up with water on the floor so you need

4632
03:19:36,780 --> 03:19:39,900
something to catch the runoff that comes

4633
03:19:38,069 --> 03:19:41,489
out of your plants so I kind of use the

4634
03:19:39,899 --> 03:19:43,020
pitcher that I'm using to stir up the

4635
03:19:41,489 --> 03:19:44,310
solution before I go right to the plants

4636
03:19:43,021 --> 03:19:46,320
to try to mix up the water a little bit

4637
03:19:44,310 --> 03:19:47,840
to stir up the stuff it's always a good

4638
03:19:46,319 --> 03:19:49,979
idea stir everything thoroughly

4639
03:19:47,840 --> 03:19:52,140
sometimes if I'm using a big batch

4640
03:19:49,979 --> 03:19:54,359
sometimes I mix my nutrients into a much

4641
03:19:52,140 --> 03:19:55,560
larger batch I throw an air stone in

4642
03:19:54,360 --> 03:19:56,670
there to pump it up a little bit to

4643
03:19:55,560 --> 03:19:58,260
aerate it and then while

4644
03:19:56,670 --> 03:19:59,549
doing that I also use a big stick like

4645
03:19:58,260 --> 03:20:02,520
the kind that you'd use to support your

4646
03:19:59,549 --> 03:20:03,840
plants I used to stir the water up it

4647
03:20:02,520 --> 03:20:06,780
just seems to be effective I like

4648
03:20:03,840 --> 03:20:08,399
stirring it's a good idea a little bit

4649
03:20:06,780 --> 03:20:10,079
then simply pour about a third of the

4650
03:20:08,399 --> 03:20:12,389
gallon of water of the feed into each

4651
03:20:10,079 --> 03:20:18,360
plant if you're using larger pots you're

4652
03:20:12,389 --> 03:20:20,699
gonna need more you know pretty quickly

4653
03:20:18,360 --> 03:20:22,110
I feel like crumbles down in once we had

4654
03:20:20,700 --> 03:20:24,840
the water all the airspace is gonna get

4655
03:20:22,110 --> 03:20:29,189
pushed out its gonna move around you

4656
03:20:24,840 --> 03:20:30,719
have to adjust everything and refill any

4657
03:20:29,189 --> 03:20:32,939
pots that you need to fill with soil and

4658
03:20:30,719 --> 03:20:34,438
get the plants under good lights t5

4659
03:20:32,939 --> 03:20:36,149
lights are good for veg if you have

4660
03:20:34,439 --> 03:20:37,920
enough for them close to the plants

4661
03:20:36,149 --> 03:20:39,809
metal halides are also ideal for a fetch

4662
03:20:37,920 --> 03:20:42,600
growth you want to focus on getting

4663
03:20:39,809 --> 03:20:44,100
those pots full of roots right now so

4664
03:20:42,600 --> 03:20:46,110
the blue spectrum is kind of what we

4665
03:20:44,100 --> 03:20:47,850
want LEDs seem to be really good for veg

4666
03:20:46,110 --> 03:20:49,470
plants but I personally don't have any

4667
03:20:47,850 --> 03:20:51,720
experience with the LEDs but I have seen

4668
03:20:49,469 --> 03:20:53,519
some great photographs coming from an

4669
03:20:51,719 --> 03:20:54,869
LED garden shout-out to Nancy bud while

4670
03:20:53,520 --> 03:20:58,770
she's growing some Bounty Killer right

4671
03:20:54,870 --> 03:21:01,829
now and it looks amazing so try to keep

4672
03:20:58,770 --> 03:21:03,870
your veg area around a 72 to 77 degrees

4673
03:21:01,829 --> 03:21:06,299
if you're using co2 you can get it let

4674
03:21:03,870 --> 03:21:08,700
it get a little bit warmer maybe low 80s

4675
03:21:06,299 --> 03:21:10,259
during the light period during your dark

4676
03:21:08,700 --> 03:21:13,409
cycle try to keep them about the same

4677
03:21:10,260 --> 03:21:15,079
temp or norm or no more than 10 degrees

4678
03:21:13,409 --> 03:21:17,909
cooler than your daytime temperatures

4679
03:21:15,079 --> 03:21:21,090
try to keep your humidity around 40 to

4680
03:21:17,909 --> 03:21:22,530
55 percent if possible in Colorado it

4681
03:21:21,090 --> 03:21:25,020
gets hard to keep the rooms humid so

4682
03:21:22,530 --> 03:21:26,939
they get dry here honestly you'd rather

4683
03:21:25,020 --> 03:21:28,920
have it to drive into humid if you have

4684
03:21:26,939 --> 03:21:30,479
the option if you can't get it right

4685
03:21:28,920 --> 03:21:31,920
where you want it if your floors are

4686
03:21:30,478 --> 03:21:33,539
messed up and not the way you need them

4687
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:35,040
to be if you can't correct it I

4688
03:21:33,540 --> 03:21:36,450
understand you're grown in a house it's

4689
03:21:35,040 --> 03:21:38,430
not gonna be perfect you'd rather have

4690
03:21:36,450 --> 03:21:41,010
it to dry than to moist if you've got

4691
03:21:38,430 --> 03:21:43,710
the option so also remember to keep your

4692
03:21:41,010 --> 03:21:45,569
air fresh you don't want stale stuffy

4693
03:21:43,709 --> 03:21:47,759
air in your Dro rooms your plants need

4694
03:21:45,569 --> 03:21:49,529
plenty of co2 and they deplete the co2

4695
03:21:47,760 --> 03:21:51,689
in a room very quickly

4696
03:21:49,530 --> 03:21:53,760
having stale air in a grow room can lead

4697
03:21:51,689 --> 03:21:56,880
to powdery mildew and it slows down the

4698
03:21:53,760 --> 03:21:58,800
growth of your plants quite quickly so I

4699
03:21:56,879 --> 03:21:59,879
keep my vision plants under 24 hours of

4700
03:21:58,799 --> 03:22:02,369
light I think they grow more quickly

4701
03:21:59,879 --> 03:22:04,519
under 24 hours of light than they do

4702
03:22:02,370 --> 03:22:06,319
what the dark cycle during veg

4703
03:22:04,520 --> 03:22:08,209
most books will tell you to run a

4704
03:22:06,318 --> 03:22:10,488
16-hour day period and an eight-hour

4705
03:22:08,209 --> 03:22:11,869
dark period I think it's great because

4706
03:22:10,488 --> 03:22:14,779
it's how nature works and you can't

4707
03:22:11,869 --> 03:22:16,279
argue with that I've experimented with

4708
03:22:14,779 --> 03:22:18,470
both sometimes if I'm earning a seed

4709
03:22:16,279 --> 03:22:22,279
crop I will run a 16-hour light cycle

4710
03:22:18,469 --> 03:22:25,548
and then go to a 1212 cycle sometimes I

4711
03:22:22,279 --> 03:22:26,899
will run an 1113 cycle which is odd but

4712
03:22:25,549 --> 03:22:31,549
we'll talk about that later on to learn

4713
03:22:26,898 --> 03:22:33,408
that from DJ short so that 16/8 life

4714
03:22:31,549 --> 03:22:34,789
cycle is great like I said nature works

4715
03:22:33,408 --> 03:22:36,288
it also lets your equipment cool down

4716
03:22:34,789 --> 03:22:37,729
and take a little bit of a break and it

4717
03:22:36,289 --> 03:22:39,409
lets your electricity bill chill out for

4718
03:22:37,728 --> 03:22:40,908
a second let's your meter quit spinning

4719
03:22:39,408 --> 03:22:42,889
so as long as your veggie

4720
03:22:40,908 --> 03:22:44,088
plants are under 16 hours of light every

4721
03:22:42,889 --> 03:22:47,180
day they should be happy you can

4722
03:22:44,088 --> 03:22:49,009
experiment with it I'll do another show

4723
03:22:47,180 --> 03:22:51,828
with more info on light cycles before a

4724
03:22:49,009 --> 03:22:53,270
photo period later on one thing I've

4725
03:22:51,828 --> 03:22:56,538
really noticed is that when I flip my

4726
03:22:53,270 --> 03:22:59,748
plants to 1212 to flower from this 24

4727
03:22:56,539 --> 03:23:01,699
hour light cycle they show flower faster

4728
03:22:59,748 --> 03:23:04,699
than the plants that had a dark cycle

4729
03:23:01,699 --> 03:23:05,869
during veg that's just one thing I've

4730
03:23:04,699 --> 03:23:07,459
noticed so if you're really looking for

4731
03:23:05,869 --> 03:23:09,439
a production crop that's something to

4732
03:23:07,459 --> 03:23:10,579
keep in mind since I just remembered

4733
03:23:09,439 --> 03:23:12,799
that that's kind of what inspired that

4734
03:23:10,578 --> 03:23:14,628
for me I think I might switch back I

4735
03:23:12,799 --> 03:23:16,489
also like to keep my mother plants under

4736
03:23:14,629 --> 03:23:18,020
twelve twelve just to keep them from

4737
03:23:16,488 --> 03:23:19,668
even thinking that they may have the

4738
03:23:18,020 --> 03:23:21,619
chance to flower once they get rebounded

4739
03:23:19,668 --> 03:23:24,378
stuff they sometimes some of your mother

4740
03:23:21,619 --> 03:23:27,680
plants may try to OTO flower on you so

4741
03:23:24,379 --> 03:23:29,810
we've got our babies and new pots and we

4742
03:23:27,680 --> 03:23:31,488
fed them under good lights I put a fan

4743
03:23:29,809 --> 03:23:33,918
lightly blowing over the canopy to keep

4744
03:23:31,488 --> 03:23:36,048
the air circulating and if the temps and

4745
03:23:33,918 --> 03:23:37,488
humidity or humidity are correct in the

4746
03:23:36,049 --> 03:23:39,529
room the plants won't need water for

4747
03:23:37,488 --> 03:23:41,809
three or four days if you watered them

4748
03:23:39,529 --> 03:23:43,459
enough right now so this is a good time

4749
03:23:41,809 --> 03:23:45,828
to start thinking about pest management

4750
03:23:43,459 --> 03:23:47,449
if you have neem oil on hand give each

4751
03:23:45,828 --> 03:23:49,038
plant a good spray when the lights turn

4752
03:23:47,449 --> 03:23:51,140
off you don't want to spray them when

4753
03:23:49,039 --> 03:23:53,350
the lights are on that creates what I

4754
03:23:51,139 --> 03:23:55,939
call it over reflector bubbles from the

4755
03:23:53,350 --> 03:23:58,039
you know the bubbles plant on your plant

4756
03:23:55,939 --> 03:23:59,600
the light hits it just like a magnifying

4757
03:23:58,039 --> 03:24:01,338
glass did when you were a little kid and

4758
03:23:59,600 --> 03:24:03,078
used to cook ants it'll happen to your

4759
03:24:01,338 --> 03:24:05,389
plants the grow light will work as the

4760
03:24:03,078 --> 03:24:06,259
Sun and the bubble will work like a

4761
03:24:05,389 --> 03:24:07,878
magnifying glass

4762
03:24:06,259 --> 03:24:09,680
and you get a little burn mark a little

4763
03:24:07,879 --> 03:24:11,119
white spot so spray when the lights are

4764
03:24:09,680 --> 03:24:12,520
off always try to spray when the lights

4765
03:24:11,119 --> 03:24:15,159
are off

4766
03:24:12,520 --> 03:24:17,890
yeah if that's any book will tell you

4767
03:24:15,159 --> 03:24:19,719
that knee will keep most of your passed

4768
03:24:17,889 --> 03:24:21,489
away once you're in Flour you'll need to

4769
03:24:19,719 --> 03:24:23,379
rethink the knee because you do not want

4770
03:24:21,489 --> 03:24:25,270
a spray meme on your flowering plants

4771
03:24:23,379 --> 03:24:27,250
don't do that it'll taste terrible

4772
03:24:25,270 --> 03:24:29,920
if you make concentrates with neem

4773
03:24:27,250 --> 03:24:31,870
sprayed plants excuse me if you make

4774
03:24:29,920 --> 03:24:33,728
concentrates with neem sprayed plants

4775
03:24:31,870 --> 03:24:36,630
you can definitely taste the neem so

4776
03:24:33,728 --> 03:24:39,069
once you're in flower stop spraying me

4777
03:24:36,629 --> 03:24:40,779
I've got a new product I'm testing out

4778
03:24:39,069 --> 03:24:42,969
if it works for me I'm definitely gonna

4779
03:24:40,780 --> 03:24:45,340
share it with you it's it's all organic

4780
03:24:42,969 --> 03:24:46,840
it was recommended to me by somebody in

4781
03:24:45,340 --> 03:24:48,549
the horticultural industry not the

4782
03:24:46,840 --> 03:24:51,549
cannabis industry so it's used for food

4783
03:24:48,549 --> 03:24:53,049
crops so it's completely safe I didn't

4784
03:24:51,549 --> 03:24:54,398
smell bad when I used it I'm kind of

4785
03:24:53,049 --> 03:24:56,409
testing it out now I'll let you know

4786
03:24:54,398 --> 03:24:58,989
what I think so you're now officially in

4787
03:24:56,409 --> 03:25:00,489
the fed phase I feed bottle nutrients if

4788
03:24:58,989 --> 03:25:03,010
I'm using bottled nutrients I only feed

4789
03:25:00,489 --> 03:25:04,389
them once per week with plain pH water

4790
03:25:03,010 --> 03:25:06,159
throughout the rest of the week so I

4791
03:25:04,389 --> 03:25:07,898
personally feed all my plants on Monday

4792
03:25:06,159 --> 03:25:10,090
so if you guys are listening to this on

4793
03:25:07,898 --> 03:25:11,590
Monday I'm probably waiting for the

4794
03:25:10,090 --> 03:25:15,760
lights to come on the flower room comes

4795
03:25:11,590 --> 03:25:22,148
on at 10:00 so click on I will actually

4796
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:25,870
have my nutrients mixed up already these

4797
03:25:22,148 --> 03:25:29,590
plants are mixing up through week five

4798
03:25:25,870 --> 03:25:30,820
stuff get the pH adjusted in there and

4799
03:25:29,590 --> 03:25:31,930
then I'll throw some air stones in there

4800
03:25:30,819 --> 03:25:33,398
and let that stuff just bubble around

4801
03:25:31,930 --> 03:25:34,630
and let the nutrients mean go for a

4802
03:25:33,398 --> 03:25:36,930
little while and as soon as lights come

4803
03:25:34,629 --> 03:25:39,579
on I'll go in there and feed them so

4804
03:25:36,930 --> 03:25:40,329
I'll need water again usually by

4805
03:25:39,579 --> 03:25:42,850
Thursday

4806
03:25:40,329 --> 03:25:44,469
once again heavier into flour it may

4807
03:25:42,850 --> 03:25:47,620
step up to Wednesday they won't go as

4808
03:25:44,469 --> 03:25:48,819
long so you can let your plants get

4809
03:25:47,620 --> 03:25:50,290
that's something you got to keep in mind

4810
03:25:48,819 --> 03:25:53,260
to think about how tall your plants can

4811
03:25:50,290 --> 03:25:55,149
get think about if you want to top them

4812
03:25:53,260 --> 03:25:57,309
or let them grow naturally because your

4813
03:25:55,148 --> 03:25:58,930
plants some sativa plants can double it

4814
03:25:57,309 --> 03:26:01,029
in size during flower like if you're

4815
03:25:58,930 --> 03:26:02,920
good on the Bounty Killer that thing is

4816
03:26:01,030 --> 03:26:04,329
going to double in size during your

4817
03:26:02,920 --> 03:26:06,040
flower period so it's time to think

4818
03:26:04,329 --> 03:26:08,049
about how tall and wide your plants can

4819
03:26:06,040 --> 03:26:10,060
get before you need to flower them out

4820
03:26:08,049 --> 03:26:12,039
because that is going to be the next

4821
03:26:10,059 --> 03:26:14,859
major phase of your plants get a little

4822
03:26:12,040 --> 03:26:16,540
veg probably got another month to forty

4823
03:26:14,860 --> 03:26:19,390
five maybe two months if you want to go

4824
03:26:16,540 --> 03:26:22,740
crazy but I recommend about 30 days veg

4825
03:26:19,389 --> 03:26:24,329
time from here out so don't get any bugs

4826
03:26:22,739 --> 03:26:27,000
burn with nutrients take good care of

4827
03:26:24,329 --> 03:26:28,530
them that's super important I think that

4828
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:30,149
gets us basically started through the

4829
03:26:28,530 --> 03:26:31,681
veg phase I plan to go in-depth with

4830
03:26:30,149 --> 03:26:33,149
each of these little topics in the

4831
03:26:31,681 --> 03:26:35,069
future we'll make little branches from

4832
03:26:33,149 --> 03:26:36,209
everything that I've mentioned I want to

4833
03:26:35,069 --> 03:26:37,979
get everybody up to speed with the

4834
03:26:36,209 --> 03:26:40,350
basics before we go too deeply into

4835
03:26:37,979 --> 03:26:41,819
specific stuff about growing I've got

4836
