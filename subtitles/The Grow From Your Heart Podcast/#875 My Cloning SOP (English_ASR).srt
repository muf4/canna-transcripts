If you have ever taken the dome off of

00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,320
your clones to leave it open for a few

00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:12,719

Welcome back podcast world. I'm your

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,359
host Rosta Jeff. This is episode

10
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:45,519
875 of the Grow from Your Heart podcast.

11
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,280
I've got a fun episode lined up for us.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
In today's show, I'm going to talk about

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,120
taking clones. That's right. We'll talk

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,039
about cloning in an easy cloner and

15
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,119
we'll also talk about cloning in a clone

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,800
dome environment. Before we get to that

17
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,919

00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,599
too much time advertising here at the

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,399
start of the show. Let's jump into the

41
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,919
cloning portion of today's podcast. Now,

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,478
in this episode, I'm going to say the

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,399
word clone a bunch of times. Before we

44
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,519
get too far, maybe I should explain what

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,478
I mean by the word clone. A clone is a

46
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,438
perfect exact copy of a plant that you

47
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,718
already have or a plant that already

48
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,959
exists. Let's just say you've got a

49
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,719
plant. That plant originally came from

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
seed. Maybe you got it from the seed

51
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,680
that you grew. Maybe another person took

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,080
a clone of that seed and gave you that

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,159
clone. But anyway, you have now got a

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,920
plant. Perhaps you want to keep that

55
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,598
plant around. If you bought that clone,

56
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,119
you know it's a good clone. You want to

57
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,598
preserve that and keep that so you can

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
grow it generation after generation.

59
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,280
This is how we do it in a commercial

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,039
environment. Uh this is how myself as a

61
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,159
breeder, this is how I keep specific

62
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,079
plants around to breed with them uh for

63
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,079
a long time. Like I talk about my golden

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,040
goat plant. I've had golden goat uh

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,680
since probably 2008. And it is the same

66
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,679
plant. I got that plant from a friend. I

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,319
took a clone of it. I kept that clone in

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,319
preservation and then I grew out uh the

69
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,399
other plant and then that clone got

70
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,479
bigger. I took clones from it, kept one

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,599
I always kept one back as a mother plant

72
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,079
in preservation. So uh real quickly, a

73
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,238
clone is a copy of a plant. So you've

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,719
got a plant, right? You take a cut of

75
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,200
that plant and then you put that uh that

76
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,919
cut into a solution and then into an

77
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,479
environment and over time that cut will

78
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,359
make roots and that is your clone. That

79
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,518
is an exact photocopy of the original

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
plant that it came from. That's very

81
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,280
useful because, like I said, I'm a

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,560
breeder. This is how I keep my golden

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,759
goat plant around uh since 2008. You do

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,920
the math on however long that is. Uh but

85
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,318
so over time, like I said before, the

86
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,158
plant grows, I take a clone of it or I

87
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,679
take multiple clones of it. Some of

88
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,759
those clones will go into the flower

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
room. Uh who knows what the plant that I

90
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,439
just took the cuts from. Maybe I cut all

91
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,439
of it down and made clones out of all of

92
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,359
it. Maybe the big plant went outside and

93
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,759
got to flower outside. That's not

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,680
important. We take a bunch of clones.

95
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,840
Ah, some of those clones go into flower.

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,840
I always grab one of them and put it in

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,840
the bedroom, the mom room, and keep it

98
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,000
as a mom for preservation. So, I've

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,920
always got that golden goat mother plant

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,759
in the mom room. Once it gets too big,

101
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,518
once again, we take a bunch of clones,

102
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,759
pick the best one that becomes the new

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,920
mom. We keep that in preservation. How

104
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,639
do I do that? by keeping that plant

105
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,759
under. Um, most people will go 18 hours

106
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,839
on, six hours off. I do 19 hours on and

107
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,759
five hours off of light in my mother

108
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,599
room to keep my plants uh in a

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,439
vegetative stage. And I feed them

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,199
basically vegetative nutrients. That's

111
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,959
not what we're here for today, but

112
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
that's where all this starts. You get a

113
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,198
plant, you mother out that plant is what

114
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,799
the phrase is. When you're taking cuts

115
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,759
from it, that plant just became the

116
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,360
mother. Your clone is now uh that is the

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,199
that's the clone donor. That's the

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,800
mother or the clone donor. You're now

119
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,840
taking clones. That becomes your new

120
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,960
clone. Um then one that is your mother

121
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,478
plant. That's how that works. I think

122
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,359
I've covered the mother plant start of

123
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,839
this. Now my next note here is emphasize

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,759
the importance of healthy pestfree

125
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,758
mother or donor plants. You know what a

126
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,280
clone is. Let's talk about that mother

127
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,199
plant or the donor plant. That's the

128
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,959
plant where the clone is coming from.

129
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,280
The plant that is going to give you that

130
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,478
cut. So that's your mother plant. That

131
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:09,679
plant needs to be stress free, pest

132
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,599
free, powdery mildew free. The more

133
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,478
healthy that clone is or that mother

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,879
plant is, that donor plant, the more uh

135
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,360
optimal success you have, the chance for

136
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,959
success you have for your clone. So, the

137
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,199
more healthy your mother plant is, the

138
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,279
more chance you have for success for

139
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,280
your clone. Um, people are going to talk

140
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,599
about genetic drift. I've done a full

141
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,279
episode on genetic drift. Uh, genetic

142
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,680
drift is not a real thing when it comes

143
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,758
to cloning. So, uh, that is not a

144
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,759
possibility. That's not going to happen.

145
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,000
You can, however, transfer diseases,

146
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,759
pathogens, problems like that. But

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,079
genetic drift does not happen at

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,479
cloning. Um, I've done a full episode.

149
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,800
Um, do some research on that really

150
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,639
quickly. When you read the definition of

151
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,478
genetic drift, you'll see that it cannot

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,120
happen when we are cloning. It's a

153
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,519
different process. So, um, healthy happy

154
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,519
mother plants. A clone is a genetic copy

155
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,359
of that original happy healthy mother

156
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,599
plant. Now, we've got all the basics out

157
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,319
of the way. Uh, let's jump into actually

158
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,879
how to do this. Now, this SOP is posted

159
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,479
on my Discord server. I have a Discord

160
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,800
server. There will be a link in the show

161
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,318
notes and in the video description. If

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,240
you would like to see this typed out,

163
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
mostly typed out the way that I read it.

164
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,879
I did modify it to make it readable for

165
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,120
a podcast. This is in a very uh rough

166
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,600
draft form on my Discord server. If you

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,918
join the Discord server, um, some people

168
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,520
say it's messy. I get it. Uh, all the

169
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,478
stuff on your far left are the servers

170
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,079
you're a member of. Then click on the IE

171
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,240
army server. It'll take you to my

172
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,639
server. Then all the tabs on your left

173
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,519
are just different tabs and categories

174
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,400
in my server. One of those tabs will say

175
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,038
clone care SOP. Click on there. Guess

176
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,719
what that is? Clone Care SOP. Bro,

177
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,800
congrats. You have found it. It will be

178
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,240
there in text form. You can print it.

179
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,240
You can save it to your phone. You can

180
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
do whatever you want with it. uh that is

181
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,639
there for free to share with the public

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,960
because I want you to have great success

183
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,360
in your clone game. Uh I've got good

184
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,918
skills uh good success in my clone game,

185
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,759
good uh good success rate with this SOP

186
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,198
and I want to share it with you. Uh so

187
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,720
come to the Discord server if you need

188
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,120
this printed, if you need another form

189
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,039
of this, it is there for free. Discord

190
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,720
doesn't cost you anything. Uh the

191
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,639
membership doesn't cost anything to join

192
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,720
my server is free to come hang out in

193
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,360
the smoker's lounge is free to get this

194
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,639
uh SOP completely free. free freedom.

195
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,080
So, uh, that SOP is on Discord. Now, we

196
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,519
got something in my mouth now. I know

197
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,318
I've been rambling for a minute. It is

198
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,680
time to talk about the SOP. Here's where

199
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,199
we're going to start. Healthy mother

200
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,959
plants. Then, we need clean equipment.

201
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,639
Um, I recommend just brand new scissors.

202
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,000
If you can get a pair of new scissors,

203
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
get those. If you can get a couple of

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,079
pairs of scissors, get those. A lot of

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,399
people are worried about hop latent

206
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,800
vyroid at this point. So maybe clean

207
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,478
your scissors between every single plant

208
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,160
if you're doing multiple plants. If

209
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,399
you're doing an OG cush and a blue dream

210
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,120
and a purple haze, clean the scissors

211
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:04,159
with bleach between every one or use new

212
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,079
scissors between each cut. So sterilized

213
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,000
equipment, sterilize your table,

214
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,839
sterilize um so we're going to talk

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,360
about the easy cloner first. So

216
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,079
sterilize the table, sterilize your

217
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,240
scissors, then we're going to talk about

218
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,878
the easy cloner here. Oh, uh, the easy

219
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,720
cloner. This is like a turbo cloner, an

220
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,879
easy cloner. I don't care which brand.

221
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,479
This is all going to work. Uh, basically

222
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,720
the same for whatever brand you were

223
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,120
using. I'm not sponsored by any of these

224
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,039
companies involved in this podcast here.

225
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,399
Um, shout out to AC Infinity. That's the

226
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,838
only people that I have an advertising

227
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,679
deal with. Um, so, um, Easy Cloner,

228
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,519
Turbo Cloner, whichever one you prefer.

229
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,199
The plug-in machine that sprays water up

230
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,000
from the bottom. It uses the neoprene

231
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,920
collars. That's what this is about. So,

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
uh, sterilize everything. And if you,

233
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,319
uh, have already used this machine,

234
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,399
replace or sterilize the collars. We're

235
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,560
going to say that this machine is new. I

236
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,799
would recommend sterilizing everything

237
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,879
anyway. Clean it out. At least use hot

238
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,479
water. Run some hot water, maybe even

239
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,559
some bleach through this machine. We'll

240
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
talk about that more, but sterilize it.

241
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,079
Clean it up. Thin. Whatever you clean it

242
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,399
up with, get all of that out of there.

243
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,040
Now, we have a fresh clean machine. We

244
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,120
have fresh, clean neoprene collars. If

245
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,199
you're using the Permacone collars, you

246
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,360
can sterilize those. The other brands, I

247
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
do not recommend sterilizing. I

248
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,039
recommend replacing. So, so at this

249
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,879
point, we've got a clean machine and

250
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,480
clean collars. Um, you're going to need

251
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,600
to be able to plug this in. So, be

252
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,159
certain that wherever you're putting

253
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,000
this, you can plug it in. Uh, maybe plug

254
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,519
it into an extension cord, which I don't

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,278
recommend, but make sure you can get it

256
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,039
plugged in somewhere from where it is

257
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,159
sitting. So, what you're going to do,

258
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,480
you're going to get this thing sitting

259
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,799
on a level safe place. Depending on how

260
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,159
big it is, uh you may have to fill a lot

261
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,599
of water in here. So, make sure your

262
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:48,079
table is nice and sturdy. Uh now, fill

263
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,839
the clone machine, fill that reservoir.

264
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,240
Uh put the halo in there, the little

265
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,680
spray uh manifold with the sprayers on

266
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,879
there. Make sure those have been cleaned

267
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,039
as well. We're going to talk about that

268
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,360
more later, but put your little sprayer

269
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,599
inside of the reservoir. Fill that

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,120
reservoir up right below the halo,

271
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,639
right? Because we want a lot of water in

272
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,799
here. I want it to last as long as it

273
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,399
can. Also, that pump is going to heat up

274
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,759
the water. The more water that's in

275
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,360
there, it'll help it keep a little bit

276
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,000
cool. So, fill it up right to the bottom

277
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,200
of that halo. Then, we're going to put

278
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Clone X solution inside of the cloner.

279
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
Uh, the yellow stuff, not the purple

280
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
[ __ ] We're going to use the purple [ __ ]

281
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,639
later, but at this point, we're going to

282
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,440
use the yellow stuff, the big bottle of

283
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,278
clone solution, not the clone gel, the

284
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,959
clone solution. They're two different

285
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,480
products. So, we're going to put the

286
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:38,119
clone X clone solution into the cloner.

287
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:43,600
I want to EC this solution to an EC of

288
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:45,519
1.0 to 1.2. 1.0 to 1.2 is perfect. So,

289
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
you got water in the machine, right?

290
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,600
You've got your pH or your EC meter. You

291
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
got your EC meter. We're doing EC today.

292
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Got your EC meter already dipped into

293
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,679
there. Start pouring the Clone X

294
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,040
solution and give it a stir. Give it a

295
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,879
stir. Depending on the size of your

296
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,240
machine, how much water is in there,

297
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,919
you're going to need more, right? That's

298
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,320
why I'm telling you go to an EC instead

299
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,639
of how many milliliters. Uh, pour it,

300
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,040
give it a stir. Pour it, give it a stir.

301
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,159
Once you're at about 08.9, really start

302
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:15,599
pouring super light. Get that to 1.0 to

303
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,958
1.2 EC of the yellow Clone X solution.

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
Give it a good stir. Make sure it's

305
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,518
accurate. Put the top on there. Plug it

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,078
in. Plugging it in is going to make it

307
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,679
[ __ ] stir real hard. Unplug it. Put

308
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,239
your uh meter back in there. See what

309
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,000
your EC is. Uh, if it's too high, you

310
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,120
can add water. Hopefully, it didn't go

311
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,200
too high. That's going to be a pain in

312
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,679
the ass. If it's too low, probably too

313
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,278
low, add a little bit more solution. So,

314
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,319
we filled it up. Now, we put some

315
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,720
solution in there. Now, uh, pH that

316
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,040
cloner. Uh, we're going to use pH up or

317
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,800
pH down. Probably pH down at this point

318
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:52,879
in most cases. Uh, pH that to 5.7 to

319
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:54,799
6.2. Um, it's frustrating pHing these

320
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,799
cloners if you're new at this because

321
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,639
when you get really close, you'll think,

322
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,479
I need one more drop. and you'll put one

323
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,240
more drop in there and it's going to

324
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,839
throw it way the [ __ ] off. Quick

325
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,399
sidetrack because I'm good at sidet

326
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,519
tracks and rambles. The pH scale doesn't

327
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,278
work where one is one and two is two and

328
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,360
three is three. It does not work that

329
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,039
way. I do not recall the name of the

330
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,360
scale because I did not do research of

331
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,958
this. But this is how the pH scale

332
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:24,639
works. Just follow me here. One on the

333
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:28,759
pH scale is one.

334
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Two on the pH scale is basically

335
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:36,159
20. Three on the pH scale is 300. So it

336
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,399
doesn't go up just by one. It goes up

337
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,519
incrementally by a digit. You move your

338
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,958
decimal. You add a zero every time. So

339
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,399
somebody with more of an organic

340
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,078
chemistry degree, somebody that

341
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,839
understands that better, go ahead and

342
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,759
type how that works exactly in the

343
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,720
comments. Correct me if I'm saying that

344
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,879
uh incorrectly. But so your pH is very

345
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,959
that's why it that's why it flies so

346
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,879
much when you get closer to your target.

347
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,119
Uh if you've gone up or down because

348
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,278
it's adjusting incrementally when you

349
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
add that one more drop. Now that one

350
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,039
more drop is kind of turned into 10

351
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,720
drops once you've gone far enough up the

352
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:13,120
scale. So here we are back at P ph pH

353
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,959
adjust your cloning sol after you have

354
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,799
add your nutrients after the clone

355
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:21,039
solution is in there. Now we're going to

356
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:23,519
pH this solution to 5.7 to 6.2. too.

357
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:27,278
Now, the next move is to add a product

358
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,000
called Clear Res. Clear Res is a product

359
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,639
that will prevent algae buildup and funk

360
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,159
buildup inside of this cloner. Also, it

361
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,440
will help the bottoms of these clones

362
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,120
that we're going to be they're going to

363
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,360
be exposed and hanging down into the

364
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,879
water. Clear res will stop them and

365
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,720
prevent them from getting mushy and

366
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,200
moldy and funky. It'll help prevent that

367
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,519
as well. So, it'll prevent uh bacteria

368
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,959
and algae growth inside your cloner on

369
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,200
the outer edge of your cloner where the

370
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,039
water splashes out. It'll also prevent

371
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,200
those plants from getting mushy and

372
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,879
stale and rotted. So, we're going to put

373
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,480
um uh clear res inside of there. Um I

374
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,799
wrote 30 ms per five gallons of water.

375
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,320
Most of these clone machines hold 5, 10,

376
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,958
15. They've kind of designed it that

377
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,360
way. So, every five gallons of water,

378
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,919
you want to apply 30 milliliters of

379
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,159
clear res to your cloner. Now, here is

380
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,240
something important. Date this. Write

381
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,399
down the date. Whatever the date is,

382
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,480
write down today's date and then put

383
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,078
that you put clear res in there. And

384
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,600
then put how much just to remind

385
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,599
yourself so when you come back, you know

386
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,240
how much goes in there. The reason we're

387
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,120
going to do this is because we need to

388
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,799
reapply the clear res every 5 days. So,

389
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,399
that means every 5 days. We're going to

390
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,719
check on this cloner every day, but

391
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,519
every fifth day, we need to pop it open

392
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,000
and put more clear res in there because

393
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,600
this product does need to be reapplied.

394
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,679
So, now at this point, we've got our

395
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,920
clear res in there. We have got our pH

396
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:54,599
solution in there. We've got an EC of

397
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:58,000
1.0 to 1.2. We've got a pH of 5.7 to

398
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,639
6.2. And we've also added our clear res

399
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,320
at 30 milliliters per five gallons of

400
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,240
water. Now, that's what we're going to

401
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,920
put in there. And the machine is now

402
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,320
ready to put the top on with the

403
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,719
neoprene in there and plug it in and let

404
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,920
that bad dog start running. Let it run

405
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,519
for a couple of minutes. Let it

406
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,599
circulate. Let everything get cycled

407
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,720
around. You might want to check the EC

408
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,320
and the pH one more time if you've got

409
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,399
OCD. Don't worry, we're going to adjust

410
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,199
this and correct it tomorrow. So, you

411
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,720
have another opportunity to check this.

412
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,639
Everything is cycling. Everything's

413
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,079
running around. It's spraying. It's

414
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,240
going. It's making that noise. It's

415
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,399
whooing. Everything sounds good. Now,

416
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,560
what we're going to do is pop out a few

417
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,559
random neoprene, especially in the

418
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,119
corners. Take out a few of those clone

419
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,958
collars. Pop them out. I take my dry

420
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,480
finger and put it down in that hole

421
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,638
where the clone is going to go. Put it

422
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,920
down. I've got kind of long fingers. Uh,

423
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,159
put it down at least one or two

424
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,759
knuckles. And then take your finger out.

425
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,000
Is your We're doing an oil check

426
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,159
basically. Are those sprayers wetting

427
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,480
your finger at all locations within

428
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,319
within that cloner? Especially the

429
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,600
corners. The corners always seem to get

430
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,720
[ __ ] Make sure that you're getting

431
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,560
spray to the corner. So, uh, do an oil

432
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,399
check. Basically, pop out a neoprene,

433
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,239
put your finger in there. Uh, dry your

434
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,679
finger off, try another one, and just

435
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,000
make sure that all sections are getting

436
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,078
sprayed properly. We want all of these

437
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,240
clones to get sprayed so we have a 100%

438
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,838
success rate. When one clone starts

439
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
dying in there, it gets mushy. It gets

440
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,680
funky, and it starts to [ __ ] up the

441
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,680
entire process. So, we want them all to

442
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,359
be healthy inside of there. So, we got

443
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,198
it spraying. Everything is running. Let

444
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,120
me read my notes and catch up. Now, in

445
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,958
the SOP that you'll find on Discord, it

446
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,320
does say to lift up the lid of the

447
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,919
cloner. It actually says, let me find

448
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,240
the note. Open up the cloner with the

449
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,639
pump on to make sure it's spraying water

450
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,720
everywhere and getting good coverage. Uh

451
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,320
that word spraying everywhere is the key

452
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
word in that sentence. Make sure it's

453
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,079
spraying everywhere inside of that

454
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,919
cloner. But also, when you do this, it

455
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,919
is going to spray everywhere. You are

456
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,360
going to get your shirt wet. Don't wear

457
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,039
your favorite shirt. Don't wear your

458
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,879
favorite Jordans or your favorite Dunks

459
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,719
when you do this because you're going to

460
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,320
get water everywhere when this happens

461
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,160
for a brief moment. Water is going to

462
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,160
spray out. It's just water. You'll be

463
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,439
okay. We can add more tomorrow. Uh there

464
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,600
is some solution in there that you'll

465
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,120
have to replace, but not a big deal.

466
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,719
Just some water. Lift it up. Make sure

467
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,239
it's spraying. Try to peek in there.

468
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,919
Don't let it spray in your eyes and be a

469
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,240
goofball. If you want to skip this step,

470
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
that's okay. But it does say to do so in

471
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,078
the SOP because it's a good idea just to

472
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,519
lift it up and make it spraying. Uh make

473
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:22,879
sure it's spraying. uh you're going to

474
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,720
get water everywhere when you do it.

475
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,559
Just be prepared for that. Keep in mind

476
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,240
this SOP was written for a commercial

477
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,678
environment where uh if we get a little

478
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,279
water in the floor, we just mop it up.

479
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,038
We'll be just fine. If you're in a

480
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,558
carpeted area, if you're in your own

481
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,359
home grow space where you can't get it

482
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,839
wet, skip this step. Maybe I should make

483
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,918
that disclaimer. Uh this SOP works for

484
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,918
me. This SOP works in commercial

485
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,160
environments across the country. This

486
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,720
works in home grows across the country.

487
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,960
Uh it also uh some people modify this.

488
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,480
Modify it. Do what works for you. Not

489
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,079
everything is perfect for everybody. You

490
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,319
might not have the space, the room, the

491
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:59,038
environment, the time. Maybe you're

492
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,639
limited by physical capabilities. Um, do

493
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,160
what maybe you're limited by electrical

494
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,840
capabilities. Do what you could do to

495
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,279
the best of your ability. Modify and

496
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,759
adjust and adapt. That's what a good

497
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,359
grower would do. All right, I'm rambly

498
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,720
today. Shout out to whatever did that. I

499
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,319
don't even know what made me rambly.

500
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,120
Usually I know what I smoked and I don't

501
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,480
even remember. So, where are we? We're

502
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,918
uh checking it. We're making sure that

503
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,440
it's spraying. You've done the oil

504
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,799
check. You've stuck your finger in a few

505
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,558
places. Make sure it's spraying. We've

506
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,038
lifted up. Make sure it's spraying.

507
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,440
We're good. Now, now it's time for the

508
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,839
fun part. Now, it is time to fill this

509
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,759
easy cloner with your favorite clones.

510
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,279
That's right. One thing I'm not sure if

511
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,440
I put in the notes here that I want to

512
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,079
stress. If you're taking clones from

513
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,038
more than one plant, if you've got OG

514
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,159
Kush and Blue Dream or Golden Goat and

515
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,279
[ __ ] bubble goat in the

516
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,640
room, I would recommend a couple of

517
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,319
things. Let me get on a nice ramble

518
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
here. I would recommend first of all

519
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,159
take the one plant you're taking clones

520
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,159
from now and bring it to the cloning

521
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,279
area and put the others over there out

522
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,679
of reach so that you cannot [ __ ] this

523
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,839
up. This is important to me. Um you

524
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,600
could you could accidentally take six

525
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,519
clones of bubble goat and not clone your

526
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,439
golden goat and you're going to lose it.

527
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,960
This is very as a person that comes from

528
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,480
a commercial background where our

529
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,400
genetics are very important and proper

530
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,400
labeling of those genetics is just as

531
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,840
important. This part's very important to

532
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,120
me. So, I would say uh grab the plant.

533
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,720
If you got more than one, if you only

534
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,879
got one plant, disregard all this

535
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,640
nonsense. If you got two plants, grab

536
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,080
the one you want to clone and bring it

537
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,240
close. Take the other one and push it

538
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,119
far so you can't accidentally take a cut

539
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,279
off of that one. So, also, right before

540
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,959
you do this, label, get a bunch. So, I

541
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:39,038
use plant tags. There are little plastic

542
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,440
um plant tags that are probably three,

543
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,119
three and a half, three and 3/4 in long.

544
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,360
They're slim. They're got a pointy end

545
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:48,079
at one end and square at the other. Uh

546
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,599
just plastic basic garden plant tags. I

547
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,678
get those and before I even take the

548
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,359
cuts, I think how many I need. I need

549
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,759
three of these. I will label three of

550
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,399
them golden goat. And then I will take

551
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,798
my golden goat plant over here. I'll

552
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,400
take my three golden goat cuts. And then

553
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:03,839
okay, now this is where we're going to

554
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,519
get into the SOP a little bit, but I

555
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,079
want you to label these things very

556
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,839
carefully. Also, between plants, I

557
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,000
mentioned this earlier. If you have

558
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,399
enough scissors, swap scissors.

559
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,839
Completely swap scissors. Always wear

560
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,519
gloves when you're doing this. That

561
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,519
should have been in the [ __ ] SOP.

562
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,679
Wear gloves while you're doing this. But

563
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,839
also, if you can, between plants, swap

564
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,000
out gloves. Um, I don't want you to

565
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,158
spread any plant-born viruses on

566
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,159
accident. The moisture from the plants

567
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,400
is where uh that virus will be

568
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,720
transferred. So, uh, use the gloves like

569
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,120
a condom and use scissors like a toy and

570
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,798
make sure everything is cleaned. Um, if

571
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,558
you're going to use the same scissors,

572
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,158
swish them around in bleach. Not just

573
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,599
the blades. Do the whole [ __ ]

574
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,679
scissors in the bleach while you're

575
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,519
wearing a glove. Put that in there. And

576
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,679
then change your glove. Have fresh

577
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,200
gloves, fresh scissors, or new scissors

578
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,919
for every plant. I can't stress this

579
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,720
enough. Let's not spread plant viruses.

580
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,720
Uh, so, uh, we're being sanitary. We are

581
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,240
sterilizing our scissors. So, now we're

582
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,240
being extra careful to make sure to

583
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,480
label these plants correctly. We're also

584
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,960
being careful to not cross-contaminate

585
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,440
by cleaning our scissors. Now is the fun

586
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,200
part. Now is when you get to take these

587
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,798
cuts. Get your healthy mother plant.

588
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,480
Like it said, bring it to your cloning

589
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:18,720
area. Take your cuts. Um, I like nice,

590
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,720
healthy shoots. Usually on the top of

591
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,640
the plant, there's that one nice fat top

592
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,319
growing out. Most of the time, I'm going

593
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,840
to top that plant anyway. I don't want

594
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,000
that top growing because that's going to

595
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,000
grow right into my grow lights. I want

596
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,839
to take that out. When I take that out,

597
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,919
it actually makes all the lowers of the

598
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,000
plant fight for dominance. says, "Hey,

599
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,679
the plant says, hey, you took out the

600
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,440
big leader. You took out the head. We

601
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,440
can all have the opportunity to be the

602
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,880
head now. All those buds start, all

603
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,038
those branches start growing up and

604
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,400
trying to be the new dominant top." So,

605
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,319
I take that main top out. Um, let me get

606
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,320
back to the uh let me get back to the uh

607
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,079
the SOP here and we'll we'll catch all

608
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,759
of this up. So, I take that main top out

609
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,599
is what we're going to work with. It

610
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,079
says, "Fill the aeroc cloner with five

611
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,240
to seven inch cutings taken from the

612
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,918
mother plant." So, I'm taking that main

613
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,359
top. That's a five to seven inch

614
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,200
cutting. That's if you're watching on

615
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,519
the video, that's about how wide how far

616
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,360
my how tall my fingers are showing. So,

617
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,440
I'm going to clean most of that up. It's

618
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,038
going to have your top two leaves coming

619
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,798
off the top here. It's going to have a

620
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,400
little space. There'll be a little chute

621
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,558
with a leaf coming off of that right

622
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,240
there. I'll pluck that leaf off, but

623
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,399
leave the chute. Everything else off of

624
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,558
there will get cleaned off. The reason I

625
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,240
leave that chute is because that does

626
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,399
contain hormones that will encourage

627
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,000
this. That one extra chute does. because

628
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,080
that's where hormones will develop and

629
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
are stored. Uh, somebody else explained

630
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,319
that more. You chem guys, explain that.

631
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,599
You botney majors, explain that in the

632
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,119
comment section there. But that will

633
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,599
help with your rooting process. Sounds

634
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,439
wild, does help. Um, so then we're going

635
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,798
to clean that clone up. A lot of times I

636
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,200
will give them what I call the dirty

637
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,119
haircut. If the leaves are long and big

638
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,360
and huge and going to protrude and rest

639
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,038
on other plants, uh, I pull them up and

640
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,719
just give them a little trim. I don't

641
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,558
need all that leaf. I need enough for

642
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,720
that plant to live, but I don't need all

643
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,558
of that on there. So, I've got a 5 to

644
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,079
seven inch cutting. I've cleaned up most

645
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,119
of the bottom and I've given it the

646
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:09,119
dirty haircut. Um, it says now ensure

647
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,719
that each cut, well, there are details

648
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,599
we should [ __ ] hit here before that

649
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,038
part. Ensure that each cut has a 45°

650
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,839
angle. When I'm cutting these, I cut

651
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:20,798
them at a 45° angle. Then the next step

652
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,319
is split the end of each cut with a

653
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:23,679
razor blade. You can do this. I've

654
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,839
managed to do this with good sharp

655
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,080
scissors or a razor blade. So, we're

656
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,839
taking the cut. Um, let's just say that

657
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,119
the cutting is this way. This is my

658
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,199
cutting right here. Right. My finger is

659
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,359
now the cutting. And I want to split

660
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,200
that stock right up the middle. Just

661
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,359
very short. Did I say how far? I think

662
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,519
it should be an eighth of an inch. Uh

663
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,519
where is it? Yes. Uh ensure that you

664
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,440
split. No, I didn't even put how far.

665
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,359
Split the end of each cut with a razor

666
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,960
blade. Just about an eighth of an inch.

667
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,558
What I want to do is I want to split the

668
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,960
end of it just enough to where when that

669
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,558
easy cloner starts spraying it, it's

670
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,079
going to kind of open that up. it's

671
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,240
going to split it up and those two ends

672
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,399
will start to curl up and that is where

673
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,359
the roots are going to form from first.

674
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,038
So I cut it at a 45 and then I also cut

675
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,798
it right up the middle. Just a real

676
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,558
short snip up the middle just to

677
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,240
encourage that to spread apart and then

678
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,480
the roots will come out of right there.

679
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,798
As I am reading this SOP for the show, I

680
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,480
realize it is written in a uh it could

681
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,000
have been written in a different order,

682
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,599
but I'm going to present it in the

683
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,278
proper order and then I may go back and

684
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,359
correct it while I'm actually editing

685
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,640
this show. Uh, so the first thing you

686
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,399
want to do is you want to get the cut,

687
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,159
right? Get the cut from the plant. Then

688
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,919
you want to clean it up and leave uh

689
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,520
just that one little chute and the top

690
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,360
leaves. Then we're going to give it the

691
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,200
dirty haircut. Pull up those leaves.

692
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,199
Trim that excess leaf off. We got a

693
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,919
pretty good looking cut at this point.

694
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,278
Make that 45° angle at the bottom. Slip

695
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,278
it up the middle. That way you encourage

696
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,720
it to do a little bit of spreading. All

697
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,400
of that makes sense here according to

698
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,200
the SOP, but I could have written that

699
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,559
in a better order. Now, at this point,

700
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,798
uh, we are going to dip this clone in

701
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,440
our Clone X gel. This is where the

702
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,519
purple Clone X clone gel comes into

703
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,759
play. Uh, the way I like to do it, I

704
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,319
never dip into the bottle. I always pour

705
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,000
the purple solution into another vessel,

706
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,079
whether it's a paper plate, whether it's

707
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,759
a glass plate from the kitchen. What I

708
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,079
really like to do is I get a beer cup,

709
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,720
the same cup I use for my clones, uh,

710
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,480
and I will just cut it to where um, I

711
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,000
cut I don't even cut the bottom of it

712
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,519
off. if I cut the sides of it off to

713
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,519
where I just have enough I can lay onto

714
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,960
the table and pour the solution onto

715
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,119
there and use it like the little pallet

716
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,558
that the uh the artist uses for his

717
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,918
paint cuz it's not going to run

718
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,200
everywhere. It's pretty thick. If you

719
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,200
have it kind of level, it'll stay in

720
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,640
place. It will run if you angle it. But

721
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,960
I just make a little pallet, put some

722
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,360
clone X gel on there. Then I take the

723
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,519
end of the cutting and I dip that one

724
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,918
inch end of it, the new end we just cut,

725
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,079
I dip about an inch of it into the clone

726
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,400
X gel. So I'm just rubbing that onto

727
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,240
that whatever it's on. Get that purple

728
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,440
stuff on there. Hold it over that a

729
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,120
little bit. A lot of it's going to drip

730
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,240
off. Let it drip off. That's fine. Let

731
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,558
it drip right off. Then, um, I take that

732
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,319
clone collar, the Pac-Man, right? And I

733
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,319
open it up and I put the clone right in

734
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,079
the middle of the Pac-Man clone collar.

735
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,240
And then pop that right into the hole in

736
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,240
the clone machine. Then that little

737
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,319
plant tag, that plastic plant tag that

738
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,400
we took earlier, I put that right next

739
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,839
to it. It just fits right. Pac-Man bites

740
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,759
that and sets it right inside there.

741
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,839
When you're taking the clones, you will

742
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,319
know exactly what I mean when I say

743
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,918
Pac-Man bites the clone label. So, the

744
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,519
clone is right in the middle of Pac-Man

745
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,600
and then right at the edge. That's where

746
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,519
the clone label is in Pac-Man's mouth.

747
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,480
So, nice and simple. If you do it nice

748
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,240
and simply, basically, uh, fill up the

749
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,240
clone machine, get it set up with all

750
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,519
your products, get it to the right EC

751
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,120
and pH, then clip them, dip them, and

752
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,960
stick them. At this point, you can

753
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,278
basically repeat this process and fill

754
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,679
the clone machine and set it and forget

755
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,240
it until tomorrow. Now is a good time to

756
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,000
warn you. Sometimes these clones go into

757
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,599
what I call zombie mode. You're going to

758
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,038
take these cuts, you're going to do

759
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,719
everything correctly, and as you're

760
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:54,960
cutting them, by the time you get to the

761
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,038
end of the cloner, all those first cuts

762
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,480
are going to be dead, limp, falling

763
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,440
over. They're going to look like it's

764
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,798
[ __ ] toast. But just chill out. Let

765
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,400
them do their thing. When you come back

766
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,558
tomorrow, there's a good chance,

767
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,000
probably 90% chance, if the mother plant

768
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,639
was healthy. And if you did this all

769
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,640
correctly, uh those plants will rise

770
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,640
from the dead and they will look good.

771
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,559
Um it's a not a good idea to let these

772
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,559
cuts sit for a long time after the cut

773
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,480
is taken from the plant. Don't let it

774
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,240
sit. Get it into water or get it into

775
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,079
this clone machine pretty quickly

776
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,440
because we want to prevent an embolism.

777
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,439
I don't want to make you paranoid and

778
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,278
make you stressed over it, but a lot of

779
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,519
times that is what is going to kill your

780
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,519
plants. too much oxygen gets into that

781
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,278
plant, it [ __ ] up the uh the what's it

782
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,440
called? The capillary action inside that

783
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,200
plant and it will simply kill the plant.

784
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,120
If you get it into a cup of water and

785
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,319
stop the oxygen from getting in there,

786
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,000
you're cool. If you get it into the

787
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,319
clone machine and get water spraying on

788
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,319
there, you're cool. So, get it into that

789
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,158
machine as quickly as possible. But if

790
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,319
they do tip over, if they go into zombie

791
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,720
mode, don't stress out. Don't worry.

792
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,960
Usually within 24, maybe less hours,

793
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,319
they'll start perking back up. Um, one

794
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,960
thing that I did not mention in this

795
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,439
SOP, this is not listed in here that I

796
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,759
see that um, my bad, I [ __ ] up

797
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,519
lighting. These just need to be under

798
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,200
um, minimal lighting. We don't want

799
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,359
super intense lighting because that is

800
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,120
going to cook these little clones. Also,

801
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,798
less lighting is better. That will

802
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,639
encourage the root growth. Too much

803
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,398
lighting. Too intense lighting will make

804
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,480
the plants want to grow. There's no

805
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,558
roots to support that growth. So, like a

806
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,919
little T5 light, if you just got a T5

807
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:25,839
light, that would be perfect. If you

808
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,159
have an LED light, turn it down real low

809
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,398
or keep it up real high. One of the two.

810
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,799
That'll be great for you. AC Infinity

811
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,319
does offer a wonderful clone lamp. Uh

812
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,240
that's definitely what I would recommend

813
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,839
because of course, use coupon code IE

814
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,440
Army to save 10%. Uh but um just a

815
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,839
little bit of light is great for clones.

816
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,480
And I recommend keeping it on 24 hours

817
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,079
if you can. Also, environment matters.

818
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,839
When you using the clone machine, you

819
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,158
can keep these machines in your regular

820
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:55,359
veg room. They want the same VPD

821
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,679
essentially as your uh veg environment,

822
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,278
as your small veg environment. Uh a

823
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,278
little bit of humidity is good for these

824
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,759
plants, but we don't need to keep them

825
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,679
as humid as we do the plants in the dome

826
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,200
because these plants uh aren't as

827
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,960
reliant on the humidity. They're getting

828
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,960
a lot of moisture from the bottom, which

829
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,399
will sustain them and keep them alive.

830
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,399
So, the basic humidity that you're

831
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,479
running in your veg room should be fine

832
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,158
for these plants. uh don't put too much

833
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,480
wind on them, but maybe a little bit of

834
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,039
fan across the room just circulating the

835
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,759
air would be a good idea. So, I did not

836
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,599
mention lights. I did not mention uh VPD

837
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,200
and the SOP. Maybe I do need to add

838
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,439
that. I can think about that as I'm

839
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,840
editing. Now, I did say the plants are

840
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,919
good for uh until tomorrow. I said they

841
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,480
may go into zombie mode. Don't freak

842
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,240
out. Um go smoke a joint, go take some

843
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,759
dabs, go walk the dog, and let these

844
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,919
plants do their thing for a little

845
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,359
while. Um and just ignore them. Don't

846
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,759
freak out. Do make sure that everything

847
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,119
is spraying occasionally. Uh but don't

848
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,640
freak out too much if the plants have

849
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,359
gone into zombie mode. Now, here's what

850
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,640
we got to do. In 24 hours, come back,

851
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,918
see what the plants look like. If

852
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,080
they've all tipped over and [ __ ]

853
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,520
died, my bad. We got to try again. Uh if

854
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,278
they're starting to perk up, which they

855
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,679
should by now, you're doing everything

856
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:06,079
correctly. What we need to do, unplug it

857
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,320
so the water quits spraying. Lift up the

858
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:11,278
top very carefully. Now, I want to check

859
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:13,200
the EC and the pH of that solution. Once

860
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,679
again, it has been running for quite

861
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,519
some time. All of that purple clone gel

862
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,519
that we've dipped the plants into

863
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,519
basically got sprayed and hosed off by

864
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,839
the cloner and it is now all in our

865
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,079
water. So now the EC and the pH of that

866
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,839
water has drastically changed. It is

867
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:30,000
time to adjust that. Let's get it back

868
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:35,519
to the proper range. We want it in that

869
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,200
1.0 uh to 1.2 and that 5.7 to 6.2 range.

870
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,119
We want to adjust that. We want to do

871
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,120
that today. And then make a note that

872
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,519
you did that. I recommend you do this

873
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,439
every single day. I've got an app in my

874
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,278
phone. It just says cloner. And then I

875
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,120
go in there and I say today I did this

876
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,278
and today I did this and now I need to

877
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:54,079
add clear res. And I write it down. That

878
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:56,720
way if I come back later I go, did I

879
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,079
[ __ ] do this? Like I know I did cuz

880
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,159
it's right there on my phone. I know if

881
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,599
I did or didn't and I know what I did. I

882
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,440
know how the clones look. I make weird

883
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,038
notes in there. Uh make all the weird

884
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,640
notes you want. The more details the

885
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:10,720
better. Uh that's how you know what's

886
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,120
going on. So come back, adjust the EC,

887
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,640
adjust the pH, and check on the plants.

888
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,319
See how they look. Do they look good? If

889
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,080
they look good, you don't need to adjust

890
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,599
too much. Make sure everything is

891
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,359
spraying. You'll know because if they've

892
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,798
fallen over, it's probably or if they're

893
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,759
not falling over, that's probably

894
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:28,319
spraying. But um so now after this, we

895
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,319
want to do our daily check every day. We

896
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,720
just need to adjust that pH and that EC

897
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:34,079
that drastic first time uh because that

898
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,399
stuff has dripped off. But we're going

899
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,079
to want to check every day just in case.

900
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,158
Um, we've got a lot of bubbles happening

901
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,918
in here that is going to change our pH.

902
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,080
Uh, that water is going to evaporate.

903
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,240
That's going to change our EC and pH. We

904
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,319
got a lot of things going on. So, the

905
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,720
daily check that I recommend for this

906
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,038
cloner. Uh, make sure the pumps are on

907
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,240
and working. Um, if you're at a home

908
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,240
grow, if you're at a commercial grow,

909
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,079
when you walk into that grow, listen for

910
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,440
that hum, that where are those pumps? Is

911
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,000
that [ __ ] working? That's the first

912
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,519
thing I hear. If I walk into an my grow

913
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,960
and I don't hear that, it feels like

914
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,200
something's wrong. So, when the cloners

915
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,960
are being cleaned or not in service, uh,

916
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,880
it gives me an uneasy feeling. So, make

917
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,720
sure the pumps are on. Make sure the

918
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,399
water level is still just below the

919
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,480
halo. We don't want too much water to

920
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,558
evaporate, to run out. You'll burn out

921
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,720
the pump. Also, stick your finger in

922
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:23,278
there. How hot or cold is that water? If

923
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,679
it's extreme, we may need to do some

924
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,359
adjustments. If it's way too hot, ice is

925
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,360
the solution. You can freeze water

926
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,038
bottles. uh fill up a bunch of water

927
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,038
bottles, put them in your freezer, and

928
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,879
rotate them out throughout the day to

929
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:37,359
try to keep that water cold. If it's too

930
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,960
hot, if that water is too cold, um

931
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,359
that's weird because I like it nice and

932
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,038
cold. It's probably not. All right,

933
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,959
podcast world. Let me jump back in here.

934
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,798
I apologize. I did get interrupted by a

935
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,960
visit from Nico the dog. Big shout out

936
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,038
to my buddy Nico the dog. Uh cannot

937
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,120
refuse a visit from a sweet dog. He came

938
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,640
to say hi. Let me get back on track

939
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,639
here. We will edit that nice and

940
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,720
cleanly. We were talking about checking

941
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,080
on the cloner. I'm pretty sure we were

942
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,360
talking about the heat. The last thing I

943
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,119
talked about was putting your finger in

944
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:05,359
there, making sure that that water isn't

945
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,239
too hot or too cold. If it's too cold,

946
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,439
uh, it's going to freeze out your

947
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,000
clones. If it's too hot, they're going

948
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,840
to get moldy. Um, I would prefer cold

949
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,200
temperatures. Colder water is better. It

950
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,199
does prevent the mold, the mildew, and

951
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,600
the bacteria. That's where I think we

952
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,319
were. Uh, the next thing says to remove

953
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,319
a clone collar and check the spray. I

954
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,000
call this the oil check. uh pop out one

955
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:25,200
of the neoprene collars, put your finger

956
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,720
down in there, make sure your finger

957
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,159
gets wet. We just want to make sure

958
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,600
everything is getting sprayed,

959
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,840
everything is getting wet because if

960
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,519
not, then the clones will die. So, that

961
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,599
is our daily check. We are going to do

962
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,519
that every single day. Make sure the

963
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,359
pumps are on. Make sure the water level

964
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,200
are at the right level and we're not uh

965
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,199
[ __ ] burning out the pump. Make sure

966
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,278
that the water is not too hot or too

967
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,440
cold. Another thing to do, just check

968
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:48,960
and see if your uh if your water is

969
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,640
spraying out of the holes where the

970
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,278
tubing should go in. They leave you

971
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,278
little ports for your uh your power cord

972
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,798
and if you wanted to put a heater or an

973
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:58,480
air pump or something in there, they

974
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,000
leave you little ports, little tunnels.

975
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,679
Uh make sure you're not leaking through

976
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,319
those. What I do, this is a little pro

977
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,320
tip. This is a huge pro tip. I take one

978
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,239
of those uh plant tags, the plant tags

979
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,078
we talked about, I fold it in half and

980
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,678
it breaks and then I stick those in

981
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,440
front of the little tunnels so that no

982
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,720
none of the water can spray out. So,

983
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,280
we're making sure that none of the water

984
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,439
is spraying out. Also, just make sure

985
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,280
there's no algae, no mild, no funkiness

986
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,720
happening. If there is, we might want to

987
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,800
replace that water. We might want to

988
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,559
give it a little bit of scrub. Uh you

989
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,480
could take the top right off that clone

990
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,159
machine and set it down. And then you

991
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,000
can clean out that bottom part, refresh

992
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,398
the water if you need to put it right

993
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,679
back on top. You'll be ready to go. But

994
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:37,358
every day, we're going to go in, make

995
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,800
sure the pumps are on, make sure the

996
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:40,639
water level is appropriate, make sure

997
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,000
the heat is right, make sure no funk is

998
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,440
growing, and then you're going to give

999
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,960
it a little oil check. put your finger

1000
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,119
in there and see if your finger gets

1001
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,440
wet. Then every fifth day, every fifth

1002
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,679
day, um you could do this on the fifth

1003
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,039
day. Every fifth day, uh you can count

1004
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,119
that however you want. People are going

1005
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,159
to say on day five or does this count on

1006
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,400
the fifth day? As long as you're doing

1007
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,239
it about every fifth day on your fifth

1008
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,639
day schedule that's consistent, it will

1009
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,399
work. Here's what we're going to do.

1010
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,159
Every fifth day, we're also going to do

1011
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,838
the everyday check, right? Don't ignore

1012
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:14,159
that. But you're going to add um the

1013
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,078
clear res solution. Depending on the

1014
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:19,358
size of your cloner, you're going to add

1015
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,119
more of that solution. Um it says, so

1016
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,440
I'm using a large easy cloner. I wrote

1017
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,358
down 150 mls depending on the size of

1018
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,599
the cloner. Uh use the appropriate

1019
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,920
amount. It's 30 milliliters per 5

1020
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,960
gallons. I should edit this right here.

1021
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,039
Uh but update the amount of clear res.

1022
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,119
Uh date the cloner once again so that we

1023
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,559
know when you did that. I said to write

1024
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,358
down the date when you put the I write

1025
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,519
it down uh Monday the 1st and I stick

1026
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,358
that sticker on there and then when it

1027
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,559
when I refresh it, I write the new date

1028
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:48,480
on there. If you don't want to put a

1029
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,000
sticker on your cloner, do it in your

1030
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,920
phone. Write down the date that you put

1031
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,480
that clear res in there so that you know

1032
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,559
to do it every fifth day. Uh check the

1033
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,079
water level. Make sure it's optimum. Do

1034
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,679
the other checks. Make sure it's not too

1035
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,480
hot, not too cold. Make sure there's no

1036
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,399
mildew growing. Um then recheck the EC

1037
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,079
and the pH of this clone machine. I

1038
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,599
would recommend doing that uh almost

1039
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,000
every day if you've got time, but we

1040
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,760
definitely want to do it on day five. Uh

1041
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,079
make sure that that EC and pH are

1042
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,599
proper. We want to be uh the EC once

1043
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,960
again 1.0 to 1.2 and the pH we want that

1044
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,559
at 5.8 to

1045
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,280
6.0. You guys, this is basically what

1046
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:28,559
we've got to repeat. Um through about a

1047
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,240
14, maybe a 15-day process. If your

1048
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,159
environment is not right, if your mother

1049
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,279
plants are not super healthy, maybe a

1050
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,118
20-day process, but within, I want to

1051
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,599
say 12 to 14 days, you should have

1052
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,000
plants with nice, healthy, robust roots.

1053
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,519
Uh, I'll post a picture of a plant on my

1054
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,358
Instagram. Go to the Grow From Your

1055
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,519
Heart podcast Instagram page and check

1056
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,358
out that plant that came from an easy

1057
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,519
cloner in just two weeks with crazy

1058
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,279
roots. You'll be blown away by that. So,

1059
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,519
this is basically what we've got to do.

1060
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,720
This is how I make clones for a

1061
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:00,960
commercial environment with about 99%

1062
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,039
success rate. Usually the 1% failure is

1063
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,039
because something clogs up or something

1064
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,800
just went wrong and I can't be perfect.

1065
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:10,800
But uh 99% success rate with this SOP.

1066
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,160
Honestly, I have sold this SOP to other

1067
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,240
commercial environments or other

1068
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,000
commercial processors for a lot of

1069
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,598
money. It is time to stop selling and

1070
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,920
gatekeeping. I wanted to give it to you

1071
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,880
for free. That is how to clone with an

1072
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,559
easy cloner. Um, uh, I think that

1073
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,920
basically does it. Now, I'm going to hit

1074
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,599
pause real quick. I'm going to take a

1075
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,519
drink and then we'll come back and we'll

1076
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,838
talk about how to do this, uh, in a

1077
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:33,838
clone dome environment. All right,

1078
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,159
podcast world. I am back and I am

1079
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,239
hydrated. Before we go too far, let me

1080
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:39,679
teach you how to clean this clone

1081
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,679
machine. Let's just say you got all the

1082
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,838
way through the process. You have potted

1083
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:46,480
the clones. Uh, part of that is in the

1084
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,159
SOP. Potting the clones is in the SOP.

1085
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,079
But, uh, let's just say you made it this

1086
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,319
far. Now, we need to talk about uh

1087
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,839
cleaning this clone machine. After

1088
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,039
everything is transplanted and the clone

1089
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:59,679
machine is empty, apply some bleach to

1090
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,599
the machine. The SOP says three cups of

1091
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,598
bleach. That is for a large clone

1092
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,359
machine. Reduce that if you're using

1093
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,760
your personal cloner at home. Don't put

1094
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,838
three cups in a [ __ ] 30 sight cloner.

1095
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,079
Uh maybe put a half a cup or a cup of

1096
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:13,679
bleach in there. Let that run. Turn it

1097
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,960
on. Let it run. That's going to run that

1098
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,919
bleach through all your pumps. It's

1099
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,599
going to spray the bottoms of the

1100
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,599
neoprene. It's going to bleach

1101
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,680
everything. Tomorrow we need to dump out

1102
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,440
all that water and that bleach. Then we

1103
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,358
need to fill it up and rinse it out. Let

1104
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,440
it run for a little bit. Let all that

1105
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,920
stuff cycle. Dump it out again. Then I

1106
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,838
like to let it dry. Then I take apart

1107
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,320
the pump. I unscrew everything as far as

1108
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:36,078
I can and clean everything by hand with

1109
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,559
a little brush and with some tools. Take

1110
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,039
that pump apart. Oftent times that pump

1111
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,239
will get full of algae and funk. Let's

1112
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,639
clean that out of there. Make sure

1113
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,639
that's nice and clean. Um, then the

1114
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,000
emitters, those red emitters, those

1115
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,519
things are a pain in the ass. I

1116
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,280
recommend buying another bag of them

1117
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,960
right now. Just go to Amazon and order

1118
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,800
another bag of those emitters for your

1119
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,000
clone machine right now. I don't know if

1120
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,760
the mic just [ __ ] up or the

1121
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,519
headphones. It looks good on the

1122
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,200
recording. We're good. Sorry, technical

1123
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,358
difficulties. Go get more of those

1124
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,598
emitters. Um, if you don't have more,

1125
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,279
clean those out with a paper clip or a

1126
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,559
toothpick. You got to go up and clean

1127
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,560
them from the bottom and then from the

1128
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,759
side and clean them out. Uh, it sucks

1129
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,279
trying to put them in. and it sucks

1130
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,599
trying to take them out. When they

1131
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,200
break, the way that I pull them out is I

1132
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,200
take a pair of scissors and I open up

1133
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,879
the scissor and I use one piece of the

1134
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,480
scissor and I go right into the hole

1135
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,079
deep enough to kind of just stab it and

1136
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,760
then turn the scissor. That should be

1137
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,519
enough to unscrew it for you. Just a

1138
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,440
little pro tip right there because

1139
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,679
you're going to [ __ ] break one. Trust

1140
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,119
me, buy more right now. So, that's how I

1141
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,118
clean it. I fill it up with bleach. I

1142
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,720
let it run. I dump it out. I fill it up

1143
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,800
with clean water. Let it run again. I

1144
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,919
dump it out. Then, I let it dry. Then, I

1145
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,640
take the [ __ ] apart and clean

1146
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,079
everything. Then let it dry uh all the

1147
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:46,078
way dry. That means there's no bleach.

1148
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,320
There's no residuals left. Uh I paper

1149
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,400
clip the emitters out. Then if you're

1150
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,838
using um and I'm not sponsored by this

1151
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,280
company, but it's the only company I

1152
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,279
would recommend reusing the clone

1153
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,560
collars. They are called permacone.

1154
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,320
Their collars are made out of a

1155
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,639
different substance. I don't know what

1156
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,800
it is. Uh space age [ __ ] modern

1157
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,039
advanced technology. You can throw those

1158
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,599
in the microwave and sterilize those.

1159
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,358
The other brand are made of a porous uh

1160
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,440
surface that I would not recommend

1161
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,759
reusing. So, if you're using uh

1162
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,440
Permacone, clean those, sterilize them,

1163
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,359
reuse them. The other brand, throw them

1164
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,760
the [ __ ] away. Buy new ones, replace

1165
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:22,598
those, use all new clone collars, and

1166
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,640
try again. Uh, we should talk about the

1167
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:26,960
transplanting, but this is the clone

1168
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:29,118
episode, not the potting episode. So,

1169
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,119
the next part of the episode is to talk

1170
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,760
about clone care for using a rapid

1171
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,960
router and dome environment. Before we

1172
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,320
jump into the second half of the

1173
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,800
podcast, I do need to let you know that

1174
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,359
the second half of the podcast is worth

1175
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,320
double points. All right, now let's talk

1176
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:46,639
about cloning in a rapid router and dome

1177
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,720
environment. I keep saying rapid router

1178
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:52,159
and dome environment. What am I talking

1179
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:54,799
about? The alternative to using uh the

1180
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:57,279
clone machine method is to get a tray

1181
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,440
and that tray has an insert with usually

1182
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,000
50 little squares, little spots in that

1183
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,400
tray. Then uh sometimes it comes with

1184
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,159
your clone plugs or you buy a bag of

1185
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,119
clone plugs. There are several different

1186
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:12,078
brands here. I said rapid routers. There

1187
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,000
is also um what are they called? Root

1188
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,280
riots. There's several other different

1189
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,639
brands. They are a pressed product. I

1190
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,480
can't even think of what the pressed

1191
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,400
[ __ ] is. They're pressing something

1192
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,119
together to make a consistency of a

1193
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,519
product that is perfect for a clone to

1194
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,760
grow in. Um, it's the same size and

1195
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,920
shape as the tray insert, so it fits

1196
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,920
right in that little hole in your tray.

1197
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,920
Um, it's got a hole in the top of it.

1198
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,680
So, you basically put your uh your clone

1199
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,920
in that little tiny hole. So, that is

1200
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,480
what I mean by a rapid router. Uh, that

1201
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,720
is what I mean by a root riot. There are

1202
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,240
several brands. They're basically the

1203
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,759
same. There are very little difference.

1204
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,598
The biggest difference, honestly, is

1205
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,680
price. Uh, some of them charge a lot

1206
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,680
more than the others. Some of them come

1207
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,279
with nutrients inside of them already.

1208
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,440
Some do not. That doesn't matter to me

1209
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,760
because I rinse that out and put my own

1210
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,159
nutrients in

1211
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,079
there. This does sort of apply to

1212
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,920
Rockwool cubes except the method is

1213
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,400
different. Rockwool is more finicky and

1214
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,200
more picky. This is easier in my opinion

1215
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,039
with um Riot Router or Root Riot and

1216
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,279
Rapid Rooer brand products. There's

1217
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,279
others that are very similar. Follow

1218
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,560
along, adjust and adapt as necessary,

1219
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,720
but here we go. Um so also this goes in

1220
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,318
a tray with the insert. Then you put the

1221
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,078
plugs in there. You put the clones in

1222
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:27,838
and then it goes with the dome over it.

1223
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,039
And the dome is the pain in the ass part

1224
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,960
of this process in my opinion, but this

1225
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,039
does work. I see a lot of great success.

1226
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,280
I have success with this method. I just

1227
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,400
prefer the other method. So, I'm

1228
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,000
rambling. I'm talking. This is going to

1229
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,720
be a long [ __ ] episode. Uh,

1230
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,880
patreon.com/grow fromyouhe heart. But

1231
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,719
here we go. Uh, double points for the

1232
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,280
second half of this episode. How to make

1233
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:51,358
clones in a clone dome rapid router

1234
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,000
environment. The first thing I do, I get

1235
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,719
a container. Usually I'm doing 50 clones

1236
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,639
at a time because the tray holds 50. Um

1237
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,480
it's and it's easier to do all 50

1238
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,239
because that helps regulate the humidity

1239
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,679
and the dome. You don't have to do all

1240
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,159
50. Do the amount you're going to do.

1241
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,559
But what I do, I soak the rapid routers

1242
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:12,000
in a weak but pH balanced nutrient

1243
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:14,318
solution before plugging them. So that's

1244
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,400
a lot of words, but I take a container,

1245
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,719
usually a three or five gallon bucket,

1246
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,400
fill it up with water. I mix a solution.

1247
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,879
We'll talk about that solution next.

1248
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,200
Then I drop my rapid rooters right into

1249
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,358
that bucket. Then I take my hand and

1250
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:29,039
just mush them around. I'm trying to if

1251
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,719
there's already nutrients in there, I

1252
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:35,199
want to kind of wash it out and replace

1253
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:38,239
it with my new nutrient mix. Um in this

1254
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:40,000
um SOP that's written here, it says use

1255
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,559
three milliliters of a certain product,

1256
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,679
nine of another, five of another, two of

1257
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,199
another, and then pH it at

1258
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:51,519
6.1. That's a lot of products. It says

1259
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:53,838
or 3 g of veg bloom. And it's got other

1260
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,960
stuff here. I think it would be just as

1261
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:59,119
easy to use the yellow clone solution

1262
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,280
for this process. That should be on this

1263
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,760
SOP as well. Maybe while I'm editing the

1264
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,519
podcast, I will update and edit the SOP.

1265
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,920
But that yellow clone X solution would

1266
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,440
work just right for this as well. Uh

1267
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,119
this does need to be updated a little

1268
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,679
bit and I've said that a couple times.

1269
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,720
But so I'm soaking my rapid routers in a

1270
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:18,159
solution, just a light solution. Then

1271
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,078
I'm going to put all those rapid

1272
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:22,078
routters in the tray into those little

1273
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,680
the trays got 50 little spots. This

1274
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,440
should make sense to you with the whole

1275
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,598
side pointing up because I need to put

1276
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,639
my clone in that hole. I don't like to

1277
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,720
take clones if I see pest problems, but

1278
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,400
uh in this part of the SOP, I did

1279
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,639
include that if there are pest problems,

1280
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,240
you could apply this to the uh the easy

1281
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,879
cloner part as well, but if there are

1282
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:43,679
problems, I will do a dunk. I will dunk

1283
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,240
my cutings in a pesticide solution

1284
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:50,000
before uh putting them into my machine

1285
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:53,279
or into my dome. In this SOP, um let me

1286
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,039
see if I did include my pesticide mix.

1287
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,119
Um if pest problems are apparent in the

1288
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:00,079
mother area, dunk cutings before taking

1289
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,400
them in a weak oil-based mix. Use 25

1290
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,318
milliliters of Smite. Smite was a

1291
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,240
product I was using when I wrote this.

1292
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,199
Um Smite is still a good product that

1293
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,639
would work. or 10 milliliters of

1294
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,719
evergreen, which is what I would

1295
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:15,118
probably recommend. Now, when you're

1296
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:18,159
doing this dunk, make sure that this

1297
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,400
product is super uh stirred up very

1298
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,879
well. Emulsified is the word I think I'm

1299
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,318
looking for. Keep stirring it

1300
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,559
continuously. Have a stir stick and stir

1301
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:29,039
this container often. I don't want it to

1302
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,960
get thick in one spot or light in one

1303
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,400
spot of your solution. So, we're going

1304
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,280
to take our cuts. We're going to do a

1305
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,280
little dunk if we see any pest problems.

1306
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,800
After we do the dunk into the pesticide,

1307
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,040
we're going to do a dunk into clean

1308
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,720
water. I want to wash off the excess

1309
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,559
pesticide by putting it into clean

1310
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,000
water. The first dunk is going to get

1311
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:47,440
rid of your bugs. Hopefully, they come

1312
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,318
off when you're dunking it and rinsing

1313
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,480
it. The second one is to wash off uh

1314
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,719
that product. It says here, after you

1315
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,800
dunk them, please redunk them into the

1316
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,118
plain water and shake them until almost

1317
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,880
dry. It's important not to leave much

1318
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,240
oil on the plants while they are

1319
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,318
rooting. This is for a couple of

1320
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,959
reasons. First off, it will suffocate

1321
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:09,358
the plant. Second off, uh it can cause a

1322
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,519
reaction with the grow lights. This pl

1323
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,440
this product could become uh toxic to

1324
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,000
the plant because of the growite. Now,

1325
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,358
let me get back on track. Now is when

1326
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,358
we're going to cut the clones. I talked

1327
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,199
earlier about cutting cuts. It says

1328
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:24,239
here, "Cut your clones from the

1329
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:26,639
healthiest growth. Take a 5 to 8 in cut

1330
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:29,199
off of a mother plant at a 45 degree

1331
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:30,960
angle." We talked about that 45 earlier.

1332
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,639
Always use scissors cleaned with rubbing

1333
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,400
alcohol. Now, we're going to upgrade

1334
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,318
that to bleach because we've got hop

1335
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,318
late and vyroid in the industry, in the

1336
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:39,838
community. We don't have it here, but

1337
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:42,079
it's possible. So, we're going to clean

1338
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:44,078
things with bleach just to step this up.

1339
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,240
Uh, trim away the bottom nodes, leaving

1340
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,920
two to three at the top to let the clone

1341
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,399
establish itself the same way we did

1342
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,559
earlier. Uh, cup the leaves in your hand

1343
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,720
and give them that dirty haircut like I

1344
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,799
talked about earlier. Now, here's an

1345
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,159
addition. Instead of splitting it up the

1346
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,920
middle, we're going to do a little

1347
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,598
scrape on this plant. I'm going to grab

1348
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,440
the plant and just kind of scrape it a

1349
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,160
little bit. I want to take off the

1350
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,920
outside layer of skin. Uh just skin off

1351
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,598
the little piece of celery skin off the

1352
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,680
outside of this plant in one or two or

1353
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,160
three spots. And that will encourage

1354
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:17,118
root growth from that spot. So, scrape

1355
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,960
the edges of the 45°ree with a razor to

1356
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,200
expose more tissue to the rooting

1357
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,960
compound. Then place the end of the

1358
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,799
clone into the rooting compound just

1359
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,039
like we did in the previous part. Uh

1360
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,280
I've got my rooting gel on a vessel.

1361
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:31,440
Just going to rub that rub that clone

1362
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,440
right into that gel. Uh do about the

1363
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,280
bottom inch of it. And then let me make

1364
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,440
sure we're following the notes here.

1365
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,440
Place the cut place the end of the cut

1366
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,838
into the rooting hormone compound for a

1367
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,480
moment. Then stick the clone into the

1368
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,639
rapid rooter. Clip it, dip it, and stick

1369
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,639
it. It's that easy, boys and girls. The

1370
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:50,879
end should slightly penetrate the Pete

1371
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,480
plug to be secure, but not that's what

1372
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,119
it's made of. Pete, thank you for having

1373
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,039
notes. uh poke it through to be secure,

1374
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,680
but not all the way through the bottom

1375
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,679
of the plug. So, if that plug is an inch

1376
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,118
deep, go threequarters of an inch deep

1377
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,960
into there. Don't poke it out of the

1378
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,559
bottom. If it comes out of the bottom,

1379
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,559
you [ __ ] up. It's not going to work.

1380
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,000
You want it 3/4 of the way in there. You

1381
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,239
want it in far enough to keep the clone

1382
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,480
from toppling over, but not all the way

1383
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,759
through. That is important. Uh so, place

1384
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,240
the clone into the plug. The end should

1385
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,559
um the bottom should not pop out of the

1386
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:23,838
plug. Then here's where we're going to

1387
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,280
do things a little differently. We're

1388
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,920
going to get the dome, right? We've got

1389
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,319
a dome for this setup. Take that dome.

1390
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,800
We're going to spray the inside of the

1391
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:35,679
dome with water. And then we're going to

1392
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,760
put that dome over these clones. All of

1393
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,279
the vents on this dome are closed at

1394
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,359
this point. I don't want any open

1395
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:45,440
venting at all. So now we have uh put

1396
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,838
solution in our clone plugs. We put the

1397
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,519
clone plugs in the tray. We have clipped

1398
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:50,880
our clones. We've cleaned them up. We've

1399
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,358
taken off some of the bottoms, given

1400
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,280
them the dirty haircut. Cut it at a 45.

1401
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,920
Give it a couple of scrapes. Now, we've

1402
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,839
dipped it into our purple clone X gel.

1403
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,760
We have now popped it into the cloner.

1404
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:03,838
Not too deep, but deep enough, just how

1405
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,000
they like it. Then, we've taken the lid,

1406
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:07,440
the dome, and we have sprayed that. Now,

1407
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,838
we're going to place that on top of the

1408
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,679
clones and close all of the the vents

1409
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:14,159
and the openings. These clones are

1410
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,159
sealed inside of this dome. I like to

1411
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,519
use those uh fancy paper clips from

1412
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:19,759
Office Max. They're the kind you would

1413
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,759
bundle thick amounts of paper together.

1414
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,000
I use those to hold that dome in place

1415
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,160
so there's no chance of it coming off.

1416
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,480
Then we're going to put that dome under

1417
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,480
a little bit of light. Um, I like once

1418
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,400
again those T5 lights or a light

1419
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,079
fluorescent. If all you have is a big

1420
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,160
light, put it off in the periphery on

1421
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,318
the floor, uh, kind of far away from

1422
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:41,598
that light. I recommend this light be on

1423
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,960
for 24 hours and no dark period. Let me

1424
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,039
get back to the notes and make sure I'm

1425
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,800
paying attention. Spray the inside of

1426
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,440
the dome with water and put the clones

1427
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,280
under a lamp for four to 5 days. That's

1428
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,240
right. We're not going to touch this for

1429
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,880
four to 5 days. Uh wait until the plugs

1430
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:59,039
are barely getting dry to remmoisten.

1431
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,838
You'll see the plugs change from dark

1432
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,358
black to lighter brown. Soak the tray

1433
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:05,119
for a few minutes with your nutrient

1434
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:08,159
solution until the plugs are black.

1435
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:11,680
Again, always drain off all the nutrient

1436
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,799
solution to pre prevent root rot. Um so

1437
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:14,159
there are a couple of ways that you

1438
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,318
could do this. And here I'm going to

1439
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:18,719
update this as we go through this also.

1440
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,960
Um, so in about 4 days you're going to

1441
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,639
notice that the tops of the plugs are

1442
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,159
going back to that brown color. We need

1443
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,480
to get them black again. There are a

1444
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:29,118
couple of ways to do this. The SOP says

1445
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,280
to soak them. There are a couple ways.

1446
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,440
You can get a container, a cup if you

1447
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,960
will, and get your nutrient solution. We

1448
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,240
want to use the same nutrient solution

1449
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:41,280
we used last time. Uh, the easy cloner

1450
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:43,679
solution at 1.0 will be perfect. Mix

1451
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,319
some of that up. Put it into a cup. Pour

1452
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,318
that over these clone plugs. Just drip

1453
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,000
it all over each one of them. You're

1454
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:51,358
going to fill that bottom tray with a

1455
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,760
lot of water. It's going to be heavy and

1456
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:55,679
have excess water. Lift out the tray of

1457
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,760
plants and take that bottom tray and

1458
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:59,598
dump that extra water out of there. Then

1459
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,520
set that tray of plugs right back in

1460
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,318
there. We just need to get We want it

1461
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,000
wet and we want it uh saturated, but we

1462
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,239
won't want we don't want them sitting in

1463
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,920
soggy water uh to where it gets moldy.

1464
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,279
We do want it to start evaporating. But

1465
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,519
we do want to create a little bit of a

1466
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,720
dryback over time. So, we want to get it

1467
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,960
saturated but not uh sitting in water at

1468
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,639
the bottom. So, another way to do this

1469
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,720
when they're brand new, I would take a

1470
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,879
spray bottle and mix up the solution,

1471
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:26,399
put it in a spray bottle and spray the

1472
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,559
clone plugs because it's much more

1473
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,800
gentle and I have much more control of

1474
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,640
how much water is applied. Sometimes

1475
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,480
when I do that, I would not moisten

1476
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,400
enough. I would not get to the bottom of

1477
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,480
the plugs. So, make sure you're watering

1478
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,760
thoroughly. So, moisten those plugs.

1479
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,480
However you do it, make sure they're

1480
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,160
nicely moistened. Uh around day four or

1481
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,880
day five. Let me make sure we're getting

1482
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,799
back to the notes here. Um place the

1483
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,960
cuts. Place securely. Poke through the

1484
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,240
bottom. Four or five days. Wait till the

1485
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,318
plugs are barely getting dry to

1486
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,919
remmoisten. That's where we are now. Uh

1487
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,519
you'll see them change colors, boys and

1488
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,599
girls. You can pick them up and feel the

1489
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,199
weight, feel the moisture. If they feel

1490
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,880
wet and cold, then they are wet. If

1491
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,399
they're starting to get dry and brittle,

1492
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,800
you [ __ ] up. You need to water them.

1493
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,838
They need water already. If it's way too

1494
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,599
soggy, you can gently squeeze some of

1495
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:12,799
the water out. Be careful not to destroy

1496
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,760
any of the roots that have started

1497
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,440
develop hands. Get in there and gently

1498
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,920
squeeze the water out. If you're not a

1499
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,440
gentle dude like my friend Soda, don't

1500
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,880
do this. But a lot of you folks can

1501
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,000
squeeze the water right out of there if

1502
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,599
there's too much. So, get those plugs

1503
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,760
reaturated, put the dome back on there,

1504
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,960
and put them back under the lights. Now,

1505
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,440
the SOP says after 7 days, open the

1506
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,880
vents on the dome. So, maybe your dome's

1507
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,200
got a vent on the top. Maybe it's got

1508
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,358
some side vents. Let's open those. Maybe

1509
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:43,039
don't go all the way right away. Uh

1510
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:44,719
maybe for a minute, open it a quarter of

1511
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,318
the way. Come back an hour later, open

1512
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,399
it another quarter. Come back an hour

1513
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,079
later, do it a little more. Let's not

1514
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,000
shock them. One of the best things we

1515
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,839
can do with these clones is everything

1516
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,559
we do from now on, do it gradually and

1517
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,639
incrementally. And then, what's the

1518
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,839
word? Maybe exponentially, maybe might

1519
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,639
be the word here, because we're going to

1520
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:04,558
increase over time each time. So, um,

1521
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,118
after 7 days, open the vents on the

1522
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,599
dome. Not all at once, not extreme. Go

1523
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,680
slow with this.

1524
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:13,440
Then, beginning at day 12, if you're in

1525
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:15,919
a rush and you've got experience, you

1526
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,240
can start this at day 10. But beginning

1527
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,480
at day 12, uh, we're going to start

1528
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,639
hardening the clones off by removing the

1529
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,199
dome for short periods of time and

1530
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:27,199
increasing that period. So, for the

1531
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,439
first day, uh, when you go into the

1532
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,799
grow, just take that dome off and set a

1533
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,800
timer for 30 minutes. Set the timer.

1534
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,800
Maybe set it for 15 minutes and go check

1535
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,000
on them. If they look like [ __ ] after 15

1536
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,920
minutes, put the dome back on. This is

1537
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,239
adjustable. But set a timer, 15, 30

1538
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,960
minutes for the first day. After 30

1539
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:49,118
minutes, maybe 15, put the put the dome

1540
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,679
back on. Then tomorrow, we're going to

1541
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,599
do the same thing. 15 or 30 minutes.

1542
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,279
Then the next day, we're going to

1543
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,559
increase that. If you've been doing 15,

1544
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,880
we're going to do 30. If you've been

1545
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,519
doing 30, we're going to do 60. Uh we're

1546
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,680
going to do 60 for two to three days.

1547
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,920
Then we're going to do 90 minutes for a

1548
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,358
couple of days. Then we're going to do a

1549
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,880
couple of hours. And by now, these

1550
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:10,239
plants are getting used to being in the

1551
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,640
environment where you shouldn't have to

1552
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,719
recover them. Um see if you can get them

1553
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:17,118
open for five or six hours without any

1554
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:19,039
problems. If you can leave that dome off

1555
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,200
for five, six, maybe even eight hours

1556
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,358
and not see any trouble. Those plants

1557
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:25,279
are successfully rooted. Uh you'll be

1558
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:26,639
able to pick them up out of the tray and

1559
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,000
look at them. They should have roots

1560
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,480
growing out of them. They should be

1561
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,119
visible roots. It is time now to pot

1562
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,800
these clones into the mix of your

1563
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,000
choice. Let me check my uh my notes here

1564
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,400
and make sure we've got Yeah, it says

1565
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,960
here whenever clones uh whenever clones

1566
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,039
have rooted, plant into our cocoa mix,

1567
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,358
which I'm going to edit that as well. Uh

1568
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:48,079
but at this point, the clones are ready

1569
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:50,719
for planting. So, um I think I've gotten

1570
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,480
you all the way through it. Um, it's the

1571
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:54,799
same process for both things. Set up

1572
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,079
your medium or your product, whatever

1573
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,359
they're going to be in. Get that

1574
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,280
prepared. Prepare that first. EC and PH.

1575
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:03,279
Have a light prepared before you even do

1576
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,880
this. Then clip them, dip them, and

1577
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,880
stick them appropriately for your

1578
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,880
method. Um, if you're doing the clones

1579
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,559
in the easy cloner, clip them, dip them,

1580
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,480
stick them. Maintenance your machine

1581
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,240
every day, every other day, every 5

1582
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,159
days. You will be good. If you're doing

1583
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,159
the clone dome, clip them, dip them,

1584
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,759
stick them. go on vacation for three or

1585
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,519
four days and come back and then start

1586
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,520
[ __ ] with them and slowly acclimate

1587
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,079
them to your environment. Once they got

1588
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,759
the roots, it it'll be obvious either

1589
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,200
way. You can lift up that clone machine

1590
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,880
and look in there. You'll see roots,

1591
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:32,960
dude. You'll go roots, man. You'll have

1592
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,160
roots. Once you see the roots, it is

1593
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,920
time to pot them into our mix. Uh maybe

1594
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:40,078
that will be my next episode. Maybe I'll

1595
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,838
do some updates to this episode and I

1596
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,720
will record the episode about potting

1597
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:47,279
our clones into their first pair of

1598
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:49,358
