115
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,598
enough chatter here at the start of the

116
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,518
show let's jump into a few

117
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,878
patreon messages i've got a great

118
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
message here right in front of me this

119
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,239
one comes from our friend chris what's

120
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,680
up kris good to hear from you bro

121
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,080
i love picking on you making fun of your

122
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,400
name that's all in love and respect

123
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,040
this message goes just like this it's a

124
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,560
full moon so i just flipped to flower

125
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,400
i like that a lot of people follow the

126
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,799
full moon for their flowering cycles

127
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
i can respect that it goes on to say i

128
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,680
probably effed that up by taking

129
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
pictures just now

130
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
ah that's funny you turned it to 12 12

131
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,598
the lights went off and you realized i

132
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,598
should

133
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,119
take some pictures in the dark if it was

134
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,039
the first day that's not a big deal and

135
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,599
it says it was day one so no worries

136
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,840
there

137
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,438
it goes on to say the big one is a rise

138
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,120
the shorter one is morning dew

139
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,560
i probably need to make the canopy more

140
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,840
even for flower

141
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,439
flower picks in 63 to 70 days so he's

142
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,359
sent me some vegetative pictures i did

143
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,839

144
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,199

145
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,439
but we've got the important part of the

146
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,000
email and i look forward to seeing

147
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,120
uh flower picks in 63 to 70 days don't

148
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,720
wait 63

149
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,240
catch me around week six that's when the

150
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,560
photos start getting really good so

151
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,918
snap some photos then anyway there is a

152
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,439
lot to this it says thank you for the

153
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,198
reply i was just about to send you an

154
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,719
email with some questions here's the

155
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,199
great part of the message

156
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,240
it says with your new leds do you notice

157
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,319
it takes less

158
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,600
time to finish so i'm sure if you've

159
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,879
been paying attention to the show you

160
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,680
know that i've started growing

161
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,439
in some spaces with black sail canon

162
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,759
leds from black sail market

163
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,279
and i really do enjoy and appreciate the

164
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
results i am seeing

165
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,359
with my led lights the plants are

166
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
growing uh quite quickly

167
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
the stalks are a little bit thicker the

168
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
inner node spacing is a little bit

169
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,199
tighter

170
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,560
the plants seem overall just a little

171
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,680
bit healthier so

172
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,160
do i notice it takes less time to finish

173
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,038
yes i do notice that it could probably

174
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
uh come down

175
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,199
about three to five days sooner than

176
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,679
what i'm used to with the hps lights

177
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
they're

178
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,240
finishing up a little bit more quickly

179
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,918
just three to five days maybe a week at

180
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,759
the most i don't have enough

181
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,599
experience yet i don't have enough

182
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,759
completed crops to have a good

183
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
solid reliable report but yes it did

184
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,038
seem like they finished a little bit

185
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
earlier this time

186
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,240
then it goes on to say how far above the

187
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,519
canopy do you hang

188
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,918
your led lights um

189
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,599
unfortunately i ran out of space so i

190
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,599
started off at the recommended

191
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,639
uh black sail sends a recommendation

192
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
sheet in

193
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,519
the with the lights there's like a

194
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,720
little instruction sheet i think they

195
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,120
say to start off about

196
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
36 inches above the canopy to the best

197
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,560
of my memory

198
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,079
i started off as recommended i saw that

199
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,519
the plants were happy but i thought

200
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,079
maybe they could take a little bit more

201
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,318
light

202
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,519
so i lowered them then the plants were

203
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,120
growing like crazy

204
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,879
i put them into flour and that thing

205
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,800
that happens the plants got taller than

206
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,079
anticipated i didn't flower early enough

207
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,520
and they got real tall

208
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,120
i was worried that those plants were

209
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,318
going to get burned by that bright light

210
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,879
but they did not

211
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,400
they got about 10 to 14 inches somewhere

212
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,000
in that range depending on which plant

213
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,758
it was which phenotype it was

214
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
they got about 10 to 14 inches from

215
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,319
those leds and they did not cause

216
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,560
any problems there was no crinkling no

217
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,439
burning no leaf issues everything looked

218
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,519
okay so

219
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,199
uh 10 to 14 inches didn't seem to cause

220
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,959
a problem they were

221
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,560
they needed a lot of water at that rate

222
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,038
they were definitely drinking and eating

223
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,038
a lot

224
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,959
so 10 to 14 inches is as close as i

225
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,240
would go and the only reason i did that

226
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,879
is because i ran out of space i was

227
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
growing that

228
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,918
strawberry starburst in there the

229
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,039
strawberry fields in there and it got up

230
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,879
near the lights because it was just

231
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,519
growing too long got tall on me

232
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,800
i would prefer to stay probably about 18

233
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,560
inches away from that light

234
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,160
but i didn't see any problems when i got

235
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,560
10 to 14 other than

236
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,319
i needed more water so it says dimmed or

237
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,680
no i don't dim

238
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,039
i don't dim the lights i feel like i

239
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,160
paid for that light i want all the

240
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,439
wattage from it

241
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
maybe i could have dimmed it when they

242
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,918
were getting close but that's just not

243
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,120
my style

244
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,318
i paid for all that so um yes they did

245
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,959
finish faster

246
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,319
uh they did start to grow into the light

247
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,680
and no i did not dim it those are the

248
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,439
notes that i wrote down for you

249
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,598
so there is more it says should i feed

250
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,639
to week six and flush on the plants in

251
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,879
these pictures here's

252
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,478
where we get into another question these

253
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,319
plants were supposed to be in cocoa but

254
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,478
i used a hot organic mix and then

255
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,598
transplanted into cocoa

256
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:36,879
that's kind of where your plants are

257
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,319
getting a little bit confused they got

258
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,800
one rhizosphere right in the middle

259
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,720
that's

260
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,160
cocoa that's how that's soil and it's

261
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,440
holding a bunch of nutrients

262
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,439
and it's a hot mix and then on the

263
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,759
outside you've got cocoa so they're not

264
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,199
sure

265
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
what to do they're kind of confused it

266
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
said i feed them have strength nutrients

267
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,439
they tend to burn if i go heavier than

268
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,878
that at the moment

269
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,478
because you got two different root zones

270
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
and they're kind of confused it said

271
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,959
most likely the vpd

272
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,639
is too high if you think the vpd is too

273
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,000
high you're probably correct a lot of

274
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,918
people say it could be this

275
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
it's probably exactly what it is

276
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,519
currently it's open vented with 86

277
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,439
degrees and 63

278
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,878
humidity that's a little bit warm and

279
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,399
that's a lot of humidity in there so

280
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,280
yeah it says but i plan to close things

281
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,519
up and use

282
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,799
the ac and add co2 a couple of weeks

283
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,359
into flower that will definitely help

284
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
you out

285
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,439
but yes your vpd is off and i don't have

286
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,479
a picture of those plants to help you

287
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,959
out to tell you

288
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,560
uh what to do with them but it does

289
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,598
sound like yes your vpd is off you're

290
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,918
asking if you should

291
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,278
uh feed to week six and then flush the

292
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,679
plants

293
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,360
i don't have a picture to tell you but

294
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,519
if you think the vpd is off

295
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,240
give them a flush then get them on a

296
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,839
solid regular feeding just wash out that

297
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,839
cocoa soil mix it's only going to take

298
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,839
one rinse to get anything out of there

299
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,640
then mix up a solid feeding you need a

300
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,320
good a good npk a good calmac put some

301
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,799
enzymes in there put some microbes in

302
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,440
there

303
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,120
maybe a kelp product in there get a good

304
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,320
solid diet for those plants give them a

305
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,759
good solid meal

306
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,040
like they just got out of jail or the

307
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,799
hospital and you want to feed them up

308
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,240
real nice and get them healthy again

309
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,159
give them a rinse get all the crap out

310
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,759
of them mix up a solid feed

311
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,199
and then feed them and then let's pay

312
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,679
attention to what happens to them from

313
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,000
there

314
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,879
and also let's correct the vpd that vpd

315
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,799
is probably

316
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,159
uh making it not able to make the plants

317
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,838
not able to eat properly

318
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,360
so they can't get the proper nutrition

319
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,279
if you're even giving it to them

320
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,879
and they're confused by that double root

321
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,720
zone stuff they don't know what to do

322
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,080
with the soilless mix the hot soilless

323
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,879
mix in the middle and the cocoa on the

324
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,879
outside

325
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,919
they're confused bro so that's going to

326
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:31,600
be a struggle

327
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,679
for the next couple of weeks if you're

328
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,440
in week 6 i would say flush them

329
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,359
water them with a good feed see how they

330
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,880
react and then consider your moves from

331
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,240
there if they respond well to that

332
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,240
flushing and new feeding

333
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,080
uh proceed with caution until about week

334
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,759
eight then flush and then finish them

335
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,278
if they keep acting weird you're gonna

336
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,360
have to adjust your feedings

337
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,360
uh you said that they go they burn if

338
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,800
you go any more than half strength so

339
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,000
feed them half strength man keep going

340
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,719
half strength all the way up to the end

341
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,080
don't burn them

342
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,680
don't [ __ ] them up give them what they

343
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,040
need try to nurse them all the way to

344
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,039
the end and learn from it

345
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,719
baby them learn as much as you can take

346
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,759
a lot of notes observe a lot see what

347
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,800
they do for you

348
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,600
then it says last question at harvest do

349
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,519
the pistols

350
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,399
shrivel when the butt is ripe or should

351
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,519
i just watch the trichomes

352
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,679
i'm gonna look right into the camera

353
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,799
here always

354
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,078
judge ripeness by your trichomes always

355
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,719
that's what tells you when the plants

356
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,159
are ripe those pistils the stigmas

357
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
those are the breeding parts of the

358
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,480
plant those are there to catch pollen

359
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,000
and slide that pollen down into the

360
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,039
calyx into the ovule

361
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,799
start making a seed those pistols those

362
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,240
stigmas aren't for ripeness

363
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,078
we're gonna smoke them because they're

364
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
there but they don't have anything to do

365
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,958
with the buzz

366
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,039
with the ripeness we don't need those

367
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,879
you could wipe all of those off and the

368
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,240
cannabis will still be the same it will

369
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,480
still be high quality

370
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,919
if all the the hairs from your buds end

371
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
up in the bottom of the bag before you

372
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,319
smoke it

373
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,399
and all you smoke are trichomes you'll

374
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
still get high if all the trichomes come

375
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,320
off your buds and all you smoke are

376
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,000
hairs

377
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,519
you're not going to get high so let's

378
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,078
not judge ripeness

379
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,839
ever by the pistols or the stigmas of

380
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,439
our plants the only way to determine

381
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,079
ripeness of a cannabis plant

382
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,079
is through the trichomes you want amber

383
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,319
trichomes a lot of people say 20 to 30

384
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,239
percent amber i can agree with that

385
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,000
cut them down dry them and cure them

386
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,399
they'll be perfect at that point

387
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,600
judge your ripeness always looking into

388
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
the camera right here again we're going

389
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,278
to zoom in on my face for this one

390
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,200
always determine the ripeness of your

391
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,159
cannabis plant by the color of the

392
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,160
trichomes

393
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,679
nothing else matters all right you're

394
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,799
not going to smoke the leaves you are

395
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,239
that's not what we're aiming for if

396
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,359
you're going to make a concentrate all

397
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,879
you're going to consume

398
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,320
is the trichomes we're not going to

399
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,159
smoke the leaves we're not trying to

400
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,040
smoke the hairs or the stigmas our goal

401
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,439
is to smoke

402
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,319
ripe trichomes so judge all of your

403
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,399
ripeness

404
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,320
by your trichomes that is when you cut

405
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,839
down is when the trichomes are ripe

406
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,839
all right i think i covered all of the

407
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399

i myself am great i'm pretty sure that

431
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,240
my loved ones are doing well also

432
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,078
it says i would love to hear your

433
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,600
thoughts on how you would strategize if

434
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,719
you were in a scenario

435
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,159
similar to the situation i am in

436
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,920
if you are growing nothing more than

437
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,039
your own small personal garden i've got

438
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,958
a 3x5

439
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:52,799
or a 3.5 by 3.5 veg space and a 5x5

440
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,559
flower space and a separate spot for

441
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,639
seedlings and clones

442
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,759
what would you be looking for in regards

443
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,600
to narrowing out

444
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,799
about three keepers if your goal is to

445
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,879
have a rotation

446
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,000
of flavors as well as trying to avoid

447
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,240
tolerance build up

448
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
to a particular cultivar that's a very

449
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
great question

450
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,519
said my first set of irie beans arrived

451
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,039
in april and after running the females

452
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,399
through flour a couple of times and

453
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,439
separating the good weed from the

454
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,440
incredible weed

455
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,519
i have a firefly and a lemon jeffrey

456
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,000
that are both far superior

457
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,039
to any herb you can find for miles

458
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,879
around here

459
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,559
i really loved it i really love hearing

460
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,159
that my genetics are making people happy

461
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,759
and that they've got superior

462
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,000
product compared to everybody around

463
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,958
them it does go on to say what does it

464
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,440
say

465
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,159
um scarlet begonias is also incredibly

466
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,320
bonkers

467
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,159
but she grows so fast i have a hard time

468
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
staying on top of her

469
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,919
isn't that a bummer that that plant

470
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,759
grows so fast it messes up your schedule

471
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,078
that's how the redheaded stranger that i

472
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,078
bred it from was in my commercial grows

473
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,759
i had to cut clones of that two weeks

474
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,399
later i'd cut clones of everybody else

475
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,240
today

476
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,440
and then in two weeks we'll cut that one

477
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,198
because she's gonna go

478
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,480
so quickly that i just don't need her

479
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:59,759
for that two weeks she'll get way too

480
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,120
big she'll outgrow everybody else and

481
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,679
[ __ ] up the rhythm so i know what you're

482
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,679
saying

483
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,359
uh the mommy plant that made that one

484
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,719
had hyper hyper vigor i'm trying to get

485
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,039
my mic right in my face here

486
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,879
all right let's keep moving it says i

487
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,879
know lemon skunk is the mother of both

488
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,639
firefly and lemon jeffrey

489
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,480
even though these two are not that

490
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,360
similar to each other and i'm thinking

491
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,959
long term

492
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,120
if i can part with one of them i'll have

493
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,919
to make a tough decision either way

494
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,679
one will stay so where would you go from

495
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,319
there if you were trying to establish a

496
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,039
small

497
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,278
variety of killers that would be a good

498
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,439
rotation this is a very good question

499
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,720
if you are a medical grower and you're

500
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,240
growing for yourself you need to keep

501
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,079
your medicine supplied but

502
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,839
if you continue to smoke the same thing

503
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,078
over and over again you will get what i

504
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,399
call strain lock or strain burnout

505
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,198
if i smoked lemon jeffrey is one of my

506
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,759
top five

507
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,159
favorite strains ever of all time if i

508
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,399
smoked lemon jeffrey all day every day

509
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,078
by day seven or eight it's not gonna do

510
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,600
much i'm gonna smoke it i'm a heavy

511
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,039
smoker you guys so it may take most

512
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,440
people like a month it's gonna take me a

513
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,360
week

514
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,360
ten days i'm gonna be smoking it and

515
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,639
smoking it on days one through three i'm

516
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,839
gonna be like this good weed i'm nice

517
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,759
and high by day four i'm gonna be like

518
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,360
that ain't working so much day five i'm

519
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,559
gonna be like yeah i need to switch it

520
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,000
up by day seven i'm gonna be like

521
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,119
nothing's even happening when i smoke

522
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,440
all this

523
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
so i do believe you get sort of a strain

524
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
lock you get too used to smoking the

525
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,198
same thing

526
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,720
also if you're growing to uh for a

527
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,719
profit you need to switch it up to

528
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,079
switch it up for your clientele

529
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,320
people are going to get bored buying the

530
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,919
same [ __ ] all the same time so

531
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,839
here is a very good question how do we

532
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,919
keep a good rotation of just

533
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,440
three different strains and you did say

534
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,000
that you've got the lemon jeffrey in

535
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,399
there

536
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,759
uh you said you've got the firefly in

537
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,639
there and you mentioned

538
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,240
scarlet begonias and you want three

539
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,560
keepers

540
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,759
the main thing is what works for you it

541
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,078
sounds like you're in love

542
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,839
with the uh the firefly and the lemon

543
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,359
jeffrey which are similar but different

544
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,880
which will be

545
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,399
that's a great thing if those work for

546
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,720
you medicinally

547
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,759
they are very similar but also very

548
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,440
different so they're going to have

549
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,278
similar medicinal properties but they'll

550
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,880
be different enough to where i think you

551
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,639
could probably switch them out

552
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,159
and not get a strain lock from switching

553
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,360
those two different types

554
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,439
now you said you've got the scarlet

555
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,240
begonias but it goes too fast for you

556
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,360
and it's incredibly bonkers yes some of

557
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
the head buzzes

558
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,278
the sativa dominant varieties that come

559
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,720
from that scarlet begonias cross will

560
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,320
give you a panic attack that make you

561
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,680
feel all warm when you smoke it

562
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
uh make you feel like your blood's on

563
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,399
fire and you got a sweater on you just

564
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,958
get so hot and panicky

565
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,839
it is bonkers is a great word for it uh

566
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,838
but it says

567
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,199
where would you go if you had to pick

568
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,839
three four

569
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,278
killers for a good rotation uh man what

570
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,639
works the best for you it sounds like

571
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:37,838
those two lemon strains are working

572
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,839
great for you it doesn't sound like the

573
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,920
scarlet begonias was your favorite

574
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,000
what i would do is i would pick one for

575
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,759
the day and one for the night

576
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,440
and then possibly either one to pay the

577
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,919
bills if you know what i mean

578
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,800
and then maybe one for rotation so

579
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,278
you've got your

580
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,120
lemon sunrise you got your lemon jeffrey

581
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,439
and then we need something else in there

582
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,120
just to rotate out of those two are kind

583
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,040
of the lemon sunrise and lemon jeffrey

584
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,480
are more i would consider daytime smoke

585
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,078
they're gonna keep you up keep your head

586
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,798
going keep your brain spinning keep you

587
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,318
active

588
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,838
so i would recommend maybe something a

589
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,599
little bit more mellow

590
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,438
ah maybe something like the double dose

591
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,078
or the dark hollow or something

592
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,279
kind of chill you out a little bit also

593
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,198
those are so far

594
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,639
they don't have as many of the same

595
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,640
cannabinoids and terps

596
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,559
as the uh the lemon strains they're more

597
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,079
earthy uh more cushy

598
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,678
different variety different flavor

599
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,359
different aroma different buzz they do

600
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,280
have that arise parent in there

601
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,399
but the mommy plants are so vastly

602
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,480
different that the buzz

603
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,320
and the medicinal effect are going to be

604
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,640
way different so i would say

605
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,678
um stick with those two lemons if

606
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,880
they're working for you you don't want

607
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,640
to get rid of those

608
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,080
if they're working for you but the

609
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,759
funnest part about growing

610
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,439
is you have more seeds and you get to

611
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,720
hunt that next phenotype every time you

612
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,480
get rid of one as long as you've got one

613
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,079
or two that work you've got room to get

614
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,160
that rotation you've got one to play

615
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,720
with but i would work with the two

616
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,519
lemons

617
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,400
and then maybe dark hollow and maybe uh

618
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,400
double dose

619
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,679
because those are vastly different from

620
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,280
the two you're working with

621
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,720
you can work with the two have them in

622
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,639
rotation have the other one

623
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,880
as that third like nighttime medicine or

624
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,720
switch it up but what works the best

625
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,919
for you what's best for you medicinally

626
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,600
that's what we need i don't know what

627
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,440
strains work the best for you

628
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,359
i don't know what your your brain and

629
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,320
your body and all of that stuff require

630
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,599
i don't know if you're trying to stay

631
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,720
energized all day i don't know if you're

632
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,798
trying to take a nap

633
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,038
i don't know exactly what you need but

634
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,119
uh i would stick with the two you've got

635
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,640
and then just do auditions since you've

636
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,479
got two that are reliable

637
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,000
let's just pop some seeds man and see if

638
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,079
you can run some uh

639
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,519
some dark hollow run a couple of dark

640
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,038
hollow seeds see if one of those does

641
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,480
the magic trick for you if not

642
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,839
you don't have to keep it abandon it

643
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,880
you've still got those two champions

644
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,119
right there for you

645
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,799
so maybe that's my advice as a breeder

646
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,239
as a grower as somebody who's always

647
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,079
looking for the next one

648
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,000
i would say keep those two reliable

649
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,678
there and then just have that third spot

650
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,279
as an audition spot and if something

651
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,679
better beats those two

652
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,678
keep the two new best and that third

653
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,720
spot is your new audition spot maybe

654
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,360
you're going to end up with lemon

655
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,440
jeffrey

656
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,558
and dark hollow and something that isn't

657
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,400
even released yet

658
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,918
you just haven't found it yet so just

659
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,679
have two reliables

660
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,440
and one that's being an audition or

661
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,038
always have one that's like that backup

662
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,000
rotation that's always different from

663
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:11,759
the other two

664
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,038
so i would stick with the lemon jeffree

665
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,558
the lemon sunrise

666
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,558
and then i keep saying it but i feel

667
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,240
like dark hollow or double dose

668
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,839
would fill in that gap very well it's a

669
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,120
different flavor it's a different aroma

670
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,439
and it's a different buzz

671
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,319
and also that double dose puts out big

672
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,160
harvests

673
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,519
uh the dark hollow puts out a big

674
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
harvest so you're not gonna lose any

675
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,759
weight

676
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,159
i know the lemon jeffrey and the lemon

677
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,839
sunrise really put out fat harvest so

678
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,840
if you're expecting a big fat yield like

679
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,119
that you'll still keep all of that

680
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,319
all right i hope i answered your

681
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,159
question there i'm going to go back over

682
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:43,279
this real quick and make sure i got you

683
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,919
um yeah i think we're good the struggle

684
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,599
is real

685
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,360
it's trying to decide what to grow not

686
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,279
just for you but for me

687
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,439
i have limited plant counts and as a

688
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,160
breeder who wants to do new projects and

689
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,720
new things

690
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,000
i completely understand your struggle uh

691
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,600
and then i'm gonna make new stuff as

692
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,359
soon as you decide what you like

693
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,119
i'm gonna make new stuff to keep you on

694
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,678

695

it says i am hoping you can answer a few

711
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,679
questions on ipm and i was wondering if

712
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,880
you had a recommendation for where to

713
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,280
get some predator

714
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,320
bugs for my garden that is a great

715
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,480
question

716
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,240
predator bugs are a great way for uh to

717
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
manage an integrated pest management

718
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,480
system

719
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,559
it says i mostly deal with the pressure

720
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,079
from spider mites and fungus gnats

721
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,839
but the spider mites are what i am

722
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,960
mostly concerned with i would love to

723
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,879
treat my veg

724
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,640
and have an idea of what would be best

725
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,400
to release for flower

726
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,080
i know you said recently on a podcast

727
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,759
you're moving away from sprays

728
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,279
and i would like to follow suit as you

729

let's talk about adding some beneficial

736
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,960
uh

737
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,640
beneficial bugs sorry that was harder to

738
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,200
say than it looked let's add some

739
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,640
beneficial bugs to your integrated pest

740
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,679
management system those are a lot of

741
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,840
words there

742
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,400
um they asked for a reputable place to

743
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,000
get them i am not paid by anybody i'm

744
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,159
not sponsored by anybody

745
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,079
in my opinion the most reliable spot for

746
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,799
a home grower to acquire

747
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,918
uh living bugs is from arbico dash

748
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:36,639
organics.com i've had great experience

749
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,840
with them

750
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,159
a lot of my friends have had great

751
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:43,439
experience with them i like them a lot

752
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,720
but also you have to be responsible and

753
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,279
shop locally first if possible if you

754
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,759
can find

755
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,839
a local insectiary that has the bugs you

756
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,640
need i would recommend getting them from

757
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,558
them

758
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,000
the less time your bugs are in the mail

759
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:56,720
or on the road or in a shipping

760
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,200
container

761
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,839
the more likely you are to get living

762
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,440
bugs

763
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,038
they are a living product we're buying

764
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,759
bugs that we want to come out aggressive

765
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,119
and hungry

766
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,200
we need them to come out of the box

767
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,558
ready to go we don't need them lethargic

768
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,840
and dead from a trip they don't

769
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,079
they don't need jetlag when they get

770
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,678
here so try to get them from as local of

771
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,399
a source as you can

772
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,919
maybe google put in your city and state

773
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
and then insectiary

774
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,679
and see if you can find an insect area

775
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,079
that will sell small batches to you

776
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,320
if not contact your local nurseries and

777
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,558
see if they are offering predator bugs

778
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,359
or maybe if they're using predator bugs

779
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:31,440
maybe they will

780
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,959
add some for you to their next order

781
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,640
that's often a way that it happens in

782
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,720
smaller communities

783
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,400
again i do recommend shopping locally

784
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,600
try to find somewhere that is close to

785
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,880
you

786
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,199
you don't want them to have to be

787
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,840
shipped for too far the most important

788
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,038
thing you do

789
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,720
is get the correct insect for the job if

790
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:49,839
you've got fungus gnats you want one bug

791
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,400
if you've got thrips you may want

792
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,599
another

793
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,600
if you've got spider mites you're going

794
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,279
to want to get a couple of bugs but

795
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,399
another thing to keep in mind is your

796
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,599
environment

797
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,759
how dry how humid how hot and how cold

798
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,719
is it in your area those things are

799
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,720
going to affect

800
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,880
how long your pests stick around yes you

801
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,159
may buy thousands of predator bugs

802
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,320
you may release a whole bunch of

803
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,720
swarovskis a whole bunch of californias

804
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,399
a whole bunch of california kiss a whole

805
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,759
bunch of green lace wings

806
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
and they may be hanging out for a couple

807
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,240
of days and they'll realize it's way too

808
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
[ __ ] cold here

809
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,880
and they'll find ways just to get out if

810
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,079
you can document your temperature and

811
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
humidity

812
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,119
and know kind of where you stay you

813
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,880
should know your regular temperature and

814
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,038
humidity in your grow environment

815
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,080
document that contact your local

816
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,079
insectiary

817
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,599
let them know the pest you are facing

818
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,399
and let them know your environmental

819
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:38,319
conditions

820
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,679
and they will make a recommendation on

821
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,839
the appropriate pest

822
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,360
and if you tell them how much space you

823
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,359
are working with square footage and

824
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,119
amount of plants and amount of lamps

825
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,798
uh they'll do a quick equation most of

826
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,959
them will know off the top of their head

827
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,400
say i'm facing this much pest pressure

828
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
it's either moderate or heavy pest

829
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,840
pressure

830
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,798
i've got these bugs maybe don't mention

831
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,798
cannabis

832
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,158
maybe don't mention cannabis i don't

833
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,359

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,640
what state you're in

835
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,639
maybe don't tell them you're growing

836
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,840
cannabis plants they probably won't ask

837
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
what kind of plants you're growing if

838
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,158
they do

839
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,679
you can say you're growing hops or you

840
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,760
can say you're growing tomatoes

841
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,200
those are very similar but let them know

842

what pests you're facing

843
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,720
