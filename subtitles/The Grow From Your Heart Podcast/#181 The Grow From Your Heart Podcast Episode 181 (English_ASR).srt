garden pests and issues well that's hard

68
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,919
to say that's a lot of words for a

69
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,319
podcast title but it's gonna be part two

70
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,479
of all that stuff before we get to

71
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,669
talking about new issues I need to

72
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,129
mention some stuff I forgot in the last

73
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,988
episode in the last episode we talked

74
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,090
about fungus gnats and we also talked

75
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,099
about spider mites when we talked when

76
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,409
we spoke about spider mites I forgot to

77
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,219
mention one helpful thing you guys if

78
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:55,259
you start seeing

79
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,359
spider my webbing developing in your

80
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,370
plants you can easily vacuum it up with

81
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,890
a shop vac hang on to the plant very

82
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,689
carefully get the shop vac and just suck

83
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,859
those spider mite webs right the [ __ ]

84
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,879
off of there honestly if you've got

85
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,800
spider mite webs you've got big problems

86
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,240
you need to get through that harvest you

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,890
need to clean that up and then you need

88
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,420
to figure out why there are spider mites

89
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,250
in your grow you need to correct that

90
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,719
issue you need to seal your gaps you

91
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,060
need to use some pesticides you need to

92
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,259
use some predator bugs you need to get

93
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,870
rid of the mites if you've got that big

94
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:24,340
of an issue but the shopvac will

95
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,009
certainly work to help you clean up

96
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,780
spider mite webbing should it be there

97
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:31,840
in your growth one more thing I should

98
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,969
talk about another way to really easily

99
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,219
find an issue in your garden is to be

100
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:37,840
there every day and just take a look you

101
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:39,969
guys pay attention look around in the

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,530
grow see what's going on look at the

103
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,900
plants everybody stares into the plants

104
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,939
all day stare with a purpose look at the

105
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,219
leaves see if you see any stippling see

106
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:49,719
if you see little bugs tap the soil see

107
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:51,819
if bugs fly up out of the soil

108
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,069
shake the plants see if bugs fly up out

109
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,680
of the foliage look around the room see

110
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,209
if anything looks out of place look and

111
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,770
see if you have some sort of leak or

112
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,719
drip coming from an air conditioner or a

113
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,790
dehumidifier just pay attention the best

114
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,609
way to find an issue early is to look

115
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:07,929
every day and pay attention and be there

116
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,460
all you got to do is go there and look

117
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,680
around alright just pay some attention

118
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,210
take some time in the grow I like to

119
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,710
walk in and just pull a leaf from a

120
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,290
random plant I try to pick a different

121
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,060
plant every day pick one leaf flip it

122
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,590
upside down make sure there are no bugs

123
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,449
no issues on the bottom side of that

124
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,009
leaf turn it look at the top side of the

125
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:25,360
leaf hardly ever problems on the top

126
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:27,339
sides you can see it from far away if

127
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,199
there are but grab some leaves pull off

128
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,949
the plants take a look and see if you

129
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,990
notice any issues ok another really easy

130
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,209
and simple way to prevent problems in

131
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,400
your garden is to simply clean up after

132
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,899
yourself don't leave leaves on the floor

133
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,819
don't leave dirt on the floor don't

134
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,319
leave your tools in the grow room and if

135
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:46,120
you bought some soil and you plan on

136
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,490
doing some transplanting don't bring

137
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,990
that soil into the grow room until you

138
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,460
can properly treat it and be sure that

139
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,590
there are not bugs and I should mention

140
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:56,379
that a lot of soil that you purchase

141
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:58,029
comes with free insects a lot of people

142
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,550
complain about specific brands having

143
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:03,189
insects in it honestly all of the soil

144
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,860
is eventually stored in the same place

145
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:08,139
if whatever brand you choose if it's Fox

146
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,370
farms if its roots organics if it's

147
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,379
whoever else there's just the first two

148
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,600
I thought of if its brand a brand B and

149
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,100
brand C they are all made by different

150
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,570
companies right but then they're all put

151
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,140
on a truck and they are all sent to

152
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:20,779
whatever King [ __ ] hydro supply in

153
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:22,250
whatever

154
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,019
and they're all stored in one warehouse

155
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,810
there until they're shipped out to

156
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:29,029
smaller warehouses to smaller warehouses

157
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,100
to retail stores so they're all shipped

158
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,929
to one place and in that one place I

159
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,150
imagine it's just a [ __ ] bug farm

160
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,430
every thrip and fungus net and spider

161
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:39,289
mite is just in there plotting to take

162
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,670
over your garden right now so when new

163
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,200
soil comes you have to pay attention to

164
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,240
what's in there that's a great way to

165
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,930
get bugs I forgot to mention that in the

166
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,370
last episode so be clean and pay the

167
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,170
[ __ ] attention one more thing we should

168
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,180
talk about a lot of people were like hey

169
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,980
what about ladybugs can't I use ladybugs

170
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,139
in my garden to help keep pests away

171
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,090
ladybugs are really cute but they are

172
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:02,629
not that aggressive I don't feel that

173
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:05,239
they eat enough enough problematic bugs

174
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,680
to be worth their money if you do get

175
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,720
some ladybugs release them in the grow

176
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,790
take a bunch of photography because

177
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,650
they're really cute and then in the next

178
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,569
morning get out the shopvac and vacuum

179
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:16,609
up all the dead goddamn ladybugs because

180
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:18,769
most of them are going to die within the

181
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,800
first 24 to 48 hours they're really not

182
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:24,560
that useful in my opinion and an indoor

183
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,210
grow when they die they stink you step

184
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
on them they're crunchy you find them in

185
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:30,709
your ducting you find them all over the

186
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,959
place also you guys I don't really think

187
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:34,759
a praying mantis is too beneficial in a

188
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,620
garden they mostly eat things like

189
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,209
aphids and soft bodied insects they

190
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,949
won't really go after too many spider

191
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:41,959
mites they aren't that aggressive what

192
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:44,539
I'm getting at is if you are going to

193
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,728
employ predator insects it is way more

194
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,000
worth your time your budget and your

195
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:52,189
energy to research and purchase the

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,860
correct predatory insect for your

197
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:57,168
problem for every insect that I

198
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,990
mentioned in these problem episodes I'm

199
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:02,569
going to try to include a predatory

200
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,970
insect that will control that pest

201
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:07,310
problem eventually I'll do a full

202
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,140
episode focused on beneficial insects

203
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,780
and predator bugs but for now I'll just

204
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,728
include one or two predators for each

205
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:17,029
problem that we face because if you are

206
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:18,379
looking to employ and use predator mites

207
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:20,059
and sort of an integrated pest

208
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,728
management system and go the organic

209
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,790
route I can fully endorse a company

210
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:29,060
called our Beco organics it's a RB ico

211
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:31,490
organics they are available online at RB

212
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,040
code - organics com they do not pay me I

213
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,810
am not sponsored by them but this

214
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,160
one simple catalog this is the early

215
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:42,110
spring 2017 catalog it includes

216
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,660
beneficial insects and mites to combat

217
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,699
almost any problem I could imagine in a

218
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,200
garden there are my predators there are

219
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,750
white fly parasites they're a fit

220
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,699
parasites you can buy anything from

221
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,430
ladybugs and preying mantises to my new

222
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:58,670
pirate bugs to assassin bugs which we

223
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,050
will talk about in the IPM episode which

224
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,100
I do have coming up for you later

225
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,160
gentleman my point here is that I do

226
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,689
completely endorse our Vico organics you

227
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,370
guys another way that you can pay

228
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:09,589
attention and notice bugs before they

229
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,959
become a problem is yellow and blue

230
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,279
sticky traps I said blue also yes most

231
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,989
people know about the yellow sticky

232
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,699
traps for your garden let me let me talk

233
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,560
about yellow sticky traps for a second

234
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:20,420
the reason yellow sticky traps are

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,980
yellow is because bugs are attracted to

236
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,300
the yellowing leaves the yellowing

237
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,189
leaves are a sign of weakness

238
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,500
imagine you were a bug you want to eat

239
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:29,660
through the leaf that thick green leaf

240
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,250
is crunchy and it has protection on it

241
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,960
it's gonna be it's gonna take a little

242
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,179
more work to get to the crunchy juicy or

243
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,740
that juicy taste the insides if the leaf

244
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,089
is already yellow it's a little bit weak

245
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,259
and you can get your little fangs right

246
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,269
through it and get in there and suck out

247
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,950
the juices and get what you need so

248
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,600
plants are Pro our bugs are programmed

249
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,030
to want to head for those yellow leaves

250
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,159
so hang those yellow sticky traps up I

251
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,689
like to put one kind of low near the

252
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,889
bottom of the canopy I like to put one

253
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,150
kinda in the middle of the canopy and

254
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:55,789
then I put them up high where flying

255
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,289
bugs are gonna go up near the lights so

256
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:59,779
I like to have those yellow sticky traps

257
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:01,549
around to let me know if bugs are there

258
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,559
and then if I see insects gathering on

259
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:04,969
those a couple is fine you're gonna see

260
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,049
a couple occasionally because [ __ ] flies

261
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,519
around you're just gonna have a normal

262
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:09,559
bug flying around but if you start

263
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,269
seeing them gather on there it's time to

264
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,709
treat for whatever bug you see gathering

265
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,319
on there it's probably gonna be a fungus

266
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,060
net if it's something flying the blue

267
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,950
ones put those lower the blue sticky

268
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:20,029
cards put those lower near your soil and

269
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,400
they will let you know if you are

270
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:24,559
getting thrips they are a good indicator

271
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,929
of leaf miners and thrips and other soil

272
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,119
bound insects so the sticky traps are

273
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:31,879
certainly a good way to let you know

274
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,320
that insects are coming also another

275
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,720
good way to know that you've got bugs

276
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,030
flying bugs will stick to your lights

277
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,250
the light reflectors they heat up if

278
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:43,009
you've got glass on there that'll heat

279
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,330
up somewhere there will be bugs stuck to

280
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,950
that pay attention to that if you see

281
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,170
little black bugs or little white bugs

282
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,670
that means you've got fungus

283
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,949
or white flies that you have got to

284
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:53,079
treat for so those are really simple

285
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,330
ways and indicators that you have got

286
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,850
problems and very simple ways to prevent

287
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,629
problems now it's time to work our way

288
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,460
into talking about preventing and

289
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,590
eradicating and identifying more garden

290
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,470
issues let's start today with white

291
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:10,780
flies white flies are more ugly than

292
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,460
anything but what white flies do is they

293
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,500
make your plants weak it will slow down

294
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,330
the growth of your plant they will make

295
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,549
your plants weak and tired they will

296
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,170
certainly diminish your yield they will

297
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:22,089
diminish the quality of your plants

298
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:23,979
white flies like to stick their little

299
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,300
teeth into your plants and suck the SAP

300
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,980
out of your plants and then they fly

301
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:28,149
around then they land back on your

302
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,740
plants and they [ __ ] all over your

303
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,689
plants and leave little honeydew streaks

304
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,799
on your plants so they make your plants

305
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,570
weak and then when you try to take

306
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,129
photos your photos are [ __ ] ugly

307
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,540
because you've got white flies in there

308
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:39,720
you've got white fly [ __ ] in there it's

309
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:42,459
really frustrating so let's talk about

310
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,259
white flies sounds really easy to

311
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,389
identify a white fly I did white fly

312
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:48,069
identification they are little white

313
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:49,779
bugs that fly around how do you know

314
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,160
they're there they're flying around if

315
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,230
you don't see them the best way to check

316
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,850
for him shake the plant when you shake

317
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,159
the planet shake the foliage white flies

318
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,170
will take off flying like I said earlier

319
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,399
look around the white shake the plants

320
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:02,349
and look toward the white because the

321
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,970
little bugs want to fly right at the

322
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,230
light when you shake them and then

323
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,639
they'll just fly around for a couple of

324
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,710
seconds and they'll land right back on

325
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,840
your plants they're really frustrating

326
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,810
so that's easy way to identify them a

327
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:18,100
good way to prevent white flies is a

328
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:20,649
clean dry sealed grow room and also low

329
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,300
temperatures you guys white flies thrive

330
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,059
and reproduce in temperatures over

331
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:28,089
eighty degrees so try to keep it closer

332
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:30,159
to 75 77 degrees in there that will slow

333
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,050
down the white fly production if they do

334
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,269
get in there also like I was talking

335
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:35,859
about earlier clear out all of the plant

336
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:37,720
debris that you have in your room don't

337
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,450
have that stuff in there dead leaves and

338
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,730
stuff get rid of that also in the last

339
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,379
episode I talked about using fine dust

340
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,360
filters and HEPA filters on all of your

341
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:48,610
ducting or on your intakes or on your

342
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,680
outs make sure you have some sort of

343
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,269
ducting on all your ins and outs and

344
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,370
make sure that all of your vents are

345
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:55,720
covered so that the white flies can't

346
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,399
travel through there so that's a great

347
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,990
way those are great ways to prevent

348
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,519
white flies so now you know how to spot

349
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,980
them and you know how to prevent them

350
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,889
now should you get them let's talk about

351
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,209
ways to get rid of white flies like I

352
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:09,429
talked about a little bit ago yellow

353
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:11,739
sticky traps are a great way to start

354
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,329
catching the white flies but you're only

355
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,399
gonna get a small portion of what's

356
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,930
there just the ones that fly to the

357
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:18,278
yellow sticky traps just the dumb ones

358
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:19,449
the dumb ones are gonna fly right to it

359
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:21,490
the smart ones are gonna stay there and

360
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,290
they're gonna keep breeding another way

361
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,450
that you can get rid of them is to shake

362
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:27,579
the plants and when they fly up simply

363
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,200
use your shop vac I've done this before

364
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,820
in gardens I've done this in personal

365
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,399
gardens I have done this also in

366
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,649
commercial Gardens just shake the [ __ ]

367
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,690
out of them shake the plant and just use

368
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:39,519
the wand on the shop vac and as they fly

369
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,660
out just suck them up they're gonna fly

370
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,250
right out of the plant and they're gonna

371
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,169
fly right up to the light so maybe keep

372
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,330
the shot back up toward the light just

373
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:48,250
shot back just just suck them right up

374
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,110
shake the plant keep sucking chase him

375
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,610
around suck him up until you're bored

376
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,080
until your arms go tired or until they

377
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,149
quit flying around do whichever one you

378
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,330
got to do so get off the shopvac and

379
00:12:55,149 --> 00:13:00,850
shot back the [ __ ] out of those white

380
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,430
flies also things you can do you can

381
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,200
apply sprays you can use neem oil

382
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:07,659
woodwork to help you get rid of your

383
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,700
white flies pyrethrum sprays will help

384
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:11,708
you get rid of your white flies and spin

385
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,810
Oh sad sprays will help you get rid of

386
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,909
your white flies those are all things

387
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:17,859
that are up to you if you want to use

388
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:19,480
the Evergreen pyrethrin spray it seems

389
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,769
to be a very versatile product you could

390
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,990
spray the leaves you can do a soil

391
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:24,519
drench and that will get rid of most of

392
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,740
your insects I think two or three

393
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,319
applications of the Evergreen pyrethrins

394
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,299
will get rid of most insects to tell you

395
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,120
the truth but that is up to you if it's

396
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:35,859
something you want to do also if you're

397
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,409
if you've got a very small garden in a

398
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,360
very light case of white flies you can

399
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:42,069
use insecticidal soap there is safer

400
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,528
soap I think and Rosenthal makes his own

401
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,028
type of soap simple products like that

402
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:48,129
are great to use if you've got a light

403
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:49,240
infestation but also keep in mind like I

404
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:51,278
mentioned in every episode

405
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,620
everything you spray on your leaves is

406
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,778
going to end up in your concentrates so

407
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,389
if you're going to apply essential oils

408
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:59,980
or botanical extract oils those are

409
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:02,049
going to end up in your hash if you plan

410
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,209
on making hash if you're making BHO if

411
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,979
you're making water hash this stuff will

412
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,899
end up in your concentrates you're going

413
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,899
to end up smoking it you're going to end

414
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,820
up tasting it it may have a health

415
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,169
effect I do not know what product you're

416
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,329
using I don't know the long term

417
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:19,299
Effects of these just keep that stuff in

418
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:21,159
mind another thing that you can use to

419
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:23,259
get rid of your white flies is it

420
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:24,549

pronounced Bavaria

422
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:28,269
bastiana it's a beneficial fungus it can

423
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:30,039
be applied in several different ways

424
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,690
it's sold as a powder it can be

425
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:34,179
sprinkled onto soil it can be mixed with

426

00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:56,500

it but photography is how I discover a

475
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,838
lot of issues and problems I'll snap a

476
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:24,939
picture at a grow I'll zoom in real far

477
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,470
I'll snap a picture I'll come home I'll

478
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,150
throw the disc in the computer I'll open

479
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,320
it up on the computer screen and zoom in

480
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:31,419
thinking that I've got the most amazing

481
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,310
shot and then I'll notice that there are

482
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:36,579
some white flies or some fungus gnats or

483
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:39,129
some a photonic orner on one of these

484
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,900
buds that I did not even notice and it

485
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:42,399
ruined my photo but at least now I know

486
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,929
that there's a problem there's something

487
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,639
I need to treat for something I need to

488
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:47,559
take care of so if you've got a good

489
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,090
camera if you've got a decent camera you

490
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,069
could probably do this with your iPhone

491
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,620
or Android camera if you suspect you've

492
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,360
got a problem take some pictures zoom in

493
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,909
look at the pictures when you zoom in

494
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,800
and you may reveal some problems you

495
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:01,539
were unaware of all right you guys I've

496
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:03,159
been going for 17 minutes here it looks

497
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:04,959
like I'm going to press pause for a

498
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:06,519
second I'm gonna take a drink you know

499
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,470
I'm gonna take a couple of giant dabs

500
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:11,029
and then I will be right back and we're

501
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:35,700
going to talk about a Fitz

502
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:35,700
[Music]

503
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,990
all right podcast world I am back and I

504
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:02,339
am heavily medicated I hope you enjoyed

505
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,049
the music we're listening to during the

506
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:05,939
break the song I played was called fat

507
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,649
spliffs by a band called Slightly

508
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,059
Stoopid I'm sure a lot of my reggae

509
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,200
friends are familiar with Slightly

510
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,179
Stoopid but if you haven't heard of them

511
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,920
check them out I'm sure you will dig

512
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,930
them during the break you guys

513
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,750
I took some gigantic dabs of some

514
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,279
distillate and I am heavily medicated I

515
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,440
like to talk about how much I enjoy

516
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,960
shatter I do like shatter shatter is

517
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,570
probably the most cost effective way for

518
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,610
me to medicate the way I prefer I like

519
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:32,669
to smoke frequently I like to take large

520
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:34,829
dabs I feel like I get more medicinal

521
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,990
effect off of one giant dab than I would

522
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:38,519
3 little dabs if you took the same

523
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,589
amount of hash if you took let's just

524
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,170
say 1/2 gram I would smoke a half

525
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:45,449
granddad by itself instead of breaking

526
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,970
it into 3 small dabs and I feel like if

527
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:50,490
I smoke those 3 small dabs back-to-back

528
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,789
like inhale blow it out eat the rig up

529
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:56,039
again do it again blow out the dab heat

530
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:58,109
the rig up again smoke it in blow it out

531
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,779
dude again I think those three dabs back

532
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:02,939
to back would not get me as high as one

533
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,319
single half gram dab would do so if I

534
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,269
took the same half grab broke it down

535
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,889
into three pieces took them all or took

536
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:10,200
one giant dab I'd get way better

537
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,210
medication off of the half gram so I

538
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,460
like to take giant dabs and I like to do

539
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,930
it frequently I like to take 2 or 3 dabs

540
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,059
at a time when I take a dab break

541
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,980
sometimes I'll take 4 or 5 dabs at a

542
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,990
time so shatter is the most

543
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,730
cost-effective way for me to get the

544
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,339
medicine I need for the price I like to

545
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,900
take big dad's very frequently but when

546
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,250
I need a little extra when I just want

547
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,230
to do something extra to my head you

548
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,849
guys this distillate is the way to go

549
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,440
it's a little bit expensive so you can't

550
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:35,099
get down on it you can't spoil yourself

551
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,509
every day

552
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:38,849
but if you're trying to spend a little

553
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:41,038
extra money at the dispensary I highly

554
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:42,329
recommend a nice glass vial of

555
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,609
distillate and what I like to do I heat

556
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:47,009
up the banger I heat the banger a little

557
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:48,509
bit too hot or the nail whichever you're

558
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:50,819
using or the email the email is already

559
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:52,558
on get it to a little bit hot and then

560
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:54,509
let it cool and then I just take the

561
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,279
torch and just barely heat the tip of

562
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:58,798
the glass syringe which the distillate

563
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,690
comes in and then you just barely tap

564
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,940
the plunger and it'll just push I think

565
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,130
three drops of distillate is a good dab

566
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,500
for me sometimes like to go four or five

567
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,000
if I'm trying to go crazy if you want to

568
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,349
go big go like seven or eight or ten

569
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,669
drops of the distillate into the banger

570
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,019
and do it but I think one or two drops

571
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,720
two or three drops would get most people

572
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:17,460
choking and nice and high so big shout

573
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,860
out to distillate I'm really starting to

574
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,600
fall in love with distillate you guys

575
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:23,009
I'm gonna quit rambling about distal and

576
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:27,000
concentrates and we're gonna talk about

577
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:28,650
a fits a federa common in cannabis grows

578
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,630
they love warm environments in warm

579
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,190
conditions that's why you find them in a

580
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,200
lot of ganja grows that's why you find

581
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,470
them in a lot of greenhouses so let's

582
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,140
talk about identifying a fits a federa

583
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,730
bout the size of a piece of rice I think

584
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,679
may be a little bit smaller I've seen

585
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,288
aphids plenty of times they look like a

586
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,870
piece of rice maybe just a little bit

587
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:51,629
smaller they're pear-shaped Athens come

588
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:52,469
in many different colors you guys I have

589
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,390
seen a fits

590
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,669
I've seen white Athens I've seen orange

591
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,409
aphids I've seen green Athens I have

592
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:01,470
seen a Fitz that are a reddish-brown

593
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:04,770
color almost the color of blood Athens

594
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,390
come in many different colors Athens

595
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,650
like to hang out on the bottom sides of

596
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,210
your leaves you guys they like to

597
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,130
congregate at the bottom sides of the

598
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,538
leaves usually kind of where they've got

599
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,270
some protection where they can hide from

600
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:19,890
predators and white and you and the wind

601
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:21,750
I've also seen a fiddler the bud at the

602
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,980
top bud where it kind of where the

603
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,900
leaves come out of the bud and kind of

604
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,339
make like a bowl the leaves were coming

605
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,320
out of the bud and curling up because of

606
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:29,490
the bud was really happy and right in

607
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,619
that little chilling area where the

608
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,390
leaves and bud made contact there was a

609
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:34,619
nice little colony of aphids just

610
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,419
chillin and living right there I don't

611
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:37,889
know how long they'd been there but they

612
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,679
were there for a long time because there

613
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,630
were a bunch of them so aphids liked to

614
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,850
hang out in a lot of different places on

615
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,280
the plant so make sure you check often

616
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:48,750
and they also breed very quickly so make

617
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,109
sure you're paying attention for a

618
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:54,599
it's also a fits the problem with aphids

619
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:56,459
is they are leaf suckers they like to

620
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,049
bite into your leaf and suck out the

621
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,390
juices just like all the other damn

622
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:01,829
pests for your gardens so they get up

623
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,509
under the leaves they poke little holes

624
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:05,159
in there they start sucking out the leaf

625
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:06,450
juices and all the life out of your

626
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,370
plants your plants start looking like

627
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,809
[ __ ] now your plants are getting weak

628
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,149
and they are susceptible to other

629
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:14,309
problems they're also gonna yield less

630
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,620
they're gonna grow slowly they're gonna

631
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:18,210
look like [ __ ] a lot of times if an

632
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:19,769
aphid problem gets out of control you'll

633
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,569
start seeing the leaves start to curl

634
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:23,160
and will and look like they're dead

635
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,299
they're just given up those plants have

636
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,860
been beat to [ __ ] and they've been

637
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,089
chewed up by the aphids so bad that

638
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:27,569
they're not even gonna try to fight

639
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:29,519
anymore

640
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:31,559
they're just gonna curl up and die try

641
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,000
again next year all right let's talk

642
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,759
about how to prevent yourself from

643
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,319
getting aphids in your ganja garden like

644
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,079
most other pests we can avoid getting

645
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,389
them by having filtration dust filters

646
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:45,629
and HEPA filters on your intake and your

647
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:48,690
outgoing vents also you need a clean

648
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,820
grow room I keep talking about a clean

649
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,580
grow room but every leaf every piece of

650
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:55,409
debris is a place for a bug to hide so

651
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,599
also something you can really think

652
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,390
about for aphids you need clean clothes

653
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,699
and clean shoes if you go on a hike if

654
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,250
you were around plants outside if it is

655
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,460
warm please change your clothes before

656
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:11,970
you go into your garden I worked in a

657
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:14,250
commercial grow everything was clean one

658
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,350
of my co-workers talked about taking

659
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,299
their dog for a hike they posted

660
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:20,669
pictures on Instagram all about taking

661
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:23,430
their dog for a hike they stopped by the

662
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,920
Gro to say hello and see if we wanted

663
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:28,289
lunch on their way home

664
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:30,840
three days later that garden had a fits

665
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:32,940
you guys I don't want to blame that dog

666
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,919
for running through a bush getting in

667
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,570
the car putting aphids on my friend my

668
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,700
friend coming to the girl putting aphids

669
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:39,869
in my garden but honestly you can tell

670
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,090
in my heart that that's what I think

671
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:44,579
[ __ ] happened so please do not go to

672
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:46,079
agro after you've been out hiking do not

673
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:49,049
come to agro after you've been playing

674
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,269
with your dog I think that pets are huge

675
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:52,829
carriers of garden pests they're out

676
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:54,059
there running and around in everything

677
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:55,259
they're low to the ground where the bugs

678
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,730
are they're playing in the dirt they're

679
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:58,289
playing in the bushes that's where the

680
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,120
garden pests are they're rubbing up

681
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:01,039
against plants plants are where plant

682
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,049
pests live

683
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,639
they're not gonna bring home predatory

684
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,049
mites they're going to bring home spider

685
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,780
mites they're gonna bring home trips and

686
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:11,259
a fits so please be very careful with

687
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:14,029
your clothing your shoes and your pests

688
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:17,059
another good way to prevent Athens in

689
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:18,230
your garden is to check for them I mean

690
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:19,669
if they're already there you're gonna

691
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,680
see them a way to prevent an S

692
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,480
infestation is to check for them very

693
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,600
frequently that's the best way to check

694
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,660
and prevent any type of pest infestation

695
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,759
is to pay attention every day one sign

696
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,279
that you have got an aphid problem is

697
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,519
ants if you have got ants in your grow

698
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:38,389
room you have probably got a fits also

699
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,730
ants and a fits

700
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,080
I often come together in your garden so

701
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,579
if you've got one you've probably got

702
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,899
the other answer easy to get rid of

703
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:46,279
we'll talk about that in another episode

704
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,230
I'm actually gonna write it down right

705
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:49,730
now all right I even wrote it down so

706
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,839
that will happen okay let's talk about

707
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:55,579
ways to eradicate a fits up in your

708
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,259
garden of course we talked about this

709
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:59,419
quite frequently the first step that you

710
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:02,180
can do if you choose to is you can spray

711
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:06,259
products on your garden there are many

712
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:08,870
things you can spray for a Fidesz neem

713
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:10,579
oil neem oil will get rid of the aphids

714
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:12,199
they don't want to be there it's sticky

715
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:14,119
it smells like [ __ ] it tastes terrible

716
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,340
the aphids don't want to hang out on

717
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,079
that a couple of applications of neem

718
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:20,240
oil should get rid of your a fits

719
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,429
however if you're in flower you do not

720
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,380
want to spray neem oil on flowering

721
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,680
plants keep in mind I say it all the

722
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,420
time

723
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,220
everything you spray on your buds and

724
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,380
your leaves is going to end up in your

725
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,569
concentrate if you've got big fat

726
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,160
swollen buds they're going to act like a

727
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:35,659
sponge you're gonna spray neem oil on

728
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,220
there and it's going to absorb and hang

729
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,810
onto a bunch of neem you're gonna

730
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,610
concentrate it you'll actually see the

731
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:42,379
neem oil float on the top of your hash

732
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:44,089
so you may have to think about what

733
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,830
you're gonna do if you're going to make

734
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:48,349
a lot of concentrates these sprays may

735
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:51,049
not be for you if you do choose to use

736
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:53,359
sprays pyrethrum sprays work well to get

737
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,460
rid of aphids I of course have been

738
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,049
endorsing the Evergreen brand it's very

739
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,029
affordable there's another brand that's

740
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:01,339
quite expensive it's the same thing as

741
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:03,379
evergreen you can use cinnamon oil you

742
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:05,209
can use clove oil you can use a product

743
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,430
made by Ed Rosenthal called zero

744
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,380
tolerance all of these products will

745
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:12,019
help you to get rid of your a fits it's

746
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,360
up to you to choose how strongly you

747
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:16,099
want to attack these pests and also

748
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,079
how harsh of a chemical you want to

749
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:19,909
apply to the plants that you are loving

750
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,309
and that you are growing to use as

751
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,769
medicine for yourself or other people

752
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:26,779
that you care for

753
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:29,779
another method we can use to get rid of

754
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:32,480
our a fits is a beneficial fungus called

755
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:37,220
Bavaria bassiano which is actually sold

756
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:42,470
as a product called botanic garden it

757
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:44,539
spelled Bo T and I G ard and it's 22 WP

758
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,429
it's a little bit expensive but it will

759
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:48,409
certainly work this is the beneficial

760
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:51,620
fungus I keep speaking of that can be

761
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,120
applied to treat a plethora of garden

762
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:54,829
insects you guys you can find it of

763
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,289
course at our bee code - organics

764
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:59,149
dot-com I did not realize it would be

765
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:00,678
for sale on that website I was not

766
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,059
looking for it on that website I did a

767
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:03,259
quick google search to see where we

768
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:05,000
could purchase it so I could share it

769
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:07,849
with you and the first place they came

770
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,710
up was our pico organics you guys I'm

771
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:12,109
sure they will not sponsor me because

772
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,789
I'm a cannabis podcast but let them know

773
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:15,049
if you do shop with them let them know

774
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:16,308
that you heard about them through the

775
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:18,589
girl from your heart podcast through

776
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:20,119
Rasta Jeff now we've talked about how to

777
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:21,919
get rid of these aphids on your plants

778
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:23,779
if you don't have giant buds if you are

779
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,490
in flower and you've got giant buds I

780
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:26,869
would never recommend spraying products

781
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,429
on there you don't want to spray

782
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:30,229
something that's going to leave a flavor

783
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:32,059
or possibly cause some sort of

784
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,579
long-lasting health effect that we don't

785
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:35,839
even know about for years to come so if

786
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:38,599
you don't want to spray the plants

787
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,669
what's the next option it is time to

788
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,829
bring out the predator bugs you guys

789
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:45,679
this is where ladybugs are useful

790
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,240
ladybugs do love to eat the [ __ ] out of

791
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,340
a Fitz there's actually a really cool

792
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,160
picture and Rosenthal's book of a

793
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:53,599
ladybug just devouring an aphid so this

794
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,279
is where the ladybugs do come in

795
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,469
ladybugs are actually useful for getting

796
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,599
rid of your aphids also the praying

797
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:02,058
mantis i discredited in earlier he is

798
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:04,669
actually really good at getting rid of

799
00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:06,319
aphids so the ladybugs the praying

800
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,759
mantis those would be the first steps to

801
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,678
getting rid of aphids in your cannabis

802
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,480
garden then you can bring out a food

803
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,759
paradise and aphid predators

804
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,009
there are several available the phidias

805
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,079
kool Imani is a well-known a fin

806
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:20,599
parasite there are several a fad

807
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,579
predators available some of them prefer

808
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,959
certain conditions so if you're going to

809
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:25,428
work with the Predators and the

810
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,740
parasites make sure that you've got the

811
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:29,540
proper and appropriate conditions for

812
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,230
these insects so that they can thrive

813
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:34,849
and destroy your a fed's another thing

814

you can do that is completely free and

815
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:38,519
completely organic it's safe and simple

816
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,920
you can simply remove leaves

817
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,509
or you can remove buds that are infested

818
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,789
with bugs it is not a big deal

819
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:47,069
chop it off put her in a trash bag seal

820
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:49,259
the trash bag put that in a sealed trash

821

822
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:54,509
manually eliminated the problem from

823
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,160
your grow another thing I want to

824
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:57,619
mention that I forgot to write down but

825
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,240
I just thought of it as I was talking

826
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:02,129
oftentimes I have seen a fits on these

827
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,779
stems of cannabis plants moving up and

828
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,450
down just traveling around the plant a

829
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:08,308
product called stylet oil will coat the

830
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,620
stems of the plants and it will leave it

831
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:12,960
like an undesirable place for these

832
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:15,719
aphids to be so check out a product

833
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,460
called stylin oil diluted heavily apply

834
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,279
it to your plants and that will keep

835
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,950
away most of your garden pests

836
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:24,548
especially these aphids and also the

837
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,739
white flies

838
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:28,028

845
