204
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:49,478
culture Chef all right I've got a couple

205
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,720
topics written

206
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:54,318
down one of them this just came up I was

207
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,319
kind of rude to somebody the other day

208
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,520
uh I realized that they were

209
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,120
selling their plants their crop got

210
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,680
powdery milw

211
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,680
and instead of salvaging it they decided

212
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,400
to cut the crop down and make live resin

213
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,560
out of it and I would not have known

214
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:12,279
about it unless somebody else told me

215
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,079
that they were doing that and so uh I

216
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:15,839
called him out on it and I said you are

217
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,719
the difference between being a caregiver

218
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,318
and a cash Cropper you were the person

219
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,240
that's going to make somebody sick

220
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,280
because we shouldn't be giving tainted

221
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,840
medicine to people who already have a

222
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,839
compromised immune

223
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,519
system uh other people in the room

224
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,560
treated me like I was kind of going

225
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,318
overboard but I felt it was kind of my

226
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,160
responsibility to call this dude out and

227
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,919
let him know that he's really doing it

228
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,560
wrong and he's making us all look bad

229
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:40,159
you know he's not helping the movement

230
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,800
at all and that's not what I'm working

231
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,720
towards so I wanted to have a little bit

232
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,759
of backup when I approach this dude

233
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,680
saying this is why so that's why I

234
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,919
brought Tony on the show like I was

235
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,759
saying earlier Tony's an organic

236
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,478
chemistry student and he knows a lot

237
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,840
about this so I guess the simple

238
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:56,399
question I want to ask once again excuse

239
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,439
my dab throat uh if we take these

240
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,478
powdery mude Buds and we blast them with

241
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,879
butane are we gonna get powdery mildew

242
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:04,279
or what is happening can you tell me a

243
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,120
little about that well you're not gonna

244
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:10,519
get the powdery mildew itself but you'll

245
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,598
um get the mot toxins or any sort of

246
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:18,079
toxins that they create which powdery

247
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:19,120
milu is fairly toxic to uh humans um now

248
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,439
believe it or not you could actually

249
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,720
probably be better off smoking the buds

250
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,959
yourself not Distributing them but it

251
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,680
would be less toxic than blasting it and

252
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,359
concentrating it um that's why they call

253
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,879
them concentrat cuz we're concentrating

254
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,080
everything that's in the plant matter

255
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:39,719
into a an oil that is far far far more

256
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,759
concentrated than the plant matter

257
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,800
itself I I hadn't even thought about

258
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,319
that route you're making powdery mil do

259
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,079
dabs just like you are ash yeah you're

260
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
taking the mot toxins and concentrating

261
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,959
it okay sorry I got to fix the echo I

262
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:56,199
got that mic up I have a question when

263
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:57,879
you say fairly uh toxic um could you put

264
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,680
some kind of comparison on that well

265
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,480
it's definitely not like black mole old

266
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,958
or anything like that but um I'm sure

267
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,839
you guys remember the swag days oh yeah

268
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:10,559
the the cheap brick weed that stuff had

269
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,560
powdery me do in it very often and even

270
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,039
smoking small quantities of that you'd

271
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,199
end up with chest congestion bronchitis

272
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,319
usually sore throat for a week and a

273
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,480
half uh so you can imagine what happens

274
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,360
if you concentrate it 10 to 15 times of

275
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
the dosage and then you take a big fat

276
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,240
dab like I like to do oh yeah so you

277
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,159
just probably got a good percentage of

278
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,720
MOT toxins in your body

279
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,519
yeah and the trippy thing about that is

280
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,160
it's not going to show up immediately

281
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,759
immediately it's probably going to show

282
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:39,360
up in a month or two the really weird

283
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,639
effects uh you're probably going to go

284
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,600
like a little nuts from it a little bit

285
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,720
of psychosis in my mind uh Behavior

286
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,000
change yeah paranoia that's if we smoke

287
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,480
a lot right that's not like from one or

288
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,320
two dabs or some PM dabs it's consistent

289
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,039
small doses okay so if you're smoking it

290
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,959
just once a day for a week or two it's

291
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,120
going to do some weird stuff to you all

292
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,879
right you definitely don't want to do

293
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,200
that

294
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,639
makes you think guys wonder where your

295
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
dabs are coming

296
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,600
from and he said this is something that

297
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,679
caught my mind he said it's almost it

298
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,959
would be better if you smoke the buds

299
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,519
than it would be to smoke the hash and I

300
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,159
also like that you said smoke the damn

301
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,120
buds yourself don't give them out to

302
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,759
anybody that's what you should do if you

303
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,440
grew powdery mil do Buds and you have to

304
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,958
do something smoke it yourself that way

305
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,360
you know reap what you sew that way

306
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,199
you're not getting somebody else sick if

307
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,440
you're going to do it do it don't give

308
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,879
it to someone else to smoke all right so

309
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,200
mot toxins uh you said a little bit of

310
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,399
psychosis do you think a little bit of

311
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,879
headache nausea diarrhea vomiting stuff

312
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,039
that would be described as hidden or

313
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,759
mistaken as other things definitely

314
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,360
usually flu like or cold symptoms and

315
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,278
then as it gets later you'll definitely

316
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,480
get like typical mold poisoning uh like

317
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:50,679
seizures

318
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,560
and very very very very bad things will

319
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:56,078
happen to you uh kidney and liver tox

320
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:58,679
toxicity from mot toxins right oh yeah

321
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:02,638
those those wreak havoc on you and uh

322
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,719
powdery milk do is it's of that type of

323
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,799
organism it's going to produce those and

324
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,759
it's they don't worry about it for food

325
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,799
crops very often because it's only leafy

326
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,360
parts that get affected by it okay most

327
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,679
fruits like tomatoes and stuff won't

328
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,879
show the little patches on them so like

329
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:21,439
cucumbers or squash that always get

330
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:25,000
infected the the fruit itself's probably

331
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,639
safe um yeah to consume um not to blast

332
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,679
into hash you probably run into the same

333
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:33,480
trouble cucumber resin and I'm pretty

334
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:35,000
that you get some turps bro yeah um and

335
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,879
even then that's not very strong

336
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,559
quantities cuz you have to have a large

337
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,720
amount of leafy matter infected with the

338
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:44,319
uh the white patches that's the fruiting

339
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,720
body and then it's it's a toxin that's

340
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
systemic that goes throughout the plant

341
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,360
so yeah you'll end up with it in your

342
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,560
cucumbers or squash or whatever but not

343
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,680
much however we're uh we're smoking

344
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,399
leafy leafy flowers which accumulate

345
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,958
that stuff with freakishly high

346
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,958
concentrations of self so it's not the

347
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,518
same as a food uh a food issue cuz it's

348
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,399
it's technically considered non-toxic

349
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,399
for food crops even though they don't

350
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,200
let it ever happen but you definitely

351
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,159
don't want to be smoking that stuff

352
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,240
we've had it on like you said the leafy

353
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,799
parts of plants but we've never actually

354
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,399
like I've never actually seen it on the

355
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,919
uh there you go you're into the side of

356
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,639
the mic like some kind of gangster

357
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:30,679
rapper what was that punk rocker okay oh

358
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:34,039
yeah but uh I've always um you know

359
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:38,838
since powdery mildo kind of came around

360
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:40,439
last few five six years seems like um

361
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,040
I've wondered about those late season

362
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,000
crops that always get infected with

363
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,759
that yeah yeah have tended to throw a

364
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,879
lot of that stuff in the compost pileo

365
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,240
that's probably what you should do well

366
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,519
I don't know is that powdery mildew

367
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,759
going to affect his compost yeah you

368
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,120
don't want to actually put that in

369
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,879
compost either they say really yeah it's

370
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,560
it's not a good one to have okay mot

371
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,799
toxin I figured it got hot enough that

372
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,919
it doesn't kill the spores now okay and

373
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,919
you don't actually have to worry about

374
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,078
inhaling the spores it's the literally

375
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,719
the toxins that you're burning are just

376
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,278
going to wreak havoc on your uh the

377
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,399
mucus membranes at first and then it's

378
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,198
going to make you get a little weird

379
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,839
I've been I've seen some uh big

380
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:22,439
commercial rooms that I felt like the

381
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,800
the spores actually burn my nose in

382
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,600
there maybe I know who you're talking

383
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:28,799
about I think I know who you're talking

384
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,040
about possibly so this dude told me that

385
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:35,039
using a one micron screen would prevent

386
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,639
any of the uh microt toxins or spores

387
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,159
getting into the hash that's completely

388
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,799
[ __ ] cuz he's we're basically

389
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,759
juicing the mot toxins right through

390
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,719
that screen right they're in solution so

391
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,759
you can't uh filter them out as if they

392
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,519
were solid particles just like the THC

393
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,559
is correct correct yeah it's totally uh

394
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,440
same thing as salt and water unless you

395
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,838
actually have a filter that's not even

396
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,120
it's not even a filter anymore they call

397
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,880
it a semi-permeable membrane that's what

398
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,159
osmosis uses okay yeah that's that's

399
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,078
yeah that's not even a filter anymore

400
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,600
you can't filter a dissolved solid out

401
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,479
of a liquid I like that Tony knows a lot

402
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,199
of [ __ ] yeah sorry it's warm in here oh

him a pro level grower he's got a couple

439
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,720
few crops under his belt he uh he's got

440
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,958
that chemistry background so it really

441
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,800
helps him out but it also kind of kills

442
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,319

443

sure it's going to put out some lumens

487
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,278
it's going to make my room bright it's

488
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,240
going to make my plants happy Jesse was

489
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,919
giving him praise earlier uh he said he

490
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,278
set up one light with a room that had an

491
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:58,559
uneven canopy uh because a lot of times

492
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,439
your middle plants will grow better cuz

493
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,838
that's where the lighting is uh he said

494
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,480
they evened out within a week or two so

495
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,078
must be doing something right all right

496
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,078
I said we're going to talk about doing

497
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:12,279
uh nutrients and I was also mentioning

498
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,318
that uh Tony is a chemistry and organic

499
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:15,879
uh chemistry major uh he's a physics

500
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,359
nerd he's a computer nerd but this dude

501
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,120
knows a lot of stuff I think that his

502
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,519
knowledge of science really helps him

503
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:25,000
when he grows but I also think it almost

504
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:26,798
kills him when he grows uh yeah plants

505
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,279
are predictable but plants aren't

506
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,240
science they're nature they have limits

507
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,240
yeah so I see Tony he's like I fed them

508
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,720
potassium why aren't they potassium in

509
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,200
come on do it and I'm like you got to go

510
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,720
to bed and you got to wait like three

511
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,200
days and you got to come back and check

512
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,160
and then maybe you'll see what you did

513
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,880
he's like I want it now he thinks he

514
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,120
should mix [ __ ] up and see explosions

515
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,440
for the way plants work sometimes it

516
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,719
works sometimes it does but it's funny

517
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,840
watching you be baffled I know how much

518
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,360
you know about science and Organics and

519
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,678
to see you look at me like dude how come

520
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,558
and it's just the smallest thing that

521
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,679
you overlooked it's it's great seeing

522
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:00,000
you learn like that but sometimes it

523
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,240
does slow you down sometimes it totally

524
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,599
shoots you in the foot cuz you don't

525
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,960
believe that the plants will do what I

526
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,399
think they should do on their own yeah

527
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,640
you want everything to be the Incredible

528
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,640
Hulk yes on steroids on steroids raar

529
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,120
all right so we're gonna talk a little

530
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,400
bit about nutrients I was hoping Jesse

531
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,158
would be here because he really has a

532
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,880
lot of cool [ __ ] to contribute but I

533
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,919
will cover I will try to I'll go like

534
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,080
I'll put my voice really deep I'll turn

535
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,440
up the Lowe's on the microphone so maybe

536
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,639
we get no they didn't know but I'll turn

537
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,159
up my voice real deep and I'll do

538
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,559
Jesse's Parts um most of what we're

539
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,159
going to cover will today will be based

540
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,960
on bottled nutrients I think it's a lot

541
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:34,200
easier for a new hom grower to learn

542
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,319
with the good line of bottled NES uh

543
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,600
next week I'm going to have a guy named

544
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:38,279
Shawn over you know what it may be two

545
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,839
weeks until I have Shawn over we got to

546
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,079
see what happens with the secret cup no

547
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,319
I should sea will be here next week

548
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,319
maybe Spence will be here the week after

549
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,079
with the secret Cup victory that's what

550
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm hoping for uh Sean's going to teach

551
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,240
us about Organics and sustainable

552
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,640
horiculture Shawn doesn't use to the

553
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,720
best of my knowledge Shawn doesn't use

554
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,080
any Hydro Store products uh but for

555
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,880
today's lesson we're going to focus on

556
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,359
Basics uh bottle nutrients are usually

557
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,520
reliable and cons and consistent our

558
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:03,639
good friend Adam who couldn't be here

559
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,519
tonight he specifically asked me what he

560
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,360
needs to be feeding his plants and he

561
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,359
also asked what the numbers on the front

562
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,599
of the bottles mean so I think the

563
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,119
numbers on the front of the bottle is a

564
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,399
good question and it's a super good spot

565
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,798
to start so we'll talk about that there

566
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,080
are three numbers if you go to the hydro

567
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:18,798
shop and you pick up almost any

568
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,960
fertilizer bottle there are three

569
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,279
numbers on the front uh the first number

570
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,360
represents nitrogen the second number

571
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,720
represents phosphorus and the third

572
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,879
number represents potassium uh that's

573
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,640
NPK uh those are known as macronutrients

574
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,760
so a bottle of basic grow nutrients like

575
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,360
if you grab botanic here Botanicare pure

576
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,960
blend Pro or maybe some Advanced

577
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,240
Nutrients Jungle Juice grow uh the

578
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,240
numbers on there are going to be like

579
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,839
325 or 216 or something like that each

580
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,880
brand is going to be different so if it

581
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:50,480
says two three uh 325 that's what we're

582
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,360
going to work with now is 325 it means

583
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,159
there's 3% nitrogen 2% phosphorus and 5%

584
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,000
potassium in that nutrient in that

585
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,440
bottle so the numbers on those bottles

586
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,919
tell us the NPK values of what the NPK

587
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,200
values are of the fertilizers we're

588
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:07,520
buying but it's up to us to figure out

589
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,319
uh which bottles to use and when to use

590
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,720
them and how much to use most of the

591
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,558
nutrient companies make a really cool

592
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,839
Nutrient calculator that you can get the

593
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,359
hydro shop a lot of times it's in a

594
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,158
little insert thing like a coupon right

595
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,639
next to the brand get those those are

596
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:20,880
always super helpful a lot of times Tony

597
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,080
will be like how much of this nutrient

598
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,600
do I use and since I'm kind of a nerd

599
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,879
I've happened to have a bunch of those

600
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,480
little inserts laying around and I'll

601
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,400
just pull it out and be like it says

602
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,798
this yeah but I definitely recommend

603
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,840
reducing the recommended dosage to about

604
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,480
half of what they say you use uh

605
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:38,079
sometimes 2/3 you can tell we'll talk

606
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,360
more about that that I wrote that part

607
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:44,000
down so uh most of the companies make a

608
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,240
a chart or also online you can go online

609
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,919
to botanic care.com or Advanced

610
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,679
nutrients.com I know they have super

611
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,280
great uh feeding schedule calculators uh

612
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,000
if you use a pre-developed recipe from

613
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:56,399
there they'll tell you exactly what to

614
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,679
use every week uh I suggest you reduce

615
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,038
the dosage like I was saying to about

616
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,759
half those companies they want to sell

617
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,279
you more they really want you to buy

618
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,720
more [ __ ] so they tell you to use a

619
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,319
little bit extra like 5 or 10

620
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,798
milliliters every week adds up to them

621
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,119
and to you but you don't notice it your

622
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,359
plants won't notice it so they kind of

623
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,678
overfeed your plants on purpose so

624
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,519
reduce what they say uh if you see signs

625
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,519
of a deficiency you can increase your

626
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,000
fertilizer on the next feed but you

627
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,960
can't uh if you over correct it if you

628
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,759
over feed you can't correct that uh

629
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,159
you've got burnt leaves and angry roots

630
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,240
and your plants look all [ __ ] fried

631
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:31,039
out uh I think have seen a couple of

632
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,079
your plants do that one time oh yeah

633
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,919
I've burned them yeah Tony's not afraid

634
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:36,399
to mess with some plants Tony is all

635
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,799
about getting in there and torturing the

636
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,159
[ __ ] out of his crop yeah so usually pH

637
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,359
Burns I was going to talk a lot about pH

638
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,679
Burns if we have time I'm going to try

639
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:47,319
to go about 45 to an hour here but if we

640
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:49,080
have time for pH we'll get into it uh

641
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,759
something I recommend and this is uh

642
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:52,158
this is part of what I think Tony shoots

643
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,400
himself in the foot with I recommend

644
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,799
that if you're going to use a brand of

645
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,679
bottled nutrients you stick with the

646
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,158
brand until you become experienced and

647
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,880
you can identify deficiencies and

648
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,120
problems uh which means a few things

649
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,760
first if you use Botanicare pure blend

650
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:06,599
Pro as a base I totally recommend using

651
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,599
whatever Botanicare pure blend Pro

652
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,278
additives you can afford to add but

653
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,439
don't mix stuff from other brands I know

654
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:14,200
that sounds ridiculous like brand

655
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,880
loyalty or a sales pitch but I think

656
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,440
it's rational with any brand and I'll

657
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,360
explain why I don't mix Brands because

658
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,278
of Antonio like this sholan buffers and

659
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,519
bonding agents versus Organics a lot of

660
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:27,919
products have chemicals that make the

661
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,519
products last longer some uh have

662
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,759
chemicals that prevent certain compounds

663
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,038
from bonding inside the bottle and

664
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,440
ruining the solution and many of those

665
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,440
chemicals will ruin all of the

666
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,159
beneficial compounds in an organic

667
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,400
solution uh Tony May correct me on this

668
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,159
I feel like if I poured some synthetic

669
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,880
nutrient like if I got almost anything

670
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,120
from Advanced Nutrients if I pour big

671
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,159
bud and do a batch of organic compost

672
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,519
tea I think the big bud would kill most

673
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,000
of the bioactivity in my compost tea is

674
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,599
that correct um I think big bud

675
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,720
especially like uh overdrive definitely

676
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,119
would wreak havoc okay how about my

677
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,480
micos is it just going to destroy my

678
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:05,839
micro life destroy your micos and um

679
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,038
actually it's probably going to bring

680
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:11,918
things out as solution uh like calcium

681
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,720
compounds and those once they're

682
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,480
unavailable to the plant they actually

683
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,400
uh create other

684
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,640
deficiencies it's all about balance

685
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,360
apparently all right you just over uh

686
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,038
you definitely enforced what I was

687
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,240
trying to say i' sound like I know what

688
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,599
I'm talking about now all right so

689
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,960
unless you uh unless you're sure the

690
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,918
product gets along with other products

691
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,240
you shouldn't be adding two things uh

692
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,759
from different brands because you could

693
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,839
cause problems you could have everything

694
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,879
going for the first 6 weeks and then you

695
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:39,000
go and add in some bud booster that

696
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,880
doesn't match up with your schedule and

697
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,880
it could totally just ruin all the work

698
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,200
you've done for the past veg time plus

699
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,919
six weeks of flower so another reason I

700
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,159
stick with one brand is because as you

701
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,799
learn you need something to be

702
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,799
consistent as many things as you can

703
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,400
need to be consistent it's hard to adapt

704
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,639
to changes and identify problems with

705
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,120
too many variables I feel like if we

706
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,400
minimize the variables we can dial in

707
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,839
our crops to Perfection uh if you're not

708
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,159
truly happy with your nutrients you can

709
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,278
for sure switch them but I recommend

710
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,520
trying the same brand while you learn I

711
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,278
know I keep talking about it but I

712
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,359
personally I like botanic hair I've used

713
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:13,159
Advanced Nutrients I felt like with

714
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:15,959
Advanced I got huge Buds and everything

715
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:18,120
finished really quickly but I also feel

716
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,600
like uh everything looked and smelled

717
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,199
and tasted the same I don't think there

718
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:25,000
was much variation if I ran OG Kush sour

719
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,600
diesil strawberry Haze they all kind of

720
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,398
had the same Advanced Nutrients they all

721
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,119
smelled like Nirvana oh yeah yeah and uh

722
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:33,678
Advanced uh it's actually kind of like

723
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,558
junk food it's the wrong kind of

724
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,919
nitrogen that you'd want for healthy

725
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:40,599
plants they look nice but they're not

726
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,600
actually as healthy as they should be

727
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:43,918
okay I didn't ever think of that like

728
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,119
all I could tell is that they were taken

729
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,360
off and for what I paid I could tell I

730
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,199
was getting my money's worth I was

731
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,918
getting that extra that they advertise

732
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,720
but I didn't like the flavor and when

733
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,880
you're growing crops for yourself I I

734
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,839
want the flavor I want the flavor I want

735
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,120
uh I grew with psycho I did a couple

736
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:00,879
rounds with psycho they actually gave me

737
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:03,519
a free box set and I ran it side by side

738
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,039
next to Botanicare and I have a 5x5 Hut

739
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,720
next to a 5x5 Hut everything is the same

740
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:09,919
it's in the same room and I did psycho

741
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,880
on one side Botanicare on the other the

742
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,720
psycho side everything turned really

743
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,880
really purple and it was sexy it was

744
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,360
really photogenic Bud once again I

745
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,760
didn't like the flavor oh yeah it didn't

746
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,319
burn as well and it had a funky flavor I

747
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:25,879
used Soul synthetics from Aurora oh

748
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:27,678
excuse me from Aurora Innovations and it

749
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,559
has a lot of molasses type stuff a lot

750
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,038
of humic stuff and that made for tasty

751
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:33,319
tasty buds but uh it didn't give me

752
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,200
enough Harvest and it didn't get real

753
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:37,240
resiny it tasted super good but I didn't

754
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,319
get the Harvest I wanted uh Humbolt

755
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,720
nutrients that stuff worked well but uh

756
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,158
there's a lot of pgrs and things I'm

757
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,679
trying to get away from in there uh just

758
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,278
like Advanced Nutrients I don't want to

759
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,480
use a lot of pgrs and things like that

760
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,240
Humbolt did well but again I preferred

761
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,880
Botanicare for the flavor that's what I

762
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,558
like the best it's all about tea yeah

763
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,799
now it's turn now it's getting to be all

764
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:59,599
about the teas the guy that's coming on

765
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:01,960
next week is all about making super

766
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,079
awesome teas so for my personal I'll

767
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,798
always probably go back to the

768
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,398
Botanicare pure blend Pro with all the

769
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,000
additives recommended I also use

770
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:10,959
clex uh and uh from the organic hair

771
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,319
lineup and I'll add some kind of

772
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,079
molasses and yucka extract and maybe

773
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,960
some dehydrated coconut water to my

774
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,398
feeding toward the middle of Bloom but

775
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,919
that's our secret so don't ever say that

776
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:22,038
on a podcast where people could hear you

777
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,240
it's actually good for beginner Growers

778
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:28,038
pile on the yucka it your eror tolerance

779
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,960
for temperatures and a bunch of things

780
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:31,519
yeah it's it's very good for you uh it's

781
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,240
kind of like aloe vera on a sunburn

782
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,839
except inside I know that sounds weird

783
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,839
but it definitely works to uh moisten

784
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:38,319
things up and keep things safe a good

785
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,199
source of yucka extract if you don't

786
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,158
want to just go find yua extract and

787
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,038
figure out how to use that uh humble

788
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,399
honey is actually packed with yucka

789
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:47,158
extract and it's a great product you

790
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:49,599
need something with molasses and sugars

791
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,000
in it anyway laate In Bloom so that's

792
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,319
what I would recommend uh if anybody

793
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,679
from banic is listening you can send me

794
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,918
an email and I'll get you my shipping

795
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,519
address and sponsorship info I genetics

796
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,159
on Instagram check out my feed uh yeah

797
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:04,918
Botanicare I buy a lot of your stuff

798
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,960
guys talk to me hello all right um

799
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,799
another reason I would stick to one

800
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,440
brand is because doubling up on nutrient

801
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:11,879
Brands uh you could actually double up

802
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,360
on something you don't want you could

803
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,200
have overlap there could be too much uh

804
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,439
magnesium in this one or too much uh I

805
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,720
don't know malum in this one and you

806
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,840
don't realize it because they don't list

807
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,038
all that small stuff on every bottle so

808
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:26,599
if you use something from Botanicare

809
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,599
something from Advanced Nutrients you

810
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:31,158
may possibly be overdosing your plant

811
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:33,678
with something and so Botanicare is not

812
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,840
going to uh Botanicare is not going to

813
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,320
make uh a nutrient a with nutrient B

814
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,558
that would overlap they would and they

815
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,759
kind of wouldn't they wouldn't do that

816
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:42,879
they know that that's in there sorry

817
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,640
guys my throat's all clogged up from

818
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,120
taking those dabs that killed Jesse now

819
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,080
I should say that uh most of the

820
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:52,959
nutrient companies make their own mro

821
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:57,038
products those you can uh go a little

822
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,200
outside the line absolutely as well as

823
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:02,319
uh there's a few other things like um

824
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,640
enzymes yes enzymes micos for enzymes I

825
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,639
always recommend the hydrozyme and for

826
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,640
micos lately all the ogt products are

827
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,000
freaking awesome and I also like great

828
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,278
white shark myself yeah I put those in

829
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,720
almost every plant yeah if you want to

830
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,119
go the advanced nutrients route and you

831
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,960
want to spend a lot of money that

832
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,639
piranha and tarantula in the liquid

833
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,240
bottles it's

834
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,159
$183.00 per bottle but like 10 or 20 MLS

835
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,839
will give you explosive Roots put that

836
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,000
[ __ ] in your cloner if you've got an

837
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,398
easy cloner your roots will push the lid

838
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,640
off the cloner your plants will get up

839
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:35,918
and walk away wow yeah so but once you

840
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,000
guys get comfortable and have a good

841
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,200
understanding of your feeding routine

842
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,359
you can add whatever you feel like you

843
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,558
need just read the bottles uh adjust

844
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:44,398
your ppms accordingly and pay attention

845
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:47,359
to what you're feeding the plants like

846
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:49,079
if you're just read the labels like read

847
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,000
them go to the website find out what's

848
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,319
in those products they should be readily

849
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,480
available if a company doesn't want to

850
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,918
tell you what's in their stuff I don't

851
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,399
want to use it is kind of how I feel

852
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,320
anyway yeah I wrote down a side note

853
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:01,359
talking about PMS a friend of mine was

854
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,519
having problems with this crop uh his

855
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:06,119
leaves were curling up looking like uh

856
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,599
goofy fingers I thought it was a light

857
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,599
leak during the dark cycle he thought it

858
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,678
was the

859
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:11,599
genetics uh everybody was real confused

860
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,600
sorry I just burped right into the

861
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,000
microphone everybody was real confused

862
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,639
uh but uh the room was correct he had

863
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,839
good genetics and after a few days we

864
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,759
realized a problem his magnetic ballasts

865
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:25,000
were causing interference with the PPM

866
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,480
and pH meter and everything was way off

867
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
so he's thinking he's balancing out the

868
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,599
pH perfectly you know 65 seven and he's

869
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,919
actually making it 11 or lower he's

870
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,798
probably going down it's probably like

871
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:37,120
four cuz that low is probably what made

872
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:40,278
everything curl he's getting it real low

873
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:43,199
uh so uh what I what I was going to say

874
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:45,839
is uh try to get away from your magnetic

875
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,519
ballasts so that when you take readings

876
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,000
your magnetic Ballance aren't making

877
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,880
everything jump up and down and also

878
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,919
take good care of your PPM and PH meters

879
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,919
people Overlook those and they're super

880
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,960
important Jesse recommended making the

881
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,679
cords as short as possible uh in your

882
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,600
Grow rooms yeah that would definitely

883
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,000
help with stuff like having your PPM

884
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,199
meter fluctuate so heavily uh but it'll

885
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,599
take a couple weeks but his plants will

886
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,960
be back on track he's just a couple of

887
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,000
weeks behind they'll look good all right

888
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,319
so we're talking about nutrients that

889
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,200
was a side note I wanted to make sure to

890
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,798
get out our main goal here with

891
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,798
nutrients is to have the correct amount

892
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,319
of nutrients at the right time uh to

893
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:19,759
keep the plants at Peak Performance

894
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,720
without ever overfeeding them and

895
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,960
causing nutrient burn or lockouts uh and

896
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,440
also I wrote down don't forget to pay

897
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,679
attention to your pH and also I said

898
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,159
when you see problems that look like

899
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,720
defici icies they are often from a pH

900
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,200
issue that was overlooked if you're

901
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,360
going to push your plants to perform you

902
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,840
need to have the proper pH I think 6.5

903
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:40,599
to 7 is ideal for most cannabis strains

904
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,519
you're going to have to adjust to your

905
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:45,199
room your environment and your strain uh

906
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,519
the Coco fiber people they have a

907
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,880
different range and then the regular

908
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,839
like deep water culture uh Hydro people

909
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,039
I think they want it down in the five

910
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,480
fives yeah that sounds about right most

911
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:57,278
of what I talk about is soil sorry guys

912
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,360
I'm a soil soiless kind of guy most

913
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:01,599
everything I do is soiless mix indoors

914
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,079
under thousand watt lights so you'll

915
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,879
have to adjust like I'm everything is

916
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:08,278
about adapting all right good call right

917
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,000
on for reminding those people or me uh

918
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:12,240
so during during the veg phase your

919
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,359
plants are going to want uh high levels

920
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,519
of nitrogen as the plants progress into

921
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:17,199
the flowering stage they're going to

922
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,798
require much less nitrogen and they're

923
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,440
going to want more phosphorus and

924
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:22,240
potassium so we're going to kind of

925
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,399
shift into explaining the nutrients and

926
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,038
their functions which is cool that

927
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:27,518
Tony's here for this one CU he knows a

928
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,278
lot uh you hear us talk about NPK we'll

929
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,720
focus on on nitrogen phosphorus and

930
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,960
potassium will go with nitrogen first

931
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,440
you'll almost always hear nitrogen first

932
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,519
uh most of what you breathe is nitrogen

933
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,080
it's an odorless colorless gas that

934
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,159
constitutes over 75% of the Earth's

935
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,638
atmosphere uh despite the overwhelming

936
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,120
presence of atmospheric nitrogen there

937
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:48,439
are only a few kinds of plants in the

938
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:50,479
legume family that can make use of it

939
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,720
marijuana is not a legume oh it should

940
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,919
say cannabis geez I cut and pasted this

941
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,319
from the internet I'll give them Credit

942
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,038
in a minute I just don't want to break

943
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,678
away from my focus here where is the web

944
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:01,798
I that I stole this from yeah I don't

945
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:02,919
want to stumble around and do too many

946
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:05,038
things I'm messing with the computer and

947
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,799
getting distracted uh so marijuana is

948
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,599
not a legume so nitrogen must be

949
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,839
supplemented synthetically produced

950
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:13,398
nitrogen fertilizer is made in the form

951
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:15,038
of anhydrous ammonia from natural gas

952
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,879
yeah that's what I said anhydr ammonia

953
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,798
from natural gas anhydr ammonia is then

954
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,200
usually converted into ammonium nitrate

955
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:24,440
for storage and ease of application once

956
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,600
granulated the ammonium nitrate is ready

957
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,840
for use as costeffective and easy to use

958
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:31,079
plant food natural sources of nitrogen

959
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:33,759
are numerous and include bloodmeal

960
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,638
manure bird and bat guano among many

961
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,919
others all right guys Sean will be here

962
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:38,439
next week I'm going to jump in for a

963
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:40,799
minute uh he'll be here next week to

964
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,639
discuss this all organic method uh he

965
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,200
calls it organic as [ __ ] once you hear

966
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:46,319
about your nutrients being fed being

967
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,759
made with anhydr ammonia kind of makes

968
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,638
you start getting more interested in

969
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,879
that sub sustainable Horticulture stuff

970
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:53,959
right it sounds kind of weird and

971
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,519
extreme like some crazy chemistry but it

972
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,639
actually happens in the soil itself

973
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:01,919
there's a little cycle that

974
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:04,678
nitrates um ammonium nitrites and

975
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,679
actually pure NH3

976
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:11,080
ammonia um are converted back and forth

977
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,320
by uh your MOS sometimes uh you'll buy a

978
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:15,599
pack of mos that'll say uh nitrogen

979
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:18,638
fixing that's what they're talking about

980
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,359
um they convert nitrates usually into

981
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:22,038
the

982
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,319
ammoniums so it happens in the soil

983
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:26,759
anyway um but that's actually what makes

984
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,079
Advanced Nutrients junk food it's all

985
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:31,839
nitrates you want to have some ammonium

986
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:33,839
ions in there too wow and they actually

987
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:37,759
do exist in the uh

988
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:40,798
composted organic stuff um they're just

989
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:44,679
produced usually by bacteria aerobic

990
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:47,000
Decay so Tony's got access to all of the

991
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,278
ingredient lists and studies from the

992
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,839
colleges because he's a college kid and

993
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,278
uh he's read some great [ __ ] and told me

994
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:53,798
some great things about nutrients and

995
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:57,440
it's that stuff right there that's

996
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:59,599
golden yeah yeah all right so uh where

997
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,080
was I'm talking about Sean's coming dude

998
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,519
once I read about this stuff I got kind

999
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,240
of like I want to go more toward a

1000
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,679
sustainable way of growing my plants I

1001
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,239
think it would be better that's my next

1002
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,760
step I can grow I can breed I can select

1003
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,358
phenotypes I can identify problems like

1004
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,679
everything my game is strong now I just

1005
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,319
got to adjust and get more uh more

1006
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,398
eco-friendly quit using so much

1007
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,760
electricity and photo and hydros shop

1008
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:23,239
stuff uh much love to my hydros shop

1009
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,960
sponsor I just got to get away from some

1010
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,000
of that stuff you know uh so because uh

1011
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,039
what I was talking about nitrogen

1012
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,760
because if it's crucial role in

1013
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:31,358
photosynthesis fertilizers high in

1014
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,800
nitrogen are used during the vegetative

1015
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,598
phase of growing cannabis uh nitrogen is

1016
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,000
key to both chlorophyll and protein

1017
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,720
production and used throughout

1018
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,760
photosynthesis for the conversion of

1019
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,118
carbon into sugars and other organic

1020
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,040
compounds so grow fertilizers are high

1021
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:47,720
in nitrogen they're used for rapid

1022
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:49,759
growth they're used to build chlorophyll

1023
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,358
and promote a healthy green color and

1024
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,839
they improve the volume and health of

1025
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:56,719
plant foliage you guys if you see your

1026
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,799
plants looking pale and yellow that's

1027
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,799
your first sign of probably a nitrogen

1028
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,280
deficiency oh

1029
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,800
yeah oh we're 35 minutes in we'll get

1030
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,160
through these nutrients at least this

1031
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,760
will be cool you I should say that the

1032
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:14,159
plants most plants in general will

1033
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,880
intake 80% of all of the nitrogen they

1034
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,679
use in the lifetime during the

1035
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,160
vegetative stage so that's why all your

1036
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:23,559
vegetative cannabis nutrients have a

1037
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:25,039
higher um nitrogen value than flowering

1038
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:27,358
ones then you cut that out right at the

1039
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,960
start of flower it stores it up uh for

1040
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,759
metal abolic processes okay so it just

1041
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,000
saves just chilling in there just saved

1042
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,880
part of carbohydrates actually okay and

1043
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,079
stores it up as energy and then releases

1044
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,920
it during flour so I uh usually feed my

1045
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,320
veg nutrients until about two uh two

1046
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,039
weeks into flour yeah so that I'm giving

1047
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,960
them more nitrogen to have available

1048
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:50,358
should I just switch right away um

1049
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,639
that's what I've been doing but mine

1050
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:54,358
turned yellow way too fast all right

1051
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,879
then I'll just keep uh feeding that next

1052
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:58,679
that extra two weeks kind of seems to

1053
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,519
keep them green for the time that I need

1054
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:03,919
now there's like veganic sources of

1055
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:05,920
plant nitrogens usually amino acids

1056
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,760
those usually they direct you to use

1057
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:13,440
those up to flush which I've not figured

1058
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,920
out why but it's the good

1059
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,639
nitrogen lots of it veganics is way

1060
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,240
different I've grown a veganic crop with

1061
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,639
some veganic nutrients I was given and

1062
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:25,199
it had the flavor it definitely

1063
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:28,318
had cotton seed or soybean meal those

1064
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:30,519
are very high and weird Oran types of

1065
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:32,358
nitrogens usually amino acids and

1066
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,880
proteins that's why all these organic

1067
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:36,440
guys are getting great results they're

1068
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:40,200
using actually naturally occurring but

1069
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:44,079
you nces a high highly active uh

1070
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:46,039
microsphere there lots of bacterias and

1071
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,599
romes so you have to be using I can't

1072
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,838
wait for Sean to come uh listen to the

1073
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,920
next episode with Sean you'll love it

1074
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:51,279
you'll love it all right let's talk a

1075
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,119
little bit about phosphorus uh

1076
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,640
phosphorus is a vol volatile and

1077
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,079
reactive element which is why it is

1078
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,519
probably never found in its pure

1079
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,800
Elemental form in nature because of its

1080
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:04,199
volatility fertilizer packaging is

1081
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,079
actually showing a measure of its oxide

1082
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:10,000
p205 phosphorus is commonly refined from

1083
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,680
stone called phosphatide ored from guano

1084
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,318
Islands comprised of primarily bird and

1085
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:17,519
bat droppings a common biomassive source

1086
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:21,039
of phosphorus is found in the ground

1087
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,358
bone also known as bone meal uh cannabis

1088
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,000
plants use the phosphorus throughout

1089
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:26,039
their growing Cycles but at elevated

1090
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,480
levels when flowering as the plants

1091
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:29,159
nutrient requirements change the feed

1092
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,719
eting schedule is adjusted to include

1093
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:33,399
Bloom foods with higher levels of

1094
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,959
phosphorus and lower levels of nitrogen

1095
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,440
because plants also use phosphorus in

1096
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,400
root formation low doses of it are often

1097
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,280
found in cloning

1098
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,039
Solutions uh so phosphorus basically uh

1099
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,440
Bloom foods are higher in phosphorus

1100
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:48,679
phosphorus improves Bud production uh

1101
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,880
phosphorus AIDS in root development and

1102
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:52,838
it's involved in oil and glucose

1103
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,480
production in the end of your blooming

1104
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:58,239
cycle yeah you're actually want your

1105
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,679
highest phosphorus levels

1106
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:04,959
a few weeks before flour and like for

1107
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:06,559
the first third of flour okay uh so

1108
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,920
boost those up just like we did with the

1109
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,799
nitrogen um yeah the nitrogen starts to

1110
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,519
drop down and that's when the phosphorus

1111
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,560
goes up and then towards the middle end

1112
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:20,838
of flower you want lots and lots of K so

1113
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:23,199
you want a very very high last number K

1114
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:25,119
all right let's talk about K potassium

1115
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,519
uh potassium is an Alkali metal that

1116
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,920
reacts violently with water and oxidizes

1117
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,599
quite rapidly when exposed to air this

1118
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,200
unstable nature requires that it be

1119
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,079
added to fertilizers in the form of

1120
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,639
pottassium compounds known as pot ash

1121
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,680
not all forms of pot ash are suitable

1122
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:44,559
for plants like phosphorus potassium is

1123
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:47,199
mined from mineral Laden ore uh like n&amp;p

1124
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:49,440
potassium which is K is a key component

1125
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,919
in the metabolic functions of plants and

1126
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,519
plays a large role in the production of

1127
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,079
proteins and photosynthesis potassium

1128
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,039
also helps strengthen the marijuana

1129
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,359
plant's immune system when to correct

1130
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,880
that cannabis plants immune system which

1131
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:02,759
help helps the plants cope with

1132
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,920
environmental stresses including insects

1133
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,760
and diseases Bloom formulated

1134
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,680
fertilizers often include increased

1135
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,720
levels of potassium because it helps

1136
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:13,719
improve flower quality also potassium is

1137
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,919
found in both grow and Bloom fertilizers

1138
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:17,239
because Tony was saying that it's good

1139
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,440
towards the end of edge uh it helps the

1140
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:21,039
plant's immune system and it increases

1141
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,800
flower quality you'll see it in most of

1142
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,599
your Bloom boosters it'll be real high

1143
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,079
in potassium so if you're looking for a

1144
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,720
bloom booster and a bud hardener that

1145
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,960
last number on the bottle that's the one

1146
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:33,239
you're looking at yeah so uh would you

1147
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,199
agree with me that that's the basics of

1148
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:40,078
the NPK yeah you want to start high

1149
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:44,838
nitrogen and then end very low and then

1150
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,839
start mid to low pottassium and end very

1151
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:48,480
very high very high yeah and then the

1152
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:50,440
phosphorus kind of like goes in like a

1153
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,800
little mountain hump there's some plants

1154
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,599
I feel like you almost can't give them

1155
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,519
too much phosphorus it's it's a timing

1156
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,440
thing actually I feed them a bunch of it

1157
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,838
right as they're going into flower and

1158
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,559
then when I notice the buds have

1159
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:08,000
naturally stopped uh swelling up I dose

1160
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:09,880
them with quite a bit more and then they

1161
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
just their little metabolism kicks back

1162
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,640
on for like one more week yeah yeah uh

1163
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,880
there's some yeah the if you kick a lot

1164
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:17,199
of pottassium in them it keeps them

1165
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,880
moving it definitely keeps them from

1166
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,039
slowing down your plants don't get as

1167
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,640
lazy all right so we'll talk a little

1168
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,279
more specifically about when to feed

1169
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,400
things to our plants uh when the plants

1170
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,319
are young we kind of covered this but

1171
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,680
when the plants are young they don't

1172
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:31,318
require as much viralization I focus on

1173
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,118
root building when the plants are young

1174
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:34,960
micos are your friend and enzymes are

1175
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,400
too uh we've talked about micos and

1176
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,838
enzymes on the show before we'll come

1177
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,800
back to that uh once we get all the

1178
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,519
basics covered uh that's your ogt and

1179
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,280
your hygrozyme if you guys are looking

1180
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:46,440
for products use them just like they say

1181
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,280
on the bottle those are perfect uh small

1182
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,079
plants want nitrogen to grow strong a

1183
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,960
little bit of phosphorus will help them

1184
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,318
uh build roots and grow Vigor vigorously

1185
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,358
a little potassium will keep them

1186
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,880
healthy your basic veg nutrients

1187
00:40:56,358 --> 00:41:00,078
probably have enough PK to get you

1188
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,800
through your veg phase if you veg for

1189
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,200
long periods you may need to add some

1190
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,880
calcium

1191
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,559
magnesium uh that's something that

1192
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,240
larger plants will start running out of

1193
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,318
so let's talk a little bit about calmag

1194
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:11,919
while we're here calcium and magnesium

1195
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:14,039
are what are known as secondary

1196
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,920
nutrients calcium is a big part of the

1197
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:18,079
cell structure and cellular growth

1198
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,920
calcium stimulates enzymes that build

1199
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,318
strong roots and cell walls magnesium is

1200
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,440
essential to absorb light energy if your

1201
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:27,960
plants are slow and lazy they may be

1202
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,159
experiencing a magnesium

1203
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,318
deficiency yeah there certain types of

1204
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,719
uh yellowing between the veins is

1205
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:37,000
magnesium deficiency magnesium is

1206
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,159
actually what makes chlorophyll green

1207
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,440
little bit of Huma from organic hair

1208
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:43,598
will speed your plants up when they

1209
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,079
start getting lazy like that yeah yeah

1210
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,240
uh so in the beginning you need nitrogen

1211
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:47,960
a little phosphorus and a little

1212
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,799
potassium if you're looking for big

1213
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,119
Roots definitely add some type of micos

1214
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,000
or root inoculant I always brag about

1215
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:55,480
the ogt and great white shark together

1216
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,639
that [ __ ] works great for your roots you

1217
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,280
get big fat white roots uh if you feed

1218
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,960
ogt and great white shark along with

1219
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,640
your mix your regular feed schedule in

1220
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,679
the morning right when the plants come

1221
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:07,279
on if you go in about two hours later

1222
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,639
most of your leaves will be pointing

1223
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,760
straight up and they're praying and

1224
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:13,400
thanking you they're saying holy [ __ ] I

1225
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,240
love that that's what they're doing they

1226
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,400
love that [ __ ] if your plants get a

1227
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:18,519
little too big in V you're going to need

1228
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,920
calag once you enter the flower phase

1229
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,960
totally like we talked about reduce the

1230
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,440
nitrogen uh the first two weeks of flour

1231
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,519
won't show you much keep the plants fed

1232
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,200
and happy I use my grow based nutrient

1233
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,039
until week three of flour like I was

1234
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,639
talking about I feel like it keeps them

1235
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,920
nicely uh nitrogen up until the end of

1236
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:37,400
flour I add some CAG and put some

1237
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,480
pottassium silicates in um and also some

1238
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,519
type of kelp at week three so that's

1239
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,440
calag pottassium silicates and kelp at

1240
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:46,358
week three I'll add liquid Karma and

1241
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,119
sweet at week three also so when you

1242
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:49,400
start week three of flour you can drop

1243
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,200
out most of the nitrogen and really

1244
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,599
start pumping up the pnk week four I do

1245
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:57,279
the same thing as week

1246
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,519
three um we should be low on nitrogen

1247
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,760
and pumping up the pnk I'd add some kelp

1248
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,440
and a small amount of molasses by now i'

1249
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,960
would also add some enzymes to my mix

1250
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,880
I'd be running the whole Botanicare feed

1251
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,440
chart by week five um week four so here

1252
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,358
we go week five is where I really pound

1253
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,519
my plants with food I think uh day 30 is

1254
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:15,199
where they're really ready for sugars

1255
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:16,759
and boosters that's when they're really

1256
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:19,000
ready to get hammered with a lot of

1257
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,800
stuff so I've dropped the nitrogen by

1258
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,639
now and I'm feeding heavy doses of pnk

1259
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,119
I'd be adding my Bloom boosters and lots

1260
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:27,400
of molasses and sugars uh calag would be

1261
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,880
super important for the next C couple

1262
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,559
weeks uh enzymes and kelp would also be

1263
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,519
helpful for big tasty buds I think kelp

1264
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,319
uh I use a lot of clex I think all that

1265
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:40,519
kelp really uh adds to the stink and the

1266
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:42,480
density it really adds to the uh some

1267
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:45,400
flavors if they have that foot cushy

1268
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,639
skank skunk smell that stank it kind of

1269
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,800
makes them come out a little bit better

1270
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,799
if you had a lot of uh a lot of kelp so

1271
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,960
uh you should add some pottassium

1272
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,160
silicat for thick branches at this time

1273
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,079
like week five week 30ish uh maybe you

1274
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:58,118
could have put those in at week four but

1275
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:59,359
if you got good healthy plants I think

1276
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:01,160
they're cool on week five you just need

1277
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:02,838
them for to build those branches up a

1278
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:03,719
little bit while the buds grow too super

1279
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:05,119
thick because they're going to start

1280
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:07,679
falling over if you don't have some kind

1281
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,800
of tomato cages so week five is

1282
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,159
basically your Bloom based nutrients

1283
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,400
lots of blood Bud boosters sugars

1284
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,879
enzymes potassium silicates and kelp uh

1285
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,240
week six will basically be the same

1286
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,358
thing focus on your uh Bud boosters and

1287
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:22,558
sugars and get that stuff up there as

1288
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,239
high as you can without burning the

1289
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:28,079
plants put a lot of molasses in there a

1290
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:30,199
lot of pnk products uh and some enzymes

1291
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,400
in there to keep all of that stuff

1292
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:35,078
moving um you do the same thing up to

1293
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,639
however long you need to go uh week

1294
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:37,880
seven week eight usually don't feed

1295
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:39,279
after week nine you should start

1296
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,358
flushing by week eight most plants

1297
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,440
aren't going to go more than 10 weeks uh

1298
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:43,598
if you're growing a plant that takes

1299
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,280
more than 10 weeks I hope you're

1300
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,440
experienced and I hope all of this stuff

1301
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,280
already makes sense to you because

1302
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,800
that's going to be uh it's going to be a

1303
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,720
[ __ ] for you to grow an 11we plant

1304
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,280
without this knowledge so once you get

1305
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,679
to week eight and you've gotten done

1306
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,079
feeding these plants and keeping them

1307
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,318
happy healthy you need to flush you

1308
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:02,960
we've just talked about how much stuff

1309
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:06,000
we poured into these plants uh now you

1310
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,280
need to spend at least 10 to 14 days

1311
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,318
with nothing but water in these plants

1312
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,519
so on Monday however much if you've got

1313
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:14,719
a 5 gallon pot pour water through until

1314
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,358
that shit's running through until your

1315
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:17,959
tray is almost full until you're worried

1316
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:20,119
about it if you have a way to get that

1317
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,199
water out of the tray that's ideal and

1318
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:22,640
get that water out of there and let

1319
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:25,480
those plants sit until they're almost

1320
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:27,199
dry and do the same thing all over again

1321
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,719
and do that for the next 10 to 14 days

1322
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,358
try to get three or four cycles of just

1323
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:31,959
clean water through there so that you

1324
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:34,400
can push out all the nitrogen the

1325
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:37,318
phosphorus the potassium the calcium the

1326
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,760
Magnesium the micos that we just put in

1327
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,199
there you need to clean your soil out

1328
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,240
you want to get all that stuff out of

1329
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:45,558
there now if you have like really clean

1330
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:49,799
really clean sorts of like molasses you

1331
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:53,319
could use that your first flesh watering

1332
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,839
uh quite a bit of that and uh sugar

1333
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:57,679
display salts that's why all the like

1334
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,400
clearex that they'll sell you

1335
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:02,719
uh cerx is just AE bunch of different

1336
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:05,599
types of sugars um displaces salt but it

1337
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:07,318
feeds all your MOS like basically it

1338
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,280
feeds all of them boosts their

1339
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:11,759
colonization up and they end up eating

1340
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,720
any residual food that's left they eat a

1341
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,640
bunch of it for you like a little

1342
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:18,118
garbage disposals pretty nice he just

1343
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,838
said sugars displace salts you guys so

1344
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,000
most of the nutrients you're feeding are

1345
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,799
salts and your plants are filled with

1346
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,239
salts uh salts don't taste so good sugar

1347
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,400
sounds like it tastes good right so if

1348
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,479
you put some sugars in there when you're

1349
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,000
flushing it'll push the salts out of

1350
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,318
your plants it'll also clean up the soil

1351
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,079
it'll break it up kind of it goes in

1352
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,199
there and stirs it around right yeah

1353
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,680
feed feeds your hungry feeds your hungry

1354
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:40,639
micos which is always awesome uh I want

1355
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:43,519
to go to a website this is where I got a

1356
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,519
lot of the information about um just a

1357
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:48,079
lot of information from this show it's

1358
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:50,119
called marijuana growers hq.com is where

1359
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,519
I got a lot of it and I also got some

1360
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:53,800
guidance from the Botanicare website um

1361
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:55,480
I'm kind of looking at their feed charts

1362
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,880
to keep in mind what I would feed every

1363
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,838
week because I don't have my own feed

1364
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,280
chart in my hand cuz it's it's uh it's

1365
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:02,920
in the grow spaces you know I don't

1366
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,640
carry that around but yeah so that was a

1367
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,440
shout out to the people that made the

1368
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,199
the charts easy for me to figure out and

1369
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,440
they made NPK easy for everyone to

1370
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,639
understand um I think we should stop

1371
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,800
there on the nutrient lessons because

1372
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:17,199
we're 45 minutes in 47 minutes and I

1373
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,760
think if we go any further we'll end up

1374
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,279
running over an hour and you potheads

1375
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,839
run out of attention span at 45 minutes

1376
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,079
I can tell how long you listen Stitcher

1377
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:26,358
tells me uh Tony can definitely tell how

1378
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,519
long you're listening because he runs

1379
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:32,000
all my stats um we've had about 5,000

1380
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:34,119
listens on the past few episodes yeah

1381
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,280
which is remarkable I want to thank all

1382
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:37,480

1383
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,400

1384
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,240
listen um it seems like it's about time

1385
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,119
to wrap up the show I don't feel like I

1386
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:44,639
have much more to cover where was that

1387
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,880
page that I had my topics I think I

1388
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,318
covered them all we're going to say we

1389
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,039
did because I can't find the damn paper

1390
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:52,440
so we had to have covered all the topics

the Cannabis Cup got raided and they

1399
