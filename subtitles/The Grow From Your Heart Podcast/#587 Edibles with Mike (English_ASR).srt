121
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200

starting to work i think i'm going to

144
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,439

145
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,479
that lately 50 uh is right about where i

146
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,879
start getting a little bit

147
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,599

dab

149
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,520
50 is cool but if i eat 50 milligrams

150

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,240
so i ate 20 and i'm going to eat 20 more

168
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
as the show goes on that's that's my

169
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,879
goal

170
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,720
yeah when back in the day when it was a

171
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,240
a cookie your friend made that tasted

172
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,720
like feet and

173
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,079
something from under the lawnmower it uh

174
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,720
it was harder to over

175
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,120
consume now everything's delicious yeah

176
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,199
these

177
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
chocolate candies are really really good

178
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,439
it can be dangerous

179
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,199
yeah i've uh i've gotten myself into a

180
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,639
little trouble just enjoying what i

181
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,400
purchased and then

182
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,759
you know five or six deep you're like

183
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,279
oops

184
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,120
all right man you call and scans some

185
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,638
[ __ ] you said edibles from back in the

186
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,918
day that tasted like poop remember when

187
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,680
they just tasted just like

188
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,680
green green plants you're like why does

189
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,199
it taste like i'm eating green plants

190
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,038
like people were just putting weed in

191
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,120
the edibles you guys don't put just weed

192
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,120
in your brownie mix put make some butter

193
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,199
and put the butter or some just drop

194
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,959
some shatter in the brownie mix stir

195
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,240
that in real good put some put a bunch

196
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,879
of distillate in there

197
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,759
oh yeah but don't just go to the cooking

198
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,399
mode

199
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,879
whatever the recipe calls for yeah add

200
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,478
that

201
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,918
not a bunch we're not we're not horses

202
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,439
we're not cows we don't need to graze on

203
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,879
a bunch of greens like that i get enough

204
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,000
greens in my diet let's not eat a bunch

205
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,759
of wheat i mean you can if you want

206
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,199
to but that's that's not the way i

207
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,800
recommend it

208
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,160
um so we're going to talk about edibles

209
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
i've eaten some edibles i'm going to eat

210
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
more

211
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,400
i think a good spot to start with

212
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,199
talking about edibles mike

213
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,719
might be the basic number one thing

214
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,639
dosage

215
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,840
no learn your dosage and maybe people

216
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,360
are jumping into edibles for the first

217
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,560
time i'm saying know your dosage like i

218
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
don't [ __ ] know my dosage

219
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,079
we can't even get edibles where i am so

220
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
learn your dosage you got to learn your

221
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,879
dosage

222
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,879
i used to say start off with like 10

223
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,800
milligrams i'm gonna say maybe start off

224
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,120
with five milligrams

225
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,240
it uh it all depends on your tolerance

226
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,038
level

227
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,120
and uh when i was working a retail

228
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,719
counter as a bud tender

229
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,079
edibles a lot of people would

230
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,319
um like that i hadn't smoked in 30 years

231
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,399
crowd and i just retired and i want to

232
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,360
get back into cannabis

233
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,519
uh edible seemed like a softer i don't

234
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,900
have to smoke anything i protected my

235
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,198
lungs

236
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:05,359
[Music]

237
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,120
type option to get back into cannabis or

238
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,319
to to

239
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,478
dip your toe into the water and uh

240
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,479
no

241
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,960
it's so so easy to overdo it when you're

242
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,519
when you're eating it and it's delicious

243
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,560
yeah um yeah and if you're a

244
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,159
non-consumer

245
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,720
consuming for the first time at all um

246
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,680
it's so so easy to consume more than

247
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,720
we'll be

248
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,199
enjoyable yes absolutely

249
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,199
so i think uh the the joke that mike and

250
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,360
i both made is you can't un-eat

251
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,800
that second dose when you eat eat five

252
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,598
or ten milligrams

253
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
and give it a solid hour before you see

254
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,878
what happens

255
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,239
i've eaten the edibles i probably 40

256
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,240
minutes ago and i'm just now

257
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,759
barely starting to feel it kick in and

258
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,720
i'm sure in like the next 20 minutes

259
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,919
it's going to get me

260
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,120
it's going to start moving in i'm

261
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,000
starting to feel warm my eyes are

262
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,598
getting a little heavy

263
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,199
my attention is moving around it's not

264
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,399
right here like it should be

265
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,400
it's an edible show we're gonna be just

266
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,038
fine i'm good with that i'm a [ __ ]

267
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,399
professional

268
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,360
well i'm the worst thing that's gonna

269
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,799
happen is i'm gonna get too high we're

270
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
gonna make a shitty podcast like i'm not

271
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,840
gonna have to call my mom again

272
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
you know yeah yeah but some people if

273
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,878
this is their first experience and they

274
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,478
get that oh god i'm too high it could

275
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,720
ruin the whole idea of using it for

276
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,159
medicine and we may make them gun shy

277
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,840
like if the first experience with

278
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
something sucks we could totally ruin it

279
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,959
for him forever

280
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
so yeah eat that first dose and give it

281
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,918
a solid hour

282
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,680
and then if you don't feel it wait a

283
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,038
little bit longer and eat another small

284
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,799
dose because you don't want to realize

285
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,879
about an hour and 20 in that

286
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,879
both of those doses are kicking in like

287
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,320
that's that's when it gets shitty

288
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,879
if you live in a legalization area

289
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,959
you should be able to buy store-bought

290
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,080
edibles that are

291
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:51,919
um lab tested for consistency

292
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,278
potency and it's easy to identify how

293
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,319
much

294
00:08:53,278 --> 00:09:00,480
of your candy bar cookie or brownie or

295
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,760
candy is five milligrams 10 milligrams

296
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,399
20 milligrams

297
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,319
so i'm going to show this this candy bar

298
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,399
this was 100 it's divided into

299
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,240
obvious small pieces each of those

300
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,240
triangles is a little five

301
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,759
milligram piece and so i know just by

302
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,360
breaking off one of those five milligram

303
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,879
pieces i know exactly what i'm eating i

304
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,159
just popped a five milligram piece into

305
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,919
my mouth a moment ago

306
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,919
i know exactly how much medicine i'm

307
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,519
getting i'm not going to overdo it i'm

308
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,479
not going to under do it

309
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,639
one beautiful gummy it's got the stamp

310
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,800
on it to show you how much it is

311
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,480
yep you can't see it in my poorly lit

312
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,838
studio but uh

313
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,159
says right on the front 10 milligrams

314
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,480
thc

315
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,278
or i should say it says thc exclamation

316
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,278
point

317
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,879
like you see on the bottle here that is

318
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,759
printed on these i was going to pick it

319
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,039
up and show it to you again but it

320
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,439
melted on my face

321
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,958
every edible in colorado yeah these have

322
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,880
that stamped on there as well it says

323
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,639
thc with an exclamation point it says

324
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,480
coda on there so i know that every bite

325
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,519
of this is a thc

326
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,000
laden chocolate bar there's no hiding it

327
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,440
maybe if it melted but that's that's a

328
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
totally different story the packaging

329
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,959
this was a [ __ ] for me to open i'm an

330
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,320
adult and this was still hard for me to

331
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,759
open so kids getting into this would be

332
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,959
a challenge

333
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,278
i love the little disadvantage and it

334
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,719
makes it really easy we did was making

335
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,078
it hard to get into

336
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,879
yeah and covered in labels one of my

337
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,159
only

338
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,320
one of my only complaints about the

339
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,719
colorado edible industry is

340
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
i have dietary restrictions and i am

341
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,278
breaking

342
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,278
by my diet they're reflect they're my

343
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,720
own restrictions i place them on myself

344
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,320
i have to flex those i have to be

345
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,680
flexible with them to consume this this

346
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,440
doesn't fit into my

347
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,639
general guidelines of my dietary

348
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,160
restrictions i wish there were more

349
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,559
things available for my

350
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,000
uh what i'm looking for but if i want to

351
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,599
get good and medicated i got to eat some

352
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,440
chocolate or some gummies or something

353
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,959
and i opted for chocolate to be my

354
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,320
the thing dude honestly since i've been

355
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,518
eating in the diet that i'm on this

356
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,640
chocolate is [ __ ] delicious

357
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,440
this is special um

358
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,679
we used to have anything could be

359
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,360
infused in colorado and then

360
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,799
that scared the [ __ ] out of some people

361
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,480
so

362
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,199
they put some brackets around what we

363
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,879
can infuse and what we can't

364
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,040
shout out to the ganja gourmet back in

365
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,879
the day there's quite a few

366
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,639
exactly there's quite a few options

367
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,159
though so

368
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,559
if you're looking for something special

369
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,480
or you want to try something unique you

370
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,000
can take some time on on something like

371
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,278
weed maps and find something that you

372
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,600
want to try

373
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,000
and everything recreational in colorado

374
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,759
will be 100 milligrams of package 10

375
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,519
milligrams a piece

376
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,600
so if you've never consumed before it's

377
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,759
super easy to say oh i'm gonna take half

378
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,680
a piece and start with five

379
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,200
or if you're a regular consumer it's

380
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:42,000
easy to start with

381
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:45,360
20 30 40 milligrams yeah i'm 25 in now

382
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,600
start slow and build slow yeah

383
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,959
it's it's a lot of fun to get stoned

384
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
it's a lot of fun to eat a couple

385
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,879
edibles and go for a nice ride

386
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,360
um it's not fun to get way too high

387
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,639
it's uh like jeff mentioned before the

388
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,919
the saying is you can't

389
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,680
uneat drugs like once it's in the tummy

390
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,199
you're on the roller coaster there's no

391
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,120
putting your hand up there's no getting

392
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,879
off the roller coaster early

393
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
you're on that [ __ ] until she comes to

394
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,039
a stop on its own volition

395
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,278
yep and that might be an hour that might

396
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,958
be seven hours yeah that might be sweet

397
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,078
some tears and some diapers involved in

398
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,239
that ride there's some famous instances

399
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,000
of people coming to colorado and over

400
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,039
consuming and then writing about

401
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,639
it for major publications

402
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,240
and you should take the time to read

403
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,680
those accounts

404
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,240
or to go on youtube and type in

405
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,879
um cop calls 9-1-1 after eating pot

406
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,120
brownie

407
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,000
yeah that's a good one too um don't be

408
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,360
that guy

409
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,600
don't be that guy so i highly recommend

410
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,039
if you can get some store-bought edibles

411
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,320
i love if your friend makes edibles

412
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,000
that's awesome but if you're new at it

413
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,160
let's get something from the store

414
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,679
because i don't know mike may have put a

415
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,199
gram of some concentrate and some

416
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,958
edibles and stirred it up and he's like

417
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,480
those are there was 85 grams of

418
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,000
milligrams of thc in that

419
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,000
concentrate so then that means there's

420
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,399
85 in here there are six pieces do the

421
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,399
math

422
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,919
that's what you're getting i don't know

423
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,278
who knows if that was really what was in

424
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,240
that concentrate who knows if mike

425
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:09,439
stirred it all the way

426
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,879
who knows if i got the piece on the

427
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,240
corner with all of the concentrate who

428
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,439
knows if mike got the piece with all the

429
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
concentrate

430
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,519
i prefer a lab and i know not everybody

431
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,799
some people are in places where that's

432
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,000
not an option they're giving me the

433
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,838
finger saying i'm going to take what i

434
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,958
can get do that enjoy that but

435
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,800
if you've got the opportunity to the

436
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,078
world's not spoiled like us but if

437
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,919
you've got the option

438
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,919
a lot of the states have become spoiled

439
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,319
like us so it is kind of an option get

440
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,559
those

441
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,879
and also i don't even i just this is a

442
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,838
side branch it's not even on my paper

443
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,120
maybe you're getting if you're in

444
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,560
another state and you're buying edibles

445
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,480
that look like they're from colorado be

446
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,679
careful maybe that's just a hershey bar

447
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
or something that your homie made that

448
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,039
they got some bait all the good edibles

449
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
from the colorado packaging and

450
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,120
repackaged that [ __ ] and just sent it

451
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,320
along so be careful if your edibles come

452
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,320
in suspiciously familiar packaging like

453
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,040
if it says reefers instead of snickers

454
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,839
on it or

455
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,759
instead of reese's that's probably not a

456
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,120
legit store-bought edible because all

457
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,078
those have been stopped because of the

458
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,519
copyright laws

459
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,198
so that's a good way to tell that hey

460
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,198
i'm buying a weird edible right here

461
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,599
but i prefer a lab tested edible

462
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,278
something made in a colorado regulated

463
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,440
kitchen i'm kind of picky about not only

464
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,480
what i'll eat but who i will eat from

465
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,160
do i mean not to be

466
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,680
weird with it but like we're [ __ ] old

467
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,399
now like i

468
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,719
i can't accidentally get too glazed and

469
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,278
miss

470
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,920
36 hours of my life you got two kids

471
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,958
dude

472
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,000
yeah if i go awol for 36 hours i wake up

473
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,359
with like cops looking

474
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,039
for me and [ __ ] like it's no bueno for

475
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,639
everybody involved

476
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,198
and so i i used to work with the dude

477
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,399
who made

478
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:44,719
fire edibles and uh

479
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,120
i was always happy to gobble one down

480
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,278
but like now

481
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,519
i i'd make sure it was a really safe

482
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,720
moment to eat one of those where i could

483
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,320
miss 10 hours

484
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,920
in nba yeah um

485
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,839
it's and with the store-bought you can

486
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,360
avoid that like i know exactly what my

487
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,360
experience is going to be

488
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,000
regardless if i got the coffee and

489
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,320
donuts or if i got gummies or

490
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360
breath strips i know that i'm 30

491
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,879
milligrams in now

492
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,800
and i know that i can handle that and i

493
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,799
didn't accidentally consume the bottom

494
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,319
brownie or the [ __ ] bottom scoop of

495
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,679
something with all the potency in it

496
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,120
yeah i know that we're good

497
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,719
so mine are getting me right behind the

498
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
eyes right now i'm enjoying the [ __ ] out

499
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
of it

500
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,480
yeah my um these bright lights dude geez

501
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,519
the bright lights and edibles are a fun

502
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,879
combination

503
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,480
and also if anybody's saying why aren't

504
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,360
you recording with a fancy camera it's

505
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,959
easier to zoom

506
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,480
i'm i'm waiting for a piece of equipment

507
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,159
so i can link up the sony camera so we

508
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,639
can zoom with that sorry i'm not in 4k

509
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,360
today you guys probably a relief on your

510
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,320
eyes do not

511
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,360
see me in 4k for once but on purple so

512
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,440
it makes up for it

513
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,800
um i highly prefer these store-bought

514
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
edibles that was my last note that we

515
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,679
went over

516
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,440
if you can get them if not eat what you

517
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,278
can dude good luck um

518
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,040
if you're making them make sure you stir

519
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,799
that [ __ ] up we don't want one brownie

520
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,360
that's all of the potency one brownie

521
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,319
that yeah get online and take some time

522
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,320
and try to get your dosing

523
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,759
where uh where you've got a concept of

524
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
what it might be

525
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,959
um i've hurt myself with homemade

526
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,600
edibles before

527
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,479
we all have we all have i think do you

528
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
know any of those people that say

529
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,920
edibles simply don't work on them

530
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,519
like edibles just don't work what do you

531
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,879
recommend for them come to colorado and

532
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
get one of those

533
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,120
thousand milligram bars at a retro shop

534
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,320
and eat that whole thing and hang out

535
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,120
with me and see what happens

536
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,639
no um well if they say it doesn't work

537
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,839
slow build up

538
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,720
um one of the things i like to do with

539
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,759
the new product

540
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
is uh you know i'd eat 10 and then two

541
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,759
hours

542
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,879
later i'd eat 20 and then two hours

543
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,680
later i need 30 2 hours later i need 40

544
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,720
and just let that roller coaster ride

545
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,719
begin

546
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,959
and usually 10 don't do [ __ ] but by the

547
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,079
time i'm eating 40 at a chunk like

548
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,838
game on yeah yeah and uh for the people

549
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,599
that say edibles don't work for me it's

550
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,040
usually

551
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,639
they bought an undetermined quality of

552
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,319
of pot at some point and somehow tried

553
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,838
to make food with it

554
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,640
and oh yeah okay it wasn't successful

555
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,480
and it and that's what their edibles

556
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,839
don't work on me story

557
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,400
and that's where it comes from and it's

558
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,198
like well did did you put in the oven at

559
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,400
375 for 40 minutes and just burn out all

560
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,919
the thc

561
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,240
or did you get a shitty eight the mids

562
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,839
right and then put it into a two bigger

563
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,240
tray and so there was only seven

564
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,839
milligrams per brownie

565
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,359
like i see that here and then i see

566
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,720
people that also buy

567
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,079
an edible and they say well i ate part

568
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
of it before i went into work and then

569
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,558
part of it at lunch and i gave part of

570
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,240
it to my friend

571
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,440
i'm like so nobody got high like you

572
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,279
just spread [ __ ] a bunch of

573
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,038
milligrams around so far that nothing

574
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,240
you ate like three before lunch and

575
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,400
three at work and

576
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,720
everybody micro dosed yeah everybody and

577
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,880
nobody felt a goddamn thing from it yeah

578
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,160
i see that as sort of a thing as well um

579
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,559
we get uh you can get

580
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,240
pills here in colorado that are just 10

581
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,279
milligram pills

582
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,240
and i used to love those throughout the

583
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,319
day

584
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,599
and more than once like did i take some

585
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,960
at the beginning of my lunch break or

586
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,319
the after my lunch at the end of my

587
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,840
lunch break i don't remember i'll take

588
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,558
two more on my way

589
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,079
back in and then right before third

590
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,079
break you're sitting there holding onto

591
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,759
the counter like trying to maintain eye

592
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,399
contact

593
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,558
so i did take those i did take those

594
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,840
other edibles oops took someone at the

595
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,359
start of my break in the middle of the

596
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,599
break and at the end of the break and

597
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,359
now i'm [ __ ] glazed like a ham

598
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,719
perfect so you were talking you said a

599
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,038
minute ago about putting the

600
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,720
uh con or the herb in the oven or

601
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:33,919
putting the brownie mix in the oven

602
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,839
let's talk about

603
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,360
um de-carbing and decarboxylation

604
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:40,879
um i'm gonna sound like joe rogan for a

605
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,719
minute here and you guys have

606
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,240
heard this rant from joe rogan something

607
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,079
different happens when you eat medical

608
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,679
cannabis or cannabis it does not become

609
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,199
when normal cannabis when you consume it

610
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,640
when you smoke it you consume delta 9

611
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,319
thc that gives you the buzz that you're

612
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,679
used to delta 9 thc

613
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,279
there's probably cbd and other

614
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,120
cannabinoids in there but then one we're

615
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,160
[ __ ] familiar with is the thc that's

616
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,439
what i'm after give me

617
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,798
delta 9 thc when you eat that your body

618
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,320
converts it into

619
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:08,798
11 hydroxy thc or hydroxy thc

620
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,000
which makes it more psychoactive more

621
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:11,759
bioavailable to your body

622
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,279
it makes it longer lasting it makes it

623
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,400
deeper penetrating is something that i

624
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,519
wrote down and we'll talk about why i

625
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,519
said that in a minute

626
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,879
but that is the scientific thing of

627
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,319
what's happening that's why you get a

628
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,679
different buzz from it

629
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,439
it becomes something different in your

630
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,759
liver your liver heats it up processes

631
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,558
it

632
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,079
it becomes this hydroxy thc which is

633
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,918
different than delta nine different

634
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,359
different compound different buzz treats

635
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,559
you differently that's the main thing

636
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,319
that's happening so now that leads me

637
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,918
into talking about decarbing

638
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,519
when you take cannabis flowers if you're

639
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,840
going to make edibles it needs to be

640
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,359
decarb to make it more bioavailable

641
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,119
for your body if you just took a bunch

642
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,839
of weed and ate it you may get a little

643
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,279
bit of buzz

644
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,199
if you took that weed and heated it to

645
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,960
the appropriate temperature to activate

646
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,919
those cannabinoids you would get a much

647
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,440
better buzz

648
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,038
sometimes that happens in the cooking or

649
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,080
baking process but a lot of times it

650
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,440
will be done

651
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,199
sometimes it happens in the extraction

652
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,038
process if you're making a concentrate

653
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,720
it'll kind of decarb there as well

654
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,919
sometimes you may need to de-carb your

655
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,038
product on its own if you're making a

656
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,640
butter or something

657
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,919
now you may need to de-carb that butter

658
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,559
so that is something you need to

659
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,240
research

660
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,000
that makes the i don't make edibles i'm

661
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,440
not an edible uh professional but if

662
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,038
you're making edibles de-carbing

663
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,880
decarboxylation is something i highly

664
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,879
recommend you do some research on

665
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
that is what makes that delta 11

666
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,280
available in your body even more

667
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,720
bioavailable

668
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,639
there's another thing called nano

669
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,000
infusion i don't understand nano

670
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,520
infusion completely

671
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,279
part of what i read some people say it's

672
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,720
not good to consume nano infused

673
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,200
products so

674
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,960
read about nano infusion i tried a

675
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,120
product it was a liquid

676
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,480
syrupy type product it was i don't even

677
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,319
like talking about it was like sauce or

678
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,679
syrup is what it's trying to act like

679
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,279
but you can just pour a little bit of

680
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,400
this stuff in a cup and drink it and

681
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,599
don't even drink it like sauce just

682
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,960
drink it like itself and know that

683
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,719
you're gonna get lit from it

684
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,880
it was a thousand milligrams of nano

685
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,720
infused drink and i drink just a little

686
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,520
sip of it and i could feel it hit my

687
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,798
body

688
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,599
too quickly it was like whoa that was

689
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,000
fast

690
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,678
so i don't that's scary high scary

691
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,558
quickly to me i could really mess myself

692
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,080
up with that so

693
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,240
if you want to get medicated super

694
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,599
quickly check out the nano infused

695
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,440
drink products they're available in

696
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,279
california not in colorado

697
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,440
that i know of uh because they're so

698
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,119
potent but so you got to decarb things

699
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,000
and then check out nano infusion that

700
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,839
was my quick

701
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,279
uh the part that i did write a couple of

702
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,399
detailed notes about so

703
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,279
mike it looks like you got something to

704
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,880
say bail me out well the edibles

705
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,599
one the the sum up version of what jeff

706
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,799
just said is

707
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,199
they edibles hit harder and last longer

708
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,440
than

709
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,038
smoking it the the other thing when

710
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,880
you're smoking it

711
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,400
you can it's called titrate you can

712
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,799
titrate your dose a lot

713
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,559
smoother and a lot more precise um

714
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,839
i'm trying to think of a good analogy

715
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:45,678
right here and i think it's the edibles

716
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:48,480
that are [ __ ] me up here

717
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,200
um but uh i just threw a piece of candy

718
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,360
in my mouth

719
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
for smoking's like paying for stuff with

720
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,240
loose change like you can be super

721
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,000
precise

722
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,519
but edibles is like paying for stuff

723
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,079
with gold bars

724
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,359
like there's going to be a lot of like

725
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,519
waiting around for your

726
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,119
your change to come back to you it's not

727
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,319
precise at all you got to go with a big

728
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,599
old chunk

729
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,639
like but once you dial it in i've seen

730
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,918
so many people

731
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,600
gross themselves with edibles like

732
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:20,000
um we used to get

733
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,240
vegetable oil that was infused by

734
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,240
someone else in college

735
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,558
and the brownies we would make just had

736
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,120
a reputation for like sometimes it was a

737
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,158
nice

738
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,079
mild pleasant and other times it was

739
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,679
like a sledgehammer of the forehead for

740
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:37,519
12 hours

741
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,280
and good lord like

742
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,558
i've seen people do it the same with the

743
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,158
the store-bought edibles

744
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,319
oh yeah yeah thinking about it you

745
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,000
intend to eat 30 milligrams

746
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,200
the next thing you know like something

747
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,119
funny happened in front of you on the

748
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,679
television or on your phone

749
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,038
and now you're 60 milligrams deep before

750
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,798
you realize what you're doing

751
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,359
yep especially with good candy like what

752
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,359
i'm munching on

753
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,959
the downside is that they come on super

754
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,359
strong and they can take you into a

755
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,279
different

756
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,359
realm i like joey diaz says you can

757
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,720
[ __ ] see the devil or you can see god

758
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,479
depends on what the [ __ ] which edibles

759
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,159
you ate but

760
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,759
that's why they're so useful that's why

761
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,960
they're so helpful for the medical

762
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,158
community or for i'm trying to get high

763
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,159
off if i like to get real high

764
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,200
i don't have to take four dabs like if i

765
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,480
were gonna go somewhere and didn't want

766
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,759
to go dab i could just take one of these

767
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,200
with me and just sneak it into my mouth

768
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,158
and we'd be cool

769
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,919
but it's very uh it's longer lasting and

770
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,679
i think it's really once you dial in

771
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,759
your dosage i think it's cost effective

772
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,440
the edibles aren't too expensive uh

773
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,720
compared to how much i smoke and what my

774
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,080
smoke products cost

775
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,240
compared to what the edibles cost it's

776
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,798
still cost effective it matters out

777
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,079
and i feel like it goes this may be a

778
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:40,720
weird way to put i feel like it goes

779
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,119
deeper

780
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,240
like if i've got some pain i can smoke

781
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,158
and if i've got like

782
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,240
level six back pain it'll take it to

783
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,600
like a three but if you got level seven

784
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,798
back pain and you eat edibles it'll

785
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,399
knock you down to a two

786
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:53,759
like the edibles are just oh yeah know

787
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,200
where to go they're like they're

788
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,440
swimming around in your body going oh it

789
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,919
hurts over here watch

790
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,159
oh it hurts over here my knees are my

791
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,640
knees or my back are really hurting

792
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,360
um i go with edibles to to attack the

793
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,080
pain not

794
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,839
smoking it's i'll sit here and dab for

795
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,720
all afternoon trying to get rid of knee

796
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,199
pain

797
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,640
but if i you know chew down a cbd gummy

798
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,519
and four or five

799
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,960
thc 10 milligrammers so i'm at like 50

800
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,879
and 50.

801
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,480
um within an hour and a half my knee

802
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,760
pain will be dialed back to a two or

803
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,200
three

804
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:30,400
do you feel like the cbd uh inhibits

805
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,919
the giggly fun time buzz from the thc

806
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,480
but makes it more focused on the pain

807
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,919
relief

808
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,679
all right and that's why i don't mess

809
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,640
with you they work really really well

810
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,840
together

811
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,440
um it does tend to dial back the stony

812
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,879
um one of the other phenomena i wanted

813
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,038
to bring up

814
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,640
on this episode ask you if you've

815
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,480
experienced it

816
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,720
um i've experienced it repeatedly lately

817
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,679
i'm pretty good at knowing where my

818
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,200
tolerance is

819
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,600
if i'm smoking flour dabs edibles

820
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,759
and i'll be riding like a nice pleasant

821
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,959
like three or four level high like out

822
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:06,879
of ten

823
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,240
i'm just rocking out at a three or four

824
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
maintaining

825
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,558
and then something environmental wise

826
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,200
happens

827
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,038
and it takes me to a [ __ ] nine just

828
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,558
out of nowhere and i end up

829
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,679
just laughing hysterically oh yeah or

830
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,558
i mean it's usually laughing

831
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,480
hysterically but or destroying a bunch

832
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,879
of food out of nowhere

833
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,200
i love when you eat edibles and then go

834
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,960
somewhere and you're at like the mall or

835

842
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,798

843
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,918
you just [ __ ]

844
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:53,038
bail i'm i'm done bye

845
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:57,840
yeah when i first got into the

846
00:25:53,038 --> 00:26:00,640
this gummy brand um i met the owner

847
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,639
doing a political campaign thing and

848
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,320
then like two months later the holidays

849
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,559
came around

850
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,678
and i needed something that was going to

851
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,278
be even more discreet than a vapor pen

852
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,960
and was like there's nothing more

853
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,240
discreet than gummies

854
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:21,038
yeah um

855
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:24,000
and just fantastic but i found myself

856
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,960
slightly over medicated it like now go

857
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,119
get seconds at thanksgiving

858
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,360
so it was kind of a perfect fortuitous

859
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,759
little moment for it

860
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,479
did you still go get seconds bro oh for

861
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,679
sure of course you did for sure

862
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,400
that's the best thing when you're over

863
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,240
medicated is food

864
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,600
the last time i had a black market

865
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,558
edible

866
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,399
i thought i was fine and i was scrolling

867
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,399
through one of those

868
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,679
like here's 12 funny memes about

869
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,159
whatever the [ __ ]

870
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,759
it wasn't even anything particular and

871
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,400
it wouldn't have hit me like this at any

872
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:01,440
other moment but with my medicated level

873
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,600
and the the situation i was in

874
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,480
i about died in a parking lot behind a

875
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,319
place

876
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,519
like everybody else was in the next room

877
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,599
eating chicken

878
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,599
i'm in the back just curled up on the

879
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,678
floor

880
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,678
tik tok isn't that funny until you meet

881
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,360
up it wasn't even tick tock it was just

882
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:22,320
uh it was just a regular ass

883
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,359
picture and word meme list and it was

884
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,639
hitting me like

885
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:29,038
tyson that's great that is great

886
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,000

edibles

891
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,200
yeah i had to take a break because i

892
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,640
worked with a group of savages and we

893
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
were all just eating way too many

894
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
edibles

895
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,159
people that listened to the podcast back

896
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,919
in the day thousands of milligrams do

897
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,240
not belong on a single piece of bacon

898
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,320
that's all i'm gonna say

899
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,519
yeah we were i'm not a bacon consumer

900
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,439
but there were there were a thousand

901
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,440
milligram edibles eaten during work

902

903
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,798
of it

904
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
but the work was happening one of your

905
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,359
favorite stories

906
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,798
involves somebody getting too glazed to

907
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,798
sing

908
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,079

909

performer do it

910
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,278
but i've seen a lot of other people who

911
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,200
had [ __ ] to do that was like

912
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,480
nope they had one too many brownies and

913
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,679
they're just gonna stay on the couch

914
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,919
till wednesday

915
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,399
uh we actually were at a dab event and

916
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,120
there was a rapper who raps about dabs

917
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,439
and he took a dab on stage and had to

918
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,199
have the crowd come up and karaoke his

919
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,200
songs for him because

920
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,880
he was dabbed the [ __ ] out and couldn't

921
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,360
sing anymore it was pretty funny

922
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,000
shout out to hash it'll [ __ ] up your day

923
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,359
yes

924
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,720
or fix it both i'm not sure both

925
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,398
all right mike i feel like i've covered

926
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,000
all of my bullet points

927
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:43,439
uh do you have any notes written down

928
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,759
that you'd like to cover or is it time

929
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,120
to turn it into a ramble fest here

930
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:51,839
we talked about going easy yes i brought

931
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,839
up that it seems like a kinder gentler

932
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,199
reintroduction or introduction to

933
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,558
cannabis

934
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,880
but because of your inability to slowly

935
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,319
dose yourself it tends not to be that

936
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,559
gentle

937
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,558
um

938
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,640
yeah those are the main points [ __ ] all

939
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,480
right all right i think we got all the

940
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,480
business part covered up

941
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,519
on the show that was a fun show my good

942
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,599
edible lesson

943
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,119
i hope people learned something uh i got

944
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:20,719
edibled out so i'm not sure how much we

945
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,639
taught

946
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,720
i i honestly i was just sitting here

947
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,640
thinking how long have we been going and

948
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,000
that's when i realized how hard the

949
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,440
edibles have hit me and i

950
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,599
honestly can't tell you how long we've

951
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,600
been talking i know that it's perfect

952
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,959
i know what time it is i can still read

953
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,359
the clock

954
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,960
but i don't remember what time we go i

955
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,798
do so it's perfect i'm not going to tell

956
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,480
you because i like y'all learn some [ __ ]

957

30 dispensaries in the country then

1245
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:27,439

1246
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:30,480

00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:43,838
though

1316
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,838
uh the first dispensary in pueblo

1317
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,759
colorado there was one in the county

1318
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:49,119
uh outside of our city limits that was

1319
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,480
open at the same time but

1320
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,760
i think we were getting the majority of

1321
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,880
the business and then a couple others

1322
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,079
opened

1323
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,119
um i'm not going to say their names with

1324
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,480
uh i think i only got the pleasure

1325
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,838
working there for like

1326
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:07,599
six weeks or so and

1327
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:11,519
literally when i started there was one

1328
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,880
and it was metamar and there was another

1329
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,759
one

1330
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,200
talking about opening their doors in the

1331
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,079
county and it's the one you're thinking

1332
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:22,000
of

1333
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,000
yeah and it's five or six weeks later

1334
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,800
when the city shut us down

1335
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,318
there were like eight yeah our one

1336
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,839
friend opened two shops up pretty

1337
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:34,159
quickly

1338
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:37,039
yeah and within the year there were

1339
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,358
20 yeah and then we were driving that's

1340
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,559
one

1341
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:43,838
of the first i want to say the first

1342
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:46,318
regulation bill happened in 2010

1343
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:48,719
and that's when we went from a thousand

1344
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:51,759
shops to 500

1345
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,199
essentially overnight the rules took a

1346
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,839
little while to kick in i

1347
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,879
think it was a six-month period where

1348
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,759
like they rolled out

1349
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,200
the first five big rules yeah and those

1350
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,040
rules

1351
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,239
so many people three months later but

1352
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,480
yeah it was

1353
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,759
one after the next doctor reefer

1354
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,838
disappeared

1355
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,240
the spinning sign people's all those

1356
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:15,199
[ __ ] stores disappeared

1357
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,479
um let's elaborate on that a little bit

1358
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,480
everyone's going what happened

1359
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,159
uh so back in the day we called it the

1360
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,240
wild wild west

1361
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:23,519
you could grow you could get herb from

1362
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,039
basically anywhere it was medical

1363
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:25,519
cannabis so everybody was growing at

1364
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:27,279
home

1365
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,960
and if you got a medical marijuana card

1366
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,400
you could increase your plant count

1367
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,240
dramatically back then

1368
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,440
so you could grow pretty decent

1369
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,598
quantities of product

1370
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,559
and i could backpack up four a quarter

1371
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,559
pounds of herb

1372
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,318
and stop at four different dispensaries

1373
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,480
and sell four quarter pounds

1374
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,159
for cash they would hand me just cash

1375
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,838
somewhere between seven hundred and a

1376
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,679
thousand dollars cash for a quarter

1377
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,199
pound of good weed and i would leave

1378
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,719
get in the car drive to the next spot

1379
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,318
and do it until i was out of herb

1380
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,159
every harvest just go dump them off at

1381
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,159
the dispensaries then there's

1382
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,239
a million jeff's running around the

1383
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,318
state to the

1384
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,799
the handful of dispensaries that we had

1385
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:06,880
and eventually it was like a thousand

1386
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,880
um every shop had different herb

1387
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,559
nothing was regulated there were no

1388
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,680
rules yet

1389
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:16,880
the state was pretending like

1390
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:19,759
the industry didn't exist and so

1391
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,039
the industry kept creating their own

1392
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,240
rules

1393
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:27,279
in hopes that when the state finally did

1394
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:29,439
look upon us they weren't as

1395
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,720
horrified as they otherwise might be

1396
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,159
yeah yeah

1397
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,078
that's a good way to put it led to a lot

1398
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:39,199
of silliness

1399
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:42,318
at the time but um

1400
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:45,759
i mean i it was just

1401
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:50,159
the perfect storm of like

1402
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,160
balls or hutzpah and

1403
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,639
i'm sick of this i'm not i'm just gonna

1404
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:56,399
turn a blind eye from the cops

1405
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:58,000
because if you talk to law enforcement

1406
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,480
which i ended up doing a lot when i was

1407
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,920
doing city council stuff

1408
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,358
by the time we had a medical marijuana

1409
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,240
registry

1410
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,759
in cards they were like [ __ ] it i'ma

1411
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:13,439
look for cocaine

1412
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,280
like i'm just done it's i'm tired of

1413
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,119
them saying they've got a card and then

1414
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,319
i've gotta [ __ ] look at the card and

1415
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,559
then they've

1416
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,159
got a plant count and then they can have

1417
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,358
so many [ __ ] it

1418
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:27,838
like i just you say weed i say

1419
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,039
i'm here for the guns or the heroine and

1420
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:33,838
you know what i mean

1421
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:35,838
it just exploded overnight we went from

1422
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,599
first there was one store south of

1423
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:40,318
colorado springs that was

1424
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,200
the dispensary and they were on the news

1425
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:45,519
every [ __ ] night for like four months

1426
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,118
and every night it was the same report

1427
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,639
where the guy was like yeah medical

1428
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,480
marijuana is a thing

1429
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,879
you should be able to get it without

1430
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,280
being a good gardener

1431
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,280
that's what i'm here for here's the

1432
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,440
weird [ __ ] thing we've come up with

1433
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,839
to pretend this is legal

1434
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,599
and it sort of falls under the framework

1435
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:05,440
of colorado's medical marijuana law

1436
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,640
which was purposefully written to be a

1437
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,519
little bit confusing

1438
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:12,960
yep and the news people were just aghast

1439
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,559
you should go up and pull the footage if

1440
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,960
you're interested you'll laugh your ass

1441
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,639
off if you're not familiar with

1442
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,079
um it you remember the name of that i

1443
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,118
know it's michael lee was the owner of

1444
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,880
the place but do you remember the name

1445
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,920
of that dispensary

1446
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,680
uh i can see the b-roll footage a car's

1447
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,119
getting off the highway and pulling up

1448
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,279
in front of the building but i've

1449
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:38,000
shopped there

1450
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:40,160
um for a while they were tracking plants

1451
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,599
they were to sign like if you signed up

1452
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,519
there with their

1453
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,119
uh with them for them to grow your

1454
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,800
medical plans

1455
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,318
they would have six plants with your

1456
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,560
name tag on them

1457
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:53,199
and they would try to keep track that

1458
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,279
bud all the way to a storage bin

1459
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,679
with your name on the front and only you

1460
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,200
could come in and buy from that bin

1461
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:04,078
it was so complicated um but it was

1462
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:05,358
one of those you know if the state ever

1463
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,599
is like no you're really

1464
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:08,480
a just a big drug dealer you could say

1465
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,720
like no

1466
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,838
patients and medical programs the

1467
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:14,799
caregiver program that's what we operate

1468
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:16,880
intentions at metamar we tried to call

1469
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,440
it a caregiver program because like you

1470
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,680
said

1471
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,519
uh we had i was a grower i was a

1472
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,118
caregiver there i had like was a

1473
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,199
patient's assigned to me

1474
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,318
yeah yeah and that's that means so i

1475
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,000
could do store runs

1476
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:29,759
i'm a caregiver mike's a patient he

1477
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,599
comes in he's like i can't grow weed but

1478
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,880
you can so i will assign you my plant

1479
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,800
count now i get mike's

1480
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,318
medical marijuana card he assigns me as

1481
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,440
the caregiver on the card i get to grow

1482
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:39,039
his six plants

1483
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,720
now every time he comes to my dispensary

1484
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,480
since i'm growing his six plants

1485
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:43,439
he gets medicine every time he comes

1486
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,639
because back in the day it was hard to

1487
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,318
keep up with medicine

1488
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:47,838
also if you sign us up as your caregiver

1489
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:49,358
we'll give you bonuses and extras and

1490
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,480
gifts which now is kind of frowned upon

1491
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:52,400
in the industry but

1492
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,000
uh they've regulated that quite a bit

1493
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,200
but yeah so that's how that used to work

1494
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,239
back in the day and then we just grow a

1495
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:58,159
[ __ ] ton of weed and

1496
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,399
it wouldn't be a lot then they came up

1497
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,920
with vertical integration was one of the

1498
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,119
things that crushed a lot of the

1499
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,960
businesses

1500
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,880
you had to back in the day you could

1501
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,280
just buy it and get it from wherever

1502
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,440
now it had to come 70 of your product

1503
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,359
had to be produced by you

1504
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,358
in a cultivation facility that you were

1505
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:18,239
involved with so you could only buy 30

1506
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,358
outside product that messed up a lot of

1507
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,358
things

1508
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:24,480
people that were basement buccaneers

1509
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:28,480
like me had to quit doing our thing

1510
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,440
the state took a spent a lot of years

1511
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,679
pretending like

1512
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,960
the medical marijuana industry didn't

1513
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,598
exist

1514
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,599
and waiting for the feds to stay step in

1515
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:41,200
and say it couldn't exist

1516
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,200
and when that didn't happen

1517
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:49,039
they sort of went around the state and

1518
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:52,159
created a list of the things that most

1519
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:54,400
offended them and got together and sort

1520
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:57,199
of compared lists

1521
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,680
and the stuff that went to the top of

1522
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:02,879
that list they just obliterated

1523
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:06,078
um signs spinning yes this

1524
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,119
is specifically explicitly

1525
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:12,480
prohibited um by anyone

1526
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,760
in the the dispensary or cannabis

1527
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,440
industry if

1528
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,079
you put a sign spinner in front of your

1529
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,838
place like little caesars does that

1530
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,599
[ __ ] i think they should allow those

1531
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:23,358
because those are the best signs of like

1532
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,119
low quality weed if you're spinning a

1533
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,719
[ __ ] sign for a five dollar gram that

1534
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,119
tells me don't [ __ ] shop there

1535
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:31,039
that's straight up what that means to me

1536
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,400
um

1537
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,400
no advertising no windows to the sales

1538
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,480
floor

1539
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,639
for a while they wanted to pass a rule

1540
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,358
that the dispensary had to be

1541
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,159
negatively air pressured so that when

1542
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:48,799
the doors

1543
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:51,118
opened uh no stinky pot air would escape

1544
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,960
on towards the sidewalk it would be

1545
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,039
sucked into the building

1546
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,000
through some sort of high-end filtration

1547
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,199
system

1548
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,960
and it's funny because they didn't

1549
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:00,838
understand that carbon filters are a

1550
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,800
thing and so they didn't just say carbon

1551
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:04,480
filters um

1552
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,079
they were talking about it like it's a

1553
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,838
[ __ ] bio weapons

1554
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,880
yeah oh because they think carbon

1555
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:14,400
filters make co2 when they look at them

1556
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,599
it uh but that first

1557
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,160
that first i really think it was 2010.

1558
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:24,000
um colorado legitimately went from a

1559
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:26,719
thousand retail locations to 500

1560
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,239
um within a couple of months well then

1561
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:29,598
after the vertical integration i would

1562
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,118
only interrupt you i apologize keep

1563
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,720
going well though vertical integration

1564
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,079
was a big piece of that the

1565
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:38,239
uh the 70 30 rule is only now finally

1566
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,599
fully being dissolved

1567
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:44,239
and on the one hand

1568
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,400
it's an incredibly profitable business

1569
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:49,358
model if you can get it right

1570
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,480
but on the other hand it's a [ __ ]

1571
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:52,880
nightmare from

1572
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,119
start to finish yeah that's like saying

1573
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,960
that 7-eleven can only sell 7-eleven

1574
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,720
products but now they don't have

1575
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,318
doritos and [ __ ] coke in there and

1576
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:01,519
that's the you need doritos and coke in

1577
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:03,759
your 7-eleven

1578
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,920
jacket store has to be good at raising

1579
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,040
cows like it just gets too [ __ ]

1580
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,318
complicated yeah

1581
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:11,440
yep exactly but then i think

1582
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:13,358
the next thing that really [ __ ]

1583
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,200
everything up and made a lot of the

1584
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:18,960
mom and pop the the bros style shops and

1585
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:20,480
i loved them those shops it was like you

1586
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,039
and me working there like walking like

1587
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,880
what's up

1588
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:24,480
bro i got this [ __ ] kush you're gonna

1589
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,440
love it bro you got dreads and [ __ ] i'll

1590
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,719
give it to you for cheaper because

1591
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,480
you're cool bro here you go

1592
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:29,919
like i missed those shops those were so

1593
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,920
fun now it's like welcome to the

1594
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,440
dispensary it's all plasticky i went to

1595
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,400
one place and they made me take the

1596
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,000
[ __ ] tour

1597
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,200
i was like no i want i want the the

1598
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,280
concentrates i could see them on that

1599
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,799
shelf like well over here we do this

1600
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,240
follow me for the rest of the tour i was

1601
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,599
like you're wasting my [ __ ] time i

1602
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,959
don't care about your tour

1603
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,800
but the next thing that i think ruined

1604
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,480
us was the uh

1605
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,000
the cameras and everything it's a good

1606
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,838
idea but

1607
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,440
nobody could afford it like you have to

1608
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:54,000
upgrade your security system in six

1609
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,599
months to have

1610
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,119
a camera on every square foot of your

1611
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,318
cultivation retail yeah so if i go here

1612
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,400
you have to be able to see me at two

1613
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:06,239
angles if i go here two angles i know

1614
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,318
everywhere i dispensary owner that at

1615
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:11,118
that point they shut their

1616
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:12,880
their marijuana store down and opened up

1617
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,039
a security business

1618
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,519
probably the smartest they literally

1619
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:19,440
shift gear shifted gears to

1620
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,679
well this is dumb and way too expensive

1621
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,519
i can't afford it but

1622
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:25,358
like i can be the sales manager who

1623
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,880
sells the other 12 business owners i

1624
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:28,799
know the cameras they need

1625
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,599
yeah that's probably the smartest move

1626
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,519
he could have made shout out to that guy

1627
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:37,838
um down here

1628
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,199
they immediately added the first one of

1629
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:41,119
the first things they did they

1630
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,039
added regulations saying you had to

1631
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,318
improve the property

1632
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,639
above and beyond building code and you

1633
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,400
had to beautify the parking lot yeah

1634
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,400
out of the sidewalk all the way to the

1635
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,400
street and it's all of a sudden

1636
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,160
instead of just being able to find a a

1637
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,920
retail location

1638
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,358
make a deal with the landlord and say

1639
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,000
okay now i've got a 3 000

1640
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:02,880
a month rent you know put together

1641
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,119
storefront

1642
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,559
buy a big gun safe you know bolt at the

1643
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,800
floor in the back

1644
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,200
and you know buy a couple pounds of weed

1645
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:14,240
from a friend of yours who grows

1646
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:15,838
and open a business all of a sudden you

1647
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:18,078
can't do that anymore now you need four

1648
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,960
hundred thousand dollars to improve the

1649
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,720
the parking lot you need another two

1650
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,920
hundred thousand dollars to put in the

1651
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,759
security system

1652
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,280
and the new wall they want between the

1653
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,640
safe and the what the [ __ ]

1654
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,480
and then licensing the licensing became

1655
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:34,159
super ridiculously expensive for a

1656
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,800
little while so all those costs pushed

1657
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:36,239
out

1658
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,160
the way i put it is all the people that

1659
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,118
had seoul got pushed out by all the

1660
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:40,639
people with money

1661
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,318
and you could watch there were

1662
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:43,440
dispensaries in denver i would go to we

1663
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:45,679
would stand in [ __ ]

1664
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,280
line to get product we knew that every

1665
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:49,118
the second friday of every month this

1666
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,839
one strain came out you could buy seven

1667
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,000
grams

1668
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,199
i would take the vortex yeah yeah then

1669
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,519
there was another spot yeah

1670
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,039
yeah we would line up for that and then

1671
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:58,800
when all these new rules happened all

1672
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:59,519
those places fell off and we watched the

1673
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,480
quality

1674
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,239
decline the availability is through the

1675
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,480
roof there was never more herb

1676
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:08,239
but i didn't [ __ ] want any of it it

1677
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,760
was it just turned all the [ __ ] really

1678
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:12,639
quickly with all those rules

1679
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,680
so a couple of places they i mean they

1680
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,799
specifically

1681
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,639
pushed pushed out anybody without large

1682
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,880
capital behind them they had

1683
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:22,799
requirements like you had to have 400

1684
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,760
thousand dollars in an escrow account

1685
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,400
yeah

1686
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,240
um pueblo our city of pueblo was going

1687
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,880
to pass that rule and so i pointed out

1688
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:33,439
that we weren't allowed access to banks

1689
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,440
and so that's you were just insisting we

1690
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,400
all had a duffel bag with 400

1691
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,318
they wanted to do 200 000 down here um a

1692
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,960
duffel bag with 200 000 in it that we

1693
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:44,960
just like i guess showed the inspector

1694
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,318
when they came by to check and what's

1695
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,920
the purpose of that money

1696
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,558
like what's what is that sitting there

1697
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:55,039
for their original intent

1698
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:59,280
was if we got sued for being a weed

1699
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:01,519
weed business yeah a drug

1700
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,040
what's the [ __ ] phrase if somebody

1701
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:04,639
got sick from something they got from

1702
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,440
you you'd have to have some sort of oh

1703
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,719
no there's an official legal term for

1704
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,920
running

1705
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:13,358
a property where people consume drugs

1706
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,240
and i'm spacing the name

1707
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:17,598
drug den um essentially yeah it's a drug

1708
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:20,239
den law

1709
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,280
um but it was essentially insurance an

1710
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:24,239
insurance

1711
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,519
fund in case you got sued because i

1712
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:26,799
don't know somebody bought

1713
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:29,039
something from your store and then

1714
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,160
plowed into somebody on the way home

1715
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:32,159
it was just nonsense

1716
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:36,719
and one of my favorite people down here

1717
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,399
in city government

1718
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,318
fought really hard every time somebody

1719
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,798
brought up an insane rule like that she

1720
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,318
would

1721
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:46,960
like do we have this rule for florists

1722
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:48,719
or or the oil change place or the

1723
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,920
shooting range then why do we want to do

1724
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,000
it for pot

1725
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,358
and if the only answer she was given was

1726
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,440
because it's pot

1727
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:56,798
she would say well then [ __ ] off yeah

1728
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,318
that's right that's the way to do it

1729
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:59,838
i don't think it should be treated like

1730
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:02,960
if you don't treat it like a

1731
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:05,119
ridiculous drug that's super [ __ ]

1732
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,559
druggy then it's not a drug that's super

1733
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,240
druggy if we treat it like

1734
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,920
like alcohol and cigarettes are widely

1735
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,879
accepted if nowadays i kind of think

1736
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,079
it's cool that if you see somebody

1737
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,200
walking around with a cigarette people

1738
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,000
look at them like they're a [ __ ]

1739
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:15,279
because they're slowly killing

1740
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,318
themselves and i love it that we look at

1741
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,920
them condescendingly

1742
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:19,440
but if they want to enjoy a cigarette or

1743
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,200
a beer do your thing

1744
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,880
have a good time we don't treat it like

1745
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:23,679
it's the devil and it's some [ __ ]

1746
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,039
crazy drug

1747
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:27,118
i think if cannabis was treated like

1748
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:29,119
that on all levels like politically

1749
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,480
uh physically uh what's what i'm looking

1750
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,079
for financially there's another

1751
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,838
economically that's the word

1752
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,200
economically yeah all of those things if

1753
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:36,960
we just treated it just like

1754
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:38,639
just like this bottle of water dude i

1755
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,280
want one i could buy one

1756
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,000
since we don't treat it if i made water

1757
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,760
illegal

1758
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,280
now this that people might shoot me for

1759
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,960
it people might steal it from me but

1760
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,599
since there's so many of them

1761
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,559
here not at everywhere so if i went

1762
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,119
somewhere where there aren't a lot of

1763
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,559
these

1764
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,000
drop me off in the desert in the middle

1765
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,200
of some [ __ ] third world country

1766
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,318
where they don't have this

1767
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:57,439
it's a totally different story they're

1768
00:55:56,318 --> 00:55:59,039
gonna shoot me for they're gonna kill me

1769
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,679
they're gonna dismember me and take it

1770
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:00,960
from me

1771
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:03,039
because there isn't any there because

1772
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,920
yeah so you get the point dude when that

1773
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,079
shit's legal

1774
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,440
if it's just like bananas nobody gives a

1775
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,559
[ __ ] about bananas

1776
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,119
because they can get them they're there

1777
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:13,440
we don't treat them like they're weird

1778
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,280
it's there's a million million reasons

1779
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,960
why cannabis should be legal

1780
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,319
it's it's insane the more you look at it

1781
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,519
the more insane it seems that it's

1782
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:23,519
illegal

1783
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:24,960
in uh we're getting there though bro

1784
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:25,759
we're getting there so many states are

1785
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,599
on board

1786
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,839
so many countries are on board i have

1787
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,480
more i feel bad because i didn't prep

1788
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:32,639
and check

1789
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,318
like five more with the most recent way

1790
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,679
off on a side tangent here this has

1791
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:37,039
nothing to do with edibles anymore other

1792
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:38,000
than the fact that i'm high as [ __ ] off

1793
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,599
some edibles so

1794
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,199
um that's what the people want uh

1795
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,200
they like it when we ramble

1796
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:49,358
2024 they like it when we ramble

1797
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,960
well like we're getting there i think

1798
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:54,400
there's only six or eight states left

1799
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,639
that don't have some sort of

1800
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,400
quality cannabis access law that's

1801
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,318
awesome they're a medical program that

1802
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,720

1803
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:03,039

1804
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,239
something i can't wait till i can just

1805
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,159

1806
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:07,598
colorado out to california pick up a

1807
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:09,598
couple friends and then drive out to new

1808
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,640
york and we all have a fat bag of herb

1809
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,079
or our dabs

1810
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:15,199
all of it with us and nobody worries

1811
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:18,000
about anything i can travel some again

1812
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:20,318
man for a while it was like all right so

1813
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,798
weeds legal in colorado and washington

1814
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:23,440
state

1815
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:26,400
and i don't want to go to seattle so i

1816
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,639
can't travel

1817
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,519
but now there's plenty of places with

1818
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,000
legal herb

1819
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,358
our uh medical marijuana cards are good

1820
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,760
in new mexico now so

1821
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:37,039
new mexico is a reciprocal state if you

1822
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,599
want to go down and check out the other

1823
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:39,440
whatever

1824
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,359
ends we could travel and enjoy i was

1825
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,798
gonna say places i might just be happy

1826
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,159
enough just to be able to go places i

1827
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:44,960
don't even care if we can smoke weed

1828
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:47,118
places now

1829
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:49,199
my introverted ass is gonna be excited

1830
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:51,119
to have plans when this [ __ ] is over

1831
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,399
yeah dude all of the events that we

1832
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,760
should normally be attending

1833
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,039
these would be the time this would be

1834
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,559
the couple of months where i would be

1835
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:58,000
preparing for the next two or three

1836
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,599
large events that come

1837
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,119
and they're not coming and i feel really

1838
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,119
weird for that i'd be getting

1839
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,039

1852
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,119
i just had to [ __ ] cancel

1853
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,160
thanksgiving i don't want to think about

1854
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,920
that [ __ ]

1855
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:43,598

1857
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,039
glazed [ __ ] into a telling

1858
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,640
cast our family had to cancel

1859
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:50,079
thanksgiving talk we just had that a

1860
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:51,118
couple of days ago we all called and

1861
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,640
like hey uh

1862
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,920
i don't think we're going and like no we

1863
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:54,639
expected that and i was like oh really

1864
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,480
and they're like yeah we bought

1865
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:58,798
containers and i was like oh [ __ ]

1866
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,519
so everybody gets to go meals i'm gonna

1867
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:01,440
send

1868
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:03,119
uh one person's gonna go around and pick

1869
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,119
them up and take them to everybody

1870
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,160
so it works out pretty well for our

1871
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,440
family

1872
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:11,199
my wife likes to host um she loves to

1873
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,200
have people over she loves to put plates

1874
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,598
of food in front of people she loves

1875
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:16,719
it's like one of her core personality

1876
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,640
traits

1877
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:21,358
in the last house we lived in before

1878
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:23,199
this was a great home

1879
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:24,719
but it was not a home where you could

1880
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:27,279
host people it was just not

1881
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:30,480
designed there wasn't a dining room

1882
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:33,760
space we didn't have a table space

1883
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,920
and especially when we had uh

1884
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,319
a four-year-old and a one-year-old

1885
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,798
there's just no [ __ ] room

1886
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,679
like unless we want to sit on the floor

1887
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:43,759
all crisscross

1888
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:45,440
style with our plates in our laps we

1889
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,559
can't have more than four people over at

1890
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,358
once

1891
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:51,119
and so when we found this place that was

1892
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:52,159
like her main criteria for house

1893
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,720
shopping was nice

1894
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:56,558
what's thanksgiving gonna be like and

1895
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:58,318
for this year to be like no we're gonna

1896
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,319
cancel [ __ ] all summer

1897
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:02,480
she's been staring it down just like

1898
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:04,960
nope it'll be over by thanksgiving

1899
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,440
i'm having thanksgiving i don't care

1900
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,280
what happens we're doing thanksgiving

1901
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,559
and when she came to me on her own and

1902
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,880
was like we should cancel

1903
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:15,040
i was super proud of her yeah but also

1904
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,559
like super heartbroken for it too

1905
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,798
just get a bunch of cardboard cutouts

1906
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:21,680
bro like all the sports are doing and

1907
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:23,920
also i think she's got a local family

1908
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:25,838
scheduled to come by and get a plate

1909
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,599
cool she's just gonna have go plates

1910
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:29,759
ready at the end of the driveway

1911
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,039
that's cool that's people that still

1912
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,960
feels good

1913
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,239
serving people i get turkey sandwiches

1914
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,440
so i'm happy as [ __ ]

1915
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:38,159
yeah happy holidays should not be

1916
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,159
ripping this

1917
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:45,118
pen but it's delicious

1918
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:45,838
these these are dangerous people i

1919
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,599
really want to eat

1920
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,199
more of that edibles it was delicious

1921
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,119
but you can see how heavy my eyes have

1922
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:53,759
gotten through this episode

1923
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,960
yep this has been fun i got the bright

1924
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,640
lights but i didn't have to talk into

1925
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,480
the camera i like talking to you i love

1926
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:59,838
the new camera but talking to it feels

1927
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,280
i'm just talking to the camera so it

1928
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:01,838
feels really weird it was fun to have

1929
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,119
somebody

1930
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:07,920
uh to ramble back at me in this episode

1931
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:09,039
yeah i uh i i figured out how i like to

1932
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,200
have the camera sick

1933
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:13,519
so i can pay attention to you and follow

1934
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:15,919
the show rather than

1935
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:17,679
way over analyzing whatever i'm

1936
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,358
broadcasting to the world

1937
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:21,118
yeah i try not to even look at myself

1938
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:22,639
that i i'm distracting and trying to

1939
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,640
check on my eyes occasionally because i

1940
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:25,838
feel they're heavy uh but yeah i mainly

1941
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,440
try to just look at you over here

1942
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:29,039

1943
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,079

1944
