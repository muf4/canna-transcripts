00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,438
things that will drive people crazy in a

28
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:15,200
grow room perhaps when you go to

29
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,519
somebody else's grow room or you see

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
pictures of a grow online there's

31
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:19,879
something that just drives you crazy

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,959
that makes you cringe I've been

33
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,438
accepting pet peeves on the show from

34
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,199
listeners and we are reading those on

35
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,719
the show so let's jump right into it

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,478
I've got a great pet peeve here on the

37
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,319
show this one came from somebody who

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:34,039
wants to be called JJ my friend JJ says

39
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,438
pet peeve on the forums calmag is the

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,200
answer to everything that is absolutely

41
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:41,599
correct my dude uh got thrips try calmag

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,840
got Leaf curl needs calmag got a

43
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,919
lightburn calag for sure you are correct

44
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,640
my dude on the forums we do see that

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,200
calmag is the absolute answer for

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,359
everything that's a huge pet peeve of

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,879
mine I agree with you uh calm mag is not

48
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,640
always the answer for everything and

49
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:59,839
people often forget that calcium and

50
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,118
magnesium are two different elements to

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,640
two different nutrients that need to be

52
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,399
fed to our plant they are sold in the

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,840
same bottle but it is not always the

54
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,439
absolute answer so yes Cal Mag always

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,719
being the solution on the Internet is a

56
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,479

you I'm going to add on to this a little

79
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,958
bit my pet peeve is just terrible advice

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,040
on the internet anyway somebody will ask

81
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,680
a question about uh why is my plant uh

82
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,840
dry and then somebody will complain

83
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,280
about their lights their ventilation

84
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,479
they'll start telling them all kinds of

85
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,919
unnecessary [ __ ] about that grow and

86
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,919
throw the person that's already having

87
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,598
one problem they'll throw them way off

88
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,439
course and give them 10 or 20 other

89
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,359
problems the internet does drive me

90
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,680
crazy honestly that's a big part of why

91
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,920
I started this podcast right here I was

92
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
not satisfied I was not excited with the

93
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,479
nonsense I was seeing on the internet I

94
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,438
wanted to correct some of that so I

95
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,759
thought I would make my own podcast I

96
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:33,438
was going to do a book but then I

97
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,719
realized that books uh they they run out

98
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:37,840
uh in the Cannabis cultivation World any

99
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:40,239
book that was written 10 years ago the

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,640
the basics apply but the technology the

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,080
equipment and a lot of the techniques

102
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,559
have evolved so rapidly that I decided a

103
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,799
podcast would be the only way we can

104
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,920
really keep up with the rapidly changing

105
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,280
industry the techniques uh the

106
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,798
technology the equipment that is

107
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,959
available so yes um to support your

108
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,840
statement there terrible information on

109
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,719

130
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,680
wants to be called Perry Robbins Perry

131
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,560
great to meet you my dude the question

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,439
says yo Rasta Jeff I love your products

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,879
and I've had great success with all that

134
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,038
I've tried well that is a good way to

135
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,719
start a question thank you uh thanks for

136
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,199
trusting me thanks for using my products

137
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,479
and thanks for sharing that you're

138
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,800
having great success it does say I like

139
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:02,839
to cure in jars and I keep around 50 8

140
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,038
to 62% humidity and I love the effects

141
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,719
that makes sense so far it says I found

142
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,079
it weird tonight when opening my lemon

143
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,479
Jeffree that there are visible oils on

144
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,120
the lids and the sides of the jar yet it

145
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,319
is still at

146
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,918
57% uh this is a great thing and I'll

147
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,199
talk more about this in just a second it

148
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,159
said is this common for this strain it's

149
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,840
kept in a cool dark place I've just

150
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,520
never seen it in jars like this and I

151
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,719
wonder if I did something wrong in the

152
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,918
curing process as in Dumb luck or uh

153
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,199
just great products like I suspect did

154
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,120
yes um this is a good thing it says I've

155
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,800
only been growing a few years but I fell

156
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,240
in love with this great hobby just

157
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,918
thought I would share thanks from your

158
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,439
friend Perry Robbins Perry my dude uh

159
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,918
this is an amazing phenomenon uh I

160
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,959
assume I believe that those oils you

161
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:49,758
found around the rim and the lid of your

162
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,159
jar those are tping my dude I bet you if

163
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
you rub your finger in there give it a

164
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,520
smell give it a little taste it'll have

165
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,038
a very strong lemon lime Aroma and

166
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,359
flavor to it uh if you taste it it's

167
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:01,318
going to be pretty sharp on the tongue

168
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
but but uh if you roll around a nug

169
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,879
around in that and then smoke that nug

170
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,079
it's going to be super turpy I

171
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,360
definitely I believe I assume that those

172
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,000
are turpins that have gathered in the

173
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
jar there uh that is some turpy weed I'm

174
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,959
going to assume that you've done a

175
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,639
really good job with that product if

176
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,560
anybody else out there has another idea

177
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,598
what that could be I'm very open to

178
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,038
suggestions and recommendations please

179
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:24,478
either leave them in the comments on

180
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:26,478
YouTube or send them to me grow fromyou

181
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,918
heart at hotmail.com let me know what

182
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,918
else this could be but it says oil on

183
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,959
the lids end sides of the jars and we're

184
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:36,240
still at 57% humidity I am really going

185
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,279
to assume that those are Tarpin that

186
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,400
have ah stayed there on the side of the

187
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,679
jar during the curing process I cannot

188
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,839
explain it I don't understand the

189
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,360
complete science but my assumption is

190
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,638
that those are Tarpin dude that means

191
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,560
they doing a really good job um send me

192
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,199
pictures if you can I want to see uh the

193
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,560
consistency and the color and I

194
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,639
definitely recommend that you stick your

195
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,959
finger in it and give it a good smell if

196
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,478
you're brave give it just a little bit

197
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,239
of a taste and then give me some

198
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,279
feedback uh report back and let me know

199
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,519
what what you discover uh by smelling it

200
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,119
and tasting it but dude if those are TPS

201
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,839
you have done an amazing job you should

202
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,959
enter that weed in some sort of a

203
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,318
competition uh you should get me a

204
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,918
nugget of it so that I could try it and

205
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,598
I think that um yeah you GW some good

206

00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,239
batch of seeds all right that was a

212
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
great question that was a great comment

213

that how you say that word I've got some

215
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,639
momentum going so let's not stop at all

216
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,400
let's move right here into the next

217

message this one also did come from that

218
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,159
growel tab on iy genetics.com this one

219
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,680
came from my new friend who wants to be

00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,039
question and it says hey so I'm

wondering if you will talk about the

226
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,318
best and easiest way to deal with helmet

227
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,918
head when your seeds first Sprout it's

228
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,960
the most delicate time in the plant's

229
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,560
life in my opinion I me may agree with

230
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,399
that also uh did you run out of stickers

231
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,800

says I also want to give you a great

239
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,318
compliment on the figure and potency of

240
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,639
lemon Jeffrey as I've been running the

241
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,479
exact same phenotype for almost four

242
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,120
years now uh that's a huge compliment

243
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:28,000
you've been running the same plant for 4

244
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,598
years there are um thousands if not

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,279
millions of seeds to choose from out

246
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,799
there and you've chosen to run this one

247
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,360
uh for four years you've kept the same

248
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,240
clone for 4 years that's a huge

249
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,839
compliment thank you that's the second

250
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,879
person shouting out lemon Jeffrey in

251
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,760
this episode that was not planned that

252
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:43,679
just happened the way that it did it

253
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,720
said if anyone is on the fence about

254
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,879
getting lemon Jeffrey do yourself a

255
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,000
favor and do it so that is good

256
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,639
advertising thank you bro but now let's

257
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,720
answer the main part of this question

258
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,240
here for my buddy selective it says talk

259
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,480
about the easiest way to deal with

260
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,480
helmet head because he believes that

261
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,519
that is the most delicate and sensitive

262
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,839
part of the ceiling of the plant's life

263
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,720
so helmet head what is helmet head if

264
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,240
you've grown from seed if you planted

265
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,720
any seeds this doesn't just happen with

266
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,639
cannabis but most commonly with cannabis

267
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,920
when you plant some cannabis seeds uh

268
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,519
those seeds will break through the dirt

269
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,199
and they'll grow up through the dirt and

270
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,399
most of the time they've shed their

271
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,839
their seed their hole their shell by the

272
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,399
time they come up that happens as they

273
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,880
come up through the dirt and then it

274
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,200
splits and you get your two top little

275
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,600
starter leaves coming out and that

276
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,759
spreads out what does happen sometimes

277
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,959
with the cannabis plant is that the seed

278
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,799
will get stuck on top of that seedling

279
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,679
as it pushes through the dirt and it

280
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,679
just won't pop off as the seedling opens

281
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,719
or pushes through the dirt that seedling

282
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:40,479
he's calling it the helmet just does not

283
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,440
come off that's not uncommon that's not

284
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,159
problematic there's a very easy solution

285
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,600
to that do not panic in fact do your

286
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,278
best not to panic when you're growing

287
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,120
because panic mode is when you do make

288
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:51,838
mistakes if you see something that

289
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,480
really freaks you out you want to fix it

290
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,720
right now you're going to do three or

291
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,039
four Solutions when really one or two

292
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,200
solutions would have done it and the

293
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,319
extra two steps caused more harm than

294
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,399
good so don't freak out don't panic when

295
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,680
it comes to Growing if you see an issue

296
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,480
take a big breath maybe go smoke a joint

297
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,879
think about it go to the forums go to my

298
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,240
website come talk to me on Discord read

299
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,039
more online get your brain sorted out

300
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,399
then take action in the grow room once

301
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,319
you've kind of settled your brain down

302
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,240
but don't go into panic mode now let's

303
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,879
focus on this helmet head let's say you

304
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,240
see your ceiling coming up and that

305
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,519
shell is just stuck to there and it

306
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,278
won't come off of there what is the

307
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,278
easiest way to get it get that shell off

308
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,799
of there I like to get a spray bottle

309
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,360
with water just put a little bit of it

310
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,559
could be tap water it could be Fiji

311
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,159
Water you can pH it if you want to it's

312
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,399
probably not necessary for what we're

313
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,360
about to do I get water and a spray

314
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,519
bottle sometimes I'll get some tweezers

315
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,919
at the same time if necessary sometimes

316
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,078
not even necessary but I get that spray

317
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:46,639
bottle and I get real close I'll be an

318
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,638
inch maybe 2 inches away from that

319
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,560
seeding and I'll spray the [ __ ] out of

320
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,120
that helmet head with the water because

321
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,199
that water is going to soften up the

322
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,159
shell and it's also going to loosen up

323
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,680
that natural glue I don't know what it

324
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,679
is that's holding that shell on but it

325
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,719
is kind of a it's something sticky

326
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,239
holding that bad dog on there sometimes

327
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,200
so hit it with the spray bottle hit it

328
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,759
with water and loosen it up sometimes

329
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
that water will lubricate it enough to

330
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,720
where it'll just slide right off of

331
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,919
there and I want you to get close and

332
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,360
hit it with the spray bottle kind of

333
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,559
hard give it like the the good I spit

334
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,919
real bad when I said that not even going

335
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,399
to edit it that was [ __ ] gross I

336
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,479
apologize podcast World extra apologize

337
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,759
to that microphone but give it the good

338
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,000
sort of a noise that's what I was trying

339
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,360
to do so that when you squeeze it you

340
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,440
get some pressure behind it and you kind

341
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,278
of blow some water pressure at that

342
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,920
ceiling head to knock that ceiling top

343
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,639
off of there now if that doesn't work

344
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,479
with one or two good blasts it's nice

345
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,360
and wet by now then you can get some

346
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,600
tweezers and gently pull it off of there

347
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,680
and continue to spray if you want and

348
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,879
that should get it off of there keep in

349
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,719
mind that you don't want to tug that

350
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,720
plant to where it's tugging at the roots

351
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,320
because then you're going to cause

352
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,519
damage to the root Zone that Tap Root

353
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,920
that's already digging into the dirt

354
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,480
there you don't want to tug on that that

355
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,639
will kill your seedling that will kill

356
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,879
that little Sprout so spray it and just

357
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,560
real gently pull that helmet head off of

358
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,000
there uh you may need to do it a couple

359
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,958
of times if the first time you do it if

360
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,039
it's real stubborn spray it soak the

361
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,479
[ __ ] out of it let it grow as that plant

362
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,639
pushes out there and that thing gets

363
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,560
drier as it dries out it may start to

364
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:11,799
fall off on its own if not spray it

365
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,919
again uh wait a few hours let it dry

366
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,120
spray it again and get in there with

367
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,159
your tweezers and just be real gingerly

368
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,278
about it uh don't be aggressive be real

369
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,360
gentle and just take it off real slowly

370
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,039
but water and tweezers are your best bet

371
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,680
for getting that off of there just like

372
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,039
you said keep in mind this is the most

373
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,078
critical and delicate part of this

374
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,078
plant's life so if you do see that se

375
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:32,479
tugging you're pulling too hard wait

376
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,559
just let it grow a little bit longer

377
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,440
spray it again later try again

378
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,759
eventually it will come off of there uh

379
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,000
most of the time they do fall off on

380
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,240
their own if you give them time but I

381
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,720
understand you do want to help seeds are

382
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,959
expensive I understand seeds are not

383
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,639
free even my seeds are fairly priced and

384
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,559
I still think that seeds are expensive

385
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,879
you want every one of them to come to

386
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,679
fruition so water tweezers and Patience

387
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:55,159
are the main ingredients to this let me

388
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,599
make sure I answered every part of the

389
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:58,799
question um big compliments for lemon

406
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,720
question also came from the growel tab

407
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,000
on the iy genetics website this one came

408
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,920
from our friend who wants to be called

409
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,278
Prince charmless and it goes a little

410
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:42,000
bit like this it says I have some beans

411
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,799
from a feminized Bruce Banner that were

412
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,958
pollinated by a regular sunkiss male so

413
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,639
we got a banner female that was fem and

414
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,439
a sun-kissed male that was obviously

415
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,039
regs then it says will a a feminized

416
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,959
seed pollinated by a regular male be

417
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,240
regular and will there possibly be

418
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:02,000
issues with interex plants they use the

419
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,519
word Hermes here I anti the word hermy

420
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,480
Hermes uh maybe hermaphrodite but not

421
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,039
hermy or Hermes I'm skipping that word

422
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,000
we're going to say interex because that

423
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:12,039
is the true word of what this is uh what

424
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,078
you're asking about is her interex and

425
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:17,120
it says these beans will be f1s so the

426
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:19,439
question here is can a person can a

427
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,198
grower can a breeder take a plant that

428
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,320
came from a feminized seed and pollinate

429
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,198
that with a regular plant what will the

430
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,480
outcome be will those be regs will they

431
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,599
be fem will they be intersects what is

432
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,440
the outcome going to be if all of the

433
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,399
due diligence has been done if all the

434
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,480
testing has been done properly these

435
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,879
will make regular F1 seeds they will be

436
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,079
50% male and 50% female and if there was

437
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,679
no interex traits within the breeding

438
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,120
none of them should be intersex so what

439
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,799
this person is asking is can they

440
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,959
pollinate a feminized plant with a

441
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,519
regular plant you absolutely can uh I've

442
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,319
got several lines that are made by

443
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,799
pollinating a feminized line with a

444
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,079
regular line I've also done a feminized

445
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,919
plant pollenize it with the or

446
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,719
pollinated it with a different feminized

447
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,319
plant and all of those make great

448
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,560
outcomes there's no problem in doing

449
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,240
that that female plant that feminized

450
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,879
plant is no different in any way than a

451
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,839
regular male female plant once the

452
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,838
pollen has hit the seed or once the

453
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,519
pollen has hit the ovule and become a

454
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,240
seed inside that Brack there is

455
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,480
absolutely no difference people have a

456
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,759
lot of uh misunderstandings and

457
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,199
misconceptions there's no difference in

458
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,919
a plant that came from a femin seed and

459
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,599
a plant that came from a regular seed

460
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,719
you could take their uh you could do all

461
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,720
kinds of DNA testing you will not find a

462
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,040
difference on those plants the only

463
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,800
difference is the pollen the pollen is

464
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,318
where the female feminized action

465
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,359
happens so you're not going to see any

466
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:45,000
difference uh if you would take a

467
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,199
regular female plant that came from a

468
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
regular seed or a female plant that came

469
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,159
from a femin seed and you pollinated

470
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,958
both of them with the same male you're

471
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,399
going to get positive outcomes from both

472
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,278
of those plants you won't see any

473
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,720
problems any downsides any detrimental

474
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,198
effects if both of those female plants

475
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,519
are truly female and have not been bred

476
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:06,679
from other previous interex generations

477
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,480
I have actually bred a few things where

478
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,559
the female plant the mother side of the

479
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,839
plant came from an originally feminized

480
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,078
seed that seed was feminized it has been

481
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,759
pollinated with a regular male and those

482
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:19,039
plants make great outcomes let's talk

483
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,278
about Morning Dew uh Morning Dew is

484
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,039
Grateful Dog Grateful Dog is a feminized

485
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,600
seed uh feminized plant Grateful Dog is

486
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:28,240
feminized it is pollinated by the arise

487
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,720
that makes morning de morning de makes

488
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,639
