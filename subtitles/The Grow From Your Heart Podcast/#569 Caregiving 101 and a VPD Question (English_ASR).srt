unable to do the patreon thing for now i

149
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,720
will keep it brief

150
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,639

151
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,240
patreon contributor to get your email

152
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,600
read on the show if you send me a great

153
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,360
question and it's going to fit the

154
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,479
format of the show and the time frame in

155
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,879
which i think i've got

156
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,159
i will pull questions from the regular

157
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,199
email and get them on the show like

158
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
you're seeing here

159
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,319
so this one says can you tell me how you

160
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,478
got started in

161
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,680
the caregiver part of your work how did

162
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,159
you find patients

163
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,720
uh must your herb be tested prior to

164
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,120
being

165
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
a patient taking it from you i'm looking

166
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,879
into the caregiver licenses here in

167
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,039
oklahoma and it sounds very similar to

168
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,120
what you described for colorado

grow under your belt

185
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,520
it says i'd love to hear your thoughts

186
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,600
on me looking to expand my grow capacity

187
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,799
legally we get six mature plants per

188
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,520
license holder

189
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,960
so uh let's touch on the main part of

190
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,799
this question here

191
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,318
in colorado when medical cannabis

192
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,680
started we had what was called the

193
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,919
caregiver model

194
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,519
many people want to consume cannabis

195
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,519
many people want to treat their ailments

196
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,758
with cannabis but they do not have a way

197
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,120
to provide themselves with the necessary

198
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,400
cannabis they can't grow

199
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,759
they don't have a growth space maybe

200
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,959
they're not physically able maybe they

201
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,800
just don't care to grow

202
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,120
they want to be a consumer that is just

203
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,160
fine they had to find somewhere to get

204
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,639
their cannabis

205
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
dispensaries are an option always were

206
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,600
an option some people don't like going

207
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,359
to a store

208
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,280
uh they don't want to be seen walking

209
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
into the store some people simply cannot

210
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,519
make it to the store

211
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,360
another way for people to obtain medical

212
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,799
cannabis in the colorado market at the

213
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
beginning of this was through

214
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,000
the caregiver model they would find

215
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,318
somebody who was able

216
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
willing and ready to grow a crop of

217
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
cannabis

218
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
and provide it to that patient at little

219
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,478
or no

220
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,479
cost there was no rule on the cost there

221
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,240
was no there was kind of a rule written

222
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,199
that we wouldn't profit from it but we

223
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,038
were able to

224
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,038
charge you for our electricity the

225
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,519
nutrients our time our energy

226
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,038
drying trimming curing space we could

227
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,879
put a price tag on it

228
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,199
a lot of caregivers did different things

229
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,959
my price was kind of based on

230
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,400
what you were able to afford if you're

231
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,758
going to smoke an ounce a month

232
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,679
and i know that you're going to smoke an

233
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
ounce a month and your budget was 140

234
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,360
bucks

235
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,000
you're going to get an ounce a month for

236
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,759
140 bucks if you were some young kid

237
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,680
who was smoking recreationally to be

238
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,160
cool and you smoked an ounce a month but

239
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,879
you had 300 i was charging you 300.

240
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
i based my scale based on your ability

241
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,519
some of those younger kids that were

242
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,120
hustlers and doing their thing

243
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,279
were paying for some of the other folks

244
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,079
to smoke absolutely but that was how the

245
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,959
medical cannabis

246
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,399
was working so as a caregiver let me get

247
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,439
myself back on track i feel like i lost

248
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,198
my train of thought here

249
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,199
as a caregiver somebody would find

250
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,639
somebody like me to grow that cannabis

251
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,639
for them they'd say hey jeff

252
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
i need cannabis i need about this much a

253
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,160
month i like the strains that you

254
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,160
grow can you like we'll use mike as an

255
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,759
example i was mike's caregiver

256
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,439
mike was my patient when mike went to

257
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
the medical marijuana doctor and mike

258
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,918
thanks for giving me permission to talk

259
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,280
about this because he didn't and i'm

260
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,918
just saying this hoping he's cool with

261
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,359
it

262
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,359
mike went to the medical marijuana

263
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,560
doctor the medical marijuana doctor

264
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,199
approved his card

265
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
on the part of the medical marijuana

266
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,199
recommendation is a part that says

267
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
caregiver or provider in that spot he

268
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,319
wrote my name

269
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,519
when that paper made it to the state

270
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,598
that gave the state

271
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,399
the notification that i am allowed to

272
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,120
grow mike's medical cannabis plants each

273
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,959
patient

274
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,959
each patient was allocated a certain

275
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,239
amount of plants uh there was a state

276
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,918
recommendation and the doctor with

277
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,639
finagle paperwork can give you extra

278
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,719
plants

279
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,000
so mike would make me he would designate

280
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,599
me his caregiver

281
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,918
now that i'm mike's caregiver i know

282
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,000
that every couple of weeks or every week

283
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,759
mike is gonna need a half ounce or an

284
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
ounce of grateful dog that was mike's

285
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,360
favorite [ __ ] strain on the planet i

286
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,719
cannot could not grow enough grateful

287
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
dog to keep mike happy

288
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,320
but as his caregiver that was my

289
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,959
obligation he trusted me

290
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,959
he relied on me i would accept his uh

291
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,239
caregiver ship card he would put my name

292
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,079
on the paper i'd put my name on the

293
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,480
paper we'd mail it to the state

294
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,200
if the police god forbid whatever you

295
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,879
believe in

296
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,240
if the law enforcement were to come to

297
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,519
the house they would say

298
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,959
hey you've got too many plants and i

299
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,519
would say no i'm a medical marijuana

300
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,000
patient

301
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,600
i've got my paperwork for my plants also

302
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,360
i've got mike's plants here

303
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,680
these are the papers that say i can have

304
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,200
mike's plan so as his caregiver i was

305
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,679
responsible for providing

306
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,040
him with quality cannabis also as a

307
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,319
caregiver i felt it was my

308
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,559
responsibility

309
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,920
to counsel him on his cannabis mike

310
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,039
didn't need counseling but there were

311
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,799
other people that did

312
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,120
they needed advice education and

313
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,000
guidance on how to smoke what to smoke

314
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,360
when to smoke

315
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,039
there are a lot of things that i felt

316
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,919
were my responsibility as their

317
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,519
caregiver

318
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,439
that was just a medical cannabis

319
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,600
caregiver not like a health provider

320
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
i wasn't taking them shopping i wasn't

321
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,560
doing their dishes and [ __ ] i was

322
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,479
providing medical cannabis that's what

323
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,879
my job as a medical cannabis caregiver

324
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,920
was

325
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,278
so i would find people who were in need

326
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,599
of my service

327
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,439
i developed a reputation very quickly

328
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,519
around here as being a grower who could

329
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,080
provide a quality product so i had

330
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,039
a lot of people requesting me as their

331
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,040
caregiver

332
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,120
i also had the advantage and the

333
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,120
blessing of being involved in the first

334
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,440
dispensary in my area

335
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,360
when that dispensary we got shut down

336
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,480
because of zoning violations we were not

337
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,919
in the right area

338
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,759
so they shut down our building it was

339
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,360
brand new dispensaries weren't around

340
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,039
yet they were making the rules we were

341
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,079
breaking rules that weren't made yet

342
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,759
we were shut down i saw the end

343
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,278
coming i've got a very i could see

344
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,958
things wheels turning i knew that the

345
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,799
end of our dispensary was coming

346
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,479
i began giving people my phone number

347
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,078
and my business card and i said when

348
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,159
this dispensary is gone i'll be looking

349
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,159
for people to be a caregiver for

350
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,078
that opportunity arose i got to select

351
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,000
people then the state of colorado

352
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,359
decided you can only be a caregiver for

353
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,440
so many people

354
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,039
we were pushing the system kind of

355
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,560
bending the rules i would get

356
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,399
so you're allowed to have six plants

357
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,679
right but if i've got 50 people that i'm

358
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,440
their caregiver for now i can have

359
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,719
[ __ ] 3 000 plants right is that how

360
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,320
that is that the math right there six

361
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,560
plants fifty people's at three hundred

362
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,560
three thousand whatever 300 people 300

363
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,000
plants i could put now in my grow space

364
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,679
colorado didn't like that so they

365
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,039
limited us to how many people we could

366
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,639
be a caregiver for

367
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,240
after that they limited us to how many

368
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,199
plants we can have per household

369
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,560
total no no love no stretches no breaks

370
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
on that the doctor can write you an

371
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,479
extra card

372
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,959
in most uh communities in most uh what

373
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,519
is it

374
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,359
counties in colorado we're allowed six

375
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,200
medical marijuana plants and six

376
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,800
recreational plants that's it you get

377
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,079
your 12. any more than that you're going

378
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,958
to be asking for trouble

379
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,879
so that's basically how i got into

380
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,599
caregivership i had a reputation for

381
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,838
growing

382
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,680
and people knew that i may have been

383
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,600
providing people with black market

384
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,958
cannabis allegedly at that time which i

385
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,639
don't think they can do anything about

386
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,319
now that's all alleged [ __ ]

387
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,600
but those people knew my product and

388
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,879
when it came time they're like i want

389
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,320
you to grow for me

390
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,480
because if i was your caregiver you got

391
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,160
first pick of my crop when i harvested

392
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,720
cherry widow white rhino

393
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,679
uh the flow the [ __ ] sour og when

394
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,600
those came down

395
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,799
if i was your caregiver you got first

396
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,560
pick then the other

397
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,479
people in the hood got the leftovers of

398
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,159
that so um

399
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,320
let me get back into this how did i find

400
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,240
patience i had a reputation

401
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
i just i was i've been around before

402
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,839

i found patients how did i get started i

406
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,720

408
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,160
and i got some plants and i [ __ ]

409
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,839

419
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,039
every time i would go to the medical

420

marijuana doctor i've got this big mouth

421
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,078
i can't stop talking i would end up

422
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,839
teaching people about medical cannabis

423
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,638
there i'd find new friends new patients

424
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,440
there

425
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,159

build a reputation for it

435
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,039
go to dispensaries if the dispensaries

436
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,480
in your area are still allowed to take

437
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,240
in product over the counter

438
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,600
i'm not sure the rules there back in the

439
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,039
day i could grow herb at home or

440
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,000
wherever and take it to the dispensary

441
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,078
and sell it to them

442
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
if you can still do that grow a product

443
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,958
take it to the dispensary

444
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,639
tell them this is what i grow give them

445
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,919
your business card they'll develop a

446
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,720
relationship with you and want to get

447
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,078
that product

448
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
then eventually people will find out

449
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,638
who's growing it they'll want to come

450
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,680
directly to you

451
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,720
uh also this sounds weird but craigslist

452
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,120
was a huge

453
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,920
way that people got caregiver popular in

454
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,679
colorado

455
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,159
the caregiver clones was a real funny

456
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,199
joke here uh the craigslist clones was a

457
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,120
big joke you'd find

458
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,240
caregivers looking and selling clones on

459
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,919
craigslist

460
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
i don't know how dangerous that is now

461
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,958
but honestly that's how a lot of the

462
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,320
movement got started here you'd post

463
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,638
your clones on craigslist

464
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,399
you'd post caregiver services uh

465
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,399
deliveries all of that [ __ ]

466
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,159
find that gray line find that line in

467
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,559
that gray area and ride the [ __ ] out of

468
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,480
that

469
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,078
and develop yourself a caregiver service

470
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,240
be creative be original

471
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,479
uh most importantly have a reliable

472
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,120
product don't be a [ __ ]

473

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,240
the cannabis industry this is a marathon

476
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,078

00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,599
quit treating this industry like a

489
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,319
[ __ ] sprint and be in this for the

490
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,800
marathon

491
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
or we are going to make our industry a

492
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,359
sprint it's going to be [ __ ] it's

493
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,440
going to fall apart

494
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,440
and big corporations will take over so

495
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,680
that's what i see let's quit sprinting

496
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,560
let's make it a marathon uh don't be a

497
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,719
horse race

498
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,399

506
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,959
here between what's legal and what's not

507

527
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,399
how to find patience create that uh

528
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,319
relationship create that reputation

529

be cool with people be approachable have

530
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,360
a no have knowledge

531
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,039
have knowledge don't be fake know what

532
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,680
you're talking about uh then the next

533
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:42,159
question is mush your herb be lab tested

534
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,838
unfortunately here in colorado patients

535
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,078
cannot get their quality product

536
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,759
lab tested you must be marijuana

537
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,519
enforcement division regulated which

538
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,680
means you've got to be a dispensary grow

539
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,198
to get your product lab tested there are

540
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,000
a couple of reasons for that the main

541
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,559
reason is there are

542
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,919
not enough labs the labs are overwhelmed

543
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,879
and backed up with commercial grow

544
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,399
products or

545
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,240
personal grows they just said we don't

546
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,480
even have time for you go away

547
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,959
another thing if the facility is not

548
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,759
marijuana enforcement division regulated

549
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,439
and more than enough people drop drop

550
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,360
off samples today

551
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,800
and that collection facility is in

552
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,480
possession of

553
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,319
more grams than what their license

554
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
allows they are now in possession of an

555
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,519
illegal amount of cannabis

556
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,800
so if i wanted to get 114 grams tested

557
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,320
today and so did you

558
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,078
and their personal limit because they're

559
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,519
not a marijuana enforcement division

560
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,758
regulated facility they're allowed to

561
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,799
have

562
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,680
up to uh six uh two ounces of product uh

563
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,439
depending on their

564
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,198
they can have two ounces i think so as

565
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,320
soon as they pass two ounces of product

566
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,758
they're now illegal

567
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,680
they can't have two ounces of weed in

568
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,320
the building they're breaking all kinds

569
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,159
of rules

570
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,480
so they can't receive your samples to

571
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,919
test them there is a loophole

572
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,600
um let's talk about this in hypothetical

573
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,319
there is a hypothetical situation that

574
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,199
happens

575
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,120
we do have a large hemp industry here in

576
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,120
colorado and your hemp must be tested to

577
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,519
verify that it is not hot hot meaning it

578
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,879
is

579
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,198
over 0.03 percent thc if you got too

580
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,439
much

581
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,359
thc in it that is cannabis it's not hemp

582
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,319
it must be labeled cannabis or destroyed

583
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,918
because that is not

584
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,759
a sellable hemp that is now weed

585
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,480
marijuana it's totally differently

586
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,640
regulated

587
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,720
your crop is no good as hemp so we have

588
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,640
to have all of our hemp tested

589
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,919
there's nothing to stop a grower from

590
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,759
taking his crop

591
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,959
to a hemp testing facility and having

592
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,480
them test it

593
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,000
the bad thing that happens is they give

594
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,038
you back a paper that says

595
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
you have failed the hemp test your hemp

596
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,919
does not have

597
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,038
less than three percent thc it's got

598
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,280
like 24

599
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,079
thc this hemp is no good this is

600
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,119
cannabis

601
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,199
and then you have to look at the guy

602
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,879
with a straight face and go i [ __ ] up

603
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,558
i wonder what i did wrong with my hemp

604
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,000
wink wink and then you get to go home

605
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,319
and you go i got a 23

606
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,240
test on my weed that is the way around

607
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,599
it don't tell anybody that i told you

608
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,519
definitely don't tell the people at the

609
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,959
lab that that is your intention go in

610
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,000
there acting like you're testing your

611
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,640
hemp and then when you find out that

612
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,640
your hemp is amazingly high in thc

613
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,919
be shocked act appalled and then go home

614
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,759
and call your friends and celebrate and

615
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,520
post the lab results to social media

616
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,679
so that is the way to get your stuff

617
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,000
tested in a colorado market

618
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,919
i don't know the availability of testing

619
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,519
in the oklahoma market

620
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,759

621

legally

668
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,919
so i get the idea the more caregiver

669
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,798
cards you have the more plants you can

670
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,240
grow

671
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:33,679
don't forget that just because you're

672
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,599
growing more plants doesn't mean you got

673
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,519
more herb you've got people relying on

674
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,558
you for that product maybe you can move

675
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,400
a little bit more of it

676
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,079
but you do have those people gave you

677
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,759
their rights they've given away their

678
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,960
grow rights to you they're relying on

679
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,960
you they're trusting you

680
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,798
respect that [ __ ] give them a quality

681
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,319
safe clean product and don't profit

682
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,279
ridiculously you got to make some money

683
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,399
you got to cover the lights and

684
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,160
nutrients all that

685
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,519
don't get rich off these people it is

686
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,960
very important that you don't focus on

687
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,000
making a lot of money off the people

688
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,600
you're caregiving for

689
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,960
make sure they are well make sure they

690
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,480
are provided for make sure they've got

691
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,038
the strains that they need for their

692
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,720
medical

693
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,240
ailments or their conditions whatever

694
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,839
you want to call it if you need to make

695
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,519
some profit make that profit

696
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,759
off of those black market folks like i

697
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,599
said earlier i had some older patients

698
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,519
that were on a fixed income not making a

699
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,279
lot of money i made sure they got the

700
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,079
medicine they needed for the budget that

701
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,519
they had

702
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,359
sometimes if they didn't have the budget

703
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,200
guess what they still got the medicine

704
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,798
and those younger guys that park out

705
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,400
front leave the music up too loud leave

706
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,119
their girlfriend in the car run in run

707
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,798
out

708
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,479
they covered the extra cost you'll learn

709
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,679
how to balance that economy so that your

710
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,038
pocket doesn't dwindle

711
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,200
and nobody feels like they're getting

712
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,720
slighted in your cannabis endeavors

713
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,038
all right where else am i in this

714
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,440
message two more quick things all right

715
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,798
it says your lapel mic is okay yeah i

716
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,080
felt the lapel mic was okay i've

717
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:45,599
listened to a couple of those episodes

718
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,158
it doesn't have the boom that this mic

719
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,000
has

720
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,760
i'm going to stick with this mic i like

721
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,839
this one better i like that i looked

722
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,119
more freed up i was more free but this

723
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,959
microphone here is comfortable i can put

724
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,558
my arm on it i could grab the mic

725
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,079
i caught myself reaching for the mic

726
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:58,399
that wasn't there when i had the lapel

727
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,960
mic

728
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,000
on so i appreciate that compliment it

729
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
says the lapel mic

730
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,679
is okay the boom mic has a much wider

731
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,959
frequency response and sounds much

732
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,640
better to my ears

733
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,038
i play bass with some other local

734
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,759
musicians so take that for what you will

735
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,279
um you lost all credibility at the word

736
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,879
i play bass no i'm just kidding bro i'm

737
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,678
a drummer so it's my job to pick on the

738
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,600
bass player

739
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,038
uh i'm in a band as well was in a band

740
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,918
as well i know what it's like picking on

741
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:23,599
other musicians

742
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,200
the bass player there are so many

743
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,639
[ __ ] bass player jokes i love it

744
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,759
shout out to the bass players the drums

745
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,720
and the bass are the king

746
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,519
of the dance uh and you're very accurate

747
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,759
with your uh

748
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,558
observation and assessment this mic does

749
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,879
provide a much

750
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,399
boomier uh i call it the god mic when

751
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,120
i'm on zoom videos with other people and

752
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,440
they're using like

753
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,959
iphone [ __ ] lapel mics and [ __ ] i'm

754
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,240
like hello it's god my mic will

755
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
overpower all of you

756
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,759
i can just talk right over anybody if i

757
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,359
want so i do love this mic

758
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,200
that is much more powerful thank you for

759
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:51,678
noticing says take that for what you

760
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
will

761
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,038
i'm taking it that i should stick with

762
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,519
this mic and only use the lapel mic in

763
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,279
other environments and situations

764
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,558
then i like the last part of your

765
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,038
message it says

766
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,279
lastly park mike right in front of a

767
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,720
wall so he can't back away from the mic

768
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,480
like he is prone to do

769
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,000
the dude has some great stuff when we

770
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,599
can hear him so

771
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,200
that's a really good [ __ ] way to do

772
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,480
that i put the mic right in front of

773
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,679
mike and put a wall back there so we

774
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,120
can't keep leaning back off the

775
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,600
microphone we can't miss stuff he's

776
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,000
saying

777
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,000
uh that is a good idea unfortunately

778
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,839
mike uh lives at a different spot and i

779
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,759
can't really control where the walls are

780
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,759
but i will make sure that mike gets his

781
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,119
mic adjusted we get the levels on mike a

782
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,798
little more appropriate because the dude

783
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,038
does have some great [ __ ] to say

784
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,319
and i've got him writing a full episode

785
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,079
he's been focusing that's why i haven't

786
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,158
seen him for a minute he's been focusing

787
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,759
on writing his own podcast episode i'm

788
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,360
going to highlight mike on the show

789
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,038
i know when he's on here i do over talk

790
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,479
him i do kind of i'm trying to steer a

791
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:45,759
show i give him his opportunity but

792
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,558
sometimes i'm like you've been going for

793
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,079
six minutes

794
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,918
i want to go a different direction let's

795
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,399
drive the show i try not to cut him off

796
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,919
but

797
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,080
i'm gonna give him the opportunity to do

798
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,280
basically his own show i will be there

799
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,480
driving the show but i'm just going to

800
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,038
kind of stay out of the way and let him

801
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,279
talk

802
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,079
so you're right he does have some great

803
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,079
[ __ ] to say

804
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,759
if and when we can hear him so mike uh

805
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,279

806

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,000
you need more content so let's keep

833
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,440
going this one goes like this this

834
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,119
one is from our friend bapsta it says

835
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,000
hey ross to jeff i got a question for

836
00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:00,158
you about vpd

837
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,679
i recently purchased the pulse monitor

838
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,520
and i want to get my grow tint in

839
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,080
perfect condition

840
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,720
i'm running a 4x8 gorilla grow tent with

841
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:12,000
two hlg

842
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:15,440
550s and uv light does vpd matter

843
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,798
at night and if so what is recommended

844
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,120
uh during lights on what do you

845
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:19,599
recommend the best vpd and also any of

846
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,239
tips

847
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,119
any tips on achieving this number i

848
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,278
started five

849
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,558
ten gallons with lemon jeffrey and i'll

850
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,599
post pics as i go

851
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:31,519
on cannabis thank you for the help sir

852
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,879
from basta and then he signed it with

853
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,278
hashtag ire

854
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,679
army big up to the ire army big shout

855
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:41,759
out to our buddy bapsta this is a great

856
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,679
question asking about vpd

857
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,200
um they recently grabbed a pulse monitor

858
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,360
which will tell you the

859
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,120
vpd the temperature the humidity will

860
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,439
give you a lot of great feedback

861
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,959
on that grow space he says he wants to

862
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,558
get in perfect condition

863
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,079
uh sounds like he's got enough light in

864
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,639
there he wants to know

865
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,439
if the vpd is going to matter at night

866
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,480
and if so

867
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,240
what do i recommend

868
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,519
i really like charts i really like

869
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,200
monitors but

870
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,240
the plants are the boss if the plants

871
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
look happy

872
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,240
give them what makes them look happy

873
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,079
there is a vpd chart that will show you

874
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,159
standard ideas of where to get your

875
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,759
temperature and humidity

876
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,039
if you can't get the temperature at a

877
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,720
certain range you can adjust the

878
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,158
humidity to go with that range if you

879
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
can't get the humidity at a certain

880
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,720
range or if the

881
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,558
humidity is able to stay at a certain

882
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,919
range adjust the temperature to go to

883
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,359
that range

884
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,600
it's all about what works for your

885
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,599
environment and your plants the plants

886
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,199
are the boss the monitors are great the

887
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,278
equipment is [ __ ] awesome

888
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,720
all the information is [ __ ] wonderful

889
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,000
but keeping an eye on the plants

890
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,360
is the key now i know you want numbers

891
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,919
you want details

892
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,678
so i'm going to give you ideas of my vpd

893
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,520
and my temperature and humidity

894
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,360
whatever you're running during the day

895
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,918
what is making the plants happy during

896
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,119
the day

897
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,240
time i would recommend running about 5

898
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,038
to 10 degrees

899
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,440
cooler during your night cycle the vpd

900
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:03,359
does

901
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,200
matter during the night cycle just as

902
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,639
much during the day don't overlook that

903
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,880
nighttime vpd

904
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,000
we do need that vpd during the night

905
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,200
dialed in so

906
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,599
temperature i would say 5 to 10 degrees

907
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,038
cooler than your daytime temperature

908
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,798
maybe 15 degrees

909
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,319
definitely don't hit that 20 degree

910
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,000
temperature swing so

911
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:23,519
if you're running at 80 degrees during

912
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,798
the day and the plants look happy

913
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,798
let's go 75 70 degrees at night

914
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,000
don't go more than 10 degrees 5 to 10

915
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,400
degree temperature swing and your

916
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,558
diurnal swing is going to be perfect

917
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,519
for humidity i would follow the same

918
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,399
guidelines

919
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,918
about 5 to 10 percent more humid at

920
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,679
night would be acceptable

921
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,919
let's not go more than ten to twenty

922
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,200
percent difference in our humidity in

923
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,679
our night cycle

924
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,400
so five to ten percent maybe ten to

925
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,960
twenty percent

926
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,600
maximum difference in our daytime and

927
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,159
night time

928
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,158
relative humidity and temperature i

929
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,760
don't know the exact vpd number that

930
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,520
you're going to want to hit

931
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:00,798
it's going to be challenging to get the

932
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,960
exact vpd

933
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,400
either your temperature or your humidity

934
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,558
are going to be kind of set

935
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,759
based on your room and where the grow is

936
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,558
one of those is going to be hard to

937
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,240
control

938
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,079
match the other one with that if you've

939
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,120
got a vpd chart it'll show you when the

940
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,480
humidity is here you want the

941
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,918
temperature here when the temperature's

942
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,759
here you want the humidity here

943
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,200
find where you can make that work but

944
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,440
most importantly

945
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,960
watch the plants if the plants are

946
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,080
curling up it's too hot

947
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,319
if the leaves are getting kind of

948
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,079
brittle and skinny it's too dry

949
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,678
if they're starting to droop and hang it

950
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,278
could be a lot of different things

951
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,440
pay attention to the plants the plants

952
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,558
are always the boss i love the equipment

953
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,240
i love that you want to get things

954
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,278
dialed in and i wish that i had a better

955
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,278
number for you

956
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:40,720
look at a vpd chart see where your

957
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:41,759
temperature is see where your your

958
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,278
humidity is

959
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,359
see which one you can correct and get

960
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,839
right where you want it look at the vbd

961
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,278
chart

962
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,879
see if you're matching up with something

963
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,640
on there getting a value which you

964
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,159
think will work for your plants then

965
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,240
look at the plants and see how they are

966
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,480
reacting to those values

967
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,759
i know you want numbers the plants don't

968
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,319
know what numbers are

969
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,119
so make the plants happy adjust to the

970
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,119
plants

971
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,239
once you've got that room dialed in you

972
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,319
can use the monitor

973
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,159
to make sure that your vpd is where you

974
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,038
want it but let the plants tell you what

975
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,039
they want

976
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,798
then use the monitor to get it there and

977
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,319
keep it there all the time that is my

978
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,960
recommendation

979
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,000
best vpd also any tips on achieving the

980
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,440
number

981
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,880
watch the plants and then set the

982
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,960
equipment accordingly you may need a

983
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,640
humidifier and a dehumidifier

984
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,640
uh you may need an air conditioner you

985
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,200
may need a heater uh use all of the

986
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,278
equipment

987
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,319
appropriately and you're just gonna have

988
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,398
to experiment

989
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,558
uh you may need to increase or reduce

990
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,639
your intake and outtake of air

991
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,000
all of that stuff depends on where the

992
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,080
room is what the

993
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,079
environment is in which the grow tint is

994
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,599
in is that grow room really hot is that

995
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,480
grow room really cold that grow room

996
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,599
really dry

997
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,038
you're gonna have to work with what

998
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,879
you've got and you're gonna have to let

i feel like i kind of left you in the

1018
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,240
dark and said watch the plants

1019
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,159
and let the plants tell you the vpd and

1020
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,960
then use the meters to keep that

1021
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
constant

1022
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,640
but they're plants they're the boss the

1023
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,558
meters are cool we're really smart

1024
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,559
the plants are the [ __ ] rulers they

1025
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,918
tell us what to do we become slaves to
