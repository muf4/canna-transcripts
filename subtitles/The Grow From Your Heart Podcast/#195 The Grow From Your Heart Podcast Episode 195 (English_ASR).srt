haul you either that tote of soil I'm

100
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,569
sure a lot of guys are saying how much

101
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:23,098
is a tote of soil Rasta Jeff it's a

102
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:25,680
really good question the answer is a

103
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:29,219
total soil is 54 cubic feet which is

104
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,720
about 350 gallons it's all in one bag

105
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,220
also so instead of buying a whole bunch

106
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,330
of bags you got one big bag friendly so

107
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,400
if you're running three gallon pots

108
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:41,310
that's a hundred and sixteen three

109
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,769
gallon pots if you run five gallon pots

110
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,478
that's 75 gallon pots if you run seven

111
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:47,848
gallon pots like I like to do that's

112
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:51,329
fifty seven gallon pots so that's not a

113
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:53,579
bad deal at all there hydro indoor

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,180
morning on July 23rd so it is officially

167
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,180
the birthday of his Imperial Majesty

168
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,459
King Haile Selassie I'd the first so if

169
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,750
you know what that is who that is you

170
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:05,219
understand why I'm given thanks and

171
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,110
praise many thanks and praise many

172
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,680
birthday blessings to king Haile

173
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,850
Selassie I the first let's take a little

174
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,350
half a second of silence because it's a

175
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,879
podcast a moment of silence would be

176
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:18,379
ridiculous so here's a half a second of

177
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,379
silence for king selassie i the first

178
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:24,019
all right gotta keep moving much respect

179
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,300
I am sad to inform you I'm gonna turn

180
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,469
the music way down for this one also I'm

181
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,740
sad to inform you we had an event

182
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,000
scheduled for July 27th at the Brickyard

183
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,710
I've been talking about it quite a bit

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,979
we're trying to get that hookah bar

185
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:39,469
turned into a dad bar unfortunately it's

186
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,930
not going to happen the event is

187
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,909
canceled and that place is not going to

188
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,069
get to be turned into a smoking

189
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:48,009
establishment I apologize for

190
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,379
advertising an event that didn't happen

191
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:53,000
the city is against us every step of the

192
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:54,470
way they do not want us to get this

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,750
place open they do not want us to have

194
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,550
our event I planned on taking live

195
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,929
plants to the event so that we could do

196
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:02,179
a little bit of Education and I could

197
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:04,219
show a male plant a female plant I had

198
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:09,639
plants in different stages of flower for

199
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:11,629
this event but we can't teach plants the

200
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,949
city would confiscate the plants we

201
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:14,840
can't risk taking plants and getting

202
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,520
them taken I just can't do that to

203
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,870
myself that's medicine for my patients

204
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,909
on the caregiver and they're gonna need

205
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,159
that medicine so I can't do that so

206
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:24,199
unfortunately the event that I had

207
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,649
planned that I had talked about for July

208
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,270
27th at the Brickyard is canceled we

209
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:31,250
couldn't come to an agreement with the

210
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:34,159
city they do not want us to do the event

211
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,480
I don't want anybody to get in trouble I

212
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,819
don't want my plants to get taken so we

213
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,810
have we have backed out of the event I

214
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,810
do apologize for that

215
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:44,819
the other day I said something on the

216
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,709
show I don't remember if I said it on

217
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,570
the show were just in conversation with

218
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:51,419
people but I need to correct something

219
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,970
that I said I'm going to go to a website

220
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,559
here this is actually from edy

221
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,028
Rosenthal's I've just got her to my

222
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,369
computer it's easier to do while we're

223
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:00,778
doing a show and Rosenthal's marijuana

224
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,070
growers handbook I'm trying to show it

225
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:03,509
to the camera I'm not watching the video

226
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,520
I should put the video up on the screen

227
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:10,200
so I could see the video feed here we go

228
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,809
this is the book that I'm coming from so

229
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,129
I said something about red spectrum

230
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:16,229
right and I may have gotten it backwards

231
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:17,700
for what I told you guys so this is from

232
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,839
the book I just showed you all credit

233
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,060
for what I'm saying right now it goes to

234
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,830
Ed Rosenthal and don't get mad at me for

235
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,929
saying this on the show you'd want

236
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,278
people to know this that's called the

237
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:27,509
critical light period let me give you a

238
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:32,639
quick explanation of what the critical

239
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:34,588
light period is in my opinion the

240
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:38,490
critical period is the amount of dark

241
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:40,950
time specific cannabis stream will take

242
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:48,810
to flower so let me elaborate with Ed's

243
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:50,520
article here this 12 formula has been

244
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:53,699
accepted without question by growers all

245
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,379
over the world probably probably one of

246
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,839
the reasons for this was my discussion

247
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:00,000
of the technique in some of my early

248
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,070
books the 1212 regimen was selected

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,509
because my co-author and I reasoned that

250
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,339
no matter what critical period of

251
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,759
variety might have given 12 hours of

252
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,950
darkness

253
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,620
it would flower however most marijuana

254
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,950
varieties need fewer than 12 hours of

255
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,539
darkness to flower now what I was

256
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,890
talking about was somebody was they were

257
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:19,439
saying that their plants are starting to

258
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:24,179
flower and it's not 12 hours of darkness

259
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,820
outside yes that's because of the sunset

260
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:29,009
and the sunrise have specific color

261
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,270
spectrums that are triggering hormones

262
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:33,929
in your plants is what I was telling

263
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:35,730
them all this info from memory so I

264
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:38,159
think I got it backwards to tell you the

265
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,420
truth so if I said that on a podcast or

266
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,009
if I said that to you in person

267
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:42,990
I need to correct that here's what Ed

268
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,179
Rosenthal has written a little bit more

269
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,700
about it if marijuana plants grow

270
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,049
outdoors required a 12 hour dark period

271
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,209
to flower they would

272
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:53,549
be induced to start flowering until

273
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:55,409
September 21st the first day of autumn

274
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:57,179
when day and night are equal lengths

275
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:59,490
they would ripen six to eight weeks

276
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,799
later in real life most modern varieties

277
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,169
ripen between early September and late

278
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,569
October budding was triggered sixty

279
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:08,909
weeks earlier Friz instance an eight

280
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,980
week variety that requires 55 days from

281
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:13,230
forcing to maturity which would normally

282
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,720
ripen October first would start

283
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:18,870
flowering August first at that date in

284
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,829
San Francisco sunrise occurs at 5:14 and

285
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,509
sunset at 9:18 which is 718 a total of

286
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:26,939
14 hours and 4 minutes

287
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:29,519
dawn and dusk add another 15 minutes of

288
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,680
red light plants used the absence of

289
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,500
this spectrum to measure the dark period

290
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,569
the total lit period came to about 14

291
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,089
hours and 20 minutes leaving nine hours

292
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,490
and 40 minutes of darkness the critical

293
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:43,890
period for this plant was 9 hours and 40

294
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,990
minutes if you were given just 10 hours

295
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:48,899
of dark period daily indoors rather than

296
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,399
12 it would still flower gardeners

297
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,339
growing indoors who discover the

298
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,750
critical time need to induce flowering

299
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,310
the critical time needed to induce

300
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,990
flowering can use this information to

301
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,969
get more efficient use of their indoor

302
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,310
garden currently plants grown under a

303
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,800
1212 cycle spend half their time in the

304
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:06,778
dark if these plants have a critical

305
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,939
flowering time of for instance 10 hours

306
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:11,159
of darkness daily they can provide be

307
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,380
provided 14 rather than 12 hours of

308
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:18,059
light each day so that they can receive

309
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:20,669
almost 17% more energy which they use to

310
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:23,359
produce sugars used for more and faster

311
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:23,360
growth

312
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:30,110
so does that make any sense guys it's

313
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:32,970
the it's uh called the critical period

314
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,249
for the specific strain most of your

315
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,110
you're like strains your indica stuff

316
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:40,110
that's gonna have a critical period

317
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,459
apparently closer to that's gonna have

318
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,739
like your 12-hour stuff you're more

319
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:46,018
equatorial stuff you may be able to cut

320
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:48,720
that down just a little bit actually I

321
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:55,259
heard DJ short say that he runs most of

322
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:56,519
his plants on a 13 off 11 on and he said

323
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:00,110
that that shows a little bit more

324
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,428
phenotypic expression is what that does

325
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,869
which means that if you're growing from

326
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:06,028
seed and you're trying to find that

327
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:08,879
keeper you'll get to see larger

328
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:10,558
variances in your seed stock if you've

329
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,600
got a little f1 hybrid there

330
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:16,289
I had another article I gotta click back

331
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:20,569
a couple of steps here maybe I've lost

332
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:24,028
it a lot of stuff about me here it is

333
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:26,458
sorry looking for stuff on the internet

334
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:29,698
I'm talking this guy broke something

335
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,868
down there are things cannabis plants

336
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:32,789
where's this coming from let me give

337
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:33,928
credit this is from marijuana growers

338
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,149
hq.com

339
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:40,499
slash light cycles and flowering

340
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:43,048
cannabis cannabis plants are referred to

341
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:45,058
as long night or short a plants because

342
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,948
they require a long period of Darkness

343
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:48,419
to trigger the hormone that tell the

344
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:51,328
plant to switch from vegetative growth

345
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:53,118
to flowering these light receptors are a

346
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:56,008
color pigment in the leaves called

347
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:57,959
phytochrome red and phytochrome far red

348
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:59,220
and they're gonna start abbreviating

349
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,078
that so i need to try to remember which

350
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,110
is which these pigments get their names

351
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,458
from the types of light they absorb

352
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,850
phytochrome red absorbs red light

353
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:11,359
between 600 and 760 it doesn't give me a

354
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,889
definition of what those are and

355
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,778
phytochrome far red absorbs far light

356
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:21,778
between 760 and 800 Nm I don't remember

357
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,068
what M is and that's I should sorry I

358
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:25,078
went blank on that one just now when

359
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:26,610
they wrote it on the screen these two

360
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:28,618
pigments chemically react to the light

361
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,808
and trigger the plant to flower or not

362
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:33,110
this is where it gets a little confusing

363
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:36,828
in cannabis plants the normal presence

364
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,209
of phytochrome far red switches off the

365
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:39,799
flowering signal the level of

366
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,739
phytochrome far red is what you can

367
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:44,389
manipulate to adjust the photo period

368
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,789
phytochrome far red is quickly produced

369
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:50,569
when plants are exposed to light that

370
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:53,208
contains far red wavelengths when there

371
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,879
is light the phytochrome far red and

372
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:57,708
phytochrome red maintain a balance when

373
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,689
the sun goes down or the lights go out

374
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:02,018
the darkness gradually switches the

375
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,490
phytochrome far red to phytochrome red

376
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:07,070
because of this the phytochrome red

377
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,169
levels gradually increase and the far

378
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:13,100
red gradually decreases during the dark

379
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:14,599
period the presence of red is neutral is

380
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,700
a neutral condition to the plants and

381
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,470
essentially tells them nothing when the

382
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,420
light returns or if a small amount of

383
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,389
far red light interrupts a dark period

384
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:25,699
the red immediately switches back to far

385
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:28,338
red if the plant is without light long

386
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,209
enough the far red will decrease past a

387
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,060
tipping point

388
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:34,219
this decreased level of phytochrome far

389
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:36,109
red signals the plants that fall is

390
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,470
approaching and the plants begin

391
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,839
flowering ensure the presence of

392
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,699
phytochrome far red due to long hours of

393
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,680
light and short hours of darkness keep

394
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:47,990
the plants in the vegetative phase if

395
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,559
the plant experiences enough hours of

396
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,709
darkness

397
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:55,039
most of the phytochrome far red turns to

398
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:57,649
phytochrome red and the low level of far

399
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,019
red signals the plant hormones to begin

400
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:02,328
flowering that's a really technical

401
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,279
version of what I tried to say the last

402
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:06,048
time I gave this a little rant and I

403
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,029
think I got it completely backwards to

404
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:09,078
tell you the honest truth so that goes

405
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:10,789
to show you right there that sometimes

406
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:12,438
you got to do your research you got to

407
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:14,269
remind yourself even if you think you

408
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,798
know what you're doing you might [ __ ] up

409
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:17,269
and say something wrong on a podcast and

410
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:18,798
try to embarrass yourself but you know I

411
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,019
don't feel embarrassed I'm glad that I

412
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,490
got to learn with you guys we're gonna

413
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:24,168
go find out what that one little

414
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,630
abbreviation that they wrote there I've

415
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,770
never seen it written like that before

416
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,430
I'm gonna find out what that means so I

417
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:33,879
can share that with you or was it

418
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:39,820
right they're gonna Google that and find

419
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:45,820
out what that means googling it right

420
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:47,399
now nm light measurement definition pops

421
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:49,629
up as soon as I start typing that

422
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,640
visible light is usually defined as

423
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,110
having a wavelength okay so that's that

424
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,470
is nanometers what I thought it was they

425
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:57,849
just wrote it small and capital M like

426
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,410
that so that's nanometers is what I

427
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:02,619
thought it was there and that that

428
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:05,500
article all right doing pretty good on

429
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:10,089
that one and tell Safari just decided to

430
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:12,099
freeze up there we go cool all right I

431
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:15,970
really just wanted to come on and talk

432
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:17,759
about having to cancel the committee for

433
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,230
the responsible regulation of cannabis

434
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,700
party that we were going to have at the

435
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,870
Brickyard I want to say that once again

436
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,059
in case you guys are skipping through

437
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:27,099
this episode the party the seminar the

438
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:29,559
educational seminar we planned to host

439
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:31,059
it has been cancelled I was gonna take

440
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,259
some live plant to show you guys those

441
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,669
we had people that we're gonna talk

442
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:37,690
about all kinds of cool stuff we had a

443
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:39,789
miniature job fair planned out does not

444
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,470
want that to happen so I apologize it's

445
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:42,970
beyond our control the police department

446
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,980
have threatened us and scared us and we

447
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,420
don't want police interaction so we're

448
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,089
gonna back out we're gonna foul down and

449
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:52,990
just not do that sorry it's the best we

450
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:54,730
can do right now for what we've got all

451
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,589
right enough begging for your

452
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,420
forgiveness I do apologize if you were

453
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,889
planning to come out message me and

454
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,350
we'll find something else to do how's

455
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,080
that so if you're listening on Twitter

456
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:08,230
or Facebook or whatever message me and

457
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:09,519
we will hang out since I had that night

458
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,210
booked because I thought I'd be doing

459
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,920
stuff anyway let's wrap up this episode

460
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,360
it was kind of a quick episode I want to

461
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,769
give another I want to mention that

462
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:24,459
coupon or both do it you can get

463
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:26,049
yourself a gigantic bag of roots organic

464
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,950
soil for five hundred and fifty bucks or

465
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:32,470
six hundred dollars honestly do 25 7

466
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,500
gallon pots or 57 gallon pots worth of

467
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:38,860
soil that's two runs in a four light

468
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,119
room in my opinion you know so if that

469
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:42,028
tells anything with what you could do

470
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,528
with that amount of soil

471
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,909
that is awesome big shout out to all of

472
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:47,339

portion but I've been cramming so much

487
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:18,239
stuff into one episode that I haven't

488
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:19,978
done it so officially give thanks to

489

607
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:44,890
in front of me it is five hundred and

608
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,840
fifty dollars for one tote of soil I

609
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,070
talked about this last week a tote of

610
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,389
soil that's if you pick it up at the

611
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:51,579
store it's five hundred and fifty

612
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:55,570
dollars it comes in one bag its roots

613
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:58,058
organic soil it's good [ __ ] how much is

614
00:26:55,569 --> 00:27:00,609
a tote that is approximately in my

615
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:04,990
measurements I think that is about 28 or

616
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:07,329
up is about 48 to 57 gallon pots so you

617
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,548
can run an 8 light setup pretty decently

618
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:11,949
with this one package of soil if you

619
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:14,168
need it delivered it is $600 it comes on

620
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,460
a FedEx truck to your house so it's not

621
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:16,419
like the hydro shop has shown up with

622
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,860
the truck or anything it's actually

623
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:20,470
FedEx it looks like you got a package

624
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:22,359

625
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,589

kept in like a nice smooth looking oil

680
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:34,509
slick container my red gold and green

681
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:37,000
Rasta colored oily container on the

682
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:38,679
table with my oil slick pads it just

683
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,210
looks like they got these things here

684
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,350
with like the magnetic sides to where

685
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,028
you can just put your slab I'm gonna

686
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:44,230
have to look in google docs I'm not sure

687
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:46,179
if that's actually their product or if

688
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:51,970
somebody's making that modified version

689
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:53,679
because that's a good idea if you have a

690
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:58,389
miniature sized slab you can take two of

691
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,889
these oil slick mini pads pad minis and

692
00:29:58,388 --> 00:30:01,119
you can rubber band them together with

693
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:02,349
your slab in the middle or you can find

694
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,369
other ways to stick them together and

695
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:05,319
just have your slab right in the middle

696
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:07,329
make it easily accessible there are

697
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,970
great things I actually use it almost as

698
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:12,220
a wipe my dabber off on it that's why

699
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,839
it's all sticky on this edge near me so

700
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,490
I take another tab wipe it

701
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,839

708

764
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:41,740
I'm gonna read you the back just because

765
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,179

766
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,509
good job on the packaging this is outer

767
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,070
box this product is infused with medical

768
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:50,559

769
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:52,779
regular regulatory oversight for health

770

health risks associated with the

772
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,480

796
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:03,609
attention is it lists other ingredients

00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:19,210
use in the plan phosphorus potassium and

801
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:20,890
nitrogen calcium magnesium sulfur I

802
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:26,440

803
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:27,789
but I'm I don't know you can't do it

804
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,380
either the table of elements I'd the

805
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:31,210
periodic table of elements I couldn't

806
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,519
say it I was reading these five sugar

807
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,000
malt extract so they list also what it

808
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:36,759
was grown

809
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,230

810
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,500

813
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,220

843
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:58,980
those and sometimes it would Recker and

844

sometimes it wouldn't do anything she

845
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,039
said it may have been that's what she

846
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:04,679
was saying the lady of the shops he said

847
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,210
next time try fruit flavor and that's

848
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:15,739

849
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:18,420
apple cider type all they had was some

850
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:19,949
cappuccino and I'm like I said it was

851
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,400

medicine peanut butter bar is $11 and

876
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:40,289

877
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:46,159
three and a half of those for a dollar

878
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:46,159
more didn't take a lot of convincing

879
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,560
money and thanked her for being such a

880
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:56,880
great person the flavor so far I am

881
00:39:52,559 --> 00:40:13,349

883
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:20,190
kind of chocolate almost kind of imagine

884
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,990
that a chocolate chip or something

885
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:24,869
inside of some peanut butter batter

886
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:26,409
stuff it's got the works dude it's a

887
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:28,299
layer

888
00:40:26,409 --> 00:40:31,868
semi dark chocolate over peanut butter

889
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:34,720
with this peanut butter chocolate it's a

890
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:38,470
thick mousse a light fudge sort of a

891
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,789
texture it's uh I can eat it quickly you

892
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,109
know it does it's not too peanut buttery

893
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:42,460
that I'm stuck while I'm trying to talk

894
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,630
but it does take a little effort to

895
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,789
clean up the face while you're grabbing

896
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:47,320
it and in the summertime eat this in the

897
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:49,509
air conditioner don't try to take this

898
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,039
out anywhere because he told you to kind

899
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,860
of put it in the fridge yeah for five or

900
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:56,849
ten minutes beforehand or microwave or

901
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,849
warm it up first

[Music]

903
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:04,900
he didn't say long she said like one

904
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:13,539
second two seconds you know but yeah

905
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:14,680
take a couple more bites I I think got

906
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:22,599
your attention because they had some

907
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:48,809
great looking herbs so you know that was

908
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:48,809
my only comparison about the one words

909
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:56,260
that she opened the jar and it was like

910
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:57,880
a punch in the face before she handed it

911
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,609
to me yeah and I mean like I said there

912
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,369
was no small nugs in the jar everything

913
00:42:00,608 --> 00:42:04,719
was frosty everything was right to that

914
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:07,090
point where I feel like I could have

915
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,679
brought it home and kept it in my jar

916
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:10,840
for a couple days and it would have been

917
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:14,079
like you know I could have judged where

918
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,940
how dry or how like Adam tends to like

919
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,130
his wheat a little crispier than most

920
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,809
folks likes it a little drier we'd like

921
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,280
so we'll cure it perfectly and then give

922
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:22,059
it to Adam to destroy for us yeah

923
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,240
exactly

924
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:27,130
but still it's it's nice to have that

925
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:28,959
option instead of you I'm where I'm from

926
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,329
me it's always dry so

927
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,130
you know you get something wet you're

928
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:36,579
like what is this I'm all in now I just

929
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:38,500

933

don't even know if I set it on the

978
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:44,719
podcast or in a personal conversation

979
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:46,818
but I mentioned the red light spectrum

980
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,380
and I got it totally backwards and then

981
00:45:46,818 --> 00:45:51,139
my second mistake was saying to keep

982
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,559
your vegging plants on 1212 do not do

983
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:54,168
this

984
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:56,769
keep your vegging plants on at least 18

985
00:45:54,168 --> 00:46:00,949
hours of live at least 16 hours of light

986
00:45:56,768 --> 00:46:03,218
18 would be better 24 is what I do to be

987
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:05,929
perfectly fair you didn't say it like oh

988
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:07,668
by the way put your plants I know it was

989
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:10,909
at the end of your sentence at the end

990
00:46:07,668 --> 00:46:23,028
of your lesson at the end of your ramble

991
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:24,289
of how lights work I apologize and I'm

992
00:46:23,028 --> 00:46:25,639
driving this button just telling you

993
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:29,659
from a listeners point of view tighten

994
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:30,768
your [ __ ] up it's so good chocolate

995
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:33,199

1002
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:47,229

1015
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:42,489
pretty awesome so about halfway through

1016
00:47:40,778 --> 00:47:44,108
the night he decided to wear a young

1017
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:44,440
lady's wife-beater for the rest of the

1018
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:46,869
evening

1019
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,579
each nipple stuck out just a little bit

1020
00:47:46,869 --> 00:48:02,289

1021

great in the beard everybody showed up

1032
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:28,509
Fung is out of town right there

1033
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,358
but the wedding reception I didn't go to

1034
00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:33,608
the actual wedding the pothead Cruz I

1035
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:35,048
was calling us wasn't we chose to just

1036
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:36,548
go to the after there was like a wedding

1037
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:39,489
and then a reception and then kind of an

1038
00:48:36,548 --> 00:48:42,429
after-party that started about 8:30 once

1039
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:44,440
the kids bailed out we set up a dad bar

1040
00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:46,208
and Spence from the garden of Weeden and

1041
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,349
myself with also the help of Maddy and

1042
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:48,548
if I missed anybody the garden we'd

1043
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:50,079
enlisted people I'm sorry I was trying

1044
00:48:48,548 --> 00:48:51,728
to do a podcast again like 9,000

1045
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,109
thoughts in my head at once I don't mean

1046
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:55,199
to miss anybody I love all you guys at

1047
00:48:53,108 --> 00:48:59,429
the garden Whedon Ciroc Inanna included

1048
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:01,949
and even honey so spin sin Matty and I

1049
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:06,529
were pretty much to the entire wedding

1050
00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:23,909
party that was over 21 and after the

1051
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:27,930
children left people were because the

1052
00:49:23,909 --> 00:49:49,139
wedding party with your life it was my

1053
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:50,279
job I volunteered to go there if you've

1054
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:51,809
seen that commercial that that girl

1055
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,400
smoked and she [ __ ] melts into the

1056
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:56,360
couch and becomes like playdough if you

1057
00:49:53,400 --> 00:50:02,679
have any of that weed and or hash

1058
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:02,679
[Music]

1059
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:11,340
it's that pink stuff in that and then so

1060
00:50:09,269 --> 00:50:12,929
I think we dished out probably 7 to 10

1061
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,400
grams alive resin last night to the

1062
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:16,949
wedding party some people kept coming

1063
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,650
back and coming back we we probably

1064
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:30,089
broke the record for Pueblo County in

1065
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:31,380
one building at one time on an average

1066
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:34,260
day and people are gonna [ __ ] their

1067
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:37,320
pants I take 25 dabs no problem on an

1068
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:39,900
average day maybe 30 or 40 on a heavy

1069
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:42,210
bad day I've gone to secret cups and

1070
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:44,460
we've had to judge 42 samples and I've

1071
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:47,210
done those all in one day and was okay

1072
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:49,619
and went back for seconds on a couple

1073
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,650
twenty-five to fifty dabs per day range

1074
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:55,079
which I don't know if that sounds a lot

1075
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:56,950
and when you see the size of dabs he

1076
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,559
does it is a lot

1077
00:50:56,949 --> 00:51:00,969
so and what's odd is all I'll wake up

1078
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:02,230
and I'll rock for a few hours before I

1079
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:04,059
take a nap I try to do a couple things

1080
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:12,519
like I try to get food water in my body

1081
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:14,170
and if you get up a reasonable time

1082
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:16,630
somewhere between eight and ten you know

1083
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:17,860
do your day get some food in you get

1084
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:19,630
functional get your blood moving and

1085
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:25,510
don't take a dab till 710 in the

1086
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:28,180
afternoon or the evening you get wait

1087
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:30,130
till like 6:00 or 7:00 or 4:20 lately

1088
00:51:28,179 --> 00:51:32,109
it's been too hot to get dad out all day

1089
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,820
so you gotta wait until [ __ ] 6:00 and

1090
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:38,050
the Sun starts going down and about 90

1091
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:40,300
and get dad the [ __ ] out I'll take seven

1092
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:56,620
per hour I'll sit down and take six dabs

1093
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:59,080
in succession flour that's what I'm

1094
00:51:56,619 --> 00:52:01,449
thinking though is you know I smoked

1095
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:04,420
flour most the time so it's not sitting

1096
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:09,759
there smoking you know 10 bong hits a

1097
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:13,090
flower to another four or five hours

1098
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,400
later two more you know so I get what

1099
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:18,960
you're saying I I go slower with the

1100
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:23,079
dabs and I do with the flower so that's

1101
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,610
probably your like any anything I smoke

1102
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:26,710
or two you've got a certain amount of

1103
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:28,090
inhales and exhales your lungs are going

1104
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,740
to give you before they start to burn

1105
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,690
out just like any sort of equipment or a

1106
00:52:29,739 --> 00:52:34,059
[ __ ] device or moving anything that

1107
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:36,519
moves is going to break eventually and

1108
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:39,579
if I've only got seventy two billion

1109
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:43,409
ins-and-outs half of those on a DAB then

1110
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:43,409
3/4 of them trying to smoke herb

1111
00:52:44,739 --> 00:52:47,939
[Music]

1112
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:53,590
vapor to smoke ratio tonight would have

1113
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,639
been the ninth we would have done that

1114
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:59,079
event at the bar ona give an apology to

1115
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:00,969
everybody that was excited about that I

1116
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:03,759
myself was excited me too there were

1117
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:05,319
some bureaucracy discrepancies and some

1118
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,930
stuff that happened and I'm no longer a

1119
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,088
member of

1120
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:09,348
the citizens for the responsible

1121
00:53:08,088 --> 00:53:10,670
regulation of cannabis I don't know if

1122
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:13,130
that even exists anymore to tell you the

1123
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:14,809
truth I've backed out of that just gonna

1124
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:16,338
stick with being a breeder and a podcast

1125
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:19,579
toast and doing what I know I'm good at

1126
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:20,779
I don't like the I used to go to City

1127
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:22,880
Council meetings and stuff when I was

1128
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,859
with another dispensary group I don't

1129
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,940
like being in that realm that's a little

1130
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:33,818
uncomfortable to me it's one thing going

1131
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:33,818
there when you have to you know but when

1132
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:49,640
it still feels like court yeah it still

1133
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:51,079
feels like I don't feel I backed out of

1134
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:52,429
going to those meetings because I felt

1135
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:54,079
like I was a hindrance to the group

1136
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,909
because I'm just a cliche looking quiet

1137
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,380
and I didn't speak anyway we had

1138
00:53:55,909 --> 00:53:58,519
spokespeople for the group so I just

1139
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:24,200
quit go and you wanna know the worst

1140
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:35,088
thing I may tell you how I dry trim some

1141

1143
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:42,680
but he still killed it by himself

1144
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:44,858
despicable dialects rapped who else

1145
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:47,149
performed I know I'm gonna miss somebody

1146
00:54:44,858 --> 00:54:51,019
Jesse grabbed a microphone and rapped

1147
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:52,309
that was pretty entertaining yeah a lot

1148
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:54,259
of people did a lot of cool things and

1149

is great it tastes great right Adam a

1167
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:43,070
text message saying hey bro I got some

1168
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:44,328
love resin what I actually meant to say

1169
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:47,930
it was live resin and so he's been

1170
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:49,670
laughing at that ever since take a

1171
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:51,980
pretty chunky dab of some live resin

1172
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:53,358
right now some friends that were kind

1173
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:57,230
enough to give me a little bit of live

1174
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:59,150
resin super awesome I hate the torch or

1175
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:00,769
heat seal a little bit less heat and

1176
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:02,059
make sure to use the carb cap with a

1177
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:03,920
live resin I don't want to burn it up

1178
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:05,599
cuz it's a lot more Turkey it's more

1179
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,608
terpenoids you know about Terps that's

1180
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,550
what mostly gives you the flavor there

1181
00:56:07,608 --> 00:56:13,068
flavonoids and Paley it's the contribute

1182
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:17,119
to that but mostly it's the terpenoids

1183
00:56:13,068 --> 00:56:18,679
that you want to taste very clean yeah

1184
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,210
you can see the cleanliness and the

1185
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:21,108
clarity in the hash I think I might have

1186
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,829
talked about it a little on the show

1187
00:56:21,108 --> 00:56:23,828
here we go doing a DAB

1188
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:46,839
yeah that was a dab of live resin here

1189
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:49,029
take that part take torch shut up the

1190
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:53,079
task rod for making super awesome nails

1191
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:55,120
and carb caps sponsor the show but they

1192
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:01,539
should be one day they will be I just

1193
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:02,889
got a task and I've been talking the

1194
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:04,389
words are complicated right now I'm

1195
00:57:02,889 --> 00:57:06,549
trying to say that you can pick up

1196
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:15,309
highly-educated products heated a little

1197
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:18,340
more bro sorry I recommend if you've got

1198
00:57:15,309 --> 00:57:21,699
a rig with an 18 or a 14 millimeter male

1199
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:24,010
joint sticking out of it I recommend the

1200
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:27,189
duality nail that's probably the way to

1201
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:29,260
go there it's gonna fit if you've got a

1202
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:31,710
10 millimeter there is a 10 millimeter

1203
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:36,700
domeless that works perfectly as well

1204
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:41,050
catching my breath carb caps as a new

1205
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:42,699
[ __ ] and they're awesome you don't have

1206
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:44,050
to heat your nail is hot you start you

1207
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:45,069
drop your dab in there you let it puddle

1208
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:47,710
up a little bit you cover it with the

1209
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:49,090
carb cap and it requires less heat so

1210
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,769
you choke less and your dad tastes a

1211
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,789
little bit better

1212
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:53,110
you'll need a little more heat next time

1213
00:57:51,789 --> 00:57:54,670
bro that wasn't too bad you got a dad

1214
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:57,190
but a little more he'll be better for

1215
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:59,230
you oops try not to heat it up because

1216
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:01,780
of what you just said yeah there's that

1217
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:03,130
you'll find it I usually hate the tin I

1218
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,440
usually heat it for you when you're here

1219
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:06,579
but what's your nail gets a little bit

1220
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,960
older you'll need to give it a little

1221
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:10,360
bit more heat is something that you guys

1222
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:14,820
will learn what starts getting too too

1223
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,820
worn out that's the truth

1224
00:58:15,869 --> 00:59:10,839
to the show he's harvest and pull off

1225
00:58:48,969 --> 00:59:13,799
all the leaves on this is basically the

1226
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,800
buds off the sticks

1227
00:59:25,889 --> 00:59:46,239
frozen fresh you cut down the plants

1228
00:59:41,409 --> 00:59:49,119
okay you cut them down you let them hang

1229
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:50,879
for like three to four hours and take

1230
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:54,460
off the leaves and then freeze them

1231
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:57,450
that's all the dry right frozen chopped

1232
00:59:54,460 --> 01:00:00,610
down frozen and then blasted in the

1233
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:02,739
closed-loop system out of the

1234
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:05,110
closed-loop system and vacuum purged

1235
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:07,059
really really gently and I'm not the

1236
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:09,039
hash maker this is the process I have

1237
01:00:07,059 --> 01:00:10,960
observed and gathered from hanging out

1238
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:18,369
with all of my friends that are extract

1239
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:20,409
artists don't rush out and most people

1240
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:22,210
and I can ask what most people don't

1241
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:26,199
have access to the Machine you need to

1242
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:27,400
do this a couple of specific machines

1243
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:31,809
that you need to do this they're only a

1244
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:33,910
couple brands everybody would recommend

1245
01:00:31,809 --> 01:00:42,429
to fight over so if one of them wants to

1246
01:00:33,909 --> 01:00:45,279
sponsor the show they even start to look

1247
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:52,210
once this this develops where would they

1248
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:54,730
look for it there was and it's gone now

1249
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:57,670
so I'm was there it went [ __ ] quickly

1250
01:00:54,730 --> 01:01:00,909
there was tangi live resin at the clinic

1251
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:02,559
I was 250 bucks for three grams for one

1252
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:04,659
of our friends at bought some I think

1253
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,670
that's $85 a gram is roughly what that

1254
01:01:04,659 --> 01:01:09,339
comes to but it's you gotta thank you're

1255
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:13,450
paying for the Machine well and it's

1256
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:15,730
kind of a hype that's part of I mean how

1257
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:18,489
many people have you seen on Facebook or

1258
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:20,050
anywhere yeah right and it's pretty much

1259
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:21,579
the Denver crew has got to figured out

1260
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:26,860
the Denver crew is smoking the libraries

1261
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:28,210
and I think it was giddyup is one of the

1262
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:39,490
first people that I ever saw smoke and

1263
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:42,579
resin garden of Weeden

1264
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:44,439
maybe greener side Empire that crew I'm

1265
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:49,719
gonna give them credit for inventing the

1266
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:51,519
Barenaked and the was their idea

1267
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:53,169
giddyup was definitely one of the

1268
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,250
pioneers of that [ __ ] and now that I've

1269
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:58,320
recovered from my dad let me tell you

1270
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:01,480
[Music]

1271
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:03,309
people are arguing that it's not cured

1272
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,719
so it can't be as good that the [ __ ]

1273
01:02:03,309 --> 01:02:06,900
weed isn't as good because it's not

1274
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:11,639
cured before it's blasted is the taste

1275
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:20,460
not incredible it is more flavorful than

1276
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:20,460
anything it's an apple tasted like

1277
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:26,109
cookies weird a bit if you had a Girl

1278
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:28,210
Scout cookies flavored apples and you

1279
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,780
bit into it you know how Apple's take a

1280
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,280
second

1281
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:39,340
that juice to come out of the fiber of

1282
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:41,769
the Apple and the is that is where to

1283
01:02:39,340 --> 01:03:43,240
shatter would be like buying slices from

1284
01:02:41,769 --> 01:03:45,159
a bag we explained that enough we're

1285
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:48,519
blasting fresh frozen plants don't try

1286
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:50,109
and blast them fresh frozen really

1287
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:51,519
lightly because the vacuum purge [ __ ]

1288
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:54,760
up your terpenoids and it collapses a

1289
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:56,650
lot of things if you're doing this

1290
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,070
process you should know what I'm talking

1291
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:59,769
about

1292
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:01,960
all the vacuum Persia lighter and a

1293
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:03,670
little longer just go lighter and longer

1294
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:11,740
less II don't expect to get shatter

1295
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:12,940
through the same process and it looks

1296
01:04:11,739 --> 01:04:14,319
like we [ __ ] up it looks like old

1297
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:19,150
school hash that we [ __ ] up but it's

1298
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:21,789
almost closed and that's and I'm higher

1299
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:25,570
from it yeah it's uh it's cleaner I

1300
01:04:21,789 --> 01:04:28,630
don't cough yeah I do because I smoke so

1301
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:30,280
well if I take you know a dime from it I

1302
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,960
don't know if I do a half gram dab of

1303
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,430
live resin why would you want to though

1304
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,858
because I like drop it half gram dabs

1305
01:04:33,429 --> 01:04:37,419
and [ __ ] regular shatter I like that

1306
01:04:35,858 --> 01:04:40,598
they like kicking the dick kind of

1307
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:43,028
feeling that gives you a level sometimes

1308
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:44,369
it takes a half gram dab YouTube video

1309
01:04:43,028 --> 01:04:46,539
in the making

1310
01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:47,380

1313
01:04:48,940 --> 01:05:02,739

1455
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:55,279

1457
01:13:55,279 --> 01:14:00,469
like you know I'm not gonna say what

1458

1459
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:06,380

01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:10,609
here we go with the miniature grow

1462
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:12,769
lesson on dry trimming and bear in mind

1463
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:15,259
I ate a 350 milligram aníbal that is

1464
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:16,969
highly effective to slow down a little

1465
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:19,730
bit [ __ ] working yeah Adam will help

1466
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:21,198
us out so I'll even turn on the music

1467
01:14:19,729 --> 01:14:22,698
cause it's highly distracting so I love

1468
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:28,309
these songs task rocks awesome in my

1469
01:14:22,698 --> 01:14:30,109
opinion dry trim what rubber gloves for

1470
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:35,289
almost all of everything that I'm

1471
01:14:30,109 --> 01:14:37,670
talking about it the blue nitrile gloves

1472
01:14:35,289 --> 01:14:40,988
great they're cheap they got him in like

1473
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:45,109
Walmart and Walgreens they're affordable

1474
01:14:40,988 --> 01:14:46,428
so pull the plan out of the room I guess

1475
01:14:45,109 --> 01:14:48,920
and just chop it down to the base and

1476
01:14:46,429 --> 01:14:50,600
then hang it upside down I use that

1477
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:52,190
bottom branch the very bottom branch

1478
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,429
where the first [ __ ] set of buds are

1479
01:14:52,189 --> 01:14:57,049
I hang that over sometimes you can

1480
01:14:55,429 --> 01:14:58,819
string up a line across the room or

1481
01:14:57,050 --> 01:15:00,949
maybe use like hanger depending on how

1482
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:02,059
many I have going on but you're hanging

1483
01:15:00,948 --> 01:15:03,649
it that's your new little hanger that

1484
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:06,080
little wide that first intersection and

1485
01:15:03,649 --> 01:15:07,638
then I'll grab like a fuzzy stick pack

1486
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:10,840
fuzzy sticks from Walmart it's kind of

1487
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:13,880
like a pipe cleaner anything like that

1488
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,139
[ __ ] the finger around your bread bag

1489
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,340
they got a bunch of those kind of things

1490
01:15:15,139 --> 01:15:18,469
a little twist you tie sort of thing

1491
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:19,670
wrap that around the stalk and just kind

1492
01:15:18,469 --> 01:15:21,230
of secure it on to whatever you're

1493
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:22,819
hanging into a little bit because

1494
01:15:21,229 --> 01:15:24,979
sometimes that branch will break if you

1495
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:27,139
got a heavy plant mmm you want to go to

1496
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:28,158
the second branch go for that secure it

1497
01:15:27,139 --> 01:15:30,230
on there a little bit I like to secure

1498
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:31,579
it either way just cuz I'm [ __ ] OCD I

1499
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:35,049
don't want my plants falling on the

1500
01:15:31,579 --> 01:15:35,050
floor after they've been growing for

1501
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:44,569
alright princess your turning colors hey

1502
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:45,650

1508
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:05,420
this is [ __ ] me up in such a good way

1509
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:07,429
when I bought that 315 milligram drink I

1510
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:09,139
thought that it was gonna [ __ ] me up I

1511
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:10,579
mean you literally told me I want one I

1512
01:16:09,139 --> 01:16:11,750
wish we could play some Grateful Dead

1513
01:16:10,579 --> 01:16:13,279
music without getting the show in

1514
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:15,020
trouble right now that's where I am hi I

1515
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:16,250
want to listen to Jack Straw so

1516
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,889
anybody's a Deadhead out there you know

1517
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,658
where I am

1518
01:16:16,889 --> 01:16:20,489
I see I just need to hear Jack Straw man

1519
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:21,688
somebody knows where you are somebody

1520
01:16:20,488 --> 01:16:23,279
knows where I am somebody weren't a

1521
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:24,929
[ __ ] tie-dyed shirts out there code

1522
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:26,639
yeah man they're gonna play Jack Straw

1523
01:16:24,929 --> 01:16:28,828
for me all right

1524
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:31,199
so we got the plant it's hanging upside

1525
01:16:28,828 --> 01:16:32,819
down right you need to get off the fan

1526
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:34,888
leaves now is a good time to do that

1527
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:36,328
maybe you did that some growers do that

1528
01:16:34,889 --> 01:16:38,130
a few days before harvest maybe I should

1529
01:16:36,328 --> 01:16:39,389
have recommended that maybe a few days

1530
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:41,668
before harvest go in there and take off

1531
01:16:39,389 --> 01:16:43,229
all your big fan leaves or you can do

1532
01:16:41,668 --> 01:16:44,488
that right as you harvest or you can do

1533
01:16:43,229 --> 01:16:47,280
it as it's hanging up just get those big

1534
01:16:44,488 --> 01:16:49,768
fan leaves off now your plants are

1535
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:53,099
hanging upside down in a room you want

1536
01:16:49,769 --> 01:16:54,360
that room it like [ __ ] I should've wrote

1537
01:16:53,099 --> 01:16:55,979
this down cuz I'm getting really high

1538
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:58,618
you don't want a lot of humidity in

1539
01:16:55,979 --> 01:17:00,719
there maybe like 25 to 30% max maximum

1540
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:03,268
humidity and then then you wanna have

1541
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:04,948
some air moving but not like your fans

1542
01:17:03,269 --> 01:17:06,449
blowing directly on the plants that'll

1543
01:17:04,948 --> 01:17:07,529
crisp em up a little too quickly you

1544
01:17:06,448 --> 01:17:09,268
want them to dry a little bit slowly

1545
01:17:07,529 --> 01:17:10,648
while they're hanging upside down so you

1546
01:17:09,269 --> 01:17:12,570
got whole plants hanging upside down -

1547
01:17:10,649 --> 01:17:14,729
fan leaves just hanging upside down the

1548
01:17:12,569 --> 01:17:17,219
humidity is kind of low keep your

1549
01:17:14,729 --> 01:17:19,079
temperatures you don't want to go cold

1550
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:26,069
but you want to go hot either

1551
01:17:19,078 --> 01:17:28,319
so like 7075 you know right yeah yeah

1552
01:17:26,069 --> 01:17:29,639
where you are is where they're cool yeah

1553
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:31,498
my tank kind of like in a work area

1554
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:43,300
where it's a little dark keep it dark in

1555
01:17:31,498 --> 01:17:46,358
there go to possibly 80 if you have to

1556
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:46,359
[Music]

1557
01:17:46,819 --> 01:17:52,168
air because moving air prevents mold

1558
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:54,929
just remember that in every gross

1559
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:57,630
situation moving more air prevents mold

1560
01:17:54,929 --> 01:17:59,069
that's like one of the growing is humid

1561
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:01,260
you may not even realize how much water

1562
01:17:59,069 --> 01:18:03,029
is involved in growing but every gallon

1563
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:07,498
you pour in is coming back out some

1564
01:18:03,029 --> 01:18:09,148
water you get rid of it or utilize it so

1565
01:18:07,498 --> 01:18:10,380
you got these plants are upside down

1566
01:18:09,149 --> 01:18:11,550
there in the room with the right

1567
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:13,139
humidity they're in the room with the

1568
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:17,399
right temperature hopefully it's dark

1569
01:18:13,139 --> 01:18:18,719
right as dark as you can get it you got

1570
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:20,249
a dedicated space you got a lot of air

1571
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:22,739
moving so you don't get moldy now just

1572
01:18:20,248 --> 01:18:24,510
let them dry up for [ __ ] I've got some

1573
01:18:22,738 --> 01:18:26,309
that have been hanging in the plants we

1574
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:28,619
trim tonight we're cut down

1575
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:30,210
on a Monday so they've almost been going

1576
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:32,010
for two weeks hanging up there and it's

1577
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:33,359
been a little a little humid because

1578
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:36,840
we've had a swamp cooler going in that

1579
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:38,279
area not in that area but in a room like

1580
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,840
three at a whole way down I guess

1581
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:40,979
there's this whomp cooler in there just

1582
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,880
cuz that's what that room came equipped

1583
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:46,559
with yeah but it's still getting it

1584
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,090
still it still makes a little humidity

1585
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,440
in the rest of the the grow environment

1586
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:52,319
so well they're sitting there hanging

1587
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:54,210
for about 14 days is where they've been

1588
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:55,979
they don't have any fan leaves on them

1589
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:58,289
you might want to check them every other

1590
01:18:55,979 --> 01:19:00,059
day every day like start checking about

1591
01:18:58,289 --> 01:19:01,920
four days five days six days give them a

1592
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:03,510
little squeeze and when those families

1593
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,770
are little sugar leaves start crisping

1594
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:06,780
right off just by hitting them with your

1595
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:10,080
finger grab those plants and just take

1596
01:19:06,779 --> 01:19:11,550
like I've had these long bins and I just

1597
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,809
take branches off I have the plants

1598
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:14,190
hanging and I cut branches off and lay

1599
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:17,450
them into the bins and once my bins are

1600
01:19:14,189 --> 01:19:19,679
full I go to a sit down to trim dude

1601
01:19:17,449 --> 01:19:20,909
drive you nuts trying to stand up I'm

1602
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:23,250
getting old that's how I know I'm all I

1603
01:19:20,909 --> 01:19:26,159
can't stand to trim anymore so you sit

1604
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:28,560
down and I just gonna hold I cut one bud

1605
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,880
off at a time and just knock the leaves

1606
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,830
off of it with my thumb's because now

1607
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,390
that it's dry those leaves are pretty

1608
01:19:31,829 --> 01:19:34,920
much just gonna fall off and you can see

1609
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:36,750
what your finished product is as you're

1610
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:39,619
going so trim it to your liking at this

1611
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:42,270
point if you're selling it to [ __ ]

1612
01:19:39,619 --> 01:19:43,979
for stupid cheap a pound and just hustle

1613
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:45,540
and wait to get it out don't trim it

1614
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:47,189
worth the [ __ ] that's why cheap weed is

1615
01:19:45,539 --> 01:19:49,170
cheap if you want connoisseur grade weed

1616
01:19:47,189 --> 01:19:50,009
take your time and trim it and wear

1617
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:56,340
rubber gloves

1618
01:19:50,010 --> 01:20:05,880
yeah please if you eats that sticky then

1619
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:08,400
definitely you can like rub you learn

1620
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:09,900
how to don't scrape the [ __ ] latex

1621
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:12,299
right out of that [ __ ] but you learn how

1622
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:14,279
to rub the hash off of your fingers that

1623
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:18,219
makes my little hash ball or a little

1624
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:20,050
hash watch watch a video on making

1625
01:20:18,219 --> 01:20:22,609
what was it called you know I'm talking

1626
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:29,909
about no I don't cuz you're saying it

1627
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:33,429
[Music]

1628
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:35,800
figure out real quick yeah so the butts

1629
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:37,329
are pretty much dry right uh we've got

1630
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,520
them in the room they hung there crispy

1631
01:20:37,329 --> 01:20:40,809
now we're hand trimming them so cut off

1632
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,670
like you got a bunch of sticks in a pan

1633
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:44,020
you take that [ __ ] stick you cut off

1634
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:45,730
little individual buds and you just

1635
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:47,199
knock the leaves off with your thumbs

1636
01:20:45,729 --> 01:20:48,729
you can use scissors now if you want but

1637
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:50,109
it's kind of pointless I am faster just

1638
01:20:48,729 --> 01:20:52,259
thumbing it it looks like you're playing

1639
01:20:50,109 --> 01:20:54,429
Nintendo with the button your hands

1640
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:56,590
should just take you a couple seconds to

1641
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:57,940
get each bud and you can see I like I

1642
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:59,920
said you can see the finished result

1643
01:20:57,939 --> 01:21:02,948
what's really cool is if you wet trim

1644
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:04,600
you got to trim it and you're all sticky

1645
01:21:02,948 --> 01:21:07,509
and it [ __ ] up your scissors and it

1646
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:09,219
takes so long and every time you set a

1647
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:11,409
butt down or touch a but it [ __ ]

1648
01:21:09,219 --> 01:21:18,130
sticky there and stickier and sticky

1649
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:26,170
here dry trimming is way cleaner you can

1650
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:28,569
weigh your [ __ ] sure anyways I mean

1651
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:30,699
they're essentially yes I believe you

1652
01:21:28,569 --> 01:21:32,529
know like they're they're ducks to

1653
01:21:30,698 --> 01:21:34,479
further the place they're there what

1654
01:21:32,529 --> 01:21:35,979
struggling to suck up the moisture not

1655
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:38,079
the the bud really I would imagine

1656
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:39,849
that's yeah that's mostly right but also

1657
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:43,840
it helps slow it down because you want

1658
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:46,239
the water to leave more slowly the

1659
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,590
chlorophyll evaporates with the water so

1660
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:49,238
what's the waters gone you can't take

1661
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:50,890
away any more chlorophyll but if you let

1662
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:52,359
the water come out slowly then that

1663
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:54,940
chlorophyll dissolves with the water and

1664
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:57,309
goes away okay it happens in the cure

1665
01:21:54,939 --> 01:21:58,988
process also you start the gases start

1666
01:21:57,310 --> 01:22:04,480
we're getting into cure that's different

1667
01:21:58,988 --> 01:22:05,709
yeah yeah it's just I can tell you now

1668
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:07,959
like most of the videos that I've made

1669
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:10,630
in an hour and I'm high on that edible

1670
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:12,159
it only took like 45 minutes I'm a

1671
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:13,469
little better now I've calmed down but

1672
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:17,969
for a minute there I wasn't really high

1673
01:22:13,469 --> 01:22:17,969

dry trim as soon as you're done dry

1782

1783
01:29:35,658 --> 01:29:42,229
there's a certain time period early

1784
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:44,510
evening right as the Sun sets the led

1785
01:29:42,229 --> 01:29:46,819
UFO lights come on in the greenhouse to

1786
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:49,520
keep the plants flowering earlier the

1787
01:29:46,819 --> 01:29:53,539

01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:06,579
after that you put them in a jar and

01:35:03,909 --> 01:35:08,649
start curing that's from there as curing

01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:25,869
order because we're only advanced but I

1882

was trimming we deny it so it's crispy

1883

01:36:24,599 --> 01:36:28,918
it depends that's hard to say because

oh my god yeah it's just so it's kind of

1902
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:49,288
here but for me as well worth 11 bucks

1903
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:51,630
is my [ __ ] really short answer of a

1904
01:36:49,288 --> 01:36:53,698
lot of long words

1905
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:59,038
I'm just saying usually things on that

1906
01:36:53,698 --> 01:37:00,089
level is 10 15 bucks maybe 20 bucks or

1907
01:36:59,038 --> 01:37:01,259
something really potent if you're going

1908
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:02,578
to a concert or something and you want

1909
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:04,199
to get [ __ ] high as [ __ ] and not have

1910
01:37:02,578 --> 01:37:05,458
to worry about smoking through it cuz

1911
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:07,379
that's why I like edibles I go to a

1912
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:08,908
comedy show and you can't smoke if the

there the place is tiny yeah they're in

1916
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:25,559

get back on the road by the time you get

recreational marijuana edible

01:45:34,029 --> 01:45:37,960
manufacturers face tougher rules on

01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:42,789
their products under stopgap rules

2069
01:45:39,969 --> 01:45:44,980
adopted by state regulators Thursday the

2070
01:45:42,789 --> 01:45:46,000
new guidelines in response crafted in

response to concerns about

2072
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,840
overconsumption by inexperienced

2073
01:45:47,319 --> 01:45:52,420
consumers will do away with bite size

2074
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:54,610
products that pack in 100 milligrams of

2075
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:57,969
the psychoactive chemical THC the

2076
01:45:54,609 --> 01:45:59,348
maximum allowed by state law products

2077
01:45:57,969 --> 01:46:01,149
may contain up to a hundred milligrams

2078
01:45:59,349 --> 01:46:03,770
of THC but they must be easily broken

2079
01:46:01,149 --> 01:46:06,019
off into pieces that have 10 milligrams

2080
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:08,600
or fewer the standardized edible serving

2081
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:10,790
size under state law so now there we've

2082
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:13,730
standardized apparently 10 milligrams is

2083
01:46:10,789 --> 01:46:15,229
a serving of edible cannabis so if you

2084
01:46:13,729 --> 01:46:18,259
buy a hundred milligram bar they want it

2085
01:46:15,229 --> 01:46:20,329
easily divisible in ten pieces I

2086
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:21,980
shouldn't see names of products but you

2087
01:46:20,329 --> 01:46:23,930
know the cat is already kind of

2088
01:46:21,979 --> 01:46:25,279
separated into servings that's kind of

2089
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:26,720
how I see they could do it and

2090
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:28,399
sorry KitKat that I used you but you're

2091
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,869
serving [ __ ] it's perfect for my example

2092
01:46:28,399 --> 01:46:31,879
our Hershey's bar has got they're

2093
01:46:29,869 --> 01:46:33,199
already divided perfectly so that's what

2094
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:36,079
they're gonna require of all of these

2095
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:38,300
pieces and I gotta say that that edible

2096
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:40,970
that I ate on the show was 350

2097
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:42,739
milligrams it was small I'm trying to

2098
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:44,780
measure it in my head to give to have

2099
01:46:42,739 --> 01:46:48,469
something to compare it to but it was

2100
01:46:44,779 --> 01:46:50,989
quite tiny I don't have anything in my

2101
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:55,930
range that is about the same size about

2102
01:46:50,989 --> 01:46:57,309
the size of the top of a pill bottle

2103
01:46:55,930 --> 01:46:59,450
[Music]

2104
01:46:57,310 --> 01:47:02,270
like an inch and a half by an inch and a

2105
01:46:59,449 --> 01:47:05,210
half and it was slightly thick but the

2106
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:07,010
thing was there was no way to judge you

2107
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:08,960
could break it in half I guess and kind

2108
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:11,329
of eyeball it but there was no way to

2109
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:13,819
really judge the size of that sort of an

2110
01:47:11,329 --> 01:47:16,220
edible so they're gonna make it or they

2111
01:47:13,819 --> 01:47:18,319
have to be easily broken up and then

2112
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:21,710
that way you eat ten milligrams instead

2113
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:23,449
of trying to guess and get rekt another

2114
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:25,310
change manufacturers will be required to

2115
01:47:23,449 --> 01:47:26,989
put single serving edibles and child

2116
01:47:25,310 --> 01:47:28,850
resistant packaging before shipping them

2117
01:47:26,989 --> 01:47:31,279
to stores instead of relying on stores

2118
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:33,350
to provide the packaging as customers

2119
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:35,329
leave with their purchases so I think

2120
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:37,610
that means more costs also that's gonna

2121
01:47:35,329 --> 01:47:39,500
go up because the manufacturer now has

2122
01:47:37,609 --> 01:47:41,479
to pay for that and then that's just

2123
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:43,640
gonna get moved right on down the line

2124
01:47:41,479 --> 01:47:44,899
to the dispensary and that's gonna get

2125
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:46,850
pushed right on down the line to you

2126
01:47:44,899 --> 01:47:49,369
because now you're able to bring in they

2127
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:51,110
give you this big white it looks like a

2128
01:47:49,369 --> 01:47:53,809
money envelope kind of like a bank bag

2129
01:47:51,109 --> 01:47:55,699
but it's got a child resistant zipper

2130
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:57,400
thing on it it's got like a clasp on the

2131
01:47:55,699 --> 01:47:59,989
zipper that you have to know how to open

2132
01:47:57,399 --> 01:48:01,699
and if you bring that you can put all of

2133
01:47:59,989 --> 01:48:03,319
your edibles and stuff in there and they

2134
01:48:01,699 --> 01:48:05,420
let that count as your childproof

2135
01:48:03,319 --> 01:48:07,130
container you actually you can buy those

2136
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:09,409
or they charge you for them at a lot of

2137
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:10,940
the dispensaries so there's gonna go put

2138
01:48:09,409 --> 01:48:12,389
that right on the product already you're

2139
01:48:10,939 --> 01:48:14,788
gonna pay a little more

2140
01:48:12,389 --> 01:48:16,649
but I guess a couple of bucks to keep

2141
01:48:14,788 --> 01:48:17,969
kids safe as well we got to do and then

2142
01:48:16,649 --> 01:48:19,829
you get into the argument of what about

2143
01:48:17,969 --> 01:48:21,658
parenting it's not uh it's not all about

2144
01:48:19,828 --> 01:48:24,208
the products it's about the parenting

2145
01:48:21,658 --> 01:48:25,408
but that's another argument probably a

2146
01:48:24,208 --> 01:48:27,840
whole other podcast that talks about

2147
01:48:25,408 --> 01:48:30,208
that so the rules this one says the

2148
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:32,159
rules which still must be made permanent

2149
01:48:30,208 --> 01:48:33,418
in a process that will include public

2150
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:34,348
comment will go into effect in November

2151

serving size requirements within the

regulation Rachael O Brien a founding

member of smart Colorado which supports

2165

tighter restrictions on marijuana said

2166
01:49:01,979 --> 01:49:05,010
the rules are a step in the right

2167
01:49:03,208 --> 01:49:07,559
direction the time will tell whether

2168
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:09,510
they go far enough edibles manufacturers

2169
01:49:07,559 --> 01:49:11,248
responding to public demand already

2170
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:13,289
shifted to lower potency edibles since

2171
01:49:11,248 --> 01:49:16,529
recreational sales began January 1st

2172
01:49:13,288 --> 01:49:18,599
said Mike Elliott executive director of

2173
01:49:16,529 --> 01:49:20,398
the marijuana industry group the free

2174
01:49:18,599 --> 01:49:23,819
market has largely addressed this

2175
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:26,159
problem he said I kind of agree that's

2176
01:49:23,819 --> 01:49:27,840
350 milligram in a bowl that I ate it

2177
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:31,529
[ __ ] me up and I'm a professional pot

2178
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:33,779
smoker I take dad's all day I wake and

2179
01:49:31,529 --> 01:49:35,099
bake on a regular basis you know I'm not

2180
01:49:33,779 --> 01:49:37,948
bragging about how much I smoke or

2181
01:49:35,099 --> 01:49:40,529
anything but I get down I'm smoking live

2182
01:49:37,948 --> 01:49:44,848
resin right now I probably took a couple

2183
01:49:40,529 --> 01:49:47,550
of half gram dabs today rekt me so if

2184
01:49:44,849 --> 01:49:48,479
somebody if a normal civilian got ahold

2185
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:50,369
of that thing and eat the whole thing

2186
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:52,349
they'd be destroyed and they would have

2187
01:49:50,368 --> 01:49:55,168
a miserable experience so I think

2188
01:49:52,349 --> 01:49:55,860
clearly marking it as a key that's a

2189
01:49:55,168 --> 01:49:57,418
great idea

2190
01:49:55,859 --> 01:50:01,018
we all remember the story of the lady

2191
01:49:57,418 --> 01:50:02,398
from New York Murray no doubt that ate

2192
01:50:01,019 --> 01:50:04,050
too much edibles and thought she was

2193
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:05,209
[ __ ] turning herself inside out and

2194
01:50:04,050 --> 01:50:07,979
dying in her hotel room

2195
01:50:05,208 --> 01:50:09,719
nobody wants to be that guy

2196
01:50:07,979 --> 01:50:11,070
because I think that's enough news for

2197
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:13,288
the day I just kind of wanted to read

2198
01:50:11,069 --> 01:50:15,808
you that one article Jesse came over we

2199

2201
01:50:16,979 --> 01:50:20,909

2269
01:53:57,179 --> 01:54:00,118
high grow a couple of people that have

2270
01:53:58,889 --> 01:54:01,739
been listening to the podcast kind of

2271
01:54:00,118 --> 01:54:03,719
called us out they said five hundred and

2272
01:54:01,738 --> 01:54:07,019
fifty bucks for a tote of soil if I go

2273
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:09,328
online that's only 299 dollars there

2274
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:11,250
correct they did some research the

2275
01:54:09,328 --> 01:54:13,380
caveat is if you pay two hundred ninety

2276
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:15,389
nine dollars shipping is two hundred and

2277
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:18,118
forty nine dollars yes because it's got

2278
01:54:15,389 --> 01:54:20,400
to be shipped on a FedEx truck we were

2279
01:54:18,118 --> 01:54:22,948
just talking about how big a tote of

2280
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:24,448
soil is it's about the size of a

2281
01:54:22,948 --> 01:54:27,038
Volkswagen

2282
01:54:24,448 --> 01:54:28,688
it's probably three and a half four feet

2283
01:54:27,038 --> 01:54:31,029
wide by three and a half to four feet

2284
01:54:28,689 --> 01:54:32,769
tall depending on how much it's been

2285
01:54:31,029 --> 01:54:35,259
compressed cuz it's gonna kind of squish

2286
01:54:32,769 --> 01:54:36,939
down by gravity and being moved around

2287
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:38,260
there their heaviest [ __ ]

2288
01:54:36,939 --> 01:54:39,249
yeah how are they getting that off the

2289
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:42,668
truck when they bring it to your house

2290
01:54:39,248 --> 01:54:44,498
with a pallet jack so dance you know

2291
01:54:42,668 --> 01:54:46,418
right to your front yard so figure out

2292
01:54:44,498 --> 01:54:47,618
it you know figure it out from there ya

2293
01:54:46,418 --> 01:54:51,179
know where it's gonna go when they get

2294
01:54:47,618 --> 01:54:53,168
there maybe you can sweet-talk the guy

2295
01:54:51,179 --> 01:54:54,309
this show is brought to you by hi girl

2296
01:54:53,168 --> 01:54:55,358
into our growing supplies make sure you

2297
01:54:54,309 --> 01:54:56,708
check out hi girl pretty sure I already

2298
01:54:55,359 --> 01:54:58,389
said that once in the show but I like

2299
01:54:56,708 --> 01:55:01,208
giving them love cuz they give us a lot

2300
01:54:58,389 --> 01:55:03,939
of love Jesse's back he's gonna give us

2301
01:55:01,208 --> 01:55:06,488
a grow lesson we should review a little

2302
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:08,559
bit of what we've done by now we should

2303
01:55:06,488 --> 01:55:10,568
have some big-ass bushes that are in the

2304
01:55:08,559 --> 01:55:12,429
veg stage right oh yeah yeah

2305
01:55:10,569 --> 01:55:14,319
we've talked a little bit about feeding

2306
01:55:12,429 --> 01:55:15,429
we've talked about topdressing a little

2307
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:19,149
tiny bit we're gonna talk more about

2308
01:55:15,429 --> 01:55:20,529
that we should have them kind of let's

2309
01:55:19,149 --> 01:55:23,050
see we're about to start the bloom phase

2310
01:55:20,529 --> 01:55:25,779
in the stretch phase so if we want to

2311
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:27,309
top them and do some training now is

2312
01:55:25,779 --> 01:55:28,328
kind of our last chance we should stop

2313
01:55:27,309 --> 01:55:29,619
topping by now right

2314
01:55:28,328 --> 01:55:31,568
unless we got plants that are gonna

2315
01:55:29,618 --> 01:55:34,299
clear the fence yeah unless you know

2316
01:55:31,569 --> 01:55:38,229
molest Heights a concern and that's your

2317
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:40,119
motivation for topping but you know and

2318
01:55:38,229 --> 01:55:41,588
in that case by all means you know do

2319
01:55:40,118 --> 01:55:44,259
what you need to do to get your crop in

2320
01:55:41,588 --> 01:55:45,639
so the neighbors in that [ __ ] you don't

2321
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:48,819
the people walking down the street to

2322
01:55:45,639 --> 01:55:51,458
see that [ __ ] so if you need and if you

2323
01:55:48,819 --> 01:55:53,349
don't have to do it we can pull the

2324
01:55:51,458 --> 01:55:54,519
plants down a little bit if you have

2325
01:55:53,349 --> 01:55:56,828
been taking care of it you should be

2326
01:55:54,519 --> 01:55:59,079
able to grab some branches the tall ones

2327
01:55:56,828 --> 01:56:02,498
and just pull them down and then maybe

2328
01:55:59,078 --> 01:56:03,998
time to a stake or maybe tie them to

2329
01:56:02,498 --> 01:56:06,368
something in the garden that's already

2330
01:56:03,998 --> 01:56:07,838
there like a rock or something you can

2331
01:56:06,368 --> 01:56:10,088
use a stake in the ground I use big

2332
01:56:07,838 --> 01:56:11,649
bamboo poles just spread that plant out

2333
01:56:10,088 --> 01:56:12,969
to where instead of growing straight up

2334
01:56:11,649 --> 01:56:14,530
you kind of got it girl in a little

2335
01:56:12,969 --> 01:56:18,609
horizontally now's your time to get it

2336
01:56:14,529 --> 01:56:20,168
going cuz I think within the next 10

2337
01:56:18,609 --> 01:56:22,599
days here we're gonna everyone's gonna

2338
01:56:20,168 --> 01:56:24,929
go into flower real heavily yeah I

2339
01:56:22,599 --> 01:56:27,210
believe so I've got some

2340
01:56:24,929 --> 01:56:30,539
I've got a strain that's Tom Hill's deep

2341
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:31,800
chunk crossed with a g13 sorry I fixed

2342
01:56:30,539 --> 01:56:37,140
that noise guys I could not find it I

2343
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:38,940
think I just noticed it you know I've

2344
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:42,390
got a straightener Scot you know some

2345
01:56:38,939 --> 01:56:45,359
kind of Landry stuff in it and it is

2346
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:47,460
started flowering okay actually snuck up

2347
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:50,250
on me and I had to take clones that are

2348
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:51,899
kind of pre flowering so guys that's one

2349
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:54,260
thing we're gonna talk about get clones

2350
01:56:51,899 --> 01:56:56,819
if you've got some outdoor plants and

2351
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:58,199
you're waiting for them to go in flower

2352
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:01,439
and he needs some clones from so you can

2353
01:56:58,198 --> 01:57:02,669
grow next year get clones now I always

2354
01:57:01,439 --> 01:57:03,988
say and this is I'm gonna go off on a

2355
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:06,119
little side right here I warned Jesse

2356
01:57:03,988 --> 01:57:07,769
there'd be a rant about this if you're

2357
01:57:06,119 --> 01:57:10,319
growing from seed or a clone that is

2358
01:57:07,770 --> 01:57:11,909
brand new to you take some clones before

2359
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:13,559
you go into flower it's really

2360
01:57:11,908 --> 01:57:15,869
frustrating when you grow a plant and

2361
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:17,610
it's done and you smoke it with some of

2362
01:57:15,869 --> 01:57:19,140
your friends and know like what the hell

2363
01:57:17,609 --> 01:57:21,119
is this and you're like it's the best

2364
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:22,469
and you all agree and they go I can't

2365
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:24,390
wait till you grow it even better next

2366
01:57:22,469 --> 01:57:25,980
time and you go oh yeah I don't have a

2367
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:27,869
clone of that so we're never gonna get

2368
01:57:25,979 --> 01:57:29,779
to taste this ever again except this one

2369
01:57:27,869 --> 01:57:32,579
round that's the most frustrating

2370
01:57:29,779 --> 01:57:33,899
heartbreaking feeling so take clones you

2371
01:57:32,579 --> 01:57:35,519
guys definitely take clones from

2372
01:57:33,899 --> 01:57:38,670
everything that you grow if you've got

2373
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:40,500
the option that's them that's some

2374
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:44,429
killer advice from a seed company owner

2375
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:46,649
well yeah find that keeper what

2376
01:57:44,429 --> 01:57:52,319
appreciate that how about when you do

2377
01:57:46,649 --> 01:57:53,759
get that harvest heavy a taste dank it

2378
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:55,408
[ __ ] gets you high as hell you're

2379
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:57,449
gonna wish you had a clone of that yep

2380
01:57:55,408 --> 01:57:58,889
yeah I always you had a clone of it too

2381
01:57:57,448 --> 01:58:00,960
because I want to cut when I find you at

2382
01:57:58,890 --> 01:58:03,510
the Cannabis I need to clone of that one

2383
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,948
so get some clones all the time I'm glad

2384
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:06,750
you mentioned the seed company thing

2385
01:58:04,948 --> 01:58:08,428
even yeah that's that's sound advice

2386
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:11,039
right there if I'm the seed guy yeah for

2387
01:58:08,429 --> 01:58:13,500
sure so yeah we're talking about getting

2388
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:15,210
those plants below the fence line you

2389
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:17,069
can kind of you can do the low stress

2390
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:19,260
technique you can do a little bit of

2391
01:58:17,069 --> 01:58:20,729
super dropping like soma does kind of

2392
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:22,710
crack them and bend them a little bit

2393
01:58:20,729 --> 01:58:24,539
now's your last chance really because

2394
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:25,920
you're going into flower in about ten

2395
01:58:24,539 --> 01:58:27,929
days and I really don't like to mess

2396
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:30,539
with plants there are hormones in your

2397
01:58:27,929 --> 01:58:32,670
plants auxins and cytokinins that move

2398
01:58:30,539 --> 01:58:34,229
around with they find the tops of the

2399
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:35,399
plants and affect the Grad the top of

2400
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:37,519
the plant in the way that stuff grows

2401
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:39,049
you don't want to disrupt that right

2402
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:41,030
now that's gonna that'll freak your

2403
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:43,820
plants out a little bit yeah

2404
01:58:41,029 --> 01:58:45,909
mess up bud sizes yeah but you can still

2405
01:58:43,819 --> 01:58:48,289
you can still kind of pull them down and

2406
01:58:45,909 --> 01:58:49,699
low stress training them but you don't

2407
01:58:48,289 --> 01:58:50,420
want to go and kick their ass real bad

2408
01:58:49,699 --> 01:58:54,260

01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:25,269
unicorn hash the unicorn hash yeah

2421

so uh the the ones he did from seed yeah

2422
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:30,680
um tied the rope around the top of the

2423
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:32,539
plant and just pulled the whole frickin

2424
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:36,020
thing down almost like a bow and arrow

2425

2427
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:41,930
road of buds was supercool all the

2428
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:48,500
second branches took over and started

2429
01:59:41,930 --> 01:59:50,539
they all cannabis wants one dominant top

2430
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:52,069

2432
01:59:52,069 --> 01:59:54,829
slowly with the listeners and get

2433
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:56,630
everybody up to speed and not try to Ed

2434
01:59:54,829 --> 01:59:58,789
Rosenthal people when you talk to who

2435
01:59:56,630 --> 02:00:01,430
forgets that we're not all doctors and

2436
01:59:58,789 --> 02:00:02,510
scientists yeah weed scientists and

2437
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:03,710
he'll just blow your mind so I'm trying

2438
02:00:02,510 --> 02:00:05,720
to go slow for you guys will talk about

2439
02:00:03,710 --> 02:00:07,100
the auxins and cytokinins and their

2440
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:09,260
hormones and plants that make them want

2441
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:11,420
to grow a top bud but when you cut out

2442
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:13,159
that top blood all the other bottom buds

2443
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:14,420
go hey I've got the opportunity it's

2444
02:00:13,159 --> 02:00:19,699
like when you kill the you kill the

2445
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:21,859
leader although with the top the bottom

2446
02:00:19,699 --> 02:00:23,479
buds do so if you guys that plant

2447
02:00:21,859 --> 02:00:25,009
pull it over like a fishing pole would

2448
02:00:23,479 --> 02:00:26,869
Bend when you got a fish

2449
02:00:25,010 --> 02:00:28,190
all those little branches that you've

2450
02:00:26,869 --> 02:00:29,960
got those little sucker buzz that

2451
02:00:28,189 --> 02:00:31,909
oftentimes we cut off those will create

2452
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:33,529
nice little bud sites is another they've

2453
02:00:31,909 --> 02:00:35,479
got the chance to become a top and

2454
02:00:33,529 --> 02:00:38,149
they're also exposed to more light yeah

2455
02:00:35,479 --> 02:00:39,709
oh yeah yeah cool it's a real neat

2456
02:00:38,149 --> 02:00:41,779
effect so we should be in the stretch

2457
02:00:39,710 --> 02:00:43,779
phase or starting to pre flower right

2458
02:00:41,779 --> 02:00:48,340
yeah Oh totally yeah

2459
02:00:43,779 --> 02:00:52,119
are you doing anything for bugs now I I

2460
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:55,810
sprayed with neem oil and I just did it

2461
02:00:52,119 --> 02:00:59,500
the last time as soon as I know this

2462
02:00:55,810 --> 02:01:01,870
flower i I really don't special outdoors

2463
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:03,909
I really don't like spraying the plant

2464
02:01:01,869 --> 02:01:07,720
with anything meet you mom

2465
02:01:03,909 --> 02:01:13,059
so I stopped the kelp Mills compost tea

2466
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:15,159
sprays and the neem oil sprays I do that

2467
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:17,860
individually I don't you know just stop

2468
02:01:15,159 --> 02:01:19,359
the whole garden as each uncus train

2469
02:01:17,859 --> 02:01:24,689
starts flowering it's like Oh can't

2470
02:01:19,359 --> 02:01:27,219
spray that plant anymore so you know so

2471
02:01:24,689 --> 02:01:28,449

gonna look for homes and they're gonna

2479
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:50,679
lay eggs because there are normal homes

2480
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:52,660
for laying eggs are gonna be disruption

2481
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:55,390
gonna have to go look under your leaves

2482
02:01:52,659 --> 02:01:56,710

rain because it has been raining every

2491
02:02:13,090 --> 02:02:17,440
day from about 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock

2492
02:02:15,310 --> 02:02:19,930
for the past week until today when it

2493
02:02:17,439 --> 02:02:21,339
was [ __ ] sweltering hot once again um

2494
02:02:19,930 --> 02:02:24,550
I keep my plants hollowed-out

2495
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:30,430
so you know the the foliage on the

2496
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:33,310
inside there isn't really any even and

2497
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:36,670
veg I do that especially as it gets

2498
02:02:33,310 --> 02:02:37,840
later in bed but uh and you guys will

2499
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:41,020
learn when I cut up your plants a little

2500
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:43,420
bit that that helps I think a lot the

2501
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:45,880
biggest thing the rain has been doing to

2502
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:48,989
me is saving me from half of the water

2503
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:51,119
my plants yeah

2504
02:02:48,989 --> 02:02:55,409
my main outdoor gardens in a depression

2505
02:02:51,119 --> 02:02:57,239
so a couple acres drained into it works

2506
02:02:55,409 --> 02:02:59,579

2507
02:02:57,239 --> 02:03:05,039

2508
02:02:59,579 --> 02:03:09,210

2513

me and gave me that like a man handshake

2515
02:03:19,529 --> 02:03:25,019
and a man not like you're welcome walked

2516
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:26,640
away he didn't speak because it was so

2517
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:28,410
loud at the where we were yeah I

2518
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:33,050
wouldn't hurt him if he did speak and I

2519
02:03:28,409 --> 02:03:36,479
was like that's probably pops right he

2520

happen if I don't because I have no

2523
02:03:45,779 --> 02:03:49,109
intention but he just looks like a man

2524
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:52,890
that commands a little bit of respect

2525
02:03:49,109 --> 02:03:55,889

there's usually one fight and it's

2553
02:04:59,770 --> 02:05:04,180

girl on a cotton ball when they start to

2582
02:06:00,039 --> 02:06:03,220
flower it looks like you're getting a

2583
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:07,659
dandelion when they're making flowers if

2584
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:08,710
you've got some balls and literally it

2585
02:06:07,659 --> 02:06:11,349
looks like you're growing a little

2586
02:06:08,710 --> 02:06:13,300
little pack of bananas yeah mr. green

2587
02:06:11,350 --> 02:06:15,430

2588
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:16,869
into balls kill those plants unless

2589
02:06:15,430 --> 02:06:18,190

clones call me so yeah you're looking

2594
02:06:30,819 --> 02:06:34,029
for the you want the dandelion looking

2595
02:06:32,590 --> 02:06:36,520
ones that's the easiest way to describe

2596
02:06:34,029 --> 02:06:37,719
it for sure honestly we gotta do you

2597
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:39,730
guys got to read some books if you

2598
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:41,020
aren't familiar with males and females

2599
02:06:39,729 --> 02:06:42,339
you got to catch up a little bit do a

2600
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:43,660
little bit of reading that's kind of

2601
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:46,029
what a grower needs to know that [ __ ]

2602
02:06:43,659 --> 02:06:48,579
you should be doing so I didn't find the

2603
02:06:46,029 --> 02:06:51,340
males pull the males and even feminized

2604
02:06:48,579 --> 02:06:56,430
seeds keep an eye on them yeah it's fit

2605
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:58,640
feminizing is not a 100% we say 99% way

2606
02:06:56,430 --> 02:06:59,930
still there's

2607
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:01,640
problems happen when you're making if

2608
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:03,200
you use certain methods you're less

2609
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:05,180
likely to get Femmes but if you use

2610
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:07,579
certain methods then fims occur often

2611
02:07:05,180 --> 02:07:10,520
I've seen it at a big dispensary girl

2612
02:07:07,579 --> 02:07:13,970
grew out of like 250 feminized seeds

2613
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:17,780
they had like four males pay attention

2614
02:07:13,970 --> 02:07:20,480
no no um and it all got wrecked and the

2615
02:07:17,779 --> 02:07:22,670
owner was quite pissed and you know it

2616
02:07:20,479 --> 02:07:26,479
was explained to him you know that 99%

2617
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:29,829
do the math 250 plants yeah no he's got

2618
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:32,169
a problem with feminized seeds right yes

2619
02:07:29,829 --> 02:07:34,789
I want to make sure that people hear you

2620
02:07:32,170 --> 02:07:37,279
dispensary owners in general don't like

2621
02:07:34,789 --> 02:07:40,579
growing from seed so yeah the ones that

2622
02:07:37,279 --> 02:07:41,809
do mad props to you guys yes man you get

2623
02:07:40,579 --> 02:07:43,819
such great [ __ ] when you grow if you

2624
02:07:41,810 --> 02:07:45,920
don't know what you're gonna proprietary

2625
02:07:43,819 --> 02:07:47,599
genetics and you don't have the clone

2626
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:49,069
that everybody in your neighborhoods

2627
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:52,039
growing everybody around here right now

2628
02:07:49,069 --> 02:07:54,170
has a damn blue dream clone flow-flow I

2629
02:07:52,039 --> 02:07:55,760
kind of like I give outflow to new

2630
02:07:54,170 --> 02:07:57,260
growers if you like I'm new and I need

2631
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:58,640
to grow them like try this flow cup and

2632
02:07:57,260 --> 02:08:00,050
actually I think that's flow to cut I

2633
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:01,850
don't really think that code we have is

2634
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:02,619
flow I've always thought the exact same

2635
02:08:01,850 --> 02:08:05,150
things

2636
02:08:02,619 --> 02:08:07,460
there's somebody in Colorado that posted

2637
02:08:05,149 --> 02:08:09,319
on Facebook that they know that that's

2638
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:11,869
flow data and then they actually got

2639
02:08:09,319 --> 02:08:13,189
that cut from Ed Rosenthal okay if

2640
02:08:11,869 --> 02:08:15,559
you're listening to this show please

2641
02:08:13,189 --> 02:08:17,359
tweet me or Facebook me you can go to

2642
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:19,760
hydrogen etics or I grow culture on

2643
02:08:17,359 --> 02:08:21,259
Facebook or Twitter please because I

2644
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:23,659
want to know more about the cut of flow

2645
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:26,239
that goes around Colorado yeah there's a

2646
02:08:23,659 --> 02:08:29,090
cut called tangerine that is not tangi

2647
02:08:26,239 --> 02:08:31,340
it's to the tange which a man that's is

2648
02:08:29,090 --> 02:08:37,270
so confusing I think that is v'lo and

2649
02:08:31,340 --> 02:08:37,270
urban poison okay okay okay okay yeah

2650
02:08:38,829 --> 02:08:43,069
it's not Angie everyone calls it tange

2651
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:44,510
and they called it the tange Tanjore the

2652
02:08:43,069 --> 02:08:48,439
tank tank for a little while around

2653
02:08:44,510 --> 02:08:50,900
there okay slow and urban poison crime

2654
02:08:48,439 --> 02:08:52,428
gang they remember a big full full

2655
02:08:50,899 --> 02:08:56,268
spread

2656
02:08:52,429 --> 02:08:58,819
um dispensary has about that strange way

2657
02:08:56,269 --> 02:09:00,860
back somebody near the Fort Collins area

2658
02:08:58,819 --> 02:09:02,748
made that one really is from what I know

2659
02:09:00,859 --> 02:09:04,158
yeah there's a lot of it's a problem

2660
02:09:02,748 --> 02:09:06,170
with the weed world because by the time

2661
02:09:04,158 --> 02:09:07,879
I give you a clone the story has changed

2662
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:10,010
and then you give it to somebody else

2663
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:11,449
and the story has totally changed and

2664
02:09:10,010 --> 02:09:13,789
then they pass it on and now it's not

2665
02:09:11,448 --> 02:09:15,859
even the same strain and it's being

2666
02:09:13,788 --> 02:09:18,738
hoarded or it's being hoard out for way

2667
02:09:15,859 --> 02:09:20,058
too much money it's not being grown to

2668
02:09:18,738 --> 02:09:25,698
its potential because it's not being

2669
02:09:20,059 --> 02:09:27,199
called what it is yeah so we're in the

2670
02:09:25,698 --> 02:09:30,049
stretch phase we're blooming we're

2671
02:09:27,198 --> 02:09:31,488
getting off track here it's cool ya know

2672
02:09:30,050 --> 02:09:33,380
it's cool that they seem to like the

2673
02:09:31,488 --> 02:09:34,938
listeners have responded man they like

2674
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:36,800
it when I get all high and just talk

2675
02:09:34,939 --> 02:09:38,840
nice yeah they like it when I kind of go

2676
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:42,260
off course cuz I ate a big ass edible Oh

2677
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:43,760
guys I'm late I gotta tell you I felt

2678
02:09:42,260 --> 02:09:46,579
like [ __ ] for the whole next day though

2679
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:49,248
eating that whole edible really took a

2680
02:09:46,578 --> 02:09:51,288
toll on my body I'm getting old as part

2681
02:09:49,248 --> 02:09:53,118
of what I'm trying to say I'm 35 now and

2682
02:09:51,288 --> 02:09:54,319
I think when I was 25 I probably could

2683
02:09:53,118 --> 02:09:55,848
have done it and not felt like [ __ ] the

2684
02:09:54,319 --> 02:10:01,009
next day but I had to go get some

2685
02:09:55,849 --> 02:10:02,809
kombucha and [ __ ] put myself back on

2686
02:10:01,010 --> 02:10:04,429
track but no disrespect to that edible

2687
02:10:02,809 --> 02:10:06,800
company I was not supposed to eat all of

2688
02:10:04,429 --> 02:10:10,519
it at once no so listen to that episode

2689
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:11,840
I was you were yeah not at all you

2690
02:10:10,519 --> 02:10:14,530
weren't even supposed to eat half of

2691
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:14,529
that yeah

2692
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:20,868
why do they make this stuff so good

2693
02:10:16,248 --> 02:10:23,748
though it was delicious dinner or a

2694
02:10:20,868 --> 02:10:25,429
restaurant dessert I'd order that thing

2695
02:10:23,748 --> 02:10:27,859
you serve put some ice cream with it

2696
02:10:25,429 --> 02:10:29,420
it'd be delicious so since we're going

2697
02:10:27,859 --> 02:10:30,889
into flour we're starting to stretch a

2698
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:32,958
little bit we're looking for the males

2699
02:10:30,889 --> 02:10:34,969
we're looking for hermaphrodites also if

2700
02:10:32,958 --> 02:10:36,859
it's question if it's weird keep a

2701
02:10:34,969 --> 02:10:40,729
really good eye on it lower inner

2702
02:10:36,859 --> 02:10:42,198
branches yeah that's a good spot to look

2703
02:10:40,729 --> 02:10:44,630
for hermes where you don't get as much

2704
02:10:42,198 --> 02:10:47,598
light straight on the top tube top plate

2705
02:10:44,630 --> 02:10:49,248
buds that's a common area too so get

2706
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:50,538
those out of there the males in the

2707
02:10:49,248 --> 02:10:51,828
rooms get them out of there put them in

2708
02:10:50,538 --> 02:10:53,208
the fire pit

2709
02:10:51,828 --> 02:10:54,768
it gets be careful when you're throwing

2710
02:10:53,208 --> 02:10:56,658
away your trash if you live in a non

2711
02:10:54,769 --> 02:10:57,979

oh yeah that's a classic one I got rare

2739
02:12:18,119 --> 02:12:22,159
all right

2740
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:25,229
vegetarian let's feed our ganja plants

2741
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:27,630
we're going into bloom so we can slowly

2742
02:12:25,229 --> 02:12:30,419
decrease the nitrogen and increase the

2743
02:12:27,630 --> 02:12:32,880
phosphorus and potassium if you're top

2744
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:34,890
dressing you can switch your teas to the

2745
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:37,650
more phosphorus and potassium based teas

2746
02:12:34,890 --> 02:12:39,119
for sure if you're using the light

2747
02:12:37,649 --> 02:12:40,949
granulated products that they sell in

2748
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:42,809
the store you can go ahead and switch to

2749
02:12:40,949 --> 02:12:44,099
the bloom version of those products now

2750
02:12:42,810 --> 02:12:47,270
you don't have to keep using that veg

2751
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:48,650
stuff yeah slowly switch that stuff

2752
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:52,730
[Music]

2753
02:12:48,649 --> 02:12:53,839
still well I don't yeah assuming you've

2754
02:12:52,729 --> 02:12:57,139
only applied it one or two times

2755
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:59,329
something like that it makes it look

2756
02:12:57,140 --> 02:13:02,300
just make sure you have nitrogen because

2757
02:12:59,329 --> 02:13:04,399
a lot of time those products are pretty

2758
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:06,409
low on nitrogen okay on the blue side

2759
02:13:04,399 --> 02:13:08,869
maybe well actually when I feed my

2760
02:13:06,409 --> 02:13:10,550
indoor plants I don't switch the day

2761
02:13:08,869 --> 02:13:12,319
that I put them into flower I don't just

2762
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:13,940
say they're in flower let's cut out all

2763
02:13:12,319 --> 02:13:15,769
the veg newts and go to just my bloom

2764
02:13:13,939 --> 02:13:17,989
schedule I kind of phase it out there's

2765
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:20,270
like a week period and I also keep my

2766
02:13:17,989 --> 02:13:22,159
metal halide lights in for about 14 to

2767
02:13:20,270 --> 02:13:23,960
21 days to keep them short and stocky

2768
02:13:22,159 --> 02:13:25,550
and then when you switch them you really

2769
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:29,000
see them they stay low and the buds

2770
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:31,220
fatten up so that's yeah so just slowly

2771
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:34,810
I like to phase out my veg into my bloom

2772
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:34,810
feed is what I think I'm trying to say

2773
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:43,579
yeah start that Mexican bat guano epsom

2774
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:45,980
salts if you're using that it's a good

2775
02:13:43,579 --> 02:13:47,899
time to be fuller you know my last

2780
02:13:54,710 --> 02:13:59,750
companies have blended guano's with

2781
02:13:56,710 --> 02:14:02,720
different ek values so just you want a

2782
02:13:59,750 --> 02:14:08,210
high PK so any alfalfa meal with this

2783
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:10,100

2796
02:14:42,680 --> 02:14:47,600
what we're talking about I've had my own

2797
02:14:44,770 --> 02:14:49,460
I've made my own worm castings before

2798

2799
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:52,350
so

2800
02:14:50,698 --> 02:14:54,389

my plants that within 24 hours the next

2824
02:15:50,039 --> 02:15:53,519
light cycle 2 light cycles later I guess

2825
02:15:51,988 --> 02:15:53,968
when they come on their prey in their

2826
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:56,400
honor

2827
02:15:53,969 --> 02:15:59,310
these are pointing straight up like yes

2828
02:15:56,399 --> 02:16:00,929
we can pray yeah they love that it

2829
02:15:59,310 --> 02:16:03,840
should be their slogan ya know that's

live in this state and yeah changed my

2952
02:20:59,129 --> 02:21:02,640
whole outlook on things for sure alright

2953
02:21:01,110 --> 02:21:04,409
guys we've talked a little bit about

2954
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:05,970
outdoor growing we're starting to bloom

2955
02:21:04,409 --> 02:21:08,250
I told you how to find your males your

2956
02:21:05,970 --> 02:21:09,779
hermaphrodites get those out of there we

2957
02:21:08,250 --> 02:21:11,101
told you to cut clones make sure you cut

2958
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:12,870
clones you don't want to grow some [ __ ]

2959
02:21:11,101 --> 02:21:13,440
and then be like this is my best strain

2960
02:21:12,870 --> 02:21:15,960
ever

2961
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:17,069
it's gone I've done that actually grew a

2962
02:21:15,959 --> 02:21:18,300
strain I don't know if I even want to

2963
02:21:17,069 --> 02:21:20,130
say the name Kevin if you're listening

2964
02:21:18,300 --> 02:21:22,949
it was that uh that strain that you and

2965
02:21:20,130 --> 02:21:24,569
pops loved I couldn't get it to root

2966
02:21:22,950 --> 02:21:27,091
those clones would not take roots for

2967
02:21:24,569 --> 02:21:28,529
the life of me so it got away I've got

2968
02:21:27,091 --> 02:21:29,671
another pack of those seeds we'll see if

2969
02:21:28,530 --> 02:21:31,500
that works

2970
02:21:29,671 --> 02:21:34,021

2983
02:22:01,261 --> 02:22:07,319
time so blood meal bone meal any of that

2984
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:08,489
stuff yet I've never put any in that

2985
02:22:07,319 --> 02:22:10,770
stuff oh you don't like slaughterhouse

2986
02:22:08,489 --> 02:22:14,039
products well no I use it I've never put

2987
02:22:10,771 --> 02:22:15,391
it in a tea but top dressing yeah okay I

2988
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:18,450
do have an issue with slaughterhouse

2989
02:22:15,390 --> 02:22:20,489
products but I also have a [ __ ] ton of

2990
02:22:18,450 --> 02:22:22,500
slaughterhouse properties so you're a

2991
02:22:20,489 --> 02:22:24,841
farmer and you understand yeah you

2992
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:26,630
balance it out yeah I mean there's

2993
02:22:24,841 --> 02:22:29,881
nothing wrong with blood mills just like

2994
02:22:26,630 --> 02:22:31,380
where well I mean I guess the argument

2995
02:22:29,880 --> 02:22:33,421
could be made that there is something

2996
02:22:31,380 --> 02:22:34,800
wrong with it but the biggest thing with

2997
02:22:33,421 --> 02:22:36,780
commercial blood mills we don't know

2998
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:38,609
where it came from and you know those

2999
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:40,829
very least that's my big issue with it

3000
02:22:38,610 --> 02:22:43,620
and those accounts were fed [ __ ] that I

3001
02:22:40,829 --> 02:22:46,261
probably highly disapprove of so yeah

3002
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:47,610
and don't want to put into my body part

3003
02:22:46,261 --> 02:22:49,351
of why I'm a vegetarian is because the

3004
02:22:47,610 --> 02:22:50,700
way they treat cows yeah for sure

3005
02:22:49,351 --> 02:22:53,101
there's no need to contribute to that in

3006
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:55,381
my opinion in general I don't really

3007
02:22:53,101 --> 02:22:56,671
like eating beef and I can't stand

3008
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:58,409
ground beef it's one of the most

3009
02:22:56,671 --> 02:23:02,700
disgusting things I can that's the most

3010
02:22:58,409 --> 02:23:04,959
questionable meat yeah what I hate when

3011
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:07,960
I'm working and in a hurry

3012
02:23:04,959 --> 02:23:10,060
yeah as a farmer and a grower are you

3013
02:23:07,959 --> 02:23:12,239
bothered by like fast-food joints by

3014
02:23:10,060 --> 02:23:15,610
seeing what people are eating yeah

3015
02:23:12,239 --> 02:23:17,470
prostates any kind of processed meat and

3016
02:23:15,610 --> 02:23:21,280
I'm just as guilty of it

3017
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:22,810
I try hard when I get busy in life you

3018
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:24,311
know it's just it's hard to cook and

3019
02:23:22,810 --> 02:23:27,190
it's easy to drive through drive through

3020
02:23:24,310 --> 02:23:29,470
and but yeah that's that's why this

3021
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:33,431
country so fat that's why we have cancer

3022
02:23:29,470 --> 02:23:35,350
that's everything it's just yeah I agree

3023
02:23:33,431 --> 02:23:37,480
I have a huge issue with all that stuff

3024
02:23:35,351 --> 02:23:39,040
you know we paid people will pay top

3025
02:23:37,479 --> 02:23:41,020
dollar for their booze pay top dollar

3026
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:42,431
for their herb but then spend ninety

3027
02:23:41,021 --> 02:23:45,190
nine cents on the [ __ ] cheeseburger

3028
02:23:42,431 --> 02:23:47,950
yeah yeah those books on yourself guys

3029
02:23:45,190 --> 02:23:50,079
yeah cancer is expensive later just life

3030
02:23:47,950 --> 02:23:52,181
just cook at home that's good for

3031

from Jesse you learned some [ __ ] on

the girl lesson before we kind of start

3041
02:24:11,829 --> 02:24:18,761
wrapping it up a little D vegging go

3042
02:24:17,050 --> 02:24:22,300
ahead pull up the bottoms of the plants

3043
02:24:18,761 --> 02:24:24,220
so clip off any shape their legs shave

3044
02:24:22,300 --> 02:24:26,829
their legs that's make them sexy all

3045
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:28,180
that bottom stuff is gonna be crap and

3046
02:24:26,829 --> 02:24:29,709
larf and it's gonna kind of take away

3047
02:24:28,181 --> 02:24:31,659
from the top of your plant so take that

3048
02:24:29,709 --> 02:24:32,859
bottom the little sucker leaves you can

3049
02:24:31,659 --> 02:24:34,690
tell what I'm talking about if it's not

3050
02:24:32,860 --> 02:24:35,891
making and you can do this all the way

3051
02:24:34,690 --> 02:24:38,170
up to like three or four weeks into

3052
02:24:35,890 --> 02:24:42,130
bloom if you keep doing it yeah yeah

3053
02:24:38,170 --> 02:24:43,271
just yeah is in the way you'll know well

3054
02:24:42,130 --> 02:24:44,949
if he doesn't look like it's gonna be a

3055
02:24:43,271 --> 02:24:46,061
bud worth trimming take it off it

3056
02:24:44,950 --> 02:24:47,351
doesn't need to be there and throw it

3057
02:24:46,060 --> 02:24:48,789
away don't just throw it on the ground I

3058
02:24:47,351 --> 02:24:50,230
see a lot of you guys cut your leaves

3059
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:52,210

little bit a little off alpha

3064
02:25:02,149 --> 02:25:09,001
some old hay that we had laying around

3065
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:12,060

3066

all the city fun yeah that's the same

3067

[ __ ] some compost and you know just

3068
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:22,831
helps hold water it's getting into the

3069
02:25:20,671 --> 02:25:26,121
hot time of year and normally of work

3074
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:40,530
rid of all your green waste so you know

3075
02:25:36,450 --> 02:25:42,510

3076
02:25:40,531 --> 02:25:43,980

3077
02:25:42,511 --> 02:25:45,479
cannabis leaves if you haven't been

3078

3084
02:25:55,620 --> 02:25:58,740
everyone's gonna move to the country and

3085
02:25:57,271 --> 02:26:00,570
abandon the city and all move out to the

3312
02:37:00,590 --> 02:37:06,889
over here that was a largest a but I've

3313
02:37:04,610 --> 02:37:07,280
ever seen Jesse voluntarily take on his

3314
02:37:06,889 --> 02:37:08,869
own

3315
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:11,450
I've seen people give him a dab that bit

3316
02:37:08,870 --> 02:37:13,910

couldn't hear it nice well we're here to

3321
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:21,740
gather and talk about the subject of

3322
02:37:20,120 --> 02:37:24,950
hand which today I decided we want to

3323
02:37:21,739 --> 02:37:26,209
talk about clones versus seeds and maybe

3324
02:37:24,950 --> 02:37:28,490
we'll do a little bit of talking about

3325
02:37:26,209 --> 02:37:30,919
feminized seeds and we might talk a

3326
02:37:28,489 --> 02:37:32,329
little bit briefly briefly about Auto

3327
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:33,319
flowers I got one thing I wanted to

3328
02:37:32,329 --> 02:37:34,700
mention in there this mix that I'm

3329
02:37:33,319 --> 02:37:36,329
playing really has a lot of volume jumps

3330
02:37:34,700 --> 02:37:38,310
in the background so I apologize that

3331
02:37:36,329 --> 02:37:39,600
it's so jumpy you listening to DJ

3332
02:37:38,309 --> 02:37:40,920
nicotine in the background again I got

3333
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:42,180
to give them a shout out shout out DJ

3334
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:44,909
nicotine thanks for let me play your

3335
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:46,260
music that's awesome so everybody at

3336
02:37:44,909 --> 02:37:49,049
this table is a pretty damn experienced

3337
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:50,880
grower you got I'd call myself a breeder

3338
02:37:49,049 --> 02:37:51,898
Jesse's a pollen chucker maybe a breeder

3339
02:37:50,879 --> 02:37:54,239
I don't know if you'd call himself a

3340
02:37:51,898 --> 02:37:56,639
breeder yet more practice

3341
02:37:54,239 --> 02:37:58,949
Spence is a hell of a grower we had some

3342
02:37:56,639 --> 02:38:00,389
stuff tested and Spence's tested higher

3343
02:37:58,950 --> 02:38:01,560
than all of my stuff and he grew

3344
02:38:00,389 --> 02:38:04,978
somebody else's strain do you remember

3345
02:38:01,559 --> 02:38:11,250
what the numbers were bro um Capleton

3346
02:38:04,978 --> 02:38:14,068
was 20% there's a Girl Scout cookie

3347
02:38:11,250 --> 02:38:19,770
cross which was creepy OG and Girl Scout

3348
02:38:14,068 --> 02:38:25,109
it was 25 maybe 24 probably 24 Ryan's

3349
02:38:19,770 --> 02:38:26,939
Rhyno 100% sativa 25% and then form

3350
02:38:25,109 --> 02:38:29,280
scout or reformed Girl Scout cookies

3351
02:38:26,939 --> 02:38:30,930
tested at right around 27 so this guy

3352
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:33,300
crushed it he had some great great tests

3353
02:38:30,930 --> 02:38:40,500
my veganic lemon jeffery tested right

3354
02:38:33,299 --> 02:38:41,759
around 24 probably ever smoked well

3355
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:43,318
thank you how much have you got ik weet

3356
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:45,989
have you smoked do you know um I've

3357
02:38:43,318 --> 02:38:47,369
smoked some I smoked some from there's a

3358
02:38:45,989 --> 02:38:49,680
place in the springs I think it's Valley

3359
02:38:47,370 --> 02:38:51,420
actual mystics they say lit that's

3360
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:57,270
really the only really place and then I

3361
02:38:51,420 --> 02:38:59,989
tried some of buds and roses so mine

3362
02:38:57,270 --> 02:39:01,550
stood up to Kyle kushman oh definitely

3363
02:38:59,989 --> 02:39:05,159
definitely

3364
02:39:01,549 --> 02:39:06,898
you have a thing for sativas and not a

3365
02:39:05,159 --> 02:39:09,659
lot of people like sativas but I like

3366
02:39:06,898 --> 02:39:13,439
the you know the citrusy really high

3367
02:39:09,659 --> 02:39:15,148
highs like take more time to grow like a

3368
02:39:13,439 --> 02:39:17,100
sativa does he let you get more out of

3369
02:39:15,148 --> 02:39:18,840
it it's nothing but the longer the

3370
02:39:17,100 --> 02:39:21,270
better in my opinion for sure

3371
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:22,530
depending on your technique yeah yeah

3372
02:39:21,270 --> 02:39:23,060
guys quit cutting your plants down too

3373
02:39:22,530 --> 02:39:26,550
early

3374
02:39:23,059 --> 02:39:28,079
alright so I was just and Jesse to give

3375
02:39:26,549 --> 02:39:29,938
him some credit in the game he won the

3376
02:39:28,079 --> 02:39:31,289
Pueblo super Blood Bowl and they gave

3377
02:39:29,939 --> 02:39:32,670
him hell a huge compliments if you guys

3378
02:39:31,290 --> 02:39:35,520
listened to past episodes we talked

3379
02:39:32,670 --> 02:39:37,350
about that the judges of the super Blood

3380
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:40,590
Bowl said that Jesse strains stood out

3381
02:39:37,350 --> 02:39:42,239
in flavor aroma taste in affect overall

3382
02:39:40,590 --> 02:39:46,260
without a doubt he was the hands-down

3383
02:39:42,239 --> 02:39:48,959
winner the freakin champ right yes yes

3384
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:49,239
grape OG hell of a strain too I took

3385
02:39:48,959 --> 02:39:51,669
some

3386
02:39:49,239 --> 02:39:52,899
of it today we'll see what atlases so

3387
02:39:51,670 --> 02:39:54,280
these guys are we're all experienced

3388
02:39:52,899 --> 02:39:55,539
growers here I'm of course the breeder

3389
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:55,900
from Ira genetics so I know what I'm

3390
02:39:55,540 --> 02:39:57,010
doing

3391
02:39:55,899 --> 02:39:59,229
we're gonna talk a little bit about

3392
02:39:57,010 --> 02:40:00,940
clones and seeds do you guys do you have

3393
02:39:59,229 --> 02:40:05,260
a preference Jesse from going growing

3394
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:07,480
from clone or seed has more to do with

3395
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:12,851
the admission I guess of you know

3396
02:40:07,479 --> 02:40:16,060
whatever particular round but I'd grow

3397
02:40:12,851 --> 02:40:18,610
from seed if that was you know all I

3398
02:40:16,060 --> 02:40:20,020
could do from now on okay so if you're

3399
02:40:18,610 --> 02:40:21,400
gonna I guess a better question would be

3400
02:40:20,021 --> 02:40:23,440
if you're gonna set up a giant warehouse

3401
02:40:21,399 --> 02:40:26,440
not a giant what if I give you 20 lights

3402
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:27,851
and I was 20 flowering lights and it's

3403
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:29,260
all yours you're gonna start brand new

3404
02:40:27,851 --> 02:40:35,050
would you grow from clones receipts at

3405
02:40:29,260 --> 02:40:37,440
that point all right how about you

3406
02:40:35,049 --> 02:40:40,299
Spence if you had 20 lights to play with

3407
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:44,069
if I had it to play with I'd probably

3408
02:40:40,299 --> 02:40:44,069
take like two lights

3409
02:40:45,149 --> 02:40:50,020
that's bad scale you want something

3410
02:40:47,890 --> 02:40:51,549
that's proven give you what you want

3411
02:40:50,021 --> 02:40:54,489
that's a perfect segue into what I was

3412
02:40:51,549 --> 02:40:56,619
gonna say clones the pros of clones are

3413
02:40:54,489 --> 02:40:57,819
that you know you've got females those

3414
02:40:56,620 --> 02:40:59,170
have been ran and tested so if you've

3415
02:40:57,819 --> 02:41:00,610
got a clone I'll talk a little bit about

3416
02:40:59,170 --> 02:41:01,989
a clone and give some setup for what

3417
02:41:00,610 --> 02:41:04,540
they are cuz people are new listeners a

3418
02:41:01,989 --> 02:41:06,729
clone is a cutting taken from a plant a

3419
02:41:04,540 --> 02:41:08,800
mother plant that you hopefully have ran

3420
02:41:06,729 --> 02:41:10,539
before and flowered out and you know

3421
02:41:08,799 --> 02:41:11,890
that that's some good [ __ ] or someone

3422
02:41:10,540 --> 02:41:13,721
else or someone else has when your

3423
02:41:11,890 --> 02:41:15,039
trusted bros like Spencer Jesse at the

3424
02:41:13,720 --> 02:41:17,500
table if they give me a clue I

3425
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:19,690
definitely appreciate it trust it I

3426
02:41:17,500 --> 02:41:21,310
don't usually get dispensary clones and

3427
02:41:19,690 --> 02:41:23,829
stuff that are mediocre most of the time

3428
02:41:21,310 --> 02:41:25,449
so you know you're getting it from but

3429
02:41:23,829 --> 02:41:28,090
usually it's a reliable crop it's a

3430
02:41:25,450 --> 02:41:29,771
female you're familiar with it somebody

3431
02:41:28,090 --> 02:41:31,450
in the crew has grown it we can say that

3432
02:41:29,771 --> 02:41:33,311
takes eight weeks that takes nine weeks

3433
02:41:31,450 --> 02:41:34,659
that takes ten weeks or be careful

3434
02:41:33,310 --> 02:41:36,431
because that [ __ ] might herm if you

3435
02:41:34,659 --> 02:41:38,260
over nitrogen it you know there there's

3436
02:41:36,431 --> 02:41:40,510
things we know so that's one of the

3437
02:41:38,260 --> 02:41:42,101
super super pros of a clone

3438
02:41:40,510 --> 02:41:44,351
we know the growth patterns we know if

3439
02:41:42,101 --> 02:41:45,550
we need to top it we know if we need to

3440
02:41:44,351 --> 02:41:46,900
train it a little bit we know how tall

3441
02:41:45,549 --> 02:41:48,759
it's gonna get I know that the Sour

3442
02:41:46,899 --> 02:41:50,229
Diesel could I've got if you let it grow

3443
02:41:48,760 --> 02:41:52,360
more than two feet tall and veg it's

3444
02:41:50,229 --> 02:41:54,069
gonna be eight feet tall and flower and

3445
02:41:52,360 --> 02:41:55,780
I know that from we've grown it several

3446
02:41:54,069 --> 02:41:58,510
times I grew that one time

3447
02:41:55,780 --> 02:42:01,120
and I'll learn yeah you learnt quick on

3448
02:41:58,510 --> 02:42:03,040
that [ __ ] tickling your lights and then

3449
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:04,030
you know what to feed it also because

3450
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:05,380
you know how long it's gonna take you

3451
02:42:04,030 --> 02:42:06,420
know when to begin flushing you know

3452
02:42:05,379 --> 02:42:08,949
when it's gonna be done

3453
02:42:06,420 --> 02:42:11,680
the cons of clones this is why I was

3454
02:42:08,950 --> 02:42:14,079
asking about the giant warehouse clones

3455
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:16,270
are where you get most of your damn bugs

3456
02:42:14,079 --> 02:42:17,979
I think when some one of your buddies

3457
02:42:16,270 --> 02:42:20,470
tries to give you a sweet cut a Sour

3458
02:42:17,979 --> 02:42:22,029
Diesel and you get it to your garden and

3459
02:42:20,469 --> 02:42:26,549
your irresponsible and it's partly your

3460
02:42:22,030 --> 02:42:28,989
responsibility to quarantine but

3461
02:42:26,549 --> 02:42:31,929
sometimes you fail yourself just like

3462
02:42:28,989 --> 02:42:34,719
that guy did and you end up with spider

3463
02:42:31,930 --> 02:42:36,040
mites the feared hamper us at my inner

3464
02:42:34,719 --> 02:42:38,010
weed garden right now those things will

3465
02:42:36,040 --> 02:42:40,540
take down your entire crop in two days I

3466
02:42:38,010 --> 02:42:45,520
had a friend told me he had those he's

3467
02:42:40,540 --> 02:42:48,250
like you want to see them ever get those

3468
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:49,690
just start over yeah fire is the cure

3469
02:42:48,250 --> 02:42:51,729
actually I have something I'm

3470
02:42:49,690 --> 02:42:52,630
experimenting with a product I don't

3471
02:42:51,729 --> 02:42:53,709
know if I've mentioned it on the show

3472
02:42:52,629 --> 02:42:56,199
because I don't want to say anything

3473
02:42:53,709 --> 02:42:58,659
until I'm familiar with it it seems to

3474
02:42:56,200 --> 02:43:01,079
kill everything unfortunately if you do

3475
02:42:58,659 --> 02:43:03,459
it wrong it will kill everything yeah I

3476
02:43:01,079 --> 02:43:04,840
volunteered a few plants and I did a few

3477
02:43:03,459 --> 02:43:08,799
different applications and a couple of

3478
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:10,420
them but if I were to do it right I feel

3479
02:43:08,799 --> 02:43:12,399
like it'll work well so I'm gonna learn

3480
02:43:10,420 --> 02:43:16,649
it cool that's gonna make you hard to

3481
02:43:12,399 --> 02:43:16,649
hear Jessie's afraid of the microphone

3482
02:43:18,379 --> 02:43:22,389
[Music]

3483
02:43:20,370 --> 02:43:24,160
that's good if you guys were wondering

3484
02:43:22,389 --> 02:43:26,260
what that furry sound is it's music in

3485
02:43:24,159 --> 02:43:28,569
the background it's not just on the

3486
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:30,219
microphone so we get our bugs our

3487
02:43:28,569 --> 02:43:33,100
problems our diseases our pathogens

3488
02:43:30,219 --> 02:43:35,170
powdery mildew comes from clones seeds

3489
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:37,350
do not carry bugs they do not carry

3490
02:43:35,170 --> 02:43:40,569
diseases they do not carry pathogens

3491
02:43:37,350 --> 02:43:42,550
something about a clone if I if I grow a

3492
02:43:40,569 --> 02:43:44,229
pack of seeds and I pick the keeper out

3493
02:43:42,549 --> 02:43:45,429
of that so you grow ten seeds there'd be

3494
02:43:44,229 --> 02:43:47,979
different phenotypes in there hopefully

3495
02:43:45,430 --> 02:43:50,079
you find that one that's stellar maybe

3496
02:43:47,979 --> 02:43:51,789
my opinion of that stellar plant is way

3497
02:43:50,079 --> 02:43:53,469
different than Spence's opinion or way

3498
02:43:51,790 --> 02:43:55,720
different than Jesse's opinion or the

3499
02:43:53,469 --> 02:43:58,029
other guy growing or so you like the

3500
02:43:55,719 --> 02:44:00,250
ability to pick my own which is a

3501
02:43:58,030 --> 02:44:01,918
benefit of the seed and a guard of the

3502
02:44:00,250 --> 02:44:03,930
clone

3503
02:44:01,918 --> 02:44:05,398
and maybe my grouse style or what I'm

3504
02:44:03,930 --> 02:44:08,668
looking for is way different than what

3505
02:44:05,398 --> 02:44:10,228
you guys are looking for yeah when you

3506
02:44:08,668 --> 02:44:11,818
get a ten pack of seeds how many keepers

3507
02:44:10,228 --> 02:44:13,408
do you hope to find out of those do you

3508
02:44:11,818 --> 02:44:17,068
hope for that just water are you looking

3509
02:44:13,408 --> 02:44:18,868
for all ten of I usually um I just look

3510
02:44:17,068 --> 02:44:20,549
for differences throughout because some

3511
02:44:18,869 --> 02:44:21,748
of them depending on what you're you

3512
02:44:20,549 --> 02:44:24,628
know what kind of seeds are popping

3513
02:44:21,748 --> 02:44:27,238
you'll find differences and whatnot so I

3514
02:44:24,629 --> 02:44:30,270
usually try to keep three just so I have

3515
02:44:27,238 --> 02:44:32,038
a you know if I have three plants that

3516
02:44:30,270 --> 02:44:33,390
don't all look the same maybe you know I

3517
02:44:32,039 --> 02:44:36,060
just want a better chance of finding

3518
02:44:33,389 --> 02:44:37,948
something yes not as or that's better

3519
02:44:36,059 --> 02:44:39,478
than one of the other it's good that you

3520
02:44:37,949 --> 02:44:41,310
say three in my opinion because usually

3521
02:44:39,478 --> 02:44:43,198
I find the one that looks like if you're

3522
02:44:41,309 --> 02:44:44,760
crossing male and a female plant I like

3523
02:44:43,199 --> 02:44:46,140
to find the male like the one that looks

3524
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:47,728
like the male the momma looks like the

3525
02:44:46,139 --> 02:44:49,828
female and then that one that's a hybrid

3526
02:44:47,728 --> 02:44:52,198
of the two and that's usually good good

3527
02:44:49,828 --> 02:44:53,760
way to do it and then smoke all those

3528
02:44:52,199 --> 02:44:55,680
get them tested do what you can have the

3529
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:57,658
crew smoke them make shatter out of them

3530
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:59,729
make live resin out of them see what

3531
02:44:57,658 --> 02:45:01,469
happens to all that stuff to him a long

3532
02:44:59,728 --> 02:45:02,788
time cure him a long time that's

3533
02:45:01,469 --> 02:45:04,318
something I failed at when I was a new

3534
02:45:02,789 --> 02:45:05,579
grower I would take that stuff and as

3535
02:45:04,318 --> 02:45:07,978
soon as it was dry enough to start

3536
02:45:05,578 --> 02:45:09,930
smoking it start smoking it up see which

3537
02:45:07,978 --> 02:45:12,179
was my favorite I'm sure I got rid of a

3538
02:45:09,930 --> 02:45:15,748
few keepers I just didn't even know yeah

3539
02:45:12,180 --> 02:45:17,488
man yeah yeah so I guess that leads us

3540
02:45:15,748 --> 02:45:19,109
into seeds a little bit when you buy a

3541
02:45:17,488 --> 02:45:21,299
ten pack of seeds I really like that

3542
02:45:19,109 --> 02:45:23,879
variation so you buy a ten pack you pop

3543
02:45:21,299 --> 02:45:31,918
them sometimes there's [ __ ] seven

3544
02:45:23,879 --> 02:45:34,590
males numbers game like bingo it is like

3545
02:45:31,918 --> 02:45:36,658
bingo so hopefully you get that one good

3546
02:45:34,590 --> 02:45:38,219
one so hopefully get some five five

3547
02:45:36,658 --> 02:45:39,868
males five females is usually what I

3548
02:45:38,219 --> 02:45:42,269
hope for somewhere in that area

3549
02:45:39,869 --> 02:45:43,709
oh you hope to get one that you can spot

3550
02:45:42,270 --> 02:45:45,119
right away that you're like and we got

3551
02:45:43,709 --> 02:45:46,619
to call that [ __ ] and you got those

3552
02:45:45,119 --> 02:45:48,390
four to work with and like Spence said

3553
02:45:46,619 --> 02:45:50,340
you get three so that's where you find

3554
02:45:48,389 --> 02:45:52,738
new stuff that's one of the pros of

3555
02:45:50,340 --> 02:45:54,449
growing from seed you find all that new

3556
02:45:52,738 --> 02:45:56,248
stuff and there's something I thought

3557
02:45:54,449 --> 02:45:58,800
about earlier everything we're growing

3558
02:45:56,248 --> 02:46:01,408
came from seed in the first adventure

3559
02:45:58,799 --> 02:46:03,448
nothing down the road the way it's

3560
02:46:01,408 --> 02:46:05,189
supposed to be yeah yeah we couldn't

3561
02:46:03,449 --> 02:46:08,220
have a plan without the seed we've

3562
02:46:05,189 --> 02:46:10,439
nobody took a clone of OG Kush yeah

3563
02:46:08,219 --> 02:46:12,289
everyone you know keeps growing from

3564
02:46:10,439 --> 02:46:15,870
Cologne

3565
02:46:12,290 --> 02:46:19,620
there are very bad consequences to that

3566
02:46:15,870 --> 02:46:22,979
so what could happen big major companies

3567
02:46:19,620 --> 02:46:27,210
could maintain control of it have the

3568
02:46:22,978 --> 02:46:30,420
seed stock similar to some ornamental

3569
02:46:27,209 --> 02:46:32,488
flowers that I can't quote species of or

3570
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:34,350
anything like that but ok I know it's

3571
02:46:32,488 --> 02:46:36,299
really hard to find like genuine seed of

3572
02:46:34,350 --> 02:46:37,979
sunflowers yeah and a lot of the

3573
02:46:36,299 --> 02:46:41,879
vegetables you can only find specific

3574
02:46:37,978 --> 02:46:43,438
seeds ok damn see so we it there you go

3575
02:46:41,879 --> 02:46:45,329
more beneficial to grow from seed or a

3576
02:46:43,439 --> 02:46:48,979
benefit of growing from seed or they'll

3577
02:46:45,329 --> 02:46:48,978
just start so and only for thy seed

3578
02:46:49,279 --> 02:46:53,790
that's something is a breeder I try to

3579
02:46:51,898 --> 02:46:54,898
pay attention to I try to make and you

3580
02:46:53,790 --> 02:46:56,640
guys have probably noticed I've been

3581
02:46:54,898 --> 02:46:59,010
pulling out a lot more reg seeds lately

3582
02:46:56,639 --> 02:47:00,358
yeah we got to have reg seeds because it

3583
02:46:59,010 --> 02:47:02,389
you got to have the males to keep the

3584
02:47:00,359 --> 02:47:04,979
breeding alive or it's gonna get stale

3585
02:47:02,389 --> 02:47:06,478
f1 hybrids are where it's at hey guys if

3586
02:47:04,978 --> 02:47:07,769
you're breeding please throw away the

3587
02:47:06,478 --> 02:47:09,299
[ __ ] there's gonna be some stuff

3588
02:47:07,770 --> 02:47:10,950
that comes out of your breeding projects

3589
02:47:09,299 --> 02:47:12,420
that is not worth three breeding or

3590
02:47:10,950 --> 02:47:14,010
giving out those seeds just toss those

3591
02:47:12,420 --> 02:47:15,870
cuz you're polluting the gene pool

3592
02:47:14,010 --> 02:47:17,250
you're making it weak you're making a

3593
02:47:15,870 --> 02:47:19,170
bunch of runts and mutants and you're

3594
02:47:17,250 --> 02:47:21,420
[ __ ] it up just get rid all that Nani

3595
02:47:19,170 --> 02:47:23,100
wheat star non-elite stuff yeah all the

3596
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:24,870
poser stuff and just kill it just kill

3597
02:47:23,100 --> 02:47:26,488
it we can breed more seems more common I

3598
02:47:24,870 --> 02:47:29,430
definitely give props to the people who

3599
02:47:26,488 --> 02:47:31,680
actually try their own seeds like if you

3600
02:47:29,430 --> 02:47:35,550
if you produce some seeds actually grow

3601
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:38,488
it or you give it to people for cetera

3602
02:47:35,549 --> 02:47:40,079
give a bunch of it away all so that

3603
02:47:38,488 --> 02:47:41,789
other people can so you can see what

3604
02:47:40,079 --> 02:47:48,959
Nancy bud well shout out to Nancy bud

3605
02:47:41,790 --> 02:47:52,410
well under LEDs I'm not even a big fan

3606
02:47:48,959 --> 02:47:54,659
of LEDs and she is killing it yeah yeah

3607
02:47:52,409 --> 02:47:56,010
yeah I'm actually like that you say that

3608
02:47:54,659 --> 02:47:57,270
you keep saying good [ __ ] to make more

3609
02:47:56,010 --> 02:47:59,189
good [ __ ] to talk about I'm growing the

3610
02:47:57,270 --> 02:48:01,109
night nurse right now looks stellar

3611
02:47:59,189 --> 02:48:04,550
there's one that looks really grateful

3612
02:48:01,109 --> 02:48:07,649
dog dominant but smells like Tora Bora

3613
02:48:04,549 --> 02:48:10,108
right I hope so I hope so I need some

3614
02:48:07,648 --> 02:48:11,398
good CBD medicine so to cloud the seeds

3615
02:48:10,109 --> 02:48:13,850
to get new stuff like we're talking

3616
02:48:11,398 --> 02:48:16,469
about you get to do that phenotype line

3617
02:48:13,850 --> 02:48:18,059
that's uh that's essentially when you

3618
02:48:16,469 --> 02:48:20,219
pop a pack of seeds they call it mapping

3619
02:48:18,059 --> 02:48:21,389
or searching or hunting sub cool calls

3620
02:48:20,219 --> 02:48:21,988
up something different I forgot what

3621
02:48:21,389 --> 02:48:23,458
even

3622
02:48:21,988 --> 02:48:25,679
but it's a phyno hunt in this group is

3623
02:48:23,459 --> 02:48:27,270
what we call it you run as many seeds as

3624
02:48:25,679 --> 02:48:29,520
you can get up one strain if you can do

3625
02:48:27,270 --> 02:48:32,069
20 of them do 20 that's awesome 25 of

3626
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:33,959
something is cool if you've only got a

3627
02:48:32,068 --> 02:48:35,668
10 or a 6-pack or a 5 pack that works

3628
02:48:33,959 --> 02:48:37,679
too just work on your scale but the more

3629
02:48:35,668 --> 02:48:39,449
the better because that gives you you

3630
02:48:37,679 --> 02:48:40,918
can see what that strains potential is

3631
02:48:39,449 --> 02:48:42,959
and you know what you're looking for a

3632
02:48:40,918 --> 02:48:45,059
little better and you can get that one

3633
02:48:42,959 --> 02:48:47,069
like I know what I want out of a

3634
02:48:45,059 --> 02:48:48,628
grateful dog pack of beans you may want

3635
02:48:47,068 --> 02:48:51,628
something totally different out of a

3636
02:48:48,629 --> 02:48:53,310
pack of dog beans and we'll find it by

3637
02:48:51,629 --> 02:48:55,350
doing that phyno huh and that's fun to

3638
02:48:53,309 --> 02:48:56,639
me run it down seeing the variations and

3639
02:48:55,350 --> 02:48:58,949
as a breeder I love seeing the

3640
02:48:56,639 --> 02:49:02,639
variations from my creations that's a

3641
02:48:58,949 --> 02:49:05,219
lot of fun if we're growing clones we're

3642
02:49:02,639 --> 02:49:06,809
all grown the same [ __ ] there's a blue

3643
02:49:05,218 --> 02:49:08,218
dream cut going around this town right

3644
02:49:06,809 --> 02:49:09,929
now going around Colorado I don't think

3645
02:49:08,218 --> 02:49:12,418
it's just this town I think it is just

3646
02:49:09,929 --> 02:49:14,039
Colorado in general that like every time

3647
02:49:12,418 --> 02:49:16,939
I see somebody post a picture of blue

3648
02:49:14,039 --> 02:49:16,939
dreams like dear God

3649
02:49:17,090 --> 02:49:20,168
[Music]

3650
02:49:22,248 --> 02:49:29,639
conditions and she'll give you some

3651
02:49:25,139 --> 02:49:31,439
product I can pull 6 ounces out of a 7

3652
02:49:29,639 --> 02:49:42,179
gallon pot with four of them perlite so

3653
02:49:31,439 --> 02:49:52,259
that's a pound and a half of herb come

3654
02:49:42,179 --> 02:49:53,429
get your stuff it's just terrible no we

3655
02:49:52,259 --> 02:49:56,009
love the Andes Blue Dream I didn't mean

3656
02:49:53,429 --> 02:49:57,779
call terrible how about the the cons of

3657
02:49:56,009 --> 02:49:59,549
growing from seed some people are not

3658
02:49:57,779 --> 02:50:03,689
good at spotting males that's the main

3659
02:49:59,549 --> 02:50:06,959
problem yeah I would I mean if you're a

3660
02:50:03,689 --> 02:50:08,279
beginner grower you know sometimes you

3661
02:50:06,959 --> 02:50:09,929
don't even know like I know people that

3662
02:50:08,279 --> 02:50:11,668
have seen male plants and like is there

3663
02:50:09,929 --> 02:50:13,889
ever gonna be flowers from there and

3664
02:50:11,668 --> 02:50:16,949
it's like no these are two completely

3665
02:50:13,889 --> 02:50:18,028
different things and I just think it's

3666
02:50:16,949 --> 02:50:19,649
about paying attention if you pay

3667
02:50:18,029 --> 02:50:22,709
attention there's there's you've gotta

3668
02:50:19,648 --> 02:50:24,148
see ya read a book the book yet every

3669
02:50:22,709 --> 02:50:26,100
grow book has a picture of a male and a

3670
02:50:24,148 --> 02:50:27,658
female right next to each other yep yep

3671
02:50:26,100 --> 02:50:29,189
so yeah spot your males what about

3672
02:50:27,658 --> 02:50:32,829

3681
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:57,909
what's up guys I miss you haven't seen

3682
02:50:56,709 --> 02:51:00,729
you guys a long time you don't listen to

3683
02:50:57,909 --> 02:51:03,729
the show but still thinking about you

3684
02:51:00,729 --> 02:51:05,409
selection time when you're drawn from

3685
02:51:03,729 --> 02:51:06,699
seeds there is always that Fino hunt

3686
02:51:05,409 --> 02:51:08,139
when you're going from clones at first

3687
02:51:06,700 --> 02:51:09,579
crop you're gonna grow that's blue dream

3688
02:51:08,139 --> 02:51:11,260
you're cool you got all the blue dream

3689
02:51:09,579 --> 02:51:13,450
you could handle when you're running

3690
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:15,069
from seed you got to run a crop to find

3691
02:51:13,450 --> 02:51:18,040
what you're even messing with and then

3692
02:51:15,069 --> 02:51:19,779
run a crop to keep again of the ones you

3693
02:51:18,040 --> 02:51:22,210
like right and then if you need to

3694
02:51:19,780 --> 02:51:24,850
eliminate more then you're gonna run

3695
02:51:22,209 --> 02:51:27,429
again and again and narrow it down yep

3696
02:51:24,850 --> 02:51:28,989
so uh and now hopefully you take clones

3697
02:51:27,430 --> 02:51:30,970
like I said on another episode take

3698
02:51:28,989 --> 02:51:33,869
clones of everything you ever grow

3699
02:51:30,969 --> 02:51:35,979
before it's in flower right before you

3700
02:51:33,870 --> 02:51:37,360
put it in flower take some clones that

3701
02:51:35,979 --> 02:51:39,310
way you know those clones are gonna root

3702
02:51:37,360 --> 02:51:42,010
and if you don't have clones you can try

3703
02:51:39,310 --> 02:51:43,180
again like give yourself a chance plan

3704
02:51:42,010 --> 02:51:45,700
ahead plan ahead when you're growing

3705
02:51:43,180 --> 02:51:47,979
it's always it's always beneficial give

3706
02:51:45,700 --> 02:51:49,390
yourself the advantage yes

3707
02:51:47,979 --> 02:51:50,739
yeah the advantage the heads up for

3708
02:51:49,389 --> 02:51:51,939
yourself is I don't put yourself behind

3709
02:51:50,739 --> 02:51:53,739
because once you're behind and growing

3710
02:51:51,940 --> 02:51:55,180
you're behind and growing and that

3711
02:51:53,739 --> 02:51:58,949
probably means your plants are stressed

3712
02:51:55,180 --> 02:51:58,950
out yeah if you're stressed they are

3713
02:51:59,219 --> 02:52:05,489
[Music]

3714
02:52:01,700 --> 02:52:07,710
so the concept seeds if you need

3715
02:52:05,489 --> 02:52:08,850
you gotta learn each phenotype like when

3716
02:52:07,709 --> 02:52:10,529
you find those phenotypes you gotta

3717
02:52:08,850 --> 02:52:12,060
learn them you gotta learn it's like

3718
02:52:10,530 --> 02:52:13,561
having three different girlfriends if

3719
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:15,239
you found three keepers one's gonna like

3720
02:52:13,560 --> 02:52:17,310
a lot of nitrogen one's gonna get mad at

3721
02:52:15,239 --> 02:52:19,680
too much nitrogen one's gonna be really

3722
02:52:17,310 --> 02:52:21,239
picky one's gonna be really easy it's

3723
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:22,950
gonna butt out one's gonna taste real

3724
02:52:21,239 --> 02:52:24,989
good you can all have to learn each

3725
02:52:22,950 --> 02:52:27,120
phenotype one may go a little longer one

3726
02:52:24,989 --> 02:52:29,250
may come down a little sooner one may

3727
02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:30,570
need to be topped one may climb up into

3728
02:52:29,250 --> 02:52:32,850
the [ __ ] lights real high you're

3729
02:52:30,569 --> 02:52:34,649
gonna learn all that stuff the con of

3730
02:52:32,850 --> 02:52:37,440
course that comes with that is wasted

3731
02:52:34,649 --> 02:52:40,440
space so if you're a cash crop er the

3732
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:44,220
seeds that kind of messes you up but

3733
02:52:40,440 --> 02:52:51,930
what about fem seeds I've seen it I mean

3734
02:52:44,219 --> 02:52:53,909
I've grown thin they take away the worry

3735
02:52:51,930 --> 02:52:55,350
about having a male there are still

3736
02:52:53,909 --> 02:52:57,239
chances where you get some funky stuff

3737
02:52:55,350 --> 02:52:59,010
but you just gotta still pay attention

3738
02:52:57,239 --> 02:53:01,170
I've made some funky stuff you've grown

3739
02:52:59,010 --> 02:53:02,399
some funky stuff for me that uh I'm not

3740
02:53:01,170 --> 02:53:06,420
even gonna say the strain to discourage

3741
02:53:02,399 --> 02:53:07,709
anybody but because I'm seeing excellent

3742
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:10,560
types coming out I've got some

3743
02:53:07,709 --> 02:53:12,869
downstairs it looks normally spin screw

3744
02:53:10,560 --> 02:53:15,389
one that shot out it was shot at a stick

3745
02:53:12,870 --> 02:53:17,579
with a gigantic leaf the size of bigger

3746
02:53:15,389 --> 02:53:20,879
than my hand and then another stick and

3747
02:53:17,579 --> 02:53:23,940
then like normal size leaves because I

3748
02:53:20,879 --> 02:53:27,859
just looked away as like seeing a car

3749
02:53:23,940 --> 02:53:31,710
wreck do you look for a minute reattach

3750
02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:33,300
amputee arm but it was cool I like

3751
02:53:31,709 --> 02:53:35,399
sometimes I like things like that you

3752
02:53:33,299 --> 02:53:36,689
know if it's gonna be a female I'm the

3753
02:53:35,399 --> 02:53:38,729
type of girl where I'll give it a chance

3754
02:53:36,690 --> 02:53:40,140
if it doesn't if it doesn't work it

3755
02:53:38,729 --> 02:53:41,789
doesn't work yeah there's always more

3756
02:53:40,139 --> 02:53:43,049
seeds to plant there are always more

3757
02:53:41,790 --> 02:53:44,670
seeds yeah don't be afraid to call

3758
02:53:43,049 --> 02:53:46,109
something and like if you guys have

3759
02:53:44,670 --> 02:53:48,030
something that is a level eight

3760
02:53:46,110 --> 02:53:53,150
let's work fun getting you guys a level

3761
02:53:48,030 --> 02:53:53,150
10 oh yeah get you some good seeds

3762
02:53:57,389 --> 02:54:00,618
I know seeds are expensive and we just

3763
02:53:59,068 --> 02:54:02,760
talked like he could just pop more but

3764
02:54:00,619 --> 02:54:04,289
it's well worth it and if you're growing

3765
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:05,639
herb you should be doing all right you

3766
02:54:04,289 --> 02:54:06,959
should at least be able to afford a pack

3767
02:54:05,639 --> 02:54:09,510
of seeds after the harvest

3768
02:54:06,959 --> 02:54:12,300
so I mentioned fem seeds fem seeds just

3769

yeah we're spoiled here in Colorado if

3798
02:55:37,959 --> 02:55:43,449
we're in Texas this table would equal

3799
02:55:40,120 --> 02:55:44,200
life in prison and you're black so if n

3800
02:55:43,450 --> 02:55:46,890
stays

3801

hey you won't catch me there

3802
02:55:46,889 --> 02:55:51,059
[Music]

3803
02:55:52,078 --> 02:55:58,828
the best thing about Texas is seeing the

3804
02:55:54,658 --> 02:56:00,270
state line in your rear-view I won't I

3805
02:55:58,828 --> 02:56:01,859
don't have a reason to go to Texas or a

3806
02:56:00,270 --> 02:56:03,689
reason to hate on Texas really but I

3807
02:56:01,859 --> 02:56:05,850
don't have a gun some food and people

3808
02:56:03,689 --> 02:56:06,898
down there know how to party you know

3809

3810
02:56:06,898 --> 02:56:11,788
from Texas and they're actually all good

3811
02:56:08,129 --> 02:56:14,509
people so they die out we'll tap on the

3812
02:56:11,789 --> 02:56:14,510
thing they'll work again

3813
02:56:16,489 --> 02:56:22,298
[Music]

3814
02:56:26,899 --> 02:56:32,939
headphones working bro cool yeah if you

3815
02:56:31,290 --> 02:56:35,070
guys are buying gear for the podcast

3816
02:56:32,939 --> 02:56:38,610
never buy a livewire Solutions headphone

3817
02:56:35,069 --> 02:56:40,590
for channel headphone amplifiers this is

3818
02:56:38,610 --> 02:56:41,700
the third one I've gotten dude and I

3819
02:56:40,590 --> 02:56:42,719
know you're like why'd you get a third

3820
02:56:41,700 --> 02:56:43,860
one because if you go to Guitar Center

3821
02:56:42,719 --> 02:56:46,500
with it you yell at them they keep just

3822
02:56:43,860 --> 02:57:04,140
giving you a fresh one so steep you're

3823
02:56:46,500 --> 02:57:05,909
using it your phone is probably the only

3824
02:57:04,139 --> 02:57:10,500
thing without how-to hash on it up until

3825
02:57:05,909 --> 02:57:11,579
now pretty much my life everything is

3826
02:57:10,500 --> 02:57:15,379
all sticky I wanted to call the

3827
02:57:11,579 --> 02:57:15,379
recording studio the sticky knob studios

3828
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:24,270
that part of the show was brought to you

3829
02:57:22,770 --> 02:57:27,149
by oil slick tools to help you

3830
02:57:24,270 --> 02:57:29,430
concentrate I just set my stuff down on

3831
02:57:27,149 --> 02:57:30,719
this fancy oil slick pad here I'm not

3832
02:57:29,430 --> 02:57:32,639
gonna get any sticky rings on my table

3833
02:57:30,719 --> 02:57:35,129
that's awesome it's a really nice oil

3834
02:57:32,639 --> 02:57:36,779
slick better yeah don't you don't you

3835
02:57:35,129 --> 02:57:43,529

3837
02:57:43,530 --> 02:57:46,920
lifting and moving so all the

3838
02:57:44,790 --> 02:57:51,270
organization and stuff give shoutouts to

3839
02:57:46,920 --> 02:57:53,010
Jesse working in the [ __ ] it's August

3840
02:57:51,270 --> 02:57:55,530
9th I want to give a quick shout out to

3841
02:57:53,010 --> 02:57:57,210
Jerry Garcia oh yeah much love much

3842
02:57:55,530 --> 02:57:59,159
respect Jerry Garcia Jerry changed my

3843
02:57:57,209 --> 02:58:01,199
life dude I never got to see Jerry live

3844
02:57:59,159 --> 02:58:02,309
but the music of the Grateful Dead and

3845
02:58:01,200 --> 02:58:05,010
the culture of the Grateful Dead are

3846
02:58:02,309 --> 02:58:06,750
definitely in my heart that is big part

3847
02:58:05,010 --> 02:58:09,300
of my world so we'll get back to the

3848
02:58:06,750 --> 02:58:12,629
point here podcast time feminised seeds

3849
02:58:09,299 --> 02:58:14,909
always females most of the time I'll say

3850
02:58:12,629 --> 02:58:17,009
99% of the time females Jesse told us a

3851
02:58:14,909 --> 02:58:19,079
story before about a dispensary owner

3852
02:58:17,010 --> 02:58:21,270
running 200 and something feminized

3853
02:58:19,079 --> 02:58:23,579
seeds and having four males yeah perfect

3854
02:58:21,270 --> 02:58:30,540
math [ __ ] up everything yep yeah did

3855
02:58:23,579 --> 02:58:32,209
you get a bunch of seeds you bring go

3856
02:58:30,540 --> 02:58:34,561
blank

3857
02:58:32,209 --> 02:58:40,709
your house in your [ __ ] balance

3858
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:45,569
clicks you just went we do you get a

3859
02:58:40,709 --> 02:58:50,609
bunch of seats from that run man and

3860
02:58:45,569 --> 02:58:52,649
then they tried to sell them to you no I

3861
02:58:50,610 --> 02:58:54,091
do and the problem with FEM seeds me

3862
02:58:52,649 --> 02:58:55,709
being a feminized seed maker I know this

3863
02:58:54,091 --> 02:58:58,290
is the big problem you don't know you've

3864
02:58:55,709 --> 02:59:00,720
got a problem until like week 7 or week

3865
02:58:58,290 --> 02:59:02,881
8 when you've already invested a lot of

3866
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:05,011
time into that plant so if you're

3867
02:59:02,880 --> 02:59:06,630
running fin seeds my advice and this is

3868
02:59:05,011 --> 02:59:08,250
what I do I flower them little I run

3869
02:59:06,630 --> 02:59:09,959
them in a 3 gallon pot I bedroom for

3870
02:59:08,250 --> 02:59:10,890
very minimal time until I can take 3

3871
02:59:09,959 --> 02:59:12,090
cuts off of them

3872
02:59:10,890 --> 02:59:13,859
and once they're all big enough for

3873
02:59:12,091 --> 02:59:15,931
three cuts I flower about the first time

3874
02:59:13,860 --> 02:59:17,670
to find out what I've got and then you

3875
02:59:15,931 --> 02:59:18,480
can find out if you've got trouble or if

3876
02:59:17,670 --> 02:59:20,521
you've got gold

3877
02:59:18,479 --> 02:59:23,130
so go early with the fins if you can

3878
02:59:20,521 --> 02:59:27,420
just to find out I would do that with

3879
02:59:23,130 --> 02:59:29,340
any plant I've had some some fire seeds

3880
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:31,170
from Tim that's an odd noise you don't

3881
02:59:29,341 --> 02:59:34,140
hear that that could be Spencer's phone

3882
02:59:31,170 --> 02:59:36,271
somebody was growing hops that [ __ ] was

3883
02:59:34,140 --> 02:59:38,819
tight on your phone yeah growing hops

3884
02:59:36,271 --> 02:59:40,290
yeah it looked like weed there it's

3885
02:59:38,819 --> 02:59:45,690
related to wheat that's like the cousin

3886
02:59:40,290 --> 02:59:49,410
just like fine you clamp that's my [ __ ]

3887
02:59:45,690 --> 02:59:52,950
hops I could say that Smith said I could

3888
02:59:49,409 --> 03:00:09,810
say that I can't believe way to send

3889
02:59:52,950 --> 03:00:11,521
them on the podcast though working well

3890
03:00:09,810 --> 03:00:15,209
I can kind of hear now I can really hear

3891
03:00:11,521 --> 03:00:17,040
I have a beer making friend and we had a

3892
03:00:15,209 --> 03:00:20,159
serious conversation last night about

3893
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:22,261
making marijuana zero I was I don't

3894
03:00:20,159 --> 03:00:24,890
drink but I would try one of those yeah

3895
03:00:22,261 --> 03:00:28,440
just to see I drink a marijuana beer one

3896
03:00:24,890 --> 03:00:30,390
Spence and I might split it yeah I get I

3897
03:00:28,440 --> 03:00:32,551
get a little turn off one beer we were

3898
03:00:30,390 --> 03:00:33,440
talking about like a really small recipe

3899
03:00:32,550 --> 03:00:35,750
so

3900
03:00:33,440 --> 03:00:37,550
and then you could ferment that beer in

3901
03:00:35,750 --> 03:00:40,040
your grow room and use your weed beer

3902
03:00:37,549 --> 03:00:41,329
co2 to enhance your ganja plants there

3903
03:00:40,040 --> 03:00:48,490
yeah would that be a little sacrilegious

3904
03:00:41,329 --> 03:00:48,489
cannibalistic almost fermenting brothers

3905
03:00:49,149 --> 03:00:55,549
all right shout out to beer I miss you

3906
03:00:54,200 --> 03:00:57,260
beer I haven't had a beer in a long long

3907
03:00:55,549 --> 03:00:58,429
time I'm better off without it you know

3908
03:00:57,260 --> 03:01:01,190
I haven't had a beer since I got my very

3909
03:00:58,430 --> 03:01:02,930
first medical marijuana card I was like

3910
03:01:01,190 --> 03:01:06,319
you know I need to drink I got the car

3911
03:01:02,930 --> 03:01:08,149
let's smoke all the herb I want nice

3912
03:01:06,319 --> 03:01:10,219
trade off with myself my dad kind of

3913
03:01:08,149 --> 03:01:11,719
sorted it's the same thing he still

3914
03:01:10,219 --> 03:01:13,459
drinks occasionally shout out to mr.

3915
03:01:11,719 --> 03:01:14,569
Wynn if you're gonna listen in to the

3916
03:01:13,459 --> 03:01:20,359
show man what's up bro

3917
03:01:14,569 --> 03:01:22,789
it's me he's cool ass dude cool ass dude

3918
03:01:20,360 --> 03:01:25,579
so we're kind of rant about FEM seeds a

3919
03:01:22,790 --> 03:01:26,450
little bit FEM seeds I've noticed and

3920
03:01:25,579 --> 03:01:28,459
you might you guys I don't know if

3921
03:01:26,450 --> 03:01:30,470
you've paid enough attention because I'm

3922
03:01:28,459 --> 03:01:32,959
looking more on the breeder FEM C's are

3923
03:01:30,469 --> 03:01:35,029
always a closer representation of the

3924
03:01:32,959 --> 03:01:36,949
parents I have found you don't get as

3925
03:01:35,030 --> 03:01:39,470
much like when we run gages F wands

3926
03:01:36,950 --> 03:01:42,380
there's not there's not as much

3927
03:01:39,469 --> 03:01:43,969
variation right FEM seeds are more

3928
03:01:42,379 --> 03:01:45,799
uniform they're closer they look a lot

3929
03:01:43,969 --> 03:01:47,600
alike when we run gages F ones we never

3930
03:01:45,799 --> 03:01:50,270
know what we're gonna get a ten-pack

3931
03:01:47,601 --> 03:01:52,130
varies so much unless it was a spur era

3932
03:01:50,271 --> 03:01:55,370
those were awesome do you suppose that's

3933
03:01:52,129 --> 03:01:57,549
because they are supposedly missing the

3934
03:01:55,370 --> 03:02:01,010
male chromosomes that and you're not

3935
03:01:57,549 --> 03:02:02,810
introducing it feels like when you're

3936
03:02:01,010 --> 03:02:04,190
bringing out the F ones I feel like

3937
03:02:02,810 --> 03:02:06,229
you're getting a lot of recessive traits

3938
03:02:04,190 --> 03:02:08,149
and you're just not bringing it could be

3939
03:02:06,229 --> 03:02:09,859
because of the male chromosomes are

3940
03:02:08,149 --> 03:02:11,659
missing but it feels like you're not

3941
03:02:09,860 --> 03:02:12,891
going back as far in the lineage they

3942
03:02:11,659 --> 03:02:15,200
forgot who their grandparents were

3943
03:02:12,890 --> 03:02:17,209
somehow just by selfing them it's what

3944
03:02:15,200 --> 03:02:20,750
it feels like and I'm also doing a lot

3945
03:02:17,209 --> 03:02:23,029
of selfing of one plant and using it to

3946
03:02:20,750 --> 03:02:24,860
pollinate the same strain so those are

3947
03:02:23,030 --> 03:02:27,739
starting to come out I've done that I'm

3948
03:02:24,860 --> 03:02:29,720
on the it would its inbred but it's kind

3949
03:02:27,739 --> 03:02:32,569
of an f3 is what level I'm at and

3950
03:02:29,719 --> 03:02:34,819
there's a mess it read yeah The Grateful

3951
03:02:32,569 --> 03:02:36,920
dog has three of they are almost all

3952
03:02:34,819 --> 03:02:38,840
looking the same by now oh nice yeah I

3953
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:40,670
have no idea

3954
03:02:38,840 --> 03:02:42,739
well thank you thank you that's a dang

3955
03:02:40,670 --> 03:02:44,620
strain by the way yes that's the one

3956
03:02:42,739 --> 03:02:46,270
that put me on the map honestly shut up

3957
03:02:44,620 --> 03:02:48,370
the callee connection and swerve because

3958
03:02:46,270 --> 03:02:48,790
just shout-out to those guys they did me

3959
03:02:48,370 --> 03:02:51,700
a favor

3960
03:02:48,790 --> 03:02:54,210
so shoutout yeah I was gonna actually

3961
03:02:51,700 --> 03:02:56,859
bring up in this conversation that uh

3962
03:02:54,209 --> 03:02:59,349
there's so many s ones and F ones out

3963
03:02:56,859 --> 03:03:02,140
there and you know we were talking about

3964
03:02:59,350 --> 03:03:04,120
say protecting the lineage and

3965
03:03:02,139 --> 03:03:09,148
everything and you can't really do that

3966
03:03:04,120 --> 03:03:12,460
with F once s ones so yeah you got f3 f3

3967
03:03:09,148 --> 03:03:14,228
you know DJ short says f2 is crucial

3968
03:03:12,459 --> 03:03:15,188
really that's where a lot of stuff is

3969
03:03:14,228 --> 03:03:18,459
really where you got to pay attention

3970
03:03:15,189 --> 03:03:20,290
cuz I've [ __ ] up the f 2s I've been

3971
03:03:18,459 --> 03:03:23,858
like oh no I used the ride chose the

3972
03:03:20,290 --> 03:03:26,020
wrong the wrong f1 to know it to that

3973
03:03:23,859 --> 03:03:27,609
and it was like no that's not I got to

3974
03:03:26,020 --> 03:03:28,930
go find a different male out of this mix

3975
03:03:27,609 --> 03:03:30,939
because this is now or a different

3976
03:03:28,930 --> 03:03:33,250
female and try this again for sure you

3977
03:03:30,939 --> 03:03:35,109
just have to go back you have to keep

3978
03:03:33,250 --> 03:03:39,069
seeds of each one and label them what

3979
03:03:35,109 --> 03:03:40,870
they were like this is the say golden go

3980
03:03:39,069 --> 03:03:42,789
times day breaker this is the first run

3981
03:03:40,870 --> 03:03:43,930
and make sure that those are legit and

3982
03:03:42,790 --> 03:03:45,460
then find it good I want to find a

3983
03:03:43,930 --> 03:03:46,689
golden goat dominant one out of there

3984
03:03:45,459 --> 03:03:50,019
and hit it again with the day breaker

3985
03:03:46,689 --> 03:03:52,300
male and I'm hoping to make it look a

3986
03:03:50,020 --> 03:03:55,180
lot like day breaker it's smell like

3987
03:03:52,299 --> 03:03:57,909
gold and go have the goats the go bigger

3988
03:03:55,180 --> 03:03:59,648
but if it doesn't I could just have to

3989
03:03:57,909 --> 03:04:01,869
back up again and go find another female

3990
03:03:59,648 --> 03:04:03,430
to use and just keep yeah eventually

3991
03:04:01,870 --> 03:04:06,790
I'll ditch a project if I have to go

3992
03:04:03,430 --> 03:04:08,050
back too many times twice second time

3993
03:04:06,790 --> 03:04:09,910
I'm like yeah that obviously doesn't

3994
03:04:08,049 --> 03:04:10,989
want to do what I want it to do out of

3995
03:04:09,909 --> 03:04:13,030
so many seeds you should get what you

3996
03:04:10,989 --> 03:04:16,000
want the first or second first or second

3997
03:04:13,030 --> 03:04:19,420
try oh yeah the Depot dug straight ahead

3998
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:21,250
or have I had to do it three times

3999
03:04:19,420 --> 03:04:23,228
before I was too happy with it the first

4000
03:04:21,250 --> 03:04:26,260
time there you go they continued from

4001
03:04:23,228 --> 03:04:28,719
there yeah dudes light leaks and stuff

4002
03:04:26,260 --> 03:04:29,800
like that no man yeah and something in

4003
03:04:28,719 --> 03:04:32,108
me says if it doesn't work the first

4004
03:04:29,799 --> 03:04:34,119
time or the second time I'm probably not

4005
03:04:32,109 --> 03:04:35,819
gonna get what I want I keep cutting oh

4006
03:04:34,120 --> 03:04:38,140
geez II got a little too much sorry

4007
03:04:35,819 --> 03:04:39,850
here's a random this is kind of off

4008
03:04:38,139 --> 03:04:41,769
topic but on topic how do you guys feel

4009
03:04:39,850 --> 03:04:43,840
have you seen where Arion goes to places

4010
03:04:41,770 --> 03:04:45,670
are in from greenhouse seeds they travel

4011
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:47,500
to places and get land race genetics

4012
03:04:45,670 --> 03:04:49,190
from I'll say Jamaica and they went to

4013
03:04:47,500 --> 03:04:51,200
like

4014
03:04:49,190 --> 03:04:52,521
they went to somewhere in India Nepal or

4015
03:04:51,200 --> 03:04:54,200
somewhere like that I don't pay enough

4016
03:04:52,521 --> 03:04:56,061
attention I just have to watch things

4017
03:04:54,200 --> 03:04:57,290
quickly while I'm trimmin so they go

4018
03:04:56,060 --> 03:05:01,159
these places and they get their land

4019
03:04:57,290 --> 03:05:04,011
raise seeds and so now our Ian's got all

4020
03:05:01,159 --> 03:05:06,709
land races from everywhere but in

4021
03:05:04,011 --> 03:05:12,051
exchange he leaves them a handful of

4022
03:05:06,709 --> 03:05:13,669
wrecks eat fancy pens and rags but he

4023
03:05:12,050 --> 03:05:15,739
gives them handfuls of seeds to grow and

4024
03:05:13,670 --> 03:05:22,909
he tells them what they are but now

4025
03:05:15,739 --> 03:05:24,860
those land races are gone and he just

4026
03:05:22,909 --> 03:05:26,780
made off with the last but the last of

4027
03:05:24,860 --> 03:05:29,870
the land raised seeds introducing

4028
03:05:26,780 --> 03:05:32,570
hybrids and modern and developed world

4029
03:05:29,870 --> 03:05:37,280
genetics into fragile places that have

4030
03:05:32,569 --> 03:05:41,779
land race genetics like that is a that's

4031
03:05:37,280 --> 03:05:45,681
kind of a douchebag thing to do it's the

4032
03:05:41,780 --> 03:05:48,739
same thing is releasing [ __ ] animals

4033
03:05:45,681 --> 03:05:49,881
that are not from that area insects that

4034
03:05:48,739 --> 03:05:51,199
are not from that or they're gonna wreak

4035
03:05:49,880 --> 03:05:53,390
havoc on [ __ ] and destroy the ecosystem

4036
03:05:51,200 --> 03:05:55,370
that's already there just the balance

4037
03:05:53,390 --> 03:05:57,770
they're asking all the farmers to grow

4038
03:05:55,370 --> 03:06:00,101
some GMO corn yeah that's he's kind of

4039
03:05:57,771 --> 03:06:02,091
doing the same thing to them yeah yeah

4040
03:06:00,101 --> 03:06:03,409
you guys think about that when you're uh

4041
03:06:02,091 --> 03:06:04,521
when you're doing what you're doing

4042
03:06:03,409 --> 03:06:05,899
we've gotta think about the effects that

4043
03:06:04,521 --> 03:06:08,301
you're having like the ripples that you

4044
03:06:05,899 --> 03:06:10,789
make in your life cuz little stuff makes

4045
03:06:08,300 --> 03:06:12,770
big big ripples what's that uh saying

4046
03:06:10,790 --> 03:06:17,591
about a butterfly in the rainforest

4047
03:06:12,771 --> 03:06:17,591
denim on to somewhere else yeah yeah if

4048
03:06:17,979 --> 03:06:28,100
there's a tidal wave in China somewhere

4049
03:06:20,181 --> 03:06:30,801
something like that happens all right so

4050
03:06:28,101 --> 03:06:33,261
that was a random rant on the pros and

4051
03:06:30,800 --> 03:06:35,091
cons of seeds so I guess the it's still

4052
03:06:33,261 --> 03:06:37,101
I think they're equal in my opinion I

4053
03:06:35,091 --> 03:06:38,329
think there's benefits of both there's a

4054
03:06:37,101 --> 03:06:40,670
reason to run seeds and there's a

4055
03:06:38,329 --> 03:06:41,209
benefit to run clones and as a seed

4056
03:06:40,670 --> 03:06:43,521
breeder

4057
03:06:41,209 --> 03:06:44,840
I should probably big up the seeds a

4058
03:06:43,521 --> 03:06:46,761
little bit more but to tell you the

4059
03:06:44,841 --> 03:06:49,851
truth all those famous cuts that you're

4060
03:06:46,761 --> 03:06:51,290
getting their famous cut for a reason

4061
03:06:49,851 --> 03:06:53,870
so we all have everybody in this room

4062
03:06:51,290 --> 03:06:57,410
grows the cookies everybody's got a

4063
03:06:53,870 --> 03:07:00,579
Gorilla Glue for a cut so no no yeah no

4064
03:06:57,409 --> 03:07:00,579
you will by the end of the day then

4065
03:07:01,969 --> 03:07:10,170
I could use another cut event that

4066
03:07:08,340 --> 03:07:12,690
beautiful that come from you want to

4067
03:07:10,170 --> 03:07:14,969
give someone a shout out shout out

4068
03:07:12,690 --> 03:07:18,810
Mariano's clones that's his Instagram

4069
03:07:14,969 --> 03:07:23,069
he's out of Cali Southern Cali central

4070
03:07:18,809 --> 03:07:26,299
Cali Cali okay probably some of the best

4071
03:07:23,069 --> 03:07:30,719
clones have ever received as far as a

4072
03:07:26,299 --> 03:07:33,029
month and I got got in like a month and

4073
03:07:30,719 --> 03:07:35,189
four days ago or something and they have

4074
03:07:33,030 --> 03:07:38,000
literally blown the [ __ ] up I've seen

4075
03:07:35,190 --> 03:07:41,250
pictures they're healthy they're happy

4076
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:43,110
Instagram garden of weed capital n at

4077
03:07:41,250 --> 03:07:45,959
the end of it it's all attached to the

4078
03:07:43,110 --> 03:07:51,600
garden of Weeden there's websites

4079
03:07:45,959 --> 03:07:54,179
Facebook Tumblr that's it Instagram

4080
03:07:51,600 --> 03:07:55,979
Instagram yeah we did not talk about

4081
03:07:54,180 --> 03:07:58,770
auto flower plants it's one thing I

4082
03:07:55,979 --> 03:08:00,799
wanted to two minutes okay let's just

4083
03:07:58,770 --> 03:08:03,479
[Music]

4084
03:08:00,799 --> 03:08:05,009
Auto flower plants are that's just I

4085
03:08:03,479 --> 03:08:06,719
will never breed people always ask me if

4086
03:08:05,010 --> 03:08:09,030
I will make an auto flower as a breeder

4087
03:08:06,719 --> 03:08:10,920
and I always say no that's uh that's

4088
03:08:09,030 --> 03:08:11,880
word that's not for big boys and then

4089
03:08:10,920 --> 03:08:13,649
some people are gonna hate me for saying

4090
03:08:11,879 --> 03:08:14,969
that if you need a fast production crop

4091
03:08:13,649 --> 03:08:17,609
and you're not familiar with the

4092
03:08:14,969 --> 03:08:19,109
cannabis plant that may work for you but

4093
03:08:17,610 --> 03:08:21,720
it's not kind of super great herb in my

4094
03:08:19,110 --> 03:08:25,319
opinion Jesse and I are familiar with

4095
03:08:21,719 --> 03:08:27,689
one epic freakin use a lot of flower

4096
03:08:25,319 --> 03:08:31,709
plants to discredit all this should I

4097
03:08:27,690 --> 03:08:33,540
just talked we live in a community that

4098
03:08:31,709 --> 03:08:36,029
is about 40 minutes away from a national

4099
03:08:33,540 --> 03:08:40,770
forest maybe an hour depending on which

4100
03:08:36,030 --> 03:08:43,200
routes you take there was a legendary

4101
03:08:40,770 --> 03:08:46,020
[ __ ] bust of there was a Mexican

4102
03:08:43,200 --> 03:08:50,220
cartel in the National Forest running a

4103
03:08:46,020 --> 03:08:53,399
giant grow operation all year long

4104
03:08:50,219 --> 03:08:55,199
very covertly in like a valley that they

4105
03:08:53,399 --> 03:08:56,670
were hiking in and hiking out they were

4106
03:08:55,200 --> 03:08:57,990
camped there they found food there and

4107
03:08:56,670 --> 03:08:58,379
said these guys had been camped for a

4108
03:08:57,989 --> 03:09:01,680
month

4109
03:08:58,379 --> 03:09:02,729
very very covertly yeah the people that

4110
03:09:01,680 --> 03:09:05,460
owned the land around there were

4111
03:09:02,729 --> 03:09:07,079
oblivious to it and they had irrigation

4112
03:09:05,459 --> 03:09:09,439
system set up coming from the river

4113
03:09:07,079 --> 03:09:11,879
running downhill watering all the plants

4114
03:09:09,440 --> 03:09:13,248
it was perfect it was like a movie set

4115
03:09:11,879 --> 03:09:16,038
up

4116
03:09:13,248 --> 03:09:19,850
I can I mean they had three different

4117
03:09:16,039 --> 03:09:21,439
places out there yeah I mean it's it's

4118
03:09:19,850 --> 03:09:22,850
high Keable there's area where we can

4119
03:09:21,439 --> 03:09:23,959
hike to just went out there hike so

4120
03:09:22,850 --> 03:09:28,970
we'll let them tell you about it I mean

4121
03:09:23,959 --> 03:09:31,779
they they clear-cut a good 7 acres of

4122
03:09:28,969 --> 03:09:35,148
you know just prime national forest

4123
03:09:31,779 --> 03:09:37,760
trees you know full-size trees just cut

4124
03:09:35,148 --> 03:09:42,049
them down clear cut them no thought to

4125
03:09:37,760 --> 03:09:45,020
drainage or no respect for the

4126
03:09:42,049 --> 03:09:47,389
environment whatsoever to be the hippie

4127
03:09:45,020 --> 03:09:50,658
yeah I was told it was a mess out there

4128
03:09:47,389 --> 03:09:52,549
I knew one of the knots a blow too many

4129
03:09:50,658 --> 03:09:55,189
[ __ ] whistles but I know a friend of

4130
03:09:52,549 --> 03:09:57,528
Mines father is a retired cop and he's

4131
03:09:55,189 --> 03:09:59,300
cool as [ __ ] my buddy's a dab head and

4132
03:09:57,529 --> 03:10:02,328
dad just sitting on the couch next to

4133
03:09:59,299 --> 03:10:03,559
his dad who was a cop at the time he was

4134
03:10:02,328 --> 03:10:07,010
telling us that there were plants out

4135
03:10:03,559 --> 03:10:09,139
there of all stages eight inches tall 12

4136
03:10:07,010 --> 03:10:11,389
inches tall three feet tall and he said

4137
03:10:09,139 --> 03:10:13,158
there were bags of buds and a manicuring

4138
03:10:11,389 --> 03:10:16,219
station and I was tripping out because

4139
03:10:13,158 --> 03:10:18,648
when this place was discovered was not

4140
03:10:16,219 --> 03:10:20,478
flowering season it was it was like

4141
03:10:18,648 --> 03:10:22,278
spring or some [ __ ] and he was saying

4142
03:10:20,478 --> 03:10:24,139
that they already had plants six foot

4143
03:10:22,279 --> 03:10:26,029
tall three foot tall with big buds on

4144
03:10:24,139 --> 03:10:28,430
them in flower and there's no way that

4145
03:10:26,029 --> 03:10:29,840
they could have setup like a light DEP

4146
03:10:28,430 --> 03:10:32,328
out there on seven acres

4147
03:10:29,840 --> 03:10:35,090
I mean without being busted they were

4148
03:10:32,328 --> 03:10:36,708
using auto flower plants which that's

4149
03:10:35,090 --> 03:10:38,180
the best use of auto flowers I could

4150
03:10:36,709 --> 03:10:40,039
ever see so if you're trying to do some

4151
03:10:38,180 --> 03:10:42,168
crazy outdoor where you've got enough

4152
03:10:40,039 --> 03:10:43,819
time before the cold comes right after

4153
03:10:42,168 --> 03:10:45,228
the cold get those in the ground you

4154
03:10:43,818 --> 03:10:48,288
might be able to pull off an outdoor

4155
03:10:45,228 --> 03:10:50,568
crop probably so yeah I mean they were

4156
03:10:48,289 --> 03:10:53,989
living up there they had quite the

4157
03:10:50,568 --> 03:10:57,408
little city and I may may have found a

4158
03:10:53,988 --> 03:10:58,639
plant and may have moved it down just to

4159
03:10:57,408 --> 03:11:00,920
see what happened and

4160
03:10:58,639 --> 03:11:02,569
yeah it was - Leonardo flower could

4161
03:11:00,920 --> 03:11:03,620
there have been any seeds up there by

4162
03:11:02,569 --> 03:11:05,930
chance

4163
03:11:03,620 --> 03:11:08,260
probably so the plan I found was

4164
03:11:05,930 --> 03:11:11,420
actually a mental auto flowering plant

4165
03:11:08,260 --> 03:11:15,260
yeah I killed it burned it stomped it

4166
03:11:11,420 --> 03:11:17,239
into the ground you [ __ ] a male auto

4167
03:11:15,260 --> 03:11:21,649
flower money oh that's super super

4168
03:11:17,239 --> 03:11:24,530
dangerous yeah this is just gonna bust

4169
03:11:21,649 --> 03:11:27,739
one day Spencer's eyeballs are about to

4170
03:11:24,530 --> 03:11:40,970
pop out yeah find a male in the grow

4171
03:11:27,739 --> 03:11:42,049
room about three weeks into flower I can

4172
03:11:40,969 --> 03:11:49,670
compare it to the feeling of when a

4173
03:11:42,049 --> 03:11:54,319
condom breaks if you can't tell

4174
03:11:49,670 --> 03:11:55,819
something's wrong it's just kind of

4175
03:11:54,319 --> 03:11:57,680
heartbreaking because at that point you

4176
03:11:55,819 --> 03:12:00,229
don't know like you don't know what it

4177
03:11:57,680 --> 03:12:01,579
hit if it hit if it's dropping pollen is

4178
03:12:00,229 --> 03:12:04,219
it not dropping pop there's just too

4179
03:12:01,579 --> 03:12:06,190
many questions oh yeah and then when you

4180
03:12:04,219 --> 03:12:08,629
find some seeds in your nose you know

4181
03:12:06,190 --> 03:12:09,890
I'm one thing our three months later

4182
03:12:08,629 --> 03:12:12,379
it's like BAM

4183
03:12:09,889 --> 03:12:13,699
there he goes there's a results yep I

4184
03:12:12,379 --> 03:12:14,839
saw it go oops

4185
03:12:13,700 --> 03:12:16,820
so guys pay attention with the males

4186
03:12:14,840 --> 03:12:20,710
that rule of that plant in the back if

4187
03:12:16,819 --> 03:12:23,299
you see a yellow dust on your leaf

4188
03:12:20,709 --> 03:12:31,879
that's I've discovered him now one time

4189
03:12:23,299 --> 03:12:33,319
by that yeah be careful keep an eye on

4190
03:12:31,879 --> 03:12:35,989
your feminized seeds do because femme

4191
03:12:33,319 --> 03:12:38,199
seeds can turn into hermaphrodites or

4192
03:12:35,989 --> 03:12:40,879
males

4193
03:12:38,200 --> 03:12:42,290
we got dab this [ __ ] on this episode

4194
03:12:40,879 --> 03:12:43,879
talking about this so I hope we made

4195
03:12:42,290 --> 03:12:46,370
some sort of sense I want to stress my

4196
03:12:43,879 --> 03:12:50,149
point again grown from seeds is awesome

4197
03:12:46,370 --> 03:12:52,430
everything came from seed yeah that's if

4198
03:12:50,149 --> 03:12:53,989
you grow for the curiosity and just the

4199
03:12:52,430 --> 03:12:56,899
level of the plant and you've never

4200
03:12:53,989 --> 03:13:00,739
grown from seed well I question your

4201
03:12:56,899 --> 03:13:02,719
curiosity though well if I grow from

4202
03:13:00,739 --> 03:13:04,190
seed because there's a possibility of

4203
03:13:02,719 --> 03:13:07,489
finding something that people don't have

4204
03:13:04,190 --> 03:13:09,079
and that's my that's my answer for you

4205
03:13:07,489 --> 03:13:11,149
right there like yeah I would literally

4206
03:13:09,079 --> 03:13:11,750
all grow a pack of seeds to find a Fino

4207
03:13:11,149 --> 03:13:15,171
that

4208
03:13:11,750 --> 03:13:16,671
you know maybe two people out of what

4209
03:13:15,171 --> 03:13:18,950
couple hundred people that have bought

4210
03:13:16,671 --> 03:13:20,261
in packs have you know you know who

4211
03:13:18,950 --> 03:13:23,931
knows one day that string could be

4212
03:13:20,261 --> 03:13:25,729
everything and I've seen seeds I forget

4213
03:13:23,931 --> 03:13:28,310
the term for it but I have bred seeds

4214
03:13:25,729 --> 03:13:32,000
that the outcome has been better than

4215
03:13:28,310 --> 03:13:33,860
both parents like it got more vigor and

4216
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:37,101
more trichomes than the two parents I

4217
03:13:33,860 --> 03:13:39,530
used and I've upgraded yeah so that's a

4218
03:13:37,101 --> 03:13:41,000
good good way to look at it you got

4219
03:13:39,530 --> 03:13:43,671
something in your brain there yeah I

4220
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:45,200
know that term yeah I can't I think DJ

4221
03:13:43,671 --> 03:13:49,940
short might have recently said it yeah

4222
03:13:45,200 --> 03:13:51,921
yeah somebody said it somebody tweeted

4223
03:13:49,940 --> 03:13:55,610
to us at agriculture I'll send you to

4224
03:13:51,921 --> 03:13:57,649

it's our past is the way to abide in

4458
03:24:16,120 --> 03:24:20,521
your presence is the only thing I pray

4459
03:24:18,459 --> 03:24:20,520
for

4460
03:24:22,549 --> 03:24:25,778
storms on our own

4461
03:24:27,229 --> 03:24:31,189
elie-san in my long

4462
03:24:35,030 --> 03:24:38,139
[Music]

4463
03:24:38,500 --> 03:24:42,010
the rest are far

4464
03:24:40,931 --> 03:24:44,040
I

4465
03:24:42,010 --> 03:24:46,370
[Music]

4466
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:49,290
I resign

4467
03:24:46,370 --> 03:24:50,950
[Music]

4468
03:24:49,290 --> 03:24:55,980
I know

4469
03:24:50,950 --> 03:24:55,980
these are the times when I hear a star

4470
03:24:56,000 --> 03:25:17,879
[Music]

4471
03:25:25,540 --> 03:25:27,600
you
