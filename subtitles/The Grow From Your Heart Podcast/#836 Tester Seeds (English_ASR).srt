that uh rosta Jeff's ganja Farm in there

52
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,239
that does raise suspicions without on

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,080
the pack without that on the package

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,360
nobody cared what was in there now that

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,840
you put Wild Bills weed Sanctuary

56

everybody wants to know what's in that

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,120
package so let's just not put those

58
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,878
details in there I get it you're proud

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,239
of your company name but it's highly

60
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,679
unnecessary so please stop doing that

61
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,319
I'm sure most of you watching listening

62
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,439
are not doing that I need to speak to a

63
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,518
different audience but you guys please

64
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,359
think about it when you're putting that

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,760
on your package people are going to read

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,959
that the mail man's going to read it the

67
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,560
male woman is going to read it the

68
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,560
person at the post office receiving that

69
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,039
is going to read it they look at every

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,959
package I hand them and they scan them

71
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,239
one at a time they look at the name the

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,319
address and they scan it and make sure

73
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,519
it matches on a computer so when you put

74
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,679
roster Jeff's Pot Farm or gan's [ __ ]

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,439
ganja weed farm they see that and they

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,879
give me silly looks I know I could

77
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,120
easily delete it but sometimes we're in

78
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,959
a hurry we don't notice all that as

79
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,039
we're printing labels you guys my point

80
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,280
is uh protect yourself protect me please

81
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,239
stop putting that silly stuff on the

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,519
label it's not necessary and it does

83
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,840
raise suspicions also if that's not a

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,560
real company if that's not like a

85
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Bonafide company that the mailman is

86

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,400
money for a pack of tester seeds then on

00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,240
top of that telling people what they can

144
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,399
and cannot do with the plants I

145
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,639
understand where this is going and I've

146
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,198
got a good response It also says if you

didn't want Cuts given out before you

148
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,720
release the strain then why would you

149
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,560
charge people for the seeds what

150
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,680
happened to testers being free to see if

151
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,959
they're worth growing or not why pay

152
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,959
money to help people do your job then be

153
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,439

154
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,599

155
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,879
tell you're fired up but uh calm down

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,479
bro because I've got basic answers

157
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,639
there's no need to be this aggro about

158
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,560
this uh pet peeve charging money for a

159
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,280

lot of stuff here I've actually got some

161
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,559
notes so we're going to combine my notes

162
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,639
with your question charging people for a

163
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,439
pack of tester seeds why do I charge for

164

tester seeds that's a very good question

165
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,160
now let me back up and talk a little bit

166
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,719
about tester seeds some people might not

167
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
have any idea what I'm talking about

168
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,400
when it comes to tester seeds uh let me

169
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,680
start with uh not only am I a podcaster

170
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,079
I'm also a seed breeder I am the seed

171
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,598
breeder and sole proprietor of iy

172
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,038
genetics premium seeds that is me I

173
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:13,000
breed all the seeds I do all the

174
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,478
selection um I've got a little bit of

175
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,319
help with some packaging and some

176
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,639
artwork and a few things like that but

177
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,479
it is 99% me running the company so I am

178
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:25,400
IE genetics premium seeds I'm we make I

179
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,399
make orange gasm lemon Jeffrey uh I made

180
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:28,598
the machine uh make a lot of great

181
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,839
strains out there when you put me on the

182
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:31,038
spot I can't even think about but there

183
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,638
are so many strains that I've made I'm

184
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,918
known for the arise was real popular so

185
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:36,960
I make these strains right and I put

186
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,240
them out you guys love to grow them so

187
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,198
when I'm making new strains sometimes I

188
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,199
get this idea of what if I put plant a

189
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,680
and plant B together and breed them

190
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,720
we'll make some cool new [ __ ] right

191
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,720
hopefully hopefully my intuition and my

192
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,599
breeding uh intelligence and knowledge

193
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,160
works and I can uh kind of predict the

194
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,519
outcome of this breeding project I put

195
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,720
the two plants together I make seeds now

196
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,399
I've got a bunch of seeds it would be

197
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,360
really easy to put them online and sell

198
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,359
them but that's kind of a dick move in

199
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,960
my opinion because I don't know what

200
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,960
those seeds are going to do they could

201
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,680
be anything they could be hopefully my

202
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,598
breeding intuition was accurate and I've

203
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,038
made amazing seeds it will produce

204
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,959
amazing progeny but also there's a

205
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:15,560
chance there's always a chance that

206
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,799
maybe there's a problem maybe they just

207
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,280
suck maybe they don't germinate properly

208
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
uh maybe they don't grow well maybe they

209
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,598
don't put off good aroma maybe there's

210
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,160
no buzz maybe we get the dreaded interex

211
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,079
plants out of the batch um these are all

212
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
possibilities you could get mutants I

213
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,159
could have just made the most amazing

214
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,198
new [ __ ] or I could have just made

215
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,919
garbage or somewhere in the middle we

216
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,439
never know the way to figure this out is

217
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:41,198
by testing now first I test them uh I'll

218
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:42,478
run um as many as I possibly can I'm not

219
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,079
going to say too many numbers because

220
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,038
I've got different locations and at some

221
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,639
places I'm allowed more some places I'm

222
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:49,598
not if it's in my house I do [ __ ] six

223
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,199
of them because it's Colorado If I'm

224
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,478
renting space somewhere in a commercial

225
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,840
facility or things that I can't talk

226
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,560
about contractually uh then I'll do more

227
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,079
seeds and I'll have people help me there

228
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,879
but I test them first then I've got a

229
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,318
small group of friends uh that you've

230
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,720
heard me talk about some of them want to

231
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,520
be known some want to remain anonymous

232
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,440
um I give those people seeds I like

233
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,680
testers that live near me they get the

234
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,839
seeds first so I grow them once I'm into

235
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,400
flower and I see uh if I've got any

236
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,239
problems right away or if I see that I'm

237
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,560
happy with what I'm getting I'll pass a

238
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,680
few seeds to a few of my friends that

239
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,360
are close to the group then once I see

240
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,319
that they're having success with that by

241
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,520
now I'm harvested I know what the seeds

242
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,479
are going to do now they're about

243
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,000
halfway through a harvest that's when I

244
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,359
decide that it is time to share those

245
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,440
testers seeds with the public if I can

246
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,278
grow those seeds and have a good outcome

247
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,640
a big deal I should be able to grow

248
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,479
every plant by now and have a good

249
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,158
outcome especially plants that I bred

250
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,399
and created I've got my rooms dialed in

251
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,319
I've got my feeding methods dialed in my

252
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,919
Sops are under control I should have

253
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,240
success with 95% 99% of the plants that

254
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,639
I attempt to grow now if I get it right

255
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,799
that's not a big deal I'm going to find

256
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,039
a lot of great [ __ ] I'm going to see the

257
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,039
phenotype I'm going to see what the

258
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,399
plant does in my environment under my

259
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,439
care I'm going to see the phenotypic

260
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,440
typical expression that happens in my

261
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,079
environment or different environments

262
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,399
and that's very limited to me I can't

263
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,599
run uh 20 different rooms to go see what

264
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,720
these plants are going to do in 20

265
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,800
different rooms it's just not uh

266
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,160
feasible for me uh logistically so um

267
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,439
I've got my friends running them now I

268
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,120
see what happens in their different

269
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,440
rooms one of my friends uh he does

270
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,759
straight up LEDs one guy does HPS the

271
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,360
other guy does ceramic metal Hy uh one

272
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,360
guy does hydro the other guy does

273
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,039
soiless and I'm just being hypothetical

274
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,000
here so I can go see those different

275
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:31,319
variables and I can talk to them I can

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,480
look at their plants I can smell their

277
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,040
plants and see what's going on that is

278
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,879
so I'm tier one testing they're tier two

279
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,759
then once I'm satisfied I want to see

280
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,679
what happens in your grow room uh we're

281
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,439
me and my crew not I'm not being

282
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:45,919
braggadocious we're [ __ ] professional

283
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,600
Growers we should be able to grow the

284
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,479
[ __ ] out of these plants the testers can

285
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,920
be anybody they may be amateur Growers

286
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,440
they may be people dreaming about

287
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,360
growing this could be their very first

288
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,079
pack of seeds they could also be

289
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,759
professional commercial cultivators like

290
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,278
myself and my crew it could be anybody

291
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,679
they could be growing indoors in a

292
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,399
greenhouse they could be growing in a

293
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,159
closet they could be in a tent they

294
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,399
could be in a big 25 by 25 room who

295
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,799
knows what they're doing are they're

296
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,639
running LEDs gavitas uh metal halides

297
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,399
hpss ceramic metal halides they find are

298
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,159
they using plasma lights are they

299
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,078
running under canopy lighting there are

300
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,240
so many variables are they doing like I

301
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:26,078
said a minute ago soil soilless mix

302
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,839
Hydro um aeroponics are they in Cocoa

303
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:28,958
are they in um are they just straight

304
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,680
hanging the plants in the air and

305
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,639
misting them some magical way

306
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:35,278
aeroponically there are so many

307
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,278
different variables that I cannot create

308
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,480
so by putting the testers out in your

309
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,039
guys' hands I can see what is happening

310
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,639
with my new Creations so that is why I

311
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,399
send them out that is what testers are

312
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,560
uh the whole idea is what are testers

313
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,759
testers are new [ __ ] that have not been

314
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,039
verified or proven to be added to the

315
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,240
official lineup of ir genetics premium

316
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,799
seeds that's what testers are now there

317
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,519
are two questions three questions to

318
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,000
cover why do I sell them because I sell

319
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,000
them because what I noticed when I used

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,759
to give them away I would give them away

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,559
and nothing would happen nobody would

322
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,000
grow them nobody would give me reports

323
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,278
nobody would ever say these plants were

324
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,440
fire or these plants were trash I I

325
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,519
would not get any return on the seeds

326
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,120
that I gave away I found that selling

327
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,159
seeds the tester seeds for a low price

328
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,320
uh people have more pride in something

329
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,240
that they paid for they actually want to

330
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,360
grow it it gives them some initiative

331
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,959
and some motivation to put that plant in

332
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,039
the dirt and grow it instead of just

333
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,159
taking a freebie seed and acting like

334
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,599
they got a cool gift because as much as

335
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,679
I did love and do love giving [ __ ] away

336
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,360
uh testers I need them ran I need them

337
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,919
tested they are testers not keepers not

338
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,200
souvenirs not drawer decorations not

339
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,439
trinkets uh those are tester seats so

340
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,920
please grow those so I want to scan your

341
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,320
question here get myself back on track

342
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,399
I'll scan my notes we're going to keep

343
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,120
going uh charging money for a pack of

344
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,799
tester seeds then telling people what

345
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,759
they can and cannot do I understand

346
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,559
where this came from another listener

347
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,039
said they wanted to give clones of my

348
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,518
new testers away you can do whatever you

349
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,439
want with them I'm not there I'm not

350
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,039
watching but this goes for any clone if

351
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,720
I sent you a clone of anything if I told

352
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,679
you it was Northern Lights if I told you

353
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,399
it's Golden Goat if I sent it to you it

354
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:17,439
is your responsibility as a farmer as a

355
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,120
cultivator as a cannabis Community

356
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,399
member as somebody that wants to forward

357
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,000
the culture it is your responsibility to

358
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,360
grow that cut and verify that it is

359
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,240
worth passing to the next person I don't

360
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,959
think it would be good etiquette to just

361
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,600
get that plant cut clones of it and pass

362
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,958
it right along there's got to be a

363
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,560
verification step and I don't just say

364
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,278
that with my tester seeds I say that

365
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:39,799
with everything that is like a general

366
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,559
rule uh that is a courtesy that is just

367
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:44,479
being classy why would would you want so

368
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,719
let's just hypothetically say hey man I

369
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,480
just sprouted this seed it's in veg I'm

370
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,000
going to send you clones of it and then

371
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,320
I'd lose contact with you right I'm not

372
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,600
going to talk to you anymore just

373
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,600
because there that's just how business

374
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,879
goes my my plant is going to grow what

375
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,639
if I find unfortunately that this plant

376
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,679
I just sent you clones of is interex now

377
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,000
you've got clones of it you've probably

378
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,719
cut clones of that and send it to your

379
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,240
friend who was probably do you see what

380
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm saying now instead of improving

381
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,560
cannabis I just accidentally spread an

382
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,839
interex plant to you you possibly I

383
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,799
don't know your level of growing I'm

384
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,079
just estimating you possibly could be a

385
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,958
brand new grower that doesn't know how

386
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,039
to look for interx you're going to [ __ ]

387
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,399
up your garden but before you did that

388
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,559
you took a bunch of cuts and sent them

389
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,039
to five other people now there's five

390
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,919
other people who are spreading them and

391
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,958
it goes exponentially inter our seex

392
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,639
plants all over the planet they were my

393
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,879
fault on accident so that's why I say

394
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,320
grow them out before you pass any clones

395
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,958
out find out what you've got it's you're

396
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,680
putting your word on that clone yes I

397
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,198
bred it I created that line but you're

398
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,599
the one that selected that clone that's

399
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:46,799
your responsibility your name is on that

400
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,560
your selection reputation is on the line

401
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,479
there does it have flavor does it have

402
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,838
Aroma does it have potency does it grow

403
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,039
well is it intersect does it get powdery

404
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,800
Milo is it prone to spider mites that's

405
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,519
your responsibility to learn that at

406
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,439
least one time before you share it and

407
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,159
spread it out so that's why I said uh

408
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,600
that it would be common courtesy to not

409
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:06,319
spread that clone I understand what

410
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,399
you're getting at uh you paid for

411
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,120
something I always talk like this I did

412
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,839
not invent cannabis um I can't stop you

413
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,000
from doing anything with the seeds that

414
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,560
I've sold you I've also said this before

415
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,480
uh that would be like me selling you a

416
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,599
motorcycle and telling you you can't go

417
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,560
fast they're your seeds go fast bro but

418
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,278
common courtesy would be to not share

419
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,719
clones that have been not been that have

420
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,759
not been tested verified tried and true

421
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,120
and ran at least to fr

422
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,800
and why do you want to pass out some

423
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
[ __ ] that you haven't even tried yet

424
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,838
anyway don't don't you want to know that

425
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,920
it's good or know that it's terrible

426
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,240
before you share it like that's that's

427
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,799
what I would want to do all right

428
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,639
there's more to your message let me keep

429
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,039
going uh if you don't want get Cuts

430
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,680
given out yeah that's what I'm talking

431
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,000
about now why' you charge people you can

432
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,879
do whatever you want bro it's just

433
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,720
common courtesy what happened to testers

434
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,360
being free people don't care about free

435
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,000
[ __ ] um I saw this when I just talked

436
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,039
about I notice when I charge more for

437
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,039
the SE for the testers people buy them

438
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,559
and then they post their tester reports

439
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,559
when I was in a band if we did a free

440
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,278
concert nobody would come if we charged

441
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,000
$3 the backyard would be full people

442
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,159
have more value in something they had to

443
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
pay for it just that they're that just

444
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,958
makes sense you gave them they gave

445
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,799
money they want something in return it's

446
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,719
an exchange they feel attached to it if

447
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,758
it's free they're not attached to it in

448
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,480
any way so those seeds go in the drawer

449
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,159
they forget all about it there is more

450
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,199
uh why pay money to help you do your job

451
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,639
because bro there um I don't have every

452
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:33,758
single type of grow uh space equipment

453
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,839
opportunity um and this isn't meant to

454
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,199
be egotistical I love getting the tester

455
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,600
seeds out to new Growers because they're

456
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,039
going to [ __ ] them up they're going to

457
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,040
cause problems they're going to overfeed

458
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,000
they're going to underfeed they're going

459
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,559
to overwater underwater there's going to

460
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,198
be a problem and I want to see what

461
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,239
happens when they face those problems I

462
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,758
want to see that also some of those

463
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,039
testers are bad [ __ ] with

464
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,480
photography and I want their photos uh

465
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,919
those photos are great seeing what's

466
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,199
happening with my plants all over the

467
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:58,958
world getting those grow reports that is

468
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,958
great info so I'm going to slide your

469
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,000
message over and I'm going to stick to

470
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,518
my notes here because I do have some

471
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,679
more notes to ramble on about this uh

472
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,159
expectations what do I expect uh when I

473
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,078
send you tester seeds when you buy

474
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,360
tester seeds I really expect and hope

475
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,758
that you grow them uh in a timely manner

476
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,240
I understand you've got more crops going

477
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,959
uh maybe you're waiting for one crop to

478
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,079
finish a room to be empty a tent to be

479
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,000
free I get it but please grow them so

480
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,479
that we can get those test reports going

481
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,360
then I can find out if they're really

482
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,240
good or not amazing or where they fall

483
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,959
on that Spectrum then we know if we put

484
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,560
them out for sale to the general public

485
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:33,479
or not so expectation grow them grow

486
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,000
them to the best of your ability one

487
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,800
thing I do recommend and these are your

488
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,839
seeds you can do what you want but keep

489
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:42,000
in mind they're testers uh you're

490
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,560
testing them we have not verified that

491
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,159
these are amazing plants if you want

492
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,479
something to put in a big pot and grow

493
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:49,759
huge buy something from the proven line

494
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,519
but testers they could be problematic

495
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,919
there could be an issue so I recommend

496
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,159
growing them veg them for a very short

497
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,000
period of time uh veg them until you can

498
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,399
get a clone or two off the bottom then

499
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,278
flower them as much my recommendation

500
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,759
like I said do whatever you want but

501
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:05,480
they're testers we don't know if they're

502
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,000
amazing plant so why would you veg them

503
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,519
out super big and waste a bunch of time

504
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,279
space energy resources lights uh soil

505
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,639
water nutrients I might have said that

506
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,480
but why would you waste all that on a

507
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,600
tester if you don't even know that it's

508
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,199
going to be hot fire most likely they

509
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,599
will be if they're coming from me

510
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,360
because I've done my preo diligence but

511
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:27,198
they're testers so I would say run them

512
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,719
small three gallon pot is big enough veg

513
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,798
them till they're about knee high flip

514
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,919
what also I would like to see is if you

515
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,679
could and I understand this is this is

516
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,080
not always possible but what I do with

517
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,400
the tester if I've got six feminized

518
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,918
plants they all get treated the exact

519
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,120
same way I don't do anything different

520
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,559
to anyone because then my test is

521
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,038
invalid I want to see if I run six of

522
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,200
these plants and this is also kind of

523
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:51,960
how I do a pheno hunt if I'm running six

524
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,400
plants I feed them all six the same

525
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,840
thing give them all six the same

526
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,519
treatment how do they react what do I

527
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,558
see out of those six that's how I want

528
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,558
to do the testing scientifically I don't

529
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,720
want to do some weird [ __ ] do what you

530
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:06,000
do all the time to these plants do your

531
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,240
sop so that we can see how they respond

532
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,960
to your sop that's my main expectation

533
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,440
uh etiquette is my next thing I wrote

534
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,360
down um they're your seeds you can do

535
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,840
what you want but I wouldn't give out

536
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,839
clones um until you flowered them that

537
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,519
is part of the etiquette then please do

538
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,359
keep in touch with me that's part of the

539
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,918
expectation I would like uh in the veg

540
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,558
phase I get it there's not a lot to show

541
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,960
me but if you notice something that

542
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:32,158
stands out email me as soon as possible

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,159
that [ __ ] excites me and interests me um

546
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,200
I like feedback um so the uh things I

547
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,559
want to know are how many seeds did you

548
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,080
try to germinate how many germinated uh

549
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,558
this is all on my website also by the

550
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,798
way you guys under the tester tab we'll

551
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,879
get to that but keep in touch with me

552
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,599
let me know what's going on with the

553
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,679
plants how many you germinated how many

554
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,000
sprouted of those how many made it to

555
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,919
the flower room uh what did you see were

556
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,919
there any mutations any weirdos any

557
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,120
problems or anything amazing that you

558
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,520
stood out then when it comes to flower I

559
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,199
would hope for weekly photos maybe at

560
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,158
the start of week one the start of week

561
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,400
two and then right before you harvest

562
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:13,320
take some pictures and let me know what

563
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,038
they look like then at the end I would

564
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,918
appreciate a smoke report let me know

565
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,640
what it did for you let me know how much

00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,320
you harvested out of how much space

567
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,120
things like that that's what I would

568
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,240
hope that's what I would hope for I

569
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,918
understand all those things aren't

570
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,440

occasionally and look at every single

602
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,119
tester picture I capture all of them put

603
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,559
them in a folder uh so that I've got all

604
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,279
the plants documented so that when I

605
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,839
want to post stuff online or talk about

606
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,839
things I've got photos for references so

607
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:41,480
the Discord is one of my favorite ways

608
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,279
to see the photos it's like a a very

609
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,519
communual way to come hang out and join

610
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,119
the community join the iy Army and while

your grow questions there on the Discord

615
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,279
server so we've got three ways so far

616

you can email me you can send them on my

617
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,119
website or you can join the Discord

618
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,799
server another thing I ask for you guys

619
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:06,719
is when the grow is completed once

620
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,599
you've harvested you've smoked it on IR

621
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,759
genetics.com there is a tab that

622
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,278
actually says testers when you click on

623
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,158
that tab a big old list of questions

624
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:17,558

questions also type in any details and

626
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:21,079
info that you may think would be

627
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,558
valuable to me as the breeder and the

628
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,439
person selling the seeds let me know if

629
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:27,200
you saw amazing colors if it smelled

630
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,080
like something brand new if you got

631
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,720
higher than you ever been let me know

632

648
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,159
notes uh why do I sell them because you

649
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,359

650
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,799
grow them right away send me pictures

651

658
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,720

673

you can share clones if you'd like to

683
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:16,679
but I'd rather you didn't share them

684
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,000
until you're finished that is basic

685
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,440
etiquette with all the Clones I think

686
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,119
