Colorado we'll get down but since your

196
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:50,250
screen name was 303 go tweet I kind of

197
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,649
think you're a Denver person because

198
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,579
that's the 303 I listen to the dude

199
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:57,779

200
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,399

00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,500

reach with my left hand and adjust it

224
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,110

238

245
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:29,379
next comment the next Facebook review

246
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,788
Facebook is that [ __ ] Facebook iTunes

247
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:32,288
review guys somehow a [ __ ] I bet you

248
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:35,348
could tell from those dabs I am high as

249
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:37,620
[ __ ] it's working this review says it's

250
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:41,050
from a person who calls himself me for

251
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,729
437 the headline of the review is wealth

252
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:44,799
of information and the review goes like

253
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,450
this this information is more

254
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,509
comprehensive than any book on the

255
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,509
subject you can spend hundreds a hundred

256
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:54,490
hours filling your head with quality

257
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:57,490
material that's straight to the point

258
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,740
and that's exactly I thought about doing

259
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,149
a book you guys I started writing the

260
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,740
outline to write a book and then I

261
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:04,980
realized that every week when I would

262
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,539
write about cannabis [ __ ] would change

263
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,850
technology would change rules would

264
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:12,159
change my ideas would change what I

265
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,290
learned would change the stuff that was

266
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,730
available to us would change so I was

267
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:18,669
like man I can't write a book because it

268
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,379
evolves every week then I was talking to

269
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:21,879
some friends it spins in Mattie's house

270
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:23,500
and was like I keep repeating this I

271
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,669
should record this and just tell people

272
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,129
to go listen and then I was like that's

273
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:28,809
a podcast and I had another podcast with

274
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:30,759
a friend worried occasionally I would

275
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:32,708
talk about pot and it this was this show

276
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,360
started off kind of as a spinoff from

277
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,369
another show so that I could focus on

278
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,440
weed but instead of doing a book I

279
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,159
thought I'll do a podcast and it's

280
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,509
definitely true

281
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,969
it's more comprehensive than any book

282
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:44,709
because I can update you every week and

283
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,329
if something changes I can tell you

284
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,799
about that a book once it's published

285
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:49,269
I gotta make a whole new edition where

286
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,189
you got to go back and amend everything

287
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,568
that sucks with the podcast I can jump

288
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,420
in at any time and say hey what I said

289
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:56,979
last week wrong update so you're right

290
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:58,929
way more comprehensive than any book I'm

291
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,670
glad you notice that and a hundred hours

292
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:03,698
filling your head with quality material

293
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:06,490
that's absolutely correct there are 196

294
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:09,188
episodes out now some of those are old

295
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,810
flashback episodes so there's probably I

296
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:12,188
would say over a hundred hours of

297
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:13,599
quality material so if you guys need

298
00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:15,578
something to listen to go back check out

299
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,019
the archives and since I mentioned it I

300
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:18,429
am putting out the old episodes in

301
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,589
chunks I try to put them out at least

302
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:22,088
three episodes at a time I try to make

303
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,100
about a three three and a half to four

304
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,750
hour file that's as large as my

305
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,639
recording software will hold I think

306
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,769
that's as big as iTunes really wants to

307
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,568
support and for you guys downloading

308
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,490
podcasts it's probably a real [ __ ] let

309
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:34,688
me know what you think about that the

310
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,698
old episodes that I've been putting out

311
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:38,169
I want some reviews some feedback please

312
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:40,179
let me know what you think how I'm doing

313
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:41,469
with that do you love it do you hate it

314
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:43,750
can I do it differently to make it

315
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,040
better for you a lot of people wanted

316
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,240
those old episodes and that was the best

317
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,698
way I could think of to put them out

318
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,649
quickly I am making youtube videos I

319

left by a person who calls himself

339

selves BTL eight four zero the review

goes like this the girl from your heart

341
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,379
podcast has a variety of interesting yet

342
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:43,088
practical topics on every episode and I

343
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:45,938
enjoy the laid-back manner in which is

344
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:47,889
which it is presented Rasta Jeff is very

345
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:49,389
informative and thorough but speaks in

346
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,430
layman's terms so anyone could take

347
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:52,600
advantage of his expertise as he is a

348
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:55,409
plethora of gar

349
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,420
turning wisdom thanks Rasta Jeff wow

350
00:11:55,409 --> 00:12:00,669
somebody just described me with the word

351
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:02,889
wisdom which is kind of fun to me and

352
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:05,229
expertise I've never thought of myself

353
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,360
as a wizard or an expert but if you

354
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,560
called me that it's official I didn't

355
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,818
make that [ __ ] up myself hey

356
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,049
I truly appreciate I know I'm joking

357
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:12,838
around but I truly appreciate that

358
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:14,919
review that's a huge compliment

359
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,790
interesting yet practical that's what

360
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,278
I'm aiming for

361
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:20,349
Laidback I couldn't do it any other way

362
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:22,028
you guys I'm dabbed out I'm chilling I

363
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,528
like to be a laid-back guy there's no

364
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:24,759
reason to get uptight we're not doing

365
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:26,679
rocket surgery here we're going on

366
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,079
cannabis we're growing a plant to make

367
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,328
us relax and feel better it shouldn't be

368
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:32,500
super stressful and then we smoke a

369
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:34,778
bunch of this [ __ ] so we're chilled out

370
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,940
anyway informative and thorough yes that

371
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:39,338
is my goal speak in layman's terms I

372
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,480
feel like when when I go to the doctor

373
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,130
or when I go somewhere and somebody

374
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,019
tries to talk to me and using a bit they

375
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,818
use a whole bunch of glossary words to

376
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:47,709
try to sound fancy I think they're just

377
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:50,019
Schmucks I'm like can't you just say

378
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:51,518
instead of using I don't even have an

379
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,620
example right now but instead of using

380
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,839
some big fancy word you could have said

381
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,698
blanket and they just made up some fancy

382
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,529
word for blanket that was 17 syllables

383
00:12:57,698 --> 00:13:01,088
and it makes them feel good about

384
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:03,338
themselves and they they're trying to

385
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:05,230
belittle you I think I think it's better

386
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,750
when I just talk to you like you're me

387
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,920
and we just get along like we're friends

388
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,889
and I don't have to impress you with my

389
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,958
my plethora of glossary terms that

390
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,818
doesn't seem useful to me

391
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:18,068
but anyway layman's terms yes that's

392
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:19,899
what I try to do a plethora of gardening

393
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:21,068
wisdom I like that thank you that means

394
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,188
a lot to me I've been doing this for a

395
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:25,719
long time honestly the way I learned a

396
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:28,349
lot of what I was doing was just by

397
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,089
[ __ ] things up I've got a lot of uh

398
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,500
I'm brave I guess I'll try some stuff in

399
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,300
the garden that most people wouldn't do

400
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,870
and I'm not afraid to [ __ ] some stuff up

401
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:39,729
a lot of people rely too heavily on the

402
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,049
income of their garden or the medicine

403
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,829
that they're going to receive from their

404
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:47,258
garden and I was fortunate enough to

405
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:51,099
have I live in Colorado first of all and

406
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:53,350
for the past ten years at least I have

407
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,810
worked or been involved in the medical

408
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,730
marijuana industry so I've always had

409
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:58,929
plenty of cannabis available there's

410
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,480
always been plenty of medicine available

411
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:03,729
to me and I've also had plenty of grow

412
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,129
space I've had my own grows I've had

413
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,459
friends help me and let me help them

414
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:11,588
in their spaces I've had large

415
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:14,379
facilities to grow in so I've had a lot

416
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:16,120
of places to experiment and sometimes if

417
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:17,799
I had ten lights I would dedicate two

418
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,419
lights to trying to [ __ ] something up

419
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:21,669
and see what would happen and that's how

420
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:23,439
I learned a lot that's just by going in

421
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:24,969
and seeing what happens when I totally

422
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,500
try to destroy these plants what can

423
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,970
they take and then you learn stuff

424
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
you're like whoo when I bent this this

425
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,410
way and broke it this way it really grew

426
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,299
like a champ like this so I learned a

427
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:36,490
lot by screwing things up and taking

428
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:37,809
risks and being brave and I really think

429
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,120
that that could help for most growers

430
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:41,528
don't be so afraid to mess with your

431
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,990
crop don't treat it like it's a little

432
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:47,110
baby it's a weed I've joked about it

433
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,879
before this plant has been it's growing

434
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,709
on the side of a rocky mountain in

435
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,289
Afghanistan they got beat up by the wind

436
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:56,078
it got rained on it got pissed on by a

437
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:57,610
goat it got it's had a snake hiding

438
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,328
underneath it it's been through all

439
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,709
kinds of [ __ ]

440
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:01,659
and these plants survived they've

441
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:03,729
evolved to survive through that they're

442
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:04,899
made to protect themselves so you can

443
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,509
beat the [ __ ] out of them in the grow

444
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:08,919
and it might be good for them so my

445
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:10,419
plethora of gardening knowledge and

446
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:12,188
wisdom a lot of that has come just by

447
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:16,509
trial and error and not being afraid to

448
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:18,009
screw things up so BTL eight four zero

449

532
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,150
I'm gonna take a drink and then when we

533
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:08,009
get back I'm going to talk about a

534
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,840
worker protection safety class I took

535
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:12,679
recently we'll talk a little bit about

536
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,628
pesticides I'll be right back

537
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,429
all right you guys I am back I just made

538
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,748
a marvelous discovery this new carb cap

539
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,399
that I picked up at elevate today it's a

540
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:22,100
directional flow carbon cap which means

541
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,969
when you cap the Banger I may have to

542
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:24,589
explain the Bangor

543
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,839
the Bangor instead of using a titanium

544
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:28,878
meal I'm using a bang or a banger looks

545
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,099
kind of like a glass bowl looks like a

546
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:33,109
little bucket it fits right where your

547
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:35,209
bowl would go kind of on your smoking

548
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:36,408
device and then it's just a little glass

549
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,509
bowl and you heat that and he put the

550
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:40,220
dab in there and then you cover it with

551
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:41,628
a carb cap and what that does is kinda

552
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,980
you can let it get a little cooler and

553
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:44,449
then you cap it they don't have to take

554
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,278
such a hot dab it tastes better it's

555
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,169
easier on your lungs when you cap it

556
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:49,788
kind of Stokes the heat it traps the

557
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,929
heat in there so the lower heat cooks

558
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:53,028
the dab a little better you draw the

559
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,288
oxygen over the trapped heat it makes

560
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:56,028
your dab a little better it's cooler at

561
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:57,679
software it's more taste better but I

562
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:59,269
just discovered that this carb cap its

563
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,028
directional flow which means when I cap

564
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:03,710
it I can turn it and that will stir my

565
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:05,388
oil around on the nail a little bit in

566
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,308
the Banger a little bit better so that I

567
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:08,959
can get a more efficient burn on my oil

568
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:10,579
it'll kind of move it around and set a

569
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,860
puddling up in one spot where it's cool

570
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:15,589
I can move it around to a hot spot I get

571
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:16,939
a better dab but also it's kind of an

572
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,528
extended piece on the top of it was a

573
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,788
hole in it which of course it's got a

574
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:21,710
hole in it Cythera can flow but I

575
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:24,408
figured that if I put my finger on that

576
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:27,679
hole I can really control the amount of

577
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:28,970
airflow I get up to me and I just got a

578
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,139
really killer dab with this thing that

579
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,490
was the best I haven't had with it so

580
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:33,138
far so shad it's my friends at elevate

581
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,159

593
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,378

599
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:07,190
you and of course let them know that you

600
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,069
listen to the girl from your heart a

601
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,558
podcast are you guys recently I took a

602
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:14,089
class in Denver sponsored by the

603
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,918
Colorado State University and the

604
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:18,678
Department of Agriculture and of course

605
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,778
the Environmental Protection Agency the

606
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,720
class was a worker protection safety

607
00:20:20,778 --> 00:20:26,509
train the trainer class I am now

608
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,910
certified to train people in worker

609
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:32,180
action safety which involves pesticides

610
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,370
in agricultural applications which means

611
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,769
now I can train my employees my

612
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:38,689
co-workers and other growers and other

613
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:41,329
workers and other facilities on how to

614
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,309
safely handle pesticides under EPA

615
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:45,169
guidelines and under Department of

616
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:47,119
Agriculture guidelines and of course

617
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:50,960
under the marijuana Enforcement Division

618
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,279
guidelines so the class cost me $65 to

619
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,430
take but it was definitely worth every

620
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:56,899
penny because I learned in Valley it was

621
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,730
invaluable I learned more information

622
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,710
than I could have ever imagined I was a

623
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,180
four hour class honestly it could have

624
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,730
probably have been convinced to about

625
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,920
three hours but the host the lady that

626
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,210
taught the class her name was Thea she

627
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,800
was a great instructor she kept my

628
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,230
attention the entire time you guys

629
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:15,230
usually you can tell by the podcast I've

630
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,660
got some ATD I was not the ideal student

631
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,610
in school I was able to keep my mouth

632
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,050
shut I was able to sit still I was able

633
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,490
to pay attention for the entire four

634
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:24,619
hour class I didn't feel like I needed

635
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,769
to get up and run out of the room so

636
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:29,449
good job - Thea it was a great class I

637
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:31,509
learned a whole bunch one thing that I

638
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,799
really did learn you guys was that

639
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:36,500
pesticide safety is completely

640
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:38,329
overlooked as growers most of us are not

641
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,329
paying attention to the safety of

642
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:43,099
pesticides we might read the bottle we

643
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:45,230
might follow those guidelines we might

644
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:48,049
spray and from there we overlook

645
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,940
everything else let me talk a little bit

646
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:51,500
about important stuff here when it comes

647
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,440
to pesticides because I learned things

648
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,150
that home growers will benefit from from

649
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,309
the commercial benefit growers will

650
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,310
benefit from that indoor and outdoor

651
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:02,629
outdoor growers will benefit from excuse

652
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:04,399
me I'm coughing from the dab I took it's

653
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,140
finally creeping up on me I took a big

654
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,210
old fat dab of some cactus cooler it

655
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,750
starting to set in alright I think I'm

656
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,460
gonna live

657
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,559
let's now let's talk about pesticide

658
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,170
safety the most important thing is to

659
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,309
read the bottle for every pesticide that

660
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,410
you buy on the front it's got that

661
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:20,629
little booklet that opens up peel that

662
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:23,180
open read it all the information that

663
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,310
you need is going to be on that bottle

664
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,080
it's gonna tell you what kind of

665
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:29,179
protective equipment you need if you're

666
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,609
spraying a product a pesticide you

667
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:35,210
almost always need long sleeves long

668
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:36,769
pants shoes and socks and gloves most of

669
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,049
the time they're going to recommend some

670
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:40,190
sort of eyewear you're gonna want to

671
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,500
wear some sort of goggles

672
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,820
that have protection all around not the

673
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,230
kind of goggles with holes in the side

674
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:47,720
for air but the ones that protect your

675
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,548
face you should also wear protective

676
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,440
gear when you're mixing your nutrients

677
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:53,000
certainly wear those goggles when you're

678
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,278
mixing a pesticide it only takes one

679
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,138
little splash imagine you're pouring I'm

680
00:22:55,278 --> 00:22:58,669
just gonna pick evergreen imagine you've

681
00:22:57,138 --> 00:23:00,138
got some evergreen or some pie Ganic

682
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:02,149
something similar you're pouring it from

683
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:04,699
the bottle into whatever you're gonna

684
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:06,648
pour it into to spray one drop just when

685
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,659
that liquid hits the other liquid and it

686
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:10,339
drops and splashes one drop into your

687
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:11,720
eye you're going to the eye doctor

688
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:13,638
you're [ __ ] up for a little bit it's

689
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,569
gonna get expensive it's gonna hurt it's

690
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:16,099
gonna ruin your day

691
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:17,658
now you've got an incident report if

692
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:19,428
you're at a commercial grow you got

693
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,960
paper to fill out there you got to

694
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:23,360
explain how you got evergreen in your

695
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,819
eye it's not a good idea to get [ __ ] in

696
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,099
your eye wear protective equipment also

697
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:30,619
a lot of pesticides will require some

698
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:32,778
sort of a respirator it's a good idea to

699
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:34,308
go get an expensive respirator and keep

700
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,659
the cartridges change those pink

701
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:37,819
cartridges that pop onto the sides

702
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:39,879
they're not very expensive it's well

703
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:41,898
worth your health to change those out so

704
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:43,519
find out what kind of personal

705
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:45,699
protective equipment you need for the

706
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,230
pesticides that you plan on applying and

707
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,409
get them it's well worth the money if

708
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:53,179
you work in a commercial grow beyond the

709
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:55,100
long-sleeve shirt pants shoes and socks

710
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:57,528
it's up to your employer to provide

711
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:59,628
proper personal protective equipment so

712
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:02,628
it's up to them to get you a respirator

713
00:23:59,628 --> 00:24:04,278
goggles maybe a Tyvek suit I recommend a

714
00:24:02,628 --> 00:24:06,349
Tyvek suit if you're spraying pesticide

715
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:08,089
they aren't very expensive the

716
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:10,128
Department of Ag does require that you

717
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:11,720
throw them away after each use if you're

718
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:13,668
gonna use it for your own personal grow

719
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,259
maybe you can use it a couple of times I

720
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:17,269
can't say much about that because I am

721
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:18,649
trained on how to teach you how to do it

722
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:20,599
correctly so I'm supposed to tell you

723
00:24:18,648 --> 00:24:22,339
throw those away after each use if you

724
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,689
use them in a commercial setting the

725
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,428
reason for that is because it's got

726
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,320
pesticide on it how are you going to

727
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,909
store it where is it going to be until

728
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:31,339
you use it next time how are you not

729
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:33,259
going to spread pesticides from that to

730
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:34,548
your skin when you're getting out of it

731
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:36,589
and putting it on next time there are

732
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:38,538
concerns with that how much pesticide is

733
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:40,339
going to penetrate that suit while it is

734
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:42,619
sitting there a lot of it is not just

735
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:44,599
the pesticide that's a contaminant

736
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:46,819
but the solvent that carries the

737
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,378
pesticide because maybe whatever you're

738
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,178
spraying is not always a liquid they

739
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:51,980
have to put it in a liquid to carry it

740
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:52,340
sometimes that's a solvent and will

741
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,528
cause

742
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:56,449
problems which makes me remind which

743
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,609
reminds me to tell you that if you are

744
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,340
mixing and applying a pesticide that

745
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:02,899
those nitrile gloves we're buying at the

746
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:04,428
gross store or that we're getting at

747
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,960
what's the place called over there

748
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:08,059
Harbor Freight or that you're buying

749
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,710
from you line those are probably not

750
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:14,538
approved by the EPA you need a 15 mil or

751
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,190
thicker glove if you're going to be

752
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:17,750
mixing and applying pesticides the

753
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,480
gloves that we are probably using are

754
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,710
probably around 6 mils you guys the ones

755
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,630
you're getting from Harbor Freight that

756
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,600
you get from Uline or the gross store

757
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,460
those are 6 mil gloves you need 15 mil I

758
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,980
think they're millimeters 15 millimeters

759
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,288
thick to prevent from a pesticide

760
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,610
leaking through that glove that's

761
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:37,129
something that the Department of

762
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:38,778
Agriculture and the EPA recommend so to

763
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,340
get myself back on track read the bottle

764
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:42,019
when you peel back that little booklet

765
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:43,548
on the bottle it's gonna tell you what

766
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:45,288
personal protective equipment is

767
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:47,538
required to use that pesticide I

768
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:49,879
recommend you use all of the stuff it

769
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:53,028
recommends also it's going to have

770
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,770
what's called a re-entry interval it's

771
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:57,140
going to tell you how long after the

772
00:25:54,769 --> 00:26:00,349
application ends how long you need to

773
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,179
wait before somebody re-enters that room

774
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:03,589
and that's from the time you stop

775
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:04,970
spraying so if you're a spraying

776
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:06,859
spraying spraying when you stop now

777
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,269
that's when you can start the timer most

778
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:10,459
of the products that we are using

779
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:12,950
they usually have a four hour re-entry

780
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,120
interval which is not too long so you do

781
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,740
most of your work you turn off the

782
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:17,239
lights you spray the plants then you

783
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,038
gotta wait four hours before you can go

784
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,480
back in there and turn them on there is

785
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,890
stuff that you can do if you need to go

786
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,079
in there early you would do what's

787
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,520
called an early re-entry you're gonna

788
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,589
probably have to suit up you're gonna

789
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,148
need gloves if you're going to come in

790
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:30,589
contact with the plants you need all of

791
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:32,839
the proper personal protective equipment

792
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,668
you need to suit up and be safe in there

793
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:36,500
so that you don't come in contact with

794
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:37,700
these pesticides and end up spreading

795
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,109
them that's something we're gonna talk

796
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,808
about in the next

797
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:43,308
rant so also inside that little booklet

798
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,980
is going to have all the instructions of

799
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:47,690
what to do if you do mess up with this

800
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,829
pesticide if you spill it if you get

801
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,210
some in your eye if you get some in your

802
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:52,939
mouth or if you get some on your skin

803
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:55,579
all of what to do will be listed on the

804
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,500
booklet inside of there read that before

805
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:59,000
you use the pesticide why not why not

806
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,069
have some sort of idea what's gonna

807
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,599
happen if you do [ __ ] up I know

808
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:04,158
everybody thinks I'm not gonna get this

809
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,730
in my eye I'm not gonna get it in my

810
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,559
mouth

811
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,329

number in your phone but read that read

846
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,620
what could go on think about this you're

847
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,298
spring maybe you're just spring I keep

848
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:21,529
saying evergreen or maybe what I don't

849
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:23,269
know what you're gonna use in your your

850
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:25,339
grow I was talking about evergreen

851
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:27,048
recently so it's on my mind let's let's

852
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:29,209
see you're applying whatever pesticide

853
00:28:27,048 --> 00:28:30,889
you're applying with a sprayer and you

854
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,269
forgot to turn off a fan and you spray

855
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,590
it and it hits that fan and it just

856
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:35,058
blows right back into your eyeballs

857
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:36,769
because you're not wearing protective

858
00:28:35,058 --> 00:28:38,808
equipment for your eyeballs now you got

859
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:40,190
to figure out what to do no but now your

860
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:41,990
eyes are all [ __ ] up so now you can't

861
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,669
read that label you're by yourself what

862
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,048
are you gonna do you're gonna call one

863
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:47,000
of your friends you're gonna call 9-1-1

864
00:28:45,048 --> 00:28:48,500
are you gonna call poison control if you

865
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,298
were to read the label before you'd have

866
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,589
a little bit of an idea what to do the

867
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:53,029
proper thing would be to do would

868
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:55,819
probably be to start flushing your eyes

869
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:57,558
so everybody this may sound crazy I

870
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:59,839
highly recommend having some sort of an

871
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:01,819
eye wash or an eye flush in your grow

872
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,529
near your pesticides near something

873
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:04,548
don't put it near the pesticides scratch

874
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:05,990
that I said that because you don't want

875
00:29:04,548 --> 00:29:07,819
to [ __ ] up and go thinking that you're

876
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,620
pouring some rinse in your eye and end

877
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:10,909
up pouring more evergreen in there keep

878
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:12,619
in your back pocket keep it somewhere

879
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,308
safe you just need some water to rinse

880
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,959
your eyes out

881
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:16,879
that'd be a really good idea so be

882
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,298
prepared think about that [ __ ] accidents

883
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,530
do happen

884
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:20,180
read the labels of every

885
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:21,649
product you're using that may also

886
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,810
change your mind line if you want to use

887
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,280
it in your garden or not all right so

888
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:27,169
you've read the label you have properly

889
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,430
mixed your pesticide you wore the proper

890
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,890
protective equipment while you were

891
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,720
mixing it odd you've applied it properly

892
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,850
then you were awaiting the proper

893
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,079
reenter of all time before you go in

894
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:37,339
there and check on how everything went

895
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,960
you want to know if those plants got

896
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:40,490
fried or if you killed the bugs or if

897
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,600
they look better or you just want to go

898
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,309
in there and get back to work

899
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,629
you got to wait a little bit of time now

900
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:46,819
the thing to do after you have applied

901
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:48,260
these pesticides is to carefully take

902
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:51,019
off all of your personal protective

903
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:53,089
equipment and clean yourself if you're

904
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:54,799
wearing a respirator think about when

905
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:56,599
you grab that respirator to take it off

906
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,980
do you have pesticides on your hands or

907
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:59,689
gloves that you're gonna rub onto your

908
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,519
face that's gonna move up into your high

909
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,080
think about when you go scratching your

910
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,450
face or balls or wherever are you

911
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:07,669
spreading pesticide take your gloves off

912
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,019
take your suit off in a proper order to

913
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,250
where you're not spreading [ __ ] you want

914
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:11,690
to take off the gloves because it's all

915
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,099
over your hands then you want to grab

916
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,450
the respirator and take that off and

917
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:17,089
then you want to take off the clothing

918
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:19,460
and you want to clean your hands very

919
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:22,009
well before you eat drink smoke use gum

920
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,569
or tobacco or go to the bathroom because

921
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:24,680
let me explain why going to the bathroom

922
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:27,529
is a big deal ladies and gentlemen your

923
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,930
genitals your junk is the most absorbent

924
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:32,359
absorb of what the [ __ ] word I'm trying

925
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,860
to say anyway let me rephrase it so it

926
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,990
makes more sense your genitals will

927
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:37,849
absorb more pesticides than any other

928
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,069
part of the skin on your body it's a

929
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:42,079
little softer has more mucus membranes

930
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:43,309
more nerves more veins it'll suck up

931
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,659
more of the pesticides to wash your

932
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,440
hands before you grab your junk and go

933
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,850
to the bathroom

934
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,590
certainly wash your hands before you eat

935
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:51,109
or drinking anything and if you're gonna

936
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:52,039
smoke or chewed gum or tobacco certainly

937
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:53,779
wash your hands you don't want to get

938
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:55,039
those pesticides in your mouth or

939
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:55,490
anything you're eating drinking or

940
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,379
smoking

941
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,120
most of them taste like [ __ ] anyway but

942
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,590
they're toxic you don't want that so

943
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,299
think about it when you're unsuited

944
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:04,179
after you've sprayed do it in the proper

945
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:07,159
order so that you don't spread stuff

946
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,750
wash your hands thoroughly put all of

947
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,220
your dirty clothing all of your dirty

948
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,839
gear somewhere that it doesn't get

949
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,990
washed with your family's normal

950
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,339
clothing you don't want to wash your

951
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:19,130
whatever your spouse your boyfriend your

952
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:20,179
girlfriend your your mom your baby your

953
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,640
family you don't want to wash your

954
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,850
clothes that have pesticides in it with

955
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,290
their clothes so think about that wash

956
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:29,329
your clothes in the washer separately

957
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:30,470
then run it with hot water again or cool

958
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:31,429
water to rinse it if you don't want to

959
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,259
waste hot water

960
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:36,410
then wash everybody else's clothes after

961
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:37,730
that don't go washing straight one after

962
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,870
the other cuz that you just want to

963
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,029
clean it out that's what I'm saying

964
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:42,259
we're trying not to spread pesticide so

965
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:44,539
let's get to the part that I've labeled

966
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:47,109
pesticide spread in my little my little

967
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:50,389
note here on my iPad pesticide spread

968
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:52,699
think about this imagine if we put just

969
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,380
a little bit of dye inside of the

970
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,180
pesticide spray or whatever you use as a

971
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,800
pesticide sprayer imagine if I dropped

972
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,750
what's called tracer dye in there tracer

973
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:02,269
dye is clear it's invisible to the naked

974
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,920
eye but if I shine a a blacklight over

975
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:06,440
it it will show up it'll show up like

976
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,570
DNA on a blanket so we put some of this

977
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,680
tracer dye inside of the pesticide

978
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:11,689
sprayer and then you apply your

979
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,519
pesticides then go shine that light

980
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,080
everywhere it's gonna be on the plants

981
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,730
the pesticide is going to be on the

982
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,740
walls it's gonna be on the pots it's

983
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,019
gonna be on the floors it's also going

984
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,579
to be on your shoes your hands it's

985
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:25,279
gonna be on the fans it's gonna be

986
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:27,019
everywhere so that pesticide has now

987
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,369
gotten all over your grow room if you're

988
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:29,779
in an indoor environment it's on the

989
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:32,349
walls it's on the ceiling it's on the

990
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:34,730
light reflectors it is everywhere you

991
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:37,669
don't want to walk out of that grow in

992
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:40,130
those shoes and spread that pesticide

993
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:42,140
into your car and then put those

994
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:44,240
pesticides into your house cuz it's on

995
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,370
your shirt it's on your arms it's

996
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,440
everywhere you don't need to bring that

997
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:50,479
home to your pets to your family to your

998
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,250
children anybody that is sick that may

999
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,110
compromise their health so if you're

1000
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,000
going to apply pesticides please have a

1001
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:58,159
dedicated set of clothing or like I said

1002
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,420
earlier hopefully possibly a Tyvek suit

1003
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,830
they're not that expensive if you're

1004
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,320
growing cannabis you can probably afford

1005
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:05,480
a couple of tie back suits

1006
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:07,250
hopefully that fits in your budget but

1007
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,779
think about pesticides spread you don't

1008
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,579
want to bring pesticides home to your

1009
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:12,349
family and your pets so have a dedicated

1010
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:14,809
set of clothing also think about this

1011
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:16,399
you've applied pesticides now you go

1012
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:17,899
back in there and you work you were

1013
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,220
rubbing up against those plants that

1014
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,290
have been treated with a pesticide

1015
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,269
those walls have pesticides like I said

1016
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:25,549
everything in there is now a pesticide

1017
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:27,319
contamination zone you may want to wear

1018
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:29,119
long sleeves in your grow and you may

1019
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,649
want to take those clothes off before

1020
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,479
you go anywhere else you may want to

1021
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:34,490
shower before you go anywhere else

1022
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,690
just think about pesticide spread it's

1023
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,190
gonna make a lot of people paranoid

1024
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,380
because a lot of people have been

1025
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,610
spraying pesticide willy-nilly for the

1026
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,350
past hundred years and haven't been

1027
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:44,719
thinking about it it's time to think

1028
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:46,009
about it you guys we don't want to get

1029
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,930
sick we don't want to make other people

1030
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:49,670
sick and we want to be safe we want to

1031
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,049
keep the environment healthy it's all

1032
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,300
about good health we're drawing cannabis

1033
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:55,009
to save people's lives we don't want to

1034
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:57,529
make ourselves and other people sick in

1035
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:58,549
the process one more thing I want the

1036
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:00,289
thing I want to touch on while I'm

1037
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:01,369
talking about the tracer dye think about

1038
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:03,049
when you're washing your hands and

1039
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:04,879
cleaning up if you shine the light over

1040
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:06,649
the sink where you're cleaning up the

1041
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,329
knobs are probably going to show the

1042
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,769
tracer dye the sink where you're

1043
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:12,019
cleaning up is going to probably have

1044
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:14,599
tracer dye you're going to need to clean

1045
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:16,639
up the cleanup area as well and I also

1046
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,799
recommend cleaning up your respirator I

1047
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,389
would not recommend reusing the gloves

1048
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,550
those are a one-time use thing most of

1049
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:24,799
the time those 15 mil latex gloves or

1050
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,670
the nitrile or that butyl or whatever

1051
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,320
it's called I can't think of the word

1052
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,250
right now I think those are a one-time

1053
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,110
use you're gonna have to get rid of

1054
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,699
those and the reason is they don't want

1055
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,200
to turning inside out when you uh swap

1056
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:34,669
them out I learned so much at this

1057
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,589
pesticide class you guys that I just

1058
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,700
feel like I'm a pesticide nerd now but

1059
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,140
the reason they don't want to turning

1060
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:40,639
inside out when you take it off and on

1061
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,019
because then you're gonna get the

1062
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,599
pesticide right back on you and that's

1063
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:45,139
what we're trying to prevent so be very

1064
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,670
careful

1065
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,500
clean up your equipment clean up after

1066
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:51,460
yourself be safe with the pesticides

1067
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,750
here's a very useful hint that the the

1068
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,490
instructor of the class taught me she

1069
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,530
said if you spill something kitty litter

1070
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:59,089
is probably the easiest way to clean it

1071
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,880
up sprinkle some kitty litter on it the

1072
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:03,890
kitty litter will absorb the the liquid

1073
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,599
and then you can put that you're gonna

1074
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:07,129
have to dispose of it properly because

1075
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,809
it's a pesticide it's going to have to

1076
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,349
go into the hazardous waste container

1077
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:13,190
somehow you cannot pour it down a drain

1078
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:14,389
excuse me you cannot pour it down the

1079
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,210
drain you can't dump it in the backyard

1080
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:17,329
that needs to be disposed of properly

1081
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,760
well

1082
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:21,079
areas do like a disposal thing once a

1083
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,100
year they have like a big party at a

1084
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,840
park or something where you're allowed

1085
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:25,159
to come bring all your [ __ ] like that if

1086
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,660
you've got a small homegirl that's a

1087
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:28,129
great way to get rid of it if you've got

1088
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:30,559
a commercial girl you're going to have

1089
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,700
to pay for hazardous chemical removal so

1090
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:33,769
you can clean up [ __ ] with the kitty

1091
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:35,539
with a thing a kitty litter if you get a

1092
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:36,980
hole in a bottle you can drop a chunk of

1093
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:38,570
kitty litter in the bottle and it will

1094
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,429
expand in the hole it'll kind of cause a

1095
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,050
little temporary seal put a piece of

1096
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,519
duct tape on the outside you can

1097
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:45,500
probably make that bottle lasts a little

1098
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,460
bit longer when you are done with the

1099
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,960
pesticide bottle

1100
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,420
you're supposed to rinse it out three

1101
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,010
times so that it is clean once again

1102
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,659
they were never clear about where to

1103
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:56,270
rinse that because you can't pour that

1104
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:57,949
rinse down the drain I probably put into

1105
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:59,719
a sprayer and spray it onto some plants

1106
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:01,460
if necessary but you're supposed to

1107
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:02,869
rinse the bottle three times I think

1108
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,070
you're supposed to poke holes in it so

1109
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,599
that if somebody finds that container

1110
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,309
they don't try to drink out of it or use

1111
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,989
it as a vessel for a beverage or

1112
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:10,039
something but anyway that's a little

1113
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:12,349
that's a little excessive

1114
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:14,269
anyway tracer dye it'll teach you a lot

1115
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:15,500
let's talk about disposal of pesticides

1116
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:17,030
you guys when you were done spraying

1117
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,949
when you're done applying a pesticide

1118
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,720
you've got some leftover like I said

1119
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:22,699
earlier you were not supposed to dump

1120
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,739
that down the toilet down the drain it's

1121
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:27,019
not supposed to go in the dumpster that

1122
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:29,750
is now hazardous waste that needs to be

1123
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:31,099
disposed of properly please dispose of

1124
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,409
it properly the best thing you could

1125
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:35,599
probably do is learn exactly how much

1126
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:37,909
pesticide you need to mix up mix up that

1127
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,349
much and spray that much and don't have

1128
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:40,639
any left over I know that sounds like a

1129
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:42,559
challenge it's gonna take two or three

1130
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:45,440
maybe four or five tries before you get

1131
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,940
it right but please just learn how much

1132
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,369
you need makes up the proper amount

1133
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,869
apply it then if you need to just spray

1134
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:52,819
the rest of it on on the plants maybe

1135
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:54,170
it's a little excessive but or you can

1136
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,670
find another crop that it's acceptable

1137
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,010
to spray that on if you've got other

1138
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,599
plants outside you can spray those

1139
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,610
plants with that pesticide but don't go

1140
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,929
crazy just spray pesticides on random

1141
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:05,090
[ __ ] because you have it please that's

1142
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,799
excessive and ridiculous just be careful

1143
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,539
don't be wasteful with pesticides and

1144
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,340
learn how to mix up what you need and

1145
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:12,289
how to just properly dispose of what you

1146
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,030
don't need which is just waste so just

1147
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:15,289
learn how to mix it properly anyway when

1148
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,450
you work in a commercial girl like I do

1149
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:19,279
we've got at least 100 lights we're

1150
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:21,019
working on another facility with 400

1151
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,180
lights they are next door to each other

1152
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:25,969
so it'll basically be me running a 500

1153
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:27,739
light project we are very careful when

1154
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:29,449
we mix up pesticides we're learning how

1155
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:30,739
much each room needs if we're going to

1156
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:32,358
apply something

1157
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:34,159
we're learning how much water we need to

1158
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:35,449
water each room because if we mix up too

1159
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,000
much nutrients we have to get rid of

1160
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:40,549
that properly as well so think about

1161
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,469
that type of stuff the earth hopefully

1162
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,000
you never know what the way shits going

1163
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:46,338
but hopefully this earth is going to be

1164
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,809
here much longer than you or I and our

1165
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:49,519
children and their children and their

1166
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:51,858
children hopefully this earth sticks

1167
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,139
around do your part to make it pretty

1168
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:55,190
for your grandchildren's grandchildren

1169
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:57,319
you know what I'm saying don't be a

1170
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,000
selfish [ __ ] with your pesticides and

1171
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,980
your nutrients or whatever you're doing

1172
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,559
try to keep it clean for our kids cuz

1173
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,969
they need somewhere to be also damn I've

1174
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:06,320
been ranting for a long time you guys I

1175
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:07,309
appreciate you for listening to me I

1176
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,140
hope you're learning something about

1177
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:10,909
pesticides because it is a very serious

1178
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:13,549
issue that's very overlooked and

1179
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:14,838
commercial grows in my opinion I feel

1180
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:17,240
like everybody that was in the class

1181
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:19,130
there were 16 people in the class four

1182
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,750
or five of them were actually dispensary

1183
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,940
and grow owners the rest of them were

1184
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:24,800
grown man adjourn cultivation managers

1185
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,599
or somebody that was responsible for

1186
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,780
applying pesticides in a commercial grow

1187
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,550
it was all marijuana people a lot of the

1188
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,500
people everybody in the class seemed to

1189
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,330
have one of those oh my goodness moments

1190
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,519
where we all learn to something several

1191
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:39,348
of my questions were answered it was a

1192
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,400
great class so I hope you guys learned

1193
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:42,320
something from me also at the beginning

1194
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,930
of the show I did not mention that the

1195
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,150
event was also sponsored by the MiG the

1196
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:48,769
marijuana investors group is what I

1197
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,050
think that stands for I left them out

1198
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:52,849
when I described who hosted the class I

1199
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,710
apologized for that it was a great class

1200
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:57,440
I would recommend it if you work in a

1201
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:59,088
marijuana Enforcement Division regulated

1202
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,858
grow or if you work in any sort of

1203
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:03,380
agricultural place where there are

1204
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:05,779
pesticides applied I think you would

1205
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,910
learn a lot from taking this class it

1206
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,070
was only 65 dollars if you need a link

1207
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:11,420
let me know I can set you up with Thea

1208
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,980
the host of the class and she can let

1209
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,230
you know when there's time and room for

1210
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,789
you to get in it's well worth it it's

1211
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,980
this time it was at the cash register

1212
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:21,920
building in Denver the hardest part is

1213
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:24,619
finding somewhere to [ __ ] park if you

1214
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,970
work in a Colorado marijuana Enforcement

1215
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:27,500
Division regulated facility you were

1216
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:29,929
actually required to be worker

1217
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,880
protection safety trained it is your

1218
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:34,549
employer's responsibility if you touch

1219
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,380
plants you need to be worker trained if

1220
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,970
you apply pesticides you need to be

1221
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,390
handler trained is what I think it's

1222
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:40,879
called

1223
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:42,618
you need to have that done very soon

1224
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,150
before the Department of Ag comes in and

1225
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:46,068
does an inspection on your

1226
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,259
it would be a good idea if you have a

1227
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:49,998
girl in Colorado to call the Department

1228
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:52,759
of Ag and schedule what is called a

1229
00:39:49,998 --> 00:39:54,528
compliance check they'll come and make

1230
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:55,938
sure that you're compliant before they

1231
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:57,048
come in and bust you that way they can

1232
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:58,848
show you all the shoot you're doing

1233
00:39:57,048 --> 00:40:00,739
wrong and you can correct it they give

1234
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:01,999
you plenty of time the Department of Ag

1235
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:02,869
wants you to get it right they're on

1236
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:04,548
your side

1237
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:06,949
so I recommend all of that stuff

1238
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:09,438
honestly anybody that takes the class

1239
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:10,880
that I just spoke of is allowed to train

1240
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:12,949
people I've got all of the training

1241
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,869
materials right here next to me I've got

1242
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:16,639
two videos they're on a thumb drive and

1243
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:18,739
also I've got two giant books one from

1244
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,688
the Environmental Protection Agency and

1245
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:21,978
one from the Colorado Department of Ag

1246
00:40:20,688 --> 00:40:23,989
sponsored by the Colorado State

1247
00:40:21,978 --> 00:40:26,748
University they're big thick giant books

1248
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:29,028
I am actually certified I am trainer

1249
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:31,578
certified I can train anybody in the

1250
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:34,130
state of Colorado for one year on how to

1251
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:35,539
be worker protection safe so if you need

1252
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,920
training let me know I'd be happy to

1253
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:38,660
come to your facility for a small fee

1254
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,249
and teach your employees on how to

1255
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:42,078
handle these pesticides safely

1256
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:44,118
