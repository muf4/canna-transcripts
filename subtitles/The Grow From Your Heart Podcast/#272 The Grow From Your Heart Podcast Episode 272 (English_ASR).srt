55
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:58,939
of the time by sharing what we've been

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,819
dabbing on I started dabbing this

57
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:03,859
episode on pura-vida high cannabinoid

58
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:06,859
full-spectrum extract with a little bit

59
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:08,569
of Clementine batter I couldn't get the

60
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,449
pura-vida to stick to the dabber so I

61
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:13,310
just put it enough of a Clementine

62
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:14,659
batter a good base a nice mortar yeah

63
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,099
it's stuck in there real well and I just

64
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:17,269
stick those little crystals into there

65
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,560
and then it gives me a nice little dab

66
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:20,269
of course I had some of the Clementine

67
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,939

00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:34,439
constraint before I go to another garden

166
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,969
that I could destroy someone who works

167
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,060
in the same commercial facility as you

168
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,250
do I appreciate you waiting yes tonight

169
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,319
may be the night that the pollen gets

170
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,000
chucked I've got two clothes of the same

171
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,729
male they're dropping pollen really

172
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,709
heavily and there's uh I'm excited about

173
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:51,000
the Durbin poison and star dog to tell

174
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:53,008
you the truth they're gonna come for tea

175
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,449
Durbin Kraus that's gonna be really neat

176
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,129
I don't have any idea of what its gonna

177
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,718
be called I have ideas of what I think

178
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:59,430
it's gonna smell like I know what some

179
00:05:57,718 --> 00:06:01,829
of the phenotypes I'm hoping for gonna

180
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,629
smell like I'm hoping to bring back some

181
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:06,240
of that old landrace Durbin with some of

182
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,639
those giant colas but I don't want [ __ ]

183
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,110
that takes like 14 weeks to finish so

184
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,949
I'm hoping I've got some like ten week

185
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:16,620
donkey dick and it's licorice scented

186
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,990
trichome laden funk going on out of that

187
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,090
crosses my goal with any look it'll

188
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,468
happen it will happen there's a couple

189
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,000
of things I already know I'm really

190
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:24,750
looking forward to about next year and

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,089
that's on the list

192
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,978
ah there's star dog in there and start

193
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:32,068
August a great commercial grower she

194
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:34,288
grows big fat dense colas she smells

195
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,240
really well but there's something

196
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:38,668
missing from the high and I think

197
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,129
putting that a rise resin on it will fix

198
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:44,278
that I'm looking forward to trying it

199
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,590
it's gonna be a fun next year and then

200
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,329
something that smells really amazing in

201
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:52,109
that room the smell is overwhelming the

202
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:54,028
room right now is a platinum tangi she's

203
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,889
got a phone that'll fill up the whole

204
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:57,120
building smells so good in that room

205
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,348
just because of the platinum tangi

206
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,000
there's a cactus cooler and they're also

207
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:01,468
which usually stinks up the room but

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,899
right now it's the Platinum tangi doing

209
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:07,139
it yep Tim G's just I mean just that

210
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:10,239
citrus kind of it's almost like a citrus

211
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,038
and a body order functions for days

212
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm thinking about that is why I paused

213
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:17,949
I was a citrus and body odor that's it's

214
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,538
uh I've called it when the extract when

215
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:23,110
you smoke

216
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:24,639
tangey dabs or even Clementine dabs too

217
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,110
hot I think it tastes like orange

218
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,538
chicken or garlic chicken

219
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,639
it smells like to me like garlic like

220
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:31,959
tofu garlic orange tofu but it would be

221
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,689
orange chicken from back in the dam and

222
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:36,638
had chicken and [ __ ] years but it

223
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:39,910
smells like orange chicken or garlic you

224
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:44,889
remember orange chicken from 1997 yes

225
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:47,110
circa circa 97 yes but yeah so pollen

podcast if I were to listen to another

00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:11,948
podcast frequently and the reason that I

298
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:14,620
don't is because I don't want to

299
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:17,049
contaminate my myself I don't want to

300
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,149
recite somebody else's podcast voice or

301
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:21,578
style or whatever I don't want to do it

302
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,139
on accident I catch myself turning into

303
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,528
Joe Rogan occasionally when I go on a

304
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:25,750

305
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:27,610

307
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,990
some a lot of people our age rant like

308
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,480

the show that he learned why I can't

311
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:39,219

312
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:41,169
it was [ __ ] hilarious

313
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,600
that was when I was kind of new at

314
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:45,309
smoking pot at home like I still lived

315
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,778
with my mom at the time and my parents

316
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:48,518
and [ __ ] I was young but I would smoke

317
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,720
pot at home and she knew but she

318
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,278
wouldn't say [ __ ] so when Dennis

319
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,120
Miller's comedy show I still I wish I

320
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,708
could think of the name of it

321
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,799
when Dennis Miller's comedy show came on

322
00:10:53,708 --> 00:11:01,000
on HBO it was like 99% sure it was no

323
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:03,039
cure for cancer yeah it was like a

324
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,448
sketch show weekly but every time that

325
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,778
would come on I remember I would pack up

326
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:09,490
the bomb [ __ ] edge of the bed and hit

327
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:11,289
the bong and get all stone and laugh my

328
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,870
ass off to that Dennis Miller [ __ ]

329
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:15,578
show it was hilarious

330
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,860
but so and then I also I catch myself

331
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:20,409
doing Rogan and Dennis Miller and a lot

332
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:24,850
of times Joey I catch myself doing Joey

333
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:26,980
Diaz sometimes when when you're going on

334
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,290
a write specially on a good solo show

335
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,659
and you're fairly baked yeah Joey pop

336
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:34,599
out occasionally yeah but sometimes less

337
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:36,818
than intentionally I've heard so much

338
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,019
Joe Rogan and Joey Diaz

339
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:41,198
said I don't want to do that I don't

340
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:44,168
want to turn into Danny Danko or Adam

341
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:46,118
Dunn or even more specifically Scottie

342
00:11:44,168 --> 00:11:47,078
real and the dude right ah because

343
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,579
that's who I'm talking about Scottie

344
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:51,128
ruined the dude hosts a show called the

345
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:52,178
dude gross show and they gave us a

346
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:54,038
shout-out they gave me a shout-out

347
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,928
technically but they kind of shared it

348
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:57,759
with white Mike every episode the dude

349
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:59,139
gross show does a segment called the

350
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,229
executive producer and they pick

351
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:04,028
somebody who has inspired them or done

352
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:05,350
something that they feel it's basically

353
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:06,818
how I give everyone a shout-out at the

354
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,288
end of the show they do it at the start

355
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:10,058
of the show they say executive producer

356
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:11,438
this episode and a few days ago they

357
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:14,139
said Rasta Jeff and they gave me a nice

358
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:15,399
shadows and then they mentioned that I

359
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:18,698
do the show by myself

360
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,009
and a lot of that a lot of the times I

361
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:22,719
do probably 70% of these podcasts by

362
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:23,979
myself but then they mentioned white

363
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,389
Mike comes and joins him and he has a

364
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:26,889
lot of cool people on there with him

365
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:31,479
also so they specifically said white

366
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:35,350
Mike I might I'm I'm you how do I even

367
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:37,929
say this I'm my least favorite guest

368
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,668
that you have on I think I like the

369
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:41,978
shows where everybody else is on way

370
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:43,538

371
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:45,579

373
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:54,788
interesting I feel the same about you

374
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:56,618

376

377
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,178

00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:52,909
right just gave me a shitty flashback I

487
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:55,879
think I just gave everyone that's why

488
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:57,199
it's not cool to do that I heard this

489
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,610
gurgling noise then I looked in my

490
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,720
rearview mirror and I wish I hadn't

491
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,730
looked in the mirror because I just

492
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,440
watched vomit flat of both nose holes

493
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,779
and the mouth all into the backseat of

494
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,160
my car and I was like oh that's why you

495
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:10,490
don't give a drunk people a ride home

496
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,709
yep yep oops all right so I did find the

497
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,269
message here ah no that's not the

498
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,699
correct message I lied I gotta keep

499
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:18,230
going there's a screenshot and it's just

500
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:23,690
not a screenshot of the correct message

501
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:26,920
here I think this is it alright this was

502
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:29,330
so it says question for the community

503
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,410
and then I'm gonna kind of a detects I

504
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:32,689
don't know where the original message

505
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,910
came from somebody took a screenshot of

506
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,830
this and then sent this to me and said

507
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,570
what's your opinion so it says question

508
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:40,699
for the community first I like to say I

509
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:42,559
already know what I'm going to do in

510
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,289
regards to this however I'm curious to

511
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,899
see if there is one sentiment over the

512
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:49,730
other then it says scenario grower gets

513
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,100
seeds from a breeder and/or a seed bank

514
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,079
finds a rare cut or a select fee know

515
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:55,519
what getting a cut back to the breeder

516
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,589
be the right thing to do

517
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,139
to be clear nobody has asked for it or

518
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:01,849
has suggested doing so the cut isn't

519
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,040
necessarily for breeding but more as a

520
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:06,679
gesture or would you just keep it and

521
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:10,190
sit on it for your own enjoyment and

522
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,900
then this guy also kind of asked me how

523
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:15,830
do you feel about people breeding with

524
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:18,890
your seeds once you sell them seeds so

525
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:21,220
the first part is to be more clear about

526
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:24,020
the question if somebody were to go

527
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,250
obtain I region that exceeds however you

528
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,629
get them if you get them from me if you

529
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,849
get them from the hella dank seed bank

530
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,500
if they fell out of the sky however you

531
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:32,179
ended up with them if you were to grow

532
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,700
them and you were to find something

533
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:39,560
stellar are you supposed to get me a

534
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:41,539
clone of that I don't expect [ __ ] but it

535
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,490
would be cool if you live near me I

536
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:46,609
think if you expect it you're a

537
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,190
douchebag but if you offer it like it's

538
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:50,899
definitely not expected but it's it's

539
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,170
cool and sometimes it's probably not

540
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,600
wanted like if you got one like our

541
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,870
friends at organic I haven't arised the

542
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:01,279
tested at 35 percent cool I'd love a

543
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:04,039
clone of that but if I don't get one

544
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,779
that's fine with me because there's the

545
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:07,759
same level if I told you I had a fire

546
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:10,579
arise you know and did you want to cut

547
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:13,430
you probably say no come over and check

548
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:14,990
it out before yeah yeah I'd go look at

549
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,640
yours like I'd go take pictures of it

550
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,519
I'm thinking of all the people used to

551
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,410
bring those half-dead clones in to -

552
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,150
madam are back in the day that's wrong

553
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,620
with my plants yo and I look at it and

554
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,360
be like yo that's cotton balls

555
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:30,500
oh no that's spider mite webbing yeah

556
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:33,799
yeah well mites my take on it is I sold

557
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,539
that seed like that seed went like if it

558
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,950
went to a distributor he paid me for it

559
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:38,750
and then you paid him for it now

560
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,930
passed its left me twice it's yours

561
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,240
right I don't expect anything in return

562
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:47,150
when you go to only very recently was

563
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,890
this even possible right when you go to

564
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,060
the grocery store wherever your local

565
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,590
store is and you buy all your

566
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,700
ingredients to make [ __ ] what are you

567
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:54,500
gonna make tonight for dinners and

568
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,210
pizzas or whatever and then you go home

569
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
and you make your pizza and you bake it

570
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,180
you don't drive back to the store and

571
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,619
offer everyone at the store hey I got

572
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,630
this [ __ ] here here's a slice of the

573
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:05,750
pizza I made yeah but if I give you some

574
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,100
like chickens and then you raise them up

575
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,140
like you might bring me some chicken

576
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:11,269
yeah might bring it depends on the water

577
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,840
though yeah well I don't expect anything

578
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:14,660
in return

579
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:19,549
I know another part of this is a breeder

580
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:21,410
has probably grown that strain enough to

581
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:23,450
have found that phenotype that you've

582
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,580
got it's gonna be very unlikely but you

583
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,500
find something if you've got it odds are

584
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:29,480
they've seen it yeah yeah and we've

585
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,849
probably got a we've got the fire

586
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,920
phenotype it is a really cool gesture if

587
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:35,209
you live near the breeder like our

588
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,430
friends and organic ax are in

589
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,980
Albuquerque maybe if they are coming

590
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,570
this way and there's they have to have a

591
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,950
medical marijuana patient oh no because

592
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:45,230
we're legit here so they'd have to have

593
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,180
a caller New Mexico medical marijuana

594
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,190
patient in the car and then the commit

595
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,039
is different federal crime lab your

596
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,509
dress yeah but there's no feds sitting

597
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:54,200
on the line between New Mexico and

598
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:55,970
Colorado

599
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,769
what if there's that line what if the

600
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,329
wine is as thick of it as the tip of

601
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:01,339
this pin and they set the seeds right on

602
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:04,189
the tip of this pin to where it's half

603
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:06,049
on Colorado half on New Mexico and Rob's

604
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,940
it but when guy picks it up cops aren't

605
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:08,839
meant to debate technicalities with you

606
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,700
they're meant to hit you with the

607
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,339
nightstick until you strap resist and

608
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,200
ruin your life however if you wanted to

609
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,269
bring me the con wherever you could do

610
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,980
it you could I be I'd be happy with that

611
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:20,720
but it's not required once I have once

612
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,390
that seed has been given out that is

613
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,339
your seed unless the offers yes it was a

614
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,950
tester and there was an agreement if

615
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:29,869
it's a purchased seed from a vendor that

616
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,990
makes it seem like it's not though like

617
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:35,329
that specifically no I'm pretty sure

618
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,630
that this message says purchased yep so

619
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:40,429
that that's my take on like yeah do

620
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,980
whatever you want with that clone like

621
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,480
you've got seeds and seeds are going

622
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,610
everywhere and then clones are gonna be

623
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,900
made of clones and whatever you if

624
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,519
you've got a cool phenotype do it every

625
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,580
wall with it it'd be cool if you got it

626
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,028
back on

627
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:55,408
if maybe if you're in my area and you've

628
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:57,119
got the one that won the Cup or

629
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:58,620
something maybe hooked me up so that I

630
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,109
could read back to it or something you

631
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:02,908
know but I'm probably thinking this way

632
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:06,359
because I was listening to the dude

633
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:08,340
gross show earlier in the dude gross

634
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,219
show and this came up specifically with

635
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,839
a different they were talking about

636
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,710
hydro stores in the mid 90s and early

637
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:19,500
thousands but I feel like so I'm

638
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,269
somebody like some cool and some random

639
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,679
person hits me up on Instagram there's

640
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:26,819
like hey I bought a pack of your seeds

641
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:28,440
on wwe.com and I was wondering if you

642
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:32,788
would like me to mail you a clone I'd be

643
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,919
like nope it's not entrapment right that

644
00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:39,509
would be my first response but now we're

645
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:42,299
in Colorado and if someone you knew

646
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:45,329
chatot or Michigan definitely all seven

647
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:47,308
of them but the further you're separated

648
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:49,470
I feel like the creepier that offer gets

649
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:51,658
yeah they're scarier maybe the better

650
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,129
right but I put myself out there so if

651
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,259
somebody's like Rasta Jeff I've got your

652
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:56,788
clone like it seems it's just I'm

653
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,110
putting myself out there so much for

654
00:22:56,788 --> 00:23:00,179
people to interact with me that it

655
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:02,250
doesn't feel creepy but yeah and still

656
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,769
if you're not in Colorado I'm yeah

657
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,450
that's why I changed that's why I

658
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,859
changed it to scary immediately because

659
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,639
creepy is definitely not the right word

660
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:13,648
but yeah the Capleton clone that I run I

661
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:15,658
did not Fino hunt that that came from a

662
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:17,128
pack of seeds that I sold to somebody so

663
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,320
I can't leave this has happened to

664
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:21,388
somebody brought me Ralph's roster ruff

665
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,579
brought me back a clone of blue heeler

666
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:24,839
so it does happen because he felt like

667
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:26,339
he's like this is a good one you want

668
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,298
this and he brought me a clone of it and

669
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,619
you know what happened when he did I

670
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:30,408
gave him seeds and returned for that

671
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:33,599
clone again right so he got more seeds

672
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:36,320
well I know people that have suffered

673
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,658
some sort of tragedy in their garden or

674
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:42,210
accidentally lost a whole Fino due to

675
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,129
one thing or another cats seem to be

676
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,538
particularly destructive why are you why

677
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,189
are your cats near your [ __ ] grow

678
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:50,009
room what the [ __ ] people doing sorry

679
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,210
[ __ ] up and don't take your dog to

680
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:53,099
your commercial grow either you're

681
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,298
working on an IPM program in there your

682
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,859
sprint shooting though you're releasing

683
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:56,788
bugs in and then you bring your dog in

684
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:00,069
there stop it

685
00:23:56,788 --> 00:24:02,960
viola thank you through yeah

686
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:05,000
it's via the side beat of this question

687
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,860
was how I feel about people breeding

688
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,140
with my seeds yeah go for it knew that

689
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:13,909
would the only thing I all the same

690
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,290
reasons we just listed for the first

691
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,080
half of the question yeah but the only

692
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:19,700
thing I want though is credit when you

693
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,250
if you release that when you post a

694
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,980
picture of it put the name of the parent

695
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,900
strain on their doing yeah be honest

696
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,140
about it don't lie just put that it was

697
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:33,290
a rise or Capleton or whatever you used

698
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,890
put that on their list it yep that's all

699
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:36,470
I ask

700
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,730
and honestly I got seeds from somebody

701
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,529
to breed with you don't know me at night

702
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,730
that's how I started my didn't just

703
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:43,009
invent plants

704
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,390
I got seeds and clones and use other

705
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:45,559
people's seeds and clones for breeding

706
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,450
that's how it starts you have to do

707
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,690
something it would be cool if you're

708
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:53,990
going to make seeds commercially make

709
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:57,680
your own parents like don't just go take

710
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:59,960
and just buy an established five pack in

711
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,610
column yeah yeah I know I've done it of

712
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,200
course I did it with Daybreaker I got a

713
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:04,429
[ __ ] pack of Daybreaker from gage

714
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,200
green and there was a mail and there I

715
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,830
was like god damn he's got to be used

716
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,779
for breeding

717
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:10,909
so I dusted a bunch of [ __ ] with him and

718
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:12,500
made a bunch of stuff but then I used my

719
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,970
favorite mail out of that breeding

720
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,650
project from the golden goat to

721
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,720
Daybreaker which became a rise and

722
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,490
that's my new mail so I've done some

723
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,049
work with the mail I'm using as my main

724
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,329
stud for my breeding now I didn't just

725
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:25,549
go pull one from somebody else's but

726
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:26,929
I've used four or five different mails

727
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:30,740
throughout different breeding projects

728
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:32,630
lately so I am using other people [ __ ]

729
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,480
like you have to use other people and if

730
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,950
you don't use this breeding forever like

731
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,559
at this point there's no reason to

732
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,150
reinvent the wheel like use what's

733
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,309
available to you and that's what's on

734
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,870
the market there's yeah there's a lot of

735
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:46,460
stuff you can do with it and as long as

736
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:48,769
you're not being super shady with it

737
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,410
like I'm all for it I met DNA genetics

738
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:52,700
in a cannabis cup years ago I know it's

739
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,650
pretty cool because little Kevin was

740
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,759
wearing an IRA genetics t-shirt and he

741
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,800
was walking ahead of me and I was

742
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,210
walking with just a few other people in

743
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,759
the group being on the group staggers

744
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,930
but Kevin was up front and the DNA

745
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,309
genetics boys came around the corner

746
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,810
they go hey man we've seen your logo

747
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:06,799
around nice work and Kevin psych is

748
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:08,599
actually that guy and they came and

749
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,769
talked to me and I asked him straight up

750
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,480
I was like hey do I have permission to

751
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,490
breed and like commercially breed with

752
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,960
your stuff they're like

753
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,339
yeah just give us credit bro for

754
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,769
anything you use just give us credit

755
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:19,299
that's exactly how I feel like if you

756
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:22,029
make a package and you print something

757
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:24,159
on it it should say the true parents on

758
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:26,289
there I don't even have to put whatever

759
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,290
I rise from IRA genetics just put a rise

760
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:30,879
to my new thing then we're all happy

761
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:33,159
yeah you can't use my stuff for breeding

762
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,600
I used I've used some cool stuff for

763
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,820
I've used everybody's stuff for breeding

764
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:38,679
[ __ ] I've bred with everybody's projects

765
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:40,149
there's some DNA genetics in there

766
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,029
there's some ethos collective in my

767
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:45,269
breeding there's some cool stuff in my

768
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:49,109
brief I see Holly connection in there

769
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:52,240
there's a little bit everything in there

770
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:54,039
reserve a privada I hope that answers

771
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,960
the question we got a little rambling oh

772
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:57,940
I totally picture them known to happen

773
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,680
yeah it'd be cool if I got a clone not

774
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,680
required you're not a dick if you don't

775
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,720
like some people can't share they gotta

776
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,490
grow quietly just added sharing yeah

777
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,579
theirs they can't because they're in

778
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:11,620
Odessa Texas and they can't [ __ ]

779
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:16,710
right now they're on the far end from

780
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:21,669
those reasons there's different people

781
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:23,650
that are looking to patent cannabis

782
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,779
genetics you know in other breeding

783
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,610
other plants that's a thing yep like I

784
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:29,230
couldn't cross two different breeders

785
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:30,429
tomatoes together and then try to

786
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,890
commercially sell them they would say

787
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:34,480
[ __ ] no there's a couple of outfits that

788
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,920
are just waiting for federal

789
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,630
legalization where they can pounce on it

790
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,460
they're gonna have all their paperwork

791
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,200
ready to just mass submit yeah

792
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,400
unfortunately I don't have the funding

793
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,630
for that type of stuff

794
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,320
not yet not yet Mike was in on a talk

795
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:51,180
today

796
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,619
next year's gonna be fun people yes no

797
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,880
matter what happens even if what we

798
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:55,559
talked about today didn't pan out

799
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,910
i'ma have to switch from Mountain Dew to

800
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:00,000
energy drinks or something next year I

801
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,259
think that's what I'm thinking just

802
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,720
straight coffee and Red Bull

803
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:06,349
yeah cut the coffee with Red Bull just

804
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,210
just swish two straight pots of espresso

805
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:13,319
whoo it's gonna be a fun year next year

806
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,799
we're gonna go super fast oh man I can't

807
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:15,720
wait

808

920
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,910
[ __ ] so that I actually gave up

921

caffeine for Lent and I even went an

922
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:26,040
extra day cuz they were pretty adamant

923
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,519

924
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,230

948
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,959
employed in a different industry and

949
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:23,429
make that change for yourself man change

950

embrace it it's gonna destroy you like

952
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,740
I'm watching people trying to hold on to

953
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,890
the past all day watching

954
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:34,500
prohibitionists online and like it kills

955
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,150
them little by little day by day just

956
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,420
trying to hold on to the past ruins

957
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:41,759
their lives don't do it set some goals

958

961
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,089
that there's a lot of people who try to

962
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,500
lose weight after the holidays

963
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:51,689
take that [ __ ] scale throw in the

964
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,880
trash yeah like this is bad for your

965
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,500
mental health yeah it's a number who

966
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,110
cares like your hotness is not

967
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,140
determined by a random number

968
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:02,959
I've said that same sentence to somebody

969
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,850
I think no I it's where I spend a lot of

970
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,740
time online following prohibitionists

971
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:09,079
and you end up seeing their thoughts and

972
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,269
opinions on all sorts of [ __ ] I see a

973
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,500
lot of people that are like man I'm 134

974
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:14,960
but if I could be a hundred and

975
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,280
twenty-eight I'd be happy it's not if

976
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,289
you didn't know those numbers you'd be

977
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,630
happier at least I don't even know how

978
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:22,009

992
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,949

1025
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:09,250
line with numbers but that means I've

1026

allows me to give the podcast to

1153
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:28,389

all right Twitter verse if we were on if

1204
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,820
we had an NPR show what would we call it

1205
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:08,769
wouldn't be called the Griffin Heart

1206
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,809
podcast because NPR just wouldn't go for

1207
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:12,489
that it would be something that didn't

1208
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:13,570
sound anything like it was about weed he

1209
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,949
