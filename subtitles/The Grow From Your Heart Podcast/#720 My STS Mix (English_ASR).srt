friends to find the patreon page all

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,600
right i'm going to do a quick episode

48
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,599
about making your own silver thiosulfate

49
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,679
solution this is how we do make

50
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,280
feminized seeds i'm actually in the

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,040
middle of a workday i was doing work

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,560
putting stuff together i was like i need

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,959
to mix up that solution i should spray

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,800
these plants today today is the day and

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,878
then i thought to myself what kind of

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,120
podcaster would i be if i did not set up

57
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,519
some cameras throw up a microphone here

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,759
and get this episode recorded so we're

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,159
going to record myself making i'm going

60
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,239
to record myself making a silver

61
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,000
thiosulfate solution this will be used

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,560
to make the next batch of femme seeds

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,318
that come from irie genetics this is the

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,479
solution i am going to use you're going

65
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,199
to watch me make my actual solution

66
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,119
which i use for making feminized seeds

67
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,958
there are a lot of things we should talk

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
about before we show you how to make

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,479
this solution but i feel like i've

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,959
talked about those things many times

71
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,639
i've given many other podcast episodes

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,959
about the the precursors the

73
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,878
prerequisites to making your solution

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,239
and to selecting your plants briefly i

75
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,840
will say this

76
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
selection is very important when it

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,800
comes to making feminized plants you

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,959
want true

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,319
female plants if you're going to make a

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,479
feminized plant if you're going to

81
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,479
reverse a plant pick a plant that you

82
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,399
know is a true female we want a plant

83
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,000
that has been tested uh give it some

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,239
light stress give it feeding stress

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,239
maybe not all at once or do but let's

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,439
see if that plant shows you intersex

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,480
traits i do not and will not make

88
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,719
feminized plants feminized seeds from

89
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,679
any plants that ever show me any type of

90
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,719
intersex traits let's remove the word

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,640
intersex herm hermaphrodite especially

92
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,039
eliminate the word herme from our

93
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,878
vocabulary when it comes to talking

94
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,719
about femme seeds and femme seed

95
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,840
production there is no hermaphroditism

96
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,919
happening here there are no

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,319
hermaphroditic plants being used if

98
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,318
we're using silver in the correct manner

99
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,079
so now i can move forward let's stop

100
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
saying herm let's use the right words

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,120
that is not a hermaphrodite that's you

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,959
know i would throw hermaphrodite away so

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,640
that's not what we are doing now i can

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,438
talk about a few of the options when we

105
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,518
are making femme seeds uh there are self

106
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,959
plants there are reversed plants what we

107
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,640
are going to do what i am going to do is

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,959
i am going to make a solution of silver

109
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,279
thiosulfate also my chemistry nerd

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,280
friend says i say that incorrectly uh if

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,438

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,600
silver theo sulfate thiosulfate uh if

123
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,160
it's theothio either way it's gonna do

124

125
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,720
was i uh i'm going to mix up this

126
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,000
solution and i'm going to reverse one

127
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,000
plant i'm actually going to reverse

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,240
three different clones of the same plant

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,800
we're going to put that pollen on

130
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,280
multiple other females when i put that

131
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,639
pollen on a cut of the same plant i'm

132
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,719
going to reverse golden goat full

133
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,040
disclosure i'm going to reverse a golden

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,560
goat female three golden goat females to

135
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,319
make a lot of pollen

136
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,160
um i'm going to put that pollen on

137
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,360
another golden goat of course that will

138
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,759
make golden goat s1 self golden goats i

139
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,680
will also put that pollen on a platinum

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,840
tangy plant and a lemon skunk we will

141
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,600
then make orange gasm and lemon jeffrey

142
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,198
there may be other [ __ ] in the room

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
that we can't talk about they're going

144
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,199
to get pollinated as well but let's stay

145
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,279
focused here the other plants to get

146
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,080
pollinated that are not golden goat will

147
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,319
be what are known as reversals r1s and

148
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,159
s1's we're going to self a plant use its

149
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,759
own pollen then we're going to self that

150
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,919
plant put it on other plants that is a

151
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,600
reversal i've done full episodes on that

152
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,599
wanted to give a little a little

153
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,919
background a little prerequisite now

154
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,400
let's talk more about making this

155
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,918
solution we're going to be working with

156
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,519
chemicals i've got these chemicals here

157
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,359
in my face let me move the ipad a little

158
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,120
bit over i had that mainly for the shout

159
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,720
outs uh let me check the recording it

160
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
looks like things are going well should

161
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,759
be a good show it's weird with the new

162
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,038
mic placement uh and the ipad in the

163
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,960
wrong place i'm out of my comfort zone

164
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,120
we're gonna do the best we can with this

165
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,879
new setup where were we let's talk about

166
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,038
this stuff uh we're going to be using

167
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,319
chemicals i do have a

168
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,399
bottle of sodium theo or thiosulfate

169
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,080
sodium thiosulfate i'll show that to the

170
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,758
camera i will zoom in on that maybe that

171
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,680
camera's better i'll get the best angle

172
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,199
for the show i promise you and

173
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,959
we'll fix it in post is what we're going

174
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,120
to say here i'll show you that

175
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,839
we've got this bottle here we've also

176
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,360
got this bottle of silver nitrate i'm

177
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,638
showing that to this camera i'm going to

178
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,240
hold it up here for a couple of seconds

179
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,680
let you take a look at it show it to

180
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
this camera we'll see which one gives us

181
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,439
the better view uh in post the cameras

182
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
are kind of far away we'll edit that to

183
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,199
be appropriate

184
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,519
these chemicals i do buy them from a

185
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,840
company called united nuclear on the

186
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,839
internet

187
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,079
is how i think i find them you can find

188
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,799
them they're very easy to find i buy the

189
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,439
two ounces of sodium thiosulfate and the

190
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,520
10 grams of silver nitrate uh they're

191
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,199
very affordable one is almost still full

192
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,560
this one's almost empty there's another

193
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,160
bottle inside there's why it rattles

194
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,800
they give you the double seal

195
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,800
um very cost effective very affordable

196
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
these are very cheap products however

197
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,520
they could be

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,519
caustic they could be dangerous they've

199
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,959
got a bunch of notices written on the

200
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,879
sides of them you've got to be very

201
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,638
careful when you're using these products

202
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,719
something i highly recommend one thing

203
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,319
i'll start off with i like to dab a lot

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,599
i like to smoke a lot if you're not a if

205
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,199
you're not a safe person if you're not

206
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,360
comfortable doing [ __ ] blaze don't do

207
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
this when you're high maybe get a clear

208
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,520
head maybe wait till after you do this

209
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,120
to smoke maybe uh mix up your [ __ ] then

210
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,519
smoke and celebration that's something i

211
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,360
should mention i'm not your boss bro uh

212
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,799
my rule of thumb at work if i'm the boss

213
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,160
is if i can tell you're high you're too

214
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,319
high if i can't tell you're high do your

215
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,240
[ __ ] job and have a good time

216
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,759
that applies to you right now so don't

217
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
[ __ ] this up don't get these chemicals

218
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,639
don't inhale these chemicals don't

219
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,560
ingest these chemicals don't get them in

220
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,319
your eyes be very careful the first

221
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,000
thing i'm going to do to be a good

222
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,479
example to be a good leader i'm going to

223
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,720
put on my gloves you guys ready for your

224
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,758
exam i hope you're ready line up then

225
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,599
after that we're going to make some

226
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,720
solution here so i've got my gloves

227
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:49,839
coming on

228
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,440
oh i hate it when the hands are all

229
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,719
clammy and the gloves won't go on these

230
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,000
are the right size gloves and they fit

231
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,319
just right we're going to put on some

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,639
gloves normally when i'm doing this i

233
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,680
would wear a mask i'm going to do things

234
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,759
differently

235
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,439
i already poured the chemicals i already

236
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,038
weighed them uh there i've got them

237
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,399
stored right here next to me so that i

238
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,318
don't have to waste time doing that on

239
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,878
camera also i would normally wear a mask

240
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,400
to do that however i'm asking a podcast

241
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,000
and a camera and a microphone seemed

242
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,598
stupid to me i don't want to do that

243
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,120
honestly the mask seems silly to me at

244
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:17,918
this point but this is not a political

245
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,240
show

246
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,839
um i would get the gloves and the mask i

247
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,120
would also tie up the dreadlocks but the

248
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,478
way that i had them tied with the big

249
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
hat it didn't work with the headphones

250
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,199
we're adjusting um do as i say not as i

251
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,719
do protect yourself take care of

252
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,158
yourself eyewear may be a good idea if

253
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,479
you're a clumsy [ __ ] but that's not

254
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,038
necessary in my opinion right here it's

255
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,800
a powdered chemical however again if

256
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,319
you're a clumsy [ __ ] at that eyewear

257
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,038
it's dangerous you could get [ __ ] in

258
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,120
your eyes maybe eyewear um rasta jeff

259
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,958
says wear eye protection just because

260
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,799
legally i don't want to get in trouble

261
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,000
bro wear your eyewear dude wear your

262
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,000
gloves where your mask type your

263
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,519
dreadlocks type your hair type your

264
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,360
loose sleeves if you got wobbly sleeves

265
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,039
now's a uh if you get the wizard sleeve

266
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,839
now's the time to get to get the wizard

267
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:02,240
sleeve tied up sorry about that um where

268
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,440
are we type your dreads also work in an

269
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,120
area where

270
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,880
um if you spill some [ __ ] it's gonna be

271
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,959
safe make sure you've got your ipad your

272
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,480
recording equipment your power supply

273
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,000
make sure all that [ __ ] has scale make

274
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,600
sure that's all on the same table don't

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,159
really do that i'm doing that for a

276
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,278
video like i said before do as i say not

277
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,120
as i do

278
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,639
um the podcast area will be perfect make

279
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,639
sure you get a lot of electronic [ __ ] is

280
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,639
what i wrote also i may recommend have

281
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,879
some paper towels or a rag or something

282
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,278
available uh we're gonna have some water

283
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,159
pouring here things could go awry like i

284
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,000
keep saying i'm i'm not a jedi i'm not a

285
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,278
ninja i'm not perfect also not a clumsy

286
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,759
[ __ ] i'm somewhere right in the middle

287
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,519
of that so i do need a rag occasionally

288
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,439
gonna have to clean some [ __ ] up now

289
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,919
let's get down to business let's talk

290
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
about mixing this solution what do i

291
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,199
have in front of me we talked about the

292
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
uh the two products the silver and the

293
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
sodium i've got a scale

294
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,439
because i'm going to weigh these two

295
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,360
products in a very specific amount i

296
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
need a half a gram of one and two and a

297
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,519
half grams of another then i'm going to

298
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,200
put those into

299
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,639
500 milliliters of distilled water i've

300
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,920
got distilled water i've got a gallon

301
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,199
jug of distilled water over here i'll

302
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,879
hold that up for the camera i can't find

303
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,120
the handle of the bottle there we go i

304
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,519
got a gallon jug just distilled water

305
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,839
plain distilled water i buy i try not to

306
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,200
let it sit around too long i get a fresh

307
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,519
one most of the time when i'm making the

308
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,600
solution so we've got a gallon of

309
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,440
distilled water over here

310
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,320
i've poured that into two

311
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,600
500 milliliter measuring glasses i'm

312
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,000
just going to slide these closer to the

313
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,759
camera view they're both filled with 500

314
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
milliliters of water uh it's the

315
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,879
distilled water hold that up for the

316
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,039
camera here there you go right up to the

317
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,200
500 mil mark so i have a liter of water

318
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,958
here essentially divided evenly i've got

319
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
my two powders the way i would do this

320
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,000
and like i said i skipped a step because

321
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,519
of the camera because of the mask

322
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,278
because the technology into speed shut

323
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,639
up probably talked right my way through

324
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,799
speed and [ __ ] up but what we're gonna

325
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,799
do we're going to i used a piece of

326
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,399
paper i just took a piece of paper and i

327
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,399
folded it in half to make it easier to

328
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,839
handle uh sometimes if you don't fold

329
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,559
the paper it arches the other way and

330
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,800
you lose your solution so i simply

331
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,679
took a piece of paper folded it in half

332
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,759
i set that piece of paper on the scale

333
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,639
then i hit tear now my scale is at zero

334
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,958
at this point i sprinkled the product on

335
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,958
there until i reached the desired amount

336
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,359
in this case i was using the silver

337
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,439
nitrate and this is where the recipe

338
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,959
comes in pay attention we've got 500

339
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,200
milliliters of water and i used one half

340
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,479
of a gram of silver nitrate okay we're

341
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,160
going to just set the silver nitrate

342
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,079
right in front of here that is the

343
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,679
silver nitrate container but i'm going

344
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,120
to do it this time so i've weighed it

345
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,399
right i've waited out sprinkle sprinkle

346
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,759
you saw me do it i got a half a gram

347
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,120
right here you trust me do you want to

348
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,360
see the scale or do you trust my weight

349
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,679
bro promise you i tore it i teared the

350
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,600
scale what's the word i tore i teared

351
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,039
prefixed the scale

352
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,278
i don't know the word

353
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,838
someone will tell me um so right here i

354
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,278
do have half of a gram of silver nitrate

355
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,639
i don't know if it'll come up on camera

356
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,039
i'm not gonna [ __ ] finagle it and

357
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,720
spill it uh it's not expensive but it's

358
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,240
it's right here i need it so i'm gonna

359
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
dump that right into the water i'm gonna

360
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
tap my paper just get that all into the

361
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,639
water it's in there

362
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,679
uh there is a an imaginary trash can

363
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,720
right over there i know i've got some

364
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,159
[ __ ] over there to clean up so we're

365
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,920
just gonna put that over there here i'm

366
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,958
going to use a very technical piece of

367
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,319
equipment this um we call a butter knife

368
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,239
i like this because it's metal nothing

369
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,839
sticks to it it's easy to clean up i'm

370
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,600
going to put that in here i'm going to

371
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,360
stir my [ __ ] gently i almost went too

372
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,200
hard just want this to dissolve it

373
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,879
should dissolve pretty quickly the

374
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,079
product was chunky so it may take a

375
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,000
couple of seconds you got a couple of

376
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,599
fat rocks in there that need to dissolve

377
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,600
it's going it's almost dissolved

378
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,000
completely i can see by looking through

379
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,159
the glass here it's gone it's basically

380
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,519
dissolved in there so that part is taken

381
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,958
care of i'm gonna set that there for a

382
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,039
moment get myself a paper towel

383
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,399
and then i'm just going to fold it up

384
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,559
nice and scientifically and then we're

385
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,919
just going to clean this off

386
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,518
all right the first part has been

387
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,719
handled we've done the first part just

388
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,000
leave that there just because it's safe

389
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,680
there i know where it is it's not

390
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
[ __ ] anything up so

391
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,120
the next step excuse me for the throat

392
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,879
clearing we already did this disclaimer

393
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,799
next step we're going to basically

394
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:05,439
repeat the process with the sodium

395
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:07,039
thiosulfate for this product we need 2.5

396
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,720
grams so i'm going to set that right in

397
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,159
front of here i'm not sure how much of

398
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,720
that's coming up on camera it's far away

399
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,799
for me to see i did already pre-weigh it

400
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,959
but just for science purposes and video

401
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,519
purposes i'll set it right there uh

402
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,559
actually i'll take it off i will refresh

403
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,879
the scale

404
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,479
it's refreshing it's going to zero

405
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,919
all right it's at zero

406
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,639
it's taking a minute there we go i got

407
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,599
shy on camera it's at zero we'll set it

408
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,360
on here

409
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,040
hypothetically i would tear it right now

410
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
right i hit the tare button

411
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,000
because i put the paper on there now i

412
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,000
would sprinkle my product onto there

413
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,399
until it says 2.5 grams i've already

414
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,720
done that so i know it's 2.5 what i can

415
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,799
do now pick up my product this is

416
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,480
container b sprinkle it right into

417
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,559
container b this one slid right off the

418
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,480
paper real well just for fun i'm gonna

419
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,638
set that on there it shows me that is

420
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,320
negative 2.5 so i know i started at the

421
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,399
right point i know that that's the right

422
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,240
amount i'm going to fold this up toss it

423
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,679
into the imaginary trash can

424
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,799
brush this off of the table here we

425
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,479
should probably clean up a little better

426
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,519
if you're doing this at home clean up a

427
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,680
little better don't leave [ __ ] on your

428
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,519
table especially especially if it's like

429
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,919
the family table where a pet a friend a

430
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,120
child could be clean the [ __ ] up also

431
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,120
here's another point that i kind of

432
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,159
maybe skipped clean your [ __ ] before we

433
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,959
start

434
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,039
ah i cleaned this bottle this bottle or

435
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,638
this cup a measuring cup yeah it's a cup

436
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,879
i cleaned the measuring cup i cleaned my

437
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,198
next jar i cleaned everything with rub i

438
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,039
cleaned it real well with alcohol let it

439
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,278
water let it sit dry then i cleaned it

440
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,120
with alcohol let it sit and dry again i

441
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,639
did that about an hour ago then i set up

442
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,720
the equipment i cleaned off my scale

443
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,959
real good everything is clean my spray

444
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,800
bottle is clean my environment's clean

445
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,000
everything will be just as clean when i

446
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,319
leave that's something important to

447
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,399
think about at this point i should be

448
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,920
stirring this product into here this one

449
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,278
won't take very long to dissolve it's

450
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,399
pretty much uh

451
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:49,439
this one's a little thicker than the

452
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,799
other one it will take a minute it's

453
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,560
pretty much starting to dissolve already

454
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,078
i could see the the cloud at the bottom

455
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,919
is going away at this point we can

456
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,319
remove the scale from the equation we

457
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,159
don't need that i've got my paper towel

458
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,920
here in case i make a mess got more

459
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,838
trash let's just toss that to the other

460
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,679
hypothetical invisible trash can we're

461
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,519
going to keep stirring this

462
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,078
this will dissolve i may fast-forward

463
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,078
part of this

464
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,278
now once these dissolve we're going to

465
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,479
simply combine them i'm starting to see

466
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,399
that the little crystals at the bottom

467
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,639
are disappearing there's just a little

468
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,159
bit left to stir maybe a little vigorous

469
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,600
a little more vigor don't spill it i did

470
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,600
spill it fill it right up to the top

471
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,040
here but i needed the 500 mils and wait

472
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,399
till you see me fit it into the one

473
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,159
liter jar that's going to be the fun

474
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,440
part some of it will get spilled so

475
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,120
we're going to clean this off again we

476
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,480
don't need the knife we don't need the

477
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,600
scale we don't need my little wiper

478
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
towel so those are going to go over here

479
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,120
out of my way

480
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,958
make my ocd shine get all the used [ __ ]

481
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,120
that i don't need over there

482
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,799
now where are we we've mixed up our [ __ ]

483
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,240
once again if you're doing this at your

484
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,679
space and you're not recording and have

485
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,278
headphones on get your dreadlocks tied

486
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,439
up get your long hair out of the way

487
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,120
have your mask on at this point the mask

488
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,639
may not be necessary the dry powdered

489
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,399
chemicals are gone this is where you

490
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,399
want to think about your eye protection

491
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,839
always use the gloves these chemicals i

492
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,120
think they're slightly caustic they

493
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,120
could burn up your fingers burn up your

494
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,039
skin i don't want to risk it so we have

495
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,959
got the two things mixed together now

496
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,958
in science you always pour i wrote this

497
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,359
down because i always mix this part up

498
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,919
you always pour part a into part b when

499
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,360
you are mixing things uh this is part a

500
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,599
this is part b

501
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,039
so uh what i think we should do normally

502
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,560
honestly what i normally do is i pour

503
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,000
them in here together so i'm going to

504
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,518
move the ipad over just a little bit

505
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,639
because i am a catastrophe once in a

506
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,480
while i'm going to move the mic out of

507
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,320
the way i'm going to pour parts a and b

508
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,600
in here together kind of simultaneously

509
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,680
at the same time i feel like that mixes

510
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,360
them real well we'll see how they fit in

511
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,559
here and then once i've got that done

512
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,278
i'll bring the mic back and we'll

513
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,039
continue on with our normally scheduled

514
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,639
program just going to move those out of

515
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,980
the way move the mic over and we'll get

516
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:55,919
to action here we go

517
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:57,360
[Music]

518
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,639
all right through the magic of editing i

519
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,240
did speed that up a little bit so you

520
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,600
didn't have to watch me try to slowly

521
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,160
pour that in there and then dribble some

522
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,919
onto the table anyway here we go it ah

523
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,519
we got it mostly fit i've got equal

524
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,079
parts left over in both containers so my

525
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,279
ratios are still correct uh close enough

526
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,480
in my opinion that's going to be just

527
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,519
fine there's a little bit left in each

528
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,199
container i don't want to spill it i

529
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,279
don't want to waste it but they're even

530
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,798
uh so there's just barely any left in

531
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,480
each container here but this is as close

532
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,838
to uh that that's going to fit in here

533
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,838
without starting to spill it all over

534
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,639
the table so now we've got our solution

535
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,519
this is our one liter of silver

536
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,080
thiosulfate concentrated mix this is a

537
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,240
hundred percent dilution here we cannot

538
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,000
apply this directly to the plant this

539
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,000
will cause problems this will not be

540
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,558
success if we apply this directly to the

541
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,960
plant at this point we do need to dilute

542
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,879
this product the dilutions and

543
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,038
application intervals are where this

544
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,080
becomes kind of an art kind of an

545
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,720
adjustment the same dilution rate and

546
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,159
application uh times and intervals are

547
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,919
not going to work for every single plant

548
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,919
there are things to learn this is just

549
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,679
like working with people it's just like

550
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,919
taking somebody on a date with work for

551
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,360
your last date may not work at all for

552
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,520
your next date so you're gonna have to

553
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,439
figure this out there will be you'll see

554
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,200
some success but to get this perfect

555
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,519
there will be some dialing in this will

556
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,240
be a little bit of a learning process

557
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,759
the way that i do it i get and i said

558
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,839
earlier i was going to spray three

559
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,000
golden goat clones that's because i'm

560
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,839
going to spray them all differently

561
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,519
let's talk about the ratios i'm going to

562
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,678
spray these golden goat clones because

563
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,119
that is the next step i've got my spray

564
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,480
bottle here i've got a funnel i don't

565
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,479
have the funnel with me so i've already

566
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,558
failed myself i do have a workaround to

567
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,480
where we can make this work i've got my

568
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,918
spray bottle here what i would do

569
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,839
i would spray this i would have two or

570
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,000
three spray bottles honestly or i've got

571
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,079
another method that i do that is that's

572
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,519
going to remain one of my secrets here i

573
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,720
would have three spray bottles i would

574
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:51,038
mix up one solution that is ten percent

575
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,240
silver thiosulfate i would put uh how

576
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:56,000
much does this one hold 450 we'll say

577
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,319
just for uh to make this easier we'll

578
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,440
say that i've got a thousand milliliter

579
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:04,720
sprayer i would put 900 mils of

580
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,080
distilled water and uh 100 mils i lost

581
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,798
track of my math 100 mils of this

582
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,199
non-diluted silver solution so now it is

583
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,839
a nine to one solution nine parts water

584
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,679
one part silver i would mix up a nine to

585
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,480
one ratio so i've got nine parts of

586
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,400
distilled water one part of our silver i

587
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,640
would also do another one that is an

588
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,798
eight to two so i've got eight parts

589
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,799
water two parts silver then i would do

590
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,200
another one that is seven to three so

591
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,679
it's seven parts water three parts the

592
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,640
silver solution basically 10 20 and 30

593
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,120
percent

594
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,679
then i would spray each plant let's talk

595
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,239
about the schedule and intervals of when

596
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,320
to spray these plants i've got my golden

597
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,839
goat plants what i plan to do is i'm

598
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,558
going to spray them

599
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:51,038
seven days before i put them into flour

600
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,678
so today i'm recording on a monday i

601
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,558
want to put those plants into flour next

602
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,720
monday so i will spray them today give

603
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,918
them a full week put them into flour

604
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,319
next monday when they go into flour that

605
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,480
day i will spray them again they'll get

606
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,399
sprayed again so we're gonna spray them

607
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,120
seven days before and then we're gonna

608
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,120
spray them again on day one now here's

609
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,079
where we've got to pay attention because

610
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:21,038
now i will spray them every three days

611
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:23,599
until about day 21 or around 25 or 26

612
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,119
depending on what i see from that plant

613
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,439
some plants are stubborn and they don't

614
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,759
want to reverse if it's not reversing

615
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,840
keep spraying again i'm using three

616
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,038
different dilution rates so i can see

617
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,519
some things we're going to talk about

618
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,798
that in a moment but spray every third

619
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,599
day you're going to spray these plants

620
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,519
about seven to ten times total each

621
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,240
plant over the course of their life now

622
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,918
when you spray spray that plant just

623
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,599
about to the runoff point right when it

624
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,919
starts running off soak it towards just

625
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,079
dripping around be careful because the

626
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,159
silver solution can stain things it will

627
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,759
make things have a like a purple shine

628
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,840
to it or a silver color behind it i

629
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,759
should have stuff on this table honestly

630
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,480
so spray the plants

631
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,960
don't just spray the foliage spray the

632
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,519
stems the stalks the leaves everything

633
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,880
on that plant soak it the entire plant

634
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,279
and then it will absorb more of the

635
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,960
silver what's happening here uh brief

636
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,759
science i'm not a scientologist or a

637
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,279
chemistry major the silver disrupts the

638
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,679
copper movement and the plant which

639
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,759
triggers this plant the that's as far as

640
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,038
we need to go the silver disrupts the

641
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,919
copper movement we're trying to get the

642
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,400
silver into the plant the sodium

643
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,000
thiosulfate works to penetrate the leaf

644
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,200
surface and move that into the plant

645
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,279
that's why they're working together

646
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,880
that's why we mix this up if you want to

647
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,038
know more i've done full podcasts about

648
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,559
that i tried to stop myself from digging

649
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,440
down that rabbit hole because we could

650
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,038
go deep so now let's talk about times to

651
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,400
spray i think that's where i was right

652
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,158
somebody put me back on track i'm the

653
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,320
only one here so i'm going to spray one

654
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,000
week before flip oh we're talking about

655
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,439
uh dilutions and intervals right i

656
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
really kind of got lost but we'll fix

657
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,720
this

658
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,360
spray it one day then spray it

659
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,279
every three days stop around day 21 or

660
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:03,759
24 maybe 27 sprayed about 7 to 10 times

661
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,119
um what was i where was i going uh so

662
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,240
we're going to see things happen

663
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,719
sometimes

664
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,880
the heavier dilution will make the

665
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,798
plants crinkle up and look angry that's

666
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,440
okay we're not going for pretty plants

667
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:18,000
we're going for pollen here but also

668
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,000
sometimes too much silver can make the

669
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,960
plants angry and they don't produce any

670
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,798
pollen

671
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,360
sometimes not enough silver will make

672
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,038
them not produce any pollen sometimes

673
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,558
just enough pollen but not sprayed

674
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,960
enough or just enough silver but not

675
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,798
sprayed enough times or sprayed too many

676
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,000
times will make it not make pollen

677
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,839
there's so many

678
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,839
variables here we've got to learn how

679
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,000
much and how often with each plant the

680
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,839
only way to really do it is to do it

681
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,400
that's why i say spray three if you can

682
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,879
do five spray five of the same plant

683
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,038
spray them with that 70 80 and 90 and

684
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,960
then spray one of them more often than

685
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,640
the other and less often than the other

686
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,720
set up your own variables and take a lot

687
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,480
of notes and see what works for the

688
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,319
plants that you are working with i've

689
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,679
learned my plants i've learned how to

690
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,158
make the most amount of pollen that i

691
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,400
can get from them so it's just all trial

692
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,760
and error experience experimenting i'm

693
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,840
pretty sure that's where my brain was

694
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,240
going with that part you'll see twisted

695
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,918
crooked bent leaves weird [ __ ] happening

696
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,359
uh don't be afraid of that you're

697
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,840
looking for pollen the plants are going

698
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,599
to start making pollen sacks um you're

699
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,959
going to see these female plants start

700
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,319
doing [ __ ] you've never seen them do

701
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,079
before right where the new flower

702
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,240
clusters are coming out at the top

703
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,599
you'll see these weird little round it

704
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,120
looks like they're growing a crown or a

705
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,038
tip it looks like a pine cone it looks

706
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,959
like a uh like some kind of fruit it

707
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,240
looks like a little baby corn or one of

708
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,679
those little star fruits i can't think

709
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,279
of the [ __ ] name of it a really cool

710
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,080
looking fruit starts looking like that

711
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,960
it's growing out of the top of it um

712
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:45,519
that's the male parts forming around day

713
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,038
26 those will start opening by day 32 26

714
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,359
ish in that time frame they'll start

715
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,679
making pollen ah that's when you need to

716
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,479
have the ladies ready or be ready to

717
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,480
collect the pollen my strategy i

718
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,400
generally start putting the females in

719
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,240
the flowering room uh so you're gonna

720
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,320
spray these plants one week are you

721
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,798
gonna spray them on a monday next monday

722
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,599
put them in flour 12 12 spray them that

723
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,599
day spray them every three days

724
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,558
around day 26 they'll start giving you

725
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,480
pollen maybe day 32 it's plant specific

726
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,038
dude this is really the part you got to

727
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,599
adjust the intervals the timing and the

728
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,240
plants and the timing it's all [ __ ]

729
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:25,439
timing yeah so uh get the females in

730
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,200
there when the male plants start showing

731
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,120
you or when the female paul and donor

732
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,278
start showing you that it is making male

733
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,798
parts and you're sure that that [ __ ] is

734
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,960
reversing when you're positive that

735
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,119
you've done the trick drag those girls

736
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,120
into the flower room you should time it

737
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,079
just about right at this point like i've

738
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,678
talked about before my son my platinum

739
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,639
tangy plant that makes sun kiss and

740
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,240
orange gasm it wants pollen early that

741
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,240
plant that makes the strawberry

742
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,880
starburst the strawberry fields i use it

743
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,880
wants pollen much later so

744
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,039
you could probably your first run figure

745
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,360
it out by dragging them all in there the

746
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,038
first time you see the male parts really

747
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,519
significantly forming on your pollen

748
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:06,240
donor do your first cross that way then

749
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,879
learn the timing from note taking

750
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,798
watching what happens observation

751
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,960
learn from there then make adjustments

752
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,798
on your next crop always keep in mind

753
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,038
this isn't the last time we're gonna do

754
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,639
this project unless things go wrong this

755
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,038
isn't your last run we're gonna do this

756
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,520
again plan to make mistakes plan to make

757
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,798
adjustments this is you're the first

758
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,879
time you're riding this horse you're

759
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,879
gonna fall off of it don't be afraid to

760
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,960
get back up on that horse make some more

761
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,200
femme seeds and do that [ __ ] again i'm

762
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,720
going to review the notes i got lost in

763
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,159
one point but i feel like i covered

764
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,240
everything i'm pretty sure that my point

765
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,240
was talking about dilutions and when to

766
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,798
spray you're gonna have to learn how

767
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,960
often how hard to spray just like

768
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,558
learning somebody got to go how often

769
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,880
and how hard you don't know until you

770
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,960
figure it out um

771
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,120
spray them flip them spray them more

772
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,600
keep spraying drag the girls in there

773
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,798
keep spraying um you'll get pollen stop

774
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,158
spraying once you see pollen you guys

775
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,480
don't keep spraying the pollen you'll

776
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,159
ruin it i'll put the females in there

777
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,240
let them [ __ ] just let those guys

778
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,159
pollinate the girls um

779
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,519
when you're sure that they're done when

780
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,720
the girls are close to their point that

781
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,240
they're not going to receive any more

782
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,880
pollen and you're sure the guy plants

783
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,640
the pollen donors are done uh spitting

784
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,799
out their pollen cut off the tops and

785
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,400
just uh smack them around on the female

786
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,558
plants you'll knock out more pollen into

787
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,080
the room into those plants then i do

788
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:23,519
something weird i hang the plants kind

789
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,399
of from the lights or from the top of

790
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,440
the canopy

791
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,640
as the pollen donor dries more pollen

792
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,798
will fall out of there you'll get that

793
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,640
last little bit of pollen uh get every

794
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,319
drop that you can because femme seeds

795
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,240
femme reversals don't make as much

796
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,119
pollen as we would hope that's part of

797
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,120
why

798
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,798
all the all the caveats that catches the

799
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,158
tricks you heard are why fem seeds are

800
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,038
more expensive

801
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,799
um

802
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,480
learning the intervals learning the

803
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,119
timing learning how much learning the

804
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,960
dilution rate that all takes trial and

805
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,038
error that all takes note taking skill

806
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,880
repetition so you have to do everything

807
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,440
the same every time and just adjust your

808
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,679
solutions so that's why femi's seeds are

809
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,000
expensive also it doesn't make as much

810
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,759
pollen so i make about when i do a five

811
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,240
by five space i know how many seeds i

812
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,919
expect from rags i expect about half

813
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,558
maybe three quarters of that from a

814
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,320
feminized run if i'm lucky so that's why

815
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,798
femmes are a little bit more pricey

816
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,918
however this sop that i just gave you

817
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:17,679
honestly

818
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,600
i charge a lot of money for this sop i

819
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,440
have charged a lot of money for this sop

820
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,959
there are many details i did not give

821
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,038
you that included in the written

822
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,679
standard operating procedure but this

823
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,200
was an expensive sop in the past

824
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,200
and a standard operating procedure that

825
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,960
i would charge money for in a consulting

826
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,558
environment people were there are

827
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,480
companies built on this sop you guys

828
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,960
irie genetics uses this this is the

829
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,798
solution that i will use to make more

830
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,278
femme golden goat more lemon jeffree

831
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,879
more orange gasm uh chernobyl to

832
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,558
reversed golden goat what i said that

833
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,799
out loud on the show that is going to be

834
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,158
in the in the room so

835
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:51,038
this is the solution i'll make i'll show

836
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,159
you how i'm going to get into this

837
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,480
bottle actually i'm going to just dump

838
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,720
this one into here i will set this aside

839
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,240
that is 100 mix right there that's

840
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,200
basically the same thing that's in here

841
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,640
then i'm just going to dump it you got

842
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,840
to go quickly because the way that

843
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,960
physics and science and [ __ ] work i'm

844
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,278
gonna do with the mic in front of me and

845
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,200
see how much we spill but booyah go like

846
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,960
that get that into there now i can dump

847
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,000
this one into here easily that's how

848
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,120
it's gonna work and then we'll do the

849
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,880
dilutions

850
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,239
