23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
into one of my favorite parts of the

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,680
podcast this is the section I call Pet

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,680
Peeves when I go to grows when I'm in my

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,560
own grow when I'm at a commercial grow

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,720
sometimes when I'm in a social situation

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,640
smoking or talking about cannabis a lot

29
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,000
of things will trigger a pet peeve in me

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,280
and I've been sharing those pet peeves

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,319

even going to edit that out but uh

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,440
today's pet peeve comes from me my pet

52
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,319
peeve is unlabeled pots bro don't plant

53
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,800
a bunch of seeds plant a bunch of clones

54
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,479
and think you're going to remember what

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,920
is in each and every pot uh most likely

56
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:22,560
you were stoned as [ __ ] when you were

57
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:24,039
popping those seeds most likely you were

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,039
stoned as [ __ ] when you were cutting

59
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:27,519
those clones you were probably most

60
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,359
likely highest giraffe [ __ ] when you

61
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,959
were putting those clones into soil

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,480
putting those seeds into dirt whatever

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,840
you did and you did not label them bro

64
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,079
we're not going to remember we're

65
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,719
cannabis Growers and cannabis consumers

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,680
cannabis makes you kind of forget some

67
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,759
details so if you're going to put some

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,120
pots some plants in some pots have some

69
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,919
plants anywhere label them so we know

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,878
what they are don't come back and have

71
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:50,839
to guess is this one bubble goat is this

72
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,759
one nuk town is this one strawberry

73
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,959
Starburst let's put some labels on the

74
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,079
plants label each one carefully and

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,519
maybe possibly label each plant more

76
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,239
than once something I heard somebody say

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,158
they did did recently they labeled their

78
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,959
plants and then all of the labels got

79
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,639
washed off of the tags when they watered

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,640
they used a non-waterproof marker so

81
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,238
make sure you use the appropriate marker

82
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,000
maybe if you need to get some duct tape

83
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,039
write the strain name on the duct tape

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,479
stick that duct tape on the pot spin the

85
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,400
pot around 180° and do it again write

86
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,238
the strain name on that duct tape stick

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,840
the duct tape on the pot do it again

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,519
that way you can double down in case one

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,719
gets washed off one gets [ __ ] up you

90
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,920
got two labels on there set yourself up

91
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,719
for success is what I'm saying nothing

92
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,000
drives me more crazy than not knowing

93
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,560
what strain we just grew not when if I

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,639
send you multiple packs of seeds and you

95
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,680
say this could be this one or this one

96
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,798
I'm not sure as the breeder as the

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,799
person that's going to post those

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,519
pictures none of those photos are valid

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,640
I can't use it if it's an I think sort

100
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,519
of situation I need to know this is the

101
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,119
strain that I took the photo of I want

102
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,319
to know what's in that pot so my pet

103

107

feedback that's a huge compliment it

181
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,399
goes on it says why are the descriptions

182
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,319
for your strains no longer found on your

183
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,879
websites your descriptions were

184
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,400
excellent and informed my purchases can

185
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,360
you please bring them back Grower's love

186
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,159
from hunter gatherer yes I do understand

187
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,160
that for a while all of the descriptions

188
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,240
on IR genetics.com were gone most of the

189
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,599
descriptions on iir are very vague uh

190
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,598
there are a couple of reasons for that

191
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:52,839
we'll touch iy direct first um on iy

192
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,598
Direct if you want to take a credit card

193
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,719
and process money the credit card

194
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,878
processors do not want a lot of

195
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,800
information and details about your seeds

196
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,919
on that website so what you can

197
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,038
basically put is a photo you can put a

198
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:06,839
strain name you can put a cross you

199
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,800
cannot put a flowering time you cannot

200
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,359
put any details about growing it you

201
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,720
can't put flavors and Aromas just the

202
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,360
name and the cross how many seeds are in

203
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,360
the package is basically what you can

204
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,160
put up there that's what wave allows me

205
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
to do uh wave the uh the credit card

206
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,800
processing company that I use they have

207
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,280
a very strict compliance guideline and

208
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,720
every product I put up on my website on

209
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,318
iir is scanned by their comp clients

210
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,599
team and it has to meet a certain

211
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,400
criteria if I say the wrong words put

212
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,240
the wrong details they will not even

213
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:39,679
allow the product to appear on the

214
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,720
website uh they may take wave off for a

215
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
certain time if I mess up so I'm very

216
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,199
careful about what I put on edirect

217
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,598
decom uh that is because the credit card

218
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,439
processors do not want a lot of details

219
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,598
up there now let's talk about I

220
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,478
genetics.com there's no sales being done

221
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,959
there there's no credit card processor

222
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,918
there why did I remove those

223
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,799
descriptions for a short time at this

224
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,120
time I can announce that the description

225
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,759
the genetics page The Strain

226
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,680
descriptions are back they have been

227
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,598
edited uh they're a little more vague

228
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,519
than they were but they are back now

229
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,079
let's talk a little bit about that I had

230
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,478
to change some of the descriptions and

231
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,878
some of the wording uh mainly for legal

232
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,959
and Technical reasons um I'm learning

233
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,759
that you can't say I can't say things

234
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,959
like uh Golden Goat is good for

235
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,319
headaches technically that is a false

236
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,719
medical claim so I had to reward many of

237
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,840
the things on the website a lot of

238
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,440
things were geared at potency and false

239
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,519
medical claims and I don't want to brag

240
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,038
about potency at this time on the

241
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,519
website and I also cannot make uh

242
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,519
medical claims of any sort what I can

243
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,519
tell you is how it makes me feel when I

244
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,679
consume it but I can't tell you how it

245
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,639
will make you or other people feel I can

246
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,639
give you a testimony but I can't give

247
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,278
you I can't like again I can't make a

248
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,799
medical claim or any sort of claims that

249
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,080
I can't validate uh in a scientific

250
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,759
Manner and I don't want to I probably

251
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,040
could validate a lot of those claims I

252
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,639
can get 50 people in a room we could

253
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,000
smoke a joint and say yeah I do feel

254
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,399
like I'm stoned we could all agree on

255
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,639
that but I don't want to go through all

256
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,600
that uh it's easier just to not say [ __ ]

257
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,360
than it is to explain why you said some

258
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,920
[ __ ] so I had to remove some stuff off

259
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,399
the website um I am going to talk much

260
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,958
more about this on a patreon episode I

261
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,679
have to be careful about what I say I'm

262
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,439
sure you understand that but I'm going

263
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,159
to do a patreon episode that will be

264
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,240
available to patrons in the month of

265
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,278
December I'll probably uh record that

266
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,839
right when I wrap up here so look for a

267
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,919
more detailed episode uh in the month of

268
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,320
December on patreon I will keep it

269
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,039
affordable there will be a slight pay

270
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,120
wall but it will be available check

271
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,599
patreon.com fromy yourheart in the month

272
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,519
of December uh it will be available

273
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,519
there so the descriptions were gone I

274
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,360
can announce now that those descriptions

275
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,639
are back many of the descriptions are

276
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,079
back I it SP it took me a lot of time I

277
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,000
edited each and every one of those

278
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:48,319
descriptions by myself individually one

279
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,078
at a time uh that's all my thought

280
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,519
process my experiences with those plants

281
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:54,639
uh that's all in those descriptions

282
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,120
right now it is minimal and slightly

283
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,078
vague we need to do that for a few

284
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,560
reasons that I won't discuss here I may

285
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,078
talk more about that on the p patreon

286
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:04,518
episode over time those descriptions May

287
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,159
evolve again the older descriptions are

288
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,078
saved I didn't just delete it and forget

289
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,159
about them uh the highly detailed

290
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,559
descriptions are saved uh there are do

291
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,799
they are documented somewhere else so

292
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:15,679
they can be replicated in the future

293
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,838
many of those are all over the internet

294
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,120
if you go to seedfinder.eu you can find

295
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,640
a lot of those old descriptions um a lot

296
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,000
of the other websites that document

297
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:25,319
cannabis have those descriptions luckily

298
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,240
uh we got a little bit of notice and

299
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,839
those things got uh posted in other

300
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,159
places also many of those live on the

301
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,320
Discord if you need strain details that

302
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,600
we cannot put on the website on iir or I

303
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,680
genetics.com check out my Discord

304
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,240
there's a link to the Discord server in

305
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,319

them you can find blueberry butcher uh

315
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,800
uh every strain I was just trying to

316
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,600
think of random strains Golden Goat or

317

experiences so other people that have

320

grown it have posted photos all the way

321
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,159
from seedling all the way up to harvest

322
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,439
and their experience with each plant and

323

right so let me get back to the main

342
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:54,078
part of the question here uh where and

343
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:56,720
why uh they're gone they were gone they

344
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,719
are back but they are vague uh they will

345
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,200
improve and grow over time also if

346
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,800
there's there's a strain that is not

347
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,480
listed and you discover that something

348
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,958
you have experienced is not on the

349
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,039
website send me an email uh you can send

350
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,199
it to uh grow fromy yourheart at

351
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,199
hotmail.com and I will add that strain

352
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,920
that I have forgotten I put about 120

353
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,440
130 strains up there I may have easily

354
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,278
overlooked or forgotten something I'm

355
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,079
going to include all of the males all of

356
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:21,879
the females uh it just takes a little

357
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,439
bit of time but this was a good question

358
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,759
I've been asked this question several

359
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,160
times I was just not ready to address it

360
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,198
I like to address things when I have

361
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:31,360
good news when I have a resolution and

362
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:32,759
now I publicly addressed them anyway and

363
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,639
I've publicly addressed it because I

364
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,919
have fixed the problem iir is back the

365
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,360

366
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,479
is all back and happening I did send out

367
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,000

368
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,000

question is one about water for your

417
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,680
crops that's a really good question it

418
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:33,079
says is it okay to use spring water from

419
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,679
local natural spring to water my girls I

420
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:36,838
know not to buy store-bought spring

421
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,479
water yes that is true then it says what

422
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,800
would the shelf life be like I'm not

423
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,000
sure the shelf life but I've got a good

424
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,039
answer for the rest uh best way to store

425
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,600
it I'm not an expert there any other

426
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,039
Pros or cons you could send my way

427
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,360
thanks for all you do uh take care and

428
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:51,559
best uh catch you in the Discord yes

429
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,639
shout out to my friend for hanging out

430
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,479
in the Discord I'll probably be there

431
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,919
after I record this and a patreon

432
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,159
episode I'll go hang out on Discord take

433
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,120
some dabs I hope to see you there there

434
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,639
now let's answer the question the

435
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,799
question is can this listener use spring

436
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,839
water in their Garden natural spring

437
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:10,879
water my first instinct uh without any

438
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,920
education uh without any research

439
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,958
without being the water guy I would say

440
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,240
uh yes you should probably use that

441
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,638
spring water in your garden uh this

442
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,320
water does not have any added chemicals

443
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,959
in it nobody's put any chlorine no

444
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
chloramine uh they're not putting

445
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,439
fluoride in this water uh I would

446
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,759
probably recommend this water for

447
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,560
drinking for watering plants this is

448
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,360
probably a highly valuable water also

449
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,039
it's going to have natural minerals and

450
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,120
probably Trace elements of natural

451
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:40,278
microbes in there as well uh it's

452
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,519
probably really high quality water yes I

453
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:44,720
would probably recommend Watering your

454
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,120
plants with this spring water one thing

455
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,639
I would think about is maybe get it

456
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,480
tested um you can have water tested it's

457
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,159
very affordable uh it's easy to do you

458
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,720
can contact your local water company you

459
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,719
can uh probably contact the local

460
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,000
Department of a one of them can steer

461
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,399
you in the right direction to get your

462
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,039
water tested they'll tell you what's in

463
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,159
there they'll tell you if it's safe to

464
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,519
drink if it's safe for plants uh and

465
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,879
then just give it a little Quick Test

466
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,198
it's probably affordable depending on

467
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,759
where you are get it tested just for

468
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,198
peace of mind but um if if the

469
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,318
vegetation and everything around that uh

470
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:16,439
that spring is healthy and happy that

471
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:17,838
water is probably super great it could

472
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,839
have sulfur in it it could have other

473
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,800
things in it smell it taste it see what

474
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,279
you think um but I would bet that that

475
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:26,278
water is great for the plants now here

476
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:28,360
comes the uh the hippie and me the

477
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:30,360
person that has to uh speak up uh you

478
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,079
said natural spring where is it where is

479
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,560
it natural spring local natural spring

480
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,599
um I don't know how much water is coming

481
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,119
out of that I don't know if it's a

482
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,278
heavily flowing natural spring I don't

483
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,318
know if it's a light flow I don't know

484
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,240
what you got but don't take more than

485
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:47,039
what you deserve don't ruin the spring

486
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,720
by drying it up uh be uh be mindful of

487
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,000
how much water you're taking from that

488
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,800
natural resource there don't destroy it

489
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,879
uh leave no trace and then other than

490
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:57,318
that bro do your thing with the water uh

491
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:59,120
get those plants super healthy maybe

492
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:00,599
take a sip of it uh there are several

493
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,720
Springs around me in a place called

494
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,759
manitu Springs some of them you can

495
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,600
drink from some of them they suggest

496
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:08,400
they suggest you're allowed to but they

497
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,838
suggest you don't drink from it because

498
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,880
of specific mineral content so I may

499
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:15,519
check on that with these plants or with

500
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,079
this water but check the vegetation all

501
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,558
around uh maybe give it a test water or

502
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,480
maybe actually pay for a water test but

503
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,199
most of the time that spring water is

504
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,480
going to be highly valuable water for

505
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,038
your plants all right my dude LST IG

506
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,839

rolling I've got another great question

512
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:46,480
here in front of me this one also came

513
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,440
from the growel tab on iy genetics.com

514
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,960
so you do get a coupon code for a free

515
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,798
pack of iy seeds this one came from my

516
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,640
new friend Dallas Dallas said I'm a huge

517
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:57,319
fan here well thank you for being a fan

518
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,200
bro thank you for all the support thank

519
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:00,759
you for the great question it says I

520
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,000
love the show and I've watched tons of

521
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:04,759
older episodes it's almost embarrassing

522
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,440
but I do appreciate it it says I know

523
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,119
you've talked about this before but I

524
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,919
cannot find the episode that's okay

525
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,399
there's like 820 something now says I've

526
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,799
been hunting through some seeds and I've

527
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,798
grown this cultivar four times and it is

528
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,038
stretched each time every time I've

529
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,679
grown it I've upgraded to a taller tent

530
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,279
from four to six and now an eight-footer

531
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,559
i top it and send it into flower at 3

532
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,839
weeks it seems like the better I grow

533
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,000
the harder it is to grow small plants

534
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,279
all right that kind of make sense cuz

535
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,359
you're feeding them better taking better

536
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,720
care they're getting bigger faster but

537
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,599
we should also learn how to control

538
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,679
these plants with each grow it says I've

539
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,558
upgraded to a great AC infinity light

540
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,919
but the stretch never stops uh a lot of

541
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,599
my stuff is stretchy I don't know what

542
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,038
you're growing but a lot of my stuff I

543
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,519
will admit uh I am guilty of producing

544
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,038
stretchy plants early in flower but we

545
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,038
could talk about how to mitigate this

546
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:56,000
just a little bit the question is how

547
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,480
can I slow it slow the bolt or just keep

548
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,919
it in check sorry that was long winded

549
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,400
but I would love to hear back bro nobody

550
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,360
ever should apologize for being

551
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,000
longwinded when speaking to me I say

552
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,879
more words than one one sentence uh more

553
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,759
words and more one breath than most

554
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,240
people uh I'm talking fast over here I

555
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,119
got a lot of [ __ ] to say I got my own

556
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,480
show don't feel bad about being long-

557
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,279
winded thank you for the good question

558
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,919
um there are things we can do to

559
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,038
mitigate the stretch of these plants uh

560
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,799
the main thing I think you're doing it

561
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,359
right is flip early many people are

562
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,319
afraid to grow my plants because they

563
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,240
take 70 maybe 77 days to flower but then

564
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,200
I tell them you can cut 2 weeks off your

565
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,359
veg time cuz my plants grow so quickly

566
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,120
and so vigorously that it doesn't matter

567
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,839
you're still growing a 9we plant even if

568
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,359
it takes 11 just flip it a little bit

569
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,279
early because they are so vigorous uh

570
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,079
but my plants do grow tall they do grow

571
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:49,279
fast things that I do suggest to help uh

572
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,038
mitigate that stretchy phase is uh top

573
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,960
it you said top it that is a very good

574
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,119
way to do it uh top it early then you're

575
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,679
going to get a bunch of tops that are

576
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,399
going to grow out of control right so

577
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,480
top it flip early those are the first

578
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,600
things to do other things to think about

579
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,519
popping and twisting do you guys pop and

580
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,319
twist your plants I've talked about this

581
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,319
on previous episodes it's time to do a

582
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:09,798
refresher I'm going to use a pen as an

583
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,678
example so this is a branch on a plant

584
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:13,480
right this pen right here uh the branch

585
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,000
is coming up I do this on every Branch

586
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,200
so the soil is here right the plant

587
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,119
comes up here I'll grab about here with

588
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,360
this hand and about here with this hand

589
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,359
and twist opposite directions until it

590
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,240
does a little bit of a pop depending on

591
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,678
the thickness of your uh stock the

592
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,960
branch it'll be a louder or more quiet

593
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,519
pop some are twisty some are Woody some

594
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,200
are rubbery some plants will react

595
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,519
differently but a lot of times you'll

596
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,720
hear a little let me see if my knuckle

597
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,558
will do it you'll hear a little just

598
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,919
like that crunch pop that was just a

599
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,158
little knuckle pop in there that's what

600
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,280
I call it pop its Knuckles so the plant

601
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,640
is coming out of the dirt right here uh

602
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,000
we got the stick coming up I'll grab

603
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,640
with my right hand here just cuz I'm

604
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,359
right-handed that's how I prefer to to

605
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,280
grab it it's easiest for me grab it

606
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:53,599
right above with the left hand give it a

607
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,678
Twist you're going to hear that

608
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,959
cellulose structure of the plant pop

609
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,280
what's going to happen is you're going

610
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,880
to create a little a little little

611
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,599
knuckle there a little Burr it's going

612
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,360
to be a little stronger spot in that

613
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,199
plant I'm going to go up a couple of

614
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,678
inches and I'm going to do it again then

615
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,519
I'm going to go up a few inches and do

616
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,200
it again and then go up again and do it

617
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,639
again and I'm going to do that to the

618
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,558
entire plant I'm going to start at the

619
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,159
bottom and work my way up the main stock

620
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:16,759
all the way to the top then I'm going to

621
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:18,440
go to the bottom branches and work my

622
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,558
way up all those then the lowers and

623
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,000
work my way up every branch is going to

624
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,639
get popped and twisted popped it and

625
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,558
twisted popped and twisted that's what I

626
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,960
said every branch is going to get a nice

627
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,000
pop and twist a nice knuckle crack ing

628
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,278
then wherever I pop those Knuckles it's

629
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,440
going to get a little bit thicker just

630
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:35,319
like in your finger you can see my

631
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,600
fingers are swollen at my knuckle and

632
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,678
they're going to get a little bur there

633
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,119
a little bit thicker they're going to

634
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,120
get more support they're going to be

635
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,959
stronger those branches will become more

636
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,759
robust and tougher they'll be able to

637
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,079
support the big fat buds that are coming

638
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,319
up in the future now also this is going

639
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,798
to slow down the stretch of that plant

640
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:52,839
because it's going to spend a lot of its

641
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,319
energy healing up that broken cellulose

642
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:56,199
structure the fibers of the plant we

643
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,678
just broke we didn't really ruin

644
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,960
anything we didn't damage anything we

645
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,000
just broke broke it enough to slow down

646
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,480
that growth we do that in the first 2

647
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,038
and 1/2 weeks of flow the plan is just

648
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,200
adjusting its hormones into the

649
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:09,519
flowering phase at that time by the time

650
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,000
we're done popping and twisting

651
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,960
everything and that stretch phase is

652
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,558
over it's not even going really into

653
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,278
flower yet the flowers aren't going to

654
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,240
happen till about day 21 24 is when

655
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:20,720
you're going to get buds developing so

656
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,400
go ahead and pop them twist them crack

657
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,038
them manipulate them all the way up

658
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,038
until you start seeing Bud set you can

659
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:28,200
even go a little further if you want but

660
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,798
that will slow down that growth and it

661
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,159
will make the plants a little they'll

662
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:34,200
stay squater and more bushy and more

663
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,720
robust they'll stay a little lower and

664
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,919
you're not even messing up the buds

665
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,038
it'll slow down that stretch phase so

666
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,559
pop them twist them top them put them

667
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:43,919
under a trellis is something else you

668
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:45,158
can also do if you put them under a net

669
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,919
they can't go much higher because

670
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,400
they're under that net it's a it's a

671
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,679
skill it's an art form to learn how to

672
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,519
Trellis plants properly but do it the

673
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,159
only way to learn it is to do it but the

674
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,798
main idea is to get them to grow out

675
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:59,799
instead of up so you're not dealing with

676
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,319
one big giant uh Victory Bud one Glory

677
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:02,798
Cola that's touching the light and

678
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,359
messing everything up you've got

679
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,119
everything bent down it's all growing

680
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:10,000
evenly and everything gets that nice

681
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:12,719
even Light canopy so um flower early top

682
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,319
them pop and twist them trellis them uh

683
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,240
also feeding them properly can also help

684
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:19,158
mitigate that stretch in some strains

685
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,880
understand this is only going to be

686
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,880
strain dependent and this will only do

687
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,679
so much but if you give them if you

688
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,760
reduce that nitrogen give them

689
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,320
phosphorus and pottassium early in flour

690
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:31,599
that may help mitigate that stretchiness

691
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:33,158
in the start of the flowering phase

692
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,038
everything is going to take off for

693
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,039
about the first uh you'll see it take

694
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,558
off about day 10 and it won't stop until

695
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,759
about day 21 24 things are going to go

696
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:44,399
crazy in the stretch phase once you get

697
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,000
past that it's slow gradual growth until

698
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
the end if it really explodes at the end

699
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
of week n9ine or 10 but if you can

700
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,919
manage that super turbo growth for the

701
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,080
first 3 weeks you should be able to

702
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,000
manage the next six weeks of growth uh

703
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:57,199
they won't grow as quickly and rapidly

704
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,839
once you get past that I call it puberty

705
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,278
that puberty stretchy phase there

706
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:03,000
they're going from young girls to ladies

707
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,038
they just want to stretch and be seen

708
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,400
all right what they're really doing is

709
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:07,400
they're stretching to get up top so they

710
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,720
can receive pollen I'm sure you notice

711
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,519
if you grow a male plant he grows taller

712
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,278
more quickly than everybody so he can

713
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,240
get up high and when he pollinates that

714
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:16,798
pollen can fall the girls are trying to

715
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,440
get up above the other girls so that

716
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,359
they can get that pollen they want to be

717
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,960
the one to get that pollen cannabis's

718
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,839
whole purpose the whole purpose of that

719
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,558
plant we think it's to get us High

720
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,839
that's that's our favorite part but that

721
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:29,960
plant's whole purpose is to breed it

722
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,678
wants to make seeds for next year so

723
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,480
that it can make seeds for next year and

724
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,278
so on so keep that in mind when you're

725
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,278
working with cannabis plants its whole

726
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:41,079
goal is to breed we think it's to get us

727
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:42,440
High that's like a bonus all right my
