jump into the main topic of today's

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,879
podcast i do want to talk about

46
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,599
something i saw today i was driving

47
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,679
around town and i saw a giant fire there

48
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,679
was a huge fire and it made me want to

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,439
come home and remind you if you're

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,040
growing maybe if you're not growing

51
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,039
maybe just in your home

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,360
definitely if you're growing do you have

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,439
a smoke detector some sort of fire

54
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,840
detector then if that goes off do you

55
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,000
have a fire extinguisher

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,319
sometimes a lot of us may be running a

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,159
lot of equipment just plugging in a grow

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,519
light could set you up for disaster if

59
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,000
you're pulling too much power from the

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,920
wall or if that grow light may be uh oh

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,759
what's the word if it malfunctions if

62
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,359
it's faulty is the word i'm looking for

63
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,719
that grow light can definitely cause

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,200
major problems it can cause an

65
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:26,159
electrical fire it could cause a fire

66
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,318
we need to make sure as growers that we

67
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,639
don't put that mark on our community

68
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,518
we've come a long way in cannabis

69
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,439
legalization and cannabis acceptance

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,519
we are not it's not crack anymore we are

71
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,199
not treated like the devil anymore we're

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
given a lot of privileges now it is our

73
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,199
responsibilities to make sure

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,439
excuse me it's our responsibility to

75
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,280
make sure that we do not burn anything

76
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,959
down we've been given the rights to grow

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,400
in our homes many of us are growing

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,560
legally a lot of you may be growing

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,280
illegally we need to be very careful to

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,800
not have a fire let's avoid a fire let's

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,479
be logical and think about it when we're

82
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,719
setting up the grow

83
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,318
one thing that often causes a fire is

84
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,400
people trying to pull too much

85
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,719
electricity from one breaker or maybe

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
even one breaker box think about all of

87
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,759
the power you're pulling if you're

88
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,518
running too many extension cords if

89
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,518
you've got weak wiring that could

90
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,000
definitely cause a fire think about that

91
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,519
don't ever overload an amp don't over or

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,439
overload a breaker is what i'm trying to

93
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,959
say with too many amps don't keep

94
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,400
flipping that breaker if it flips a

95
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,239
couple of times you've got a problem you

96
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
need to make some adjustments don't be

97
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,080
that guy don't be that gal don't be that

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,239
grower that burnt down the house caused

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,080
a huge fire on the entire block the fire

100
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,439
i saw today it was hours ago it's

101
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,040
probably still burning it's gonna take a

102
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,359
minute to get that bad [ __ ] out

103
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,519
but that fire was raging let's not cause

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,159
the fires now what i wanted to focus on

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,920
uh is are you ready if there uh i don't

106
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,919
want you to have a fire but you might it

107
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,359
could happen are you prepared do you

108
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,559
have a strategy do you have a smoke

109
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
detector something that's going to

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,598
indicate to you hey there is smoke you

111
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,959
need to do some [ __ ] do you have a smoke

112
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,479
detector in your house that will beep

113
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
and let you know do you have something

114
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,598
connected to

115
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,438
a device in your grow that will let you

116
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,359
know on your phone will it notify you

117
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,799
will it beep maybe you've got a heat

118
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,400
sensor in there that will let you know

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,438
hey it's way hot in here it'll let you

120
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,719
it'll beep and let you know there's a

121
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,719
fire in the grow room you can see

122
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,719
something's going on do you have some

123
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,479
sort of notification

124
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,959
something to think about with that

125
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,959
notification of a fire if you're growing

126
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,560
in an illegal area do you really want

127
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,478
the cops and the fire department coming

128
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,720
to your grow you may need a strategy for

129
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,120
getting out that fire so i highly

130
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,880
recommend uh i recommend this for any

131
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,160
home if you've got a house where there

132
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,000
are people if you're cooking if you've

133
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,759
got electricity go get a fire

134
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,839
extinguisher a small fire extinguisher

135
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,280
from a local hardware store i hope you

136
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,439
don't have to use it but i would rather

137
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,279
you have that fire extinguisher sitting

138
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,959
on the shelf sitting on the cupboard

139
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,319
sitting on the counter it only takes up

140
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,599
a little bit of space put it on top of

141
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,519
the fridge make sure everybody knows

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,439
it's there but i'd rather you have that

143
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,198
and not need it than need it and not

144
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,600
have it that couple of bucks that you

145
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,520
spend could save your life your home

146
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,120
your family it could save all your stuff

147
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,279
it's probably going to ruin your crop in

148
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,038
your garden but i'd rather spray down

149
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,198
the entire grow space with some of that

150
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,279
disgusting fire extinguisher [ __ ] then

151
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,280
burn down the entire building structure

152
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,279
facility that the grow is in that would

153
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,599
make a big difference to me so do you

154
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,038
have some sort of warning first of all i

155
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,280
guess make sure you're not overloading

156
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,360
any breakers any circuits is all of your

157
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,638
stuff safe is all of your stuff current

158
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,400
do you have a bunch of old ballasts that

159
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,240
make a bunch of weird noises uh when you

160
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,439
turn them on does it go

161
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,000
on does it sound like it's gonna catch

162
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,160
on fire guess what it's gonna are all of

163
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
your blowers connected properly is there

164
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,000
anything in any of the fans or is all

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,478
the wiring good i know a lot of people

166
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,038
do some uh some real ingenuitive wiring

167
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,560
to make [ __ ] work be very careful let's

168
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,079
not burn anything down that's the first

169
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,918
thing to think about is not cause any

170
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,560
fires then if you do do you have

171
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,319
something to notify you then think about

172
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,000
the interaction with law enforcement and

173
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,680
the fire department is it okay to have

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,279
that girl where you have it do you have

175
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
a way to get that fire out before they

176
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,399
get there do you have a strategy do you

177
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
have an excuse do you have a friend that

178
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,239
you can call to help you out do you have

179
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,079
something in place then once that alarm

180
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,160
goes off you have a way to put out that

181
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,478
fire they sell

182
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,880
on a lot of the cultivation stores the

183
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,360
hydroponic stores the grow stores a lot

184
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,279
of the places sell a flame defender

185
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
nobody pays me any money to say anything

186
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,239
about these products they sell a flame

187
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,000
defender uh fire extinguisher that hangs

188
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,519
from the ceiling of your grow space and

189
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,918
if that grow space reaches a certain

190
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,560
temperature that thing will rupture and

191
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,879
fire retardant powder will explode all

192
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,800
over your grow space it goes in a 360

193
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,680
degree pattern it will spray and throw

194
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,840
this disgusting dust all over it will

195
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,439
put out the fire but it will ruin

196
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,879
everything in that room all of your grow

197
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,240
gear will need a thorough cleaning all

198
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,800
of your plants are pretty much [ __ ] at

199
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
that point but it will rescue a fire so

200
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
i'd recommend checking out the flame

201
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,520
defender again they don't pay me to

202
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:46,639
advertise i'm just i want you guys to be

203
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,159
safe i

204
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,079
the podcast is grow from your heart i

205
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
care about people i care about you guys

206
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,879
i saw something today i thought maybe i

207
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,719
could give you a hint and help you out

208
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,560
so uh they don't pay me to say this

209
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,840
flame defender looks like a good product

210
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,199
it is a i think that's what it's called

211
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,038
i forgot to google and research that's

212
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,720
what i remember uh it will put out a

213
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,318
fire in case of a fire and you don't

214
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,560
even have to be there it will just

215
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,639
explode rupture put out the powder and

216
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,959
extinguish that fire for you or you've

217
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,120
got the option to have a fire

218
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,799
extinguisher and if you do buy a fire

219
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,478
fire extinguisher

220
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,079
it may be a good idea to

221
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,159
pull the pin and give it a spray one

222
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,000
time just see what that's like maybe

223
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,840
practice it's always when you get a new

224
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,759
job at a big facility i've gotten jobs

225
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,359
at like warehouses and factories and

226
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,759
places where there could be fires

227
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,280
oftentimes i'm kind of a bigger dude and

228
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,879
i'm ready willing and able i've got

229
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,799
[ __ ] i'm strong minded i'm kind of

230
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,639
bossy i can follow instructions i'm one

231
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
of the guys who gets trained on how to

232
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,079
use the fire extinguisher all the time

233
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,680
because they know that i can handle an

234
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,839
emergency situation that's just my

235
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,840
mindset so i've been trained on using

236
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,318
the fire extinguisher they do it in a

237
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,159
commercial and commercial grows they do

238
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,039
it and what am i saying industrial jobs

239
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,800
they do in commercial jobs uh so why not

240
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,800
train yourself on it get ready be

241
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,319
prepared to use that fire extinguisher i

242
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,598
don't want you to have to use it i

243
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,960
really don't i don't want there to be a

244
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,120
fire i don't want you to have to spray

245
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,038
anything but i'd rather you have the

246
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,959
fire extinguisher and know how to use it

247
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,240
instead of freak out and run down the

248
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,719
street when the fire is happening and

249
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,478
end up making things even worse so i saw

250
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,319
fire today you guys it made me want to

251
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,519
remind you to think about safety in the

252
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,720
grow that's something that often gets

253
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,000
overloaded we don't think about it

254
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
something i don't talk about enough

255
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,639
probably uh being an advocate a teacher

256
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,919
an educator um whatever you want to call

257
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,400
me here in the cannabis space a

258
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,120
podcaster um i think it is part of my

259
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,359
responsibility to remind you not to be

260
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,719
that grower don't burn the [ __ ] down

261
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,879
don't burn it down until it's dried and

262
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,800
cured bro all right let's get off of

263
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,799
this topic of seeing a fire that was a

264
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,718
huge fire get your [ __ ] together be

265

268
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,639
could say about that let's keep moving

269
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,439

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,560
you for helping

275
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
even if you're new you're helping and

276
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,079
that's what matters

277
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,000
what says i have an older friend who is

278
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,639
trying cannabis to deal with intense

279
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,799
nerve pain i hope that's helping it says

280
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,278
she has got fibromyalgia and spinal

281
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,879
stenosis to name a couple of her

282
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,799
condition sounds like she may have a few

283
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,320
more that you didn't list off i hope we

284
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,559
find some medicine that works well for

285
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
your friend here uh big up and fist bump

286
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,958
to you for helping somebody it says her

287
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,039
pain heavily affects what she can do

288
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,039
especially with her hands yes i

289
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,799
definitely understand that it says i've

290
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,838
given her some flowers to see if it

291
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,399
helps

292
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,880
but consumption let's see but smoking

293
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,799
consumption through smoking is rough oh

294
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,360
and when i say flowers maybe i haven't

295
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,120
uh made this clear when i say flowers

296
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,720
i'm just kind of in the industry i'm an

297
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,200
industry snob i guess when we say

298
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,800
flowers we mean buds we mean weed

299
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,600
the dried buds the parts you want to

300
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,278
smoke the herbs the buds the nugs uh

301
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
that's that's flowers and then if you

302
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,039
talk about concentrates we just say

303
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,959
concentrates so you can get flowers

304
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,559
concentrates edibles and then you can

305
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,078
actually get clones and plants those are

306
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,639
the things that are available so when

307
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,559
i'm saying flowers i'm talking about

308
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,240
dried and cured buds that are smokeable

309
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,958
that's what our friend here is referring

310
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,799
to as well so our friend is given our

311
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,879
his uh we're going to call this person

312
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,838
your patient you've given your patient

313
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,000
um

314
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,399
some herb and she's got fibromyalgia and

315
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
spinal stenosis and her hands are

316
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,440
limited she can't do things with her

317
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,120
hands and smoking the flower is

318
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,480
difficult she can't roll joints with her

319
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,799
hand pain and it seems uh it's even

320
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,320
makes for properly holding the pipe

321
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,519
difficult so that's got to be rough she

322
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,440
can't hold the pipe and light it with

323
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,759
the lighter properly because her hands

324
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,440
are losing strength and getting sore it

325
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,759
says i've brought up some fancy flower

326
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,600
vaporizer vaporizers that might ease the

327
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,360
process but the price point for

328
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,440
something decent is a bit high yes

329
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,959
unfortunately the price point is quite

330
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,959
high for getting yourself into one of

331
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,078
those electric smoking devices and you

332
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,119
have to be careful because you don't

333
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,719
want to smoke the polyurethane stuff uh

334
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,839
and the wire coating and you want to get

335
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,800
a good product so you don't smoke a

336
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,320
bunch of [ __ ] but um they are quite

337
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,799
expensive it says i plan on letting her

338
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,640
try my volcano my next trip to visit

339
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,359
i've also brought her some homemade

340
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,958
canisav with other medicinal herbs in it

341
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,039
she's a light user at best so

342
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,759
concentrates are out of the question

343
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,958
for

344
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,159
now

345
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,039
all right so it sounds like our friend

346
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,519
is gonna ask uh how he can more easily

347
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,519
medicate our new patient here uh it

348
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,959
sounds like the condition is making it

349
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,480
uh tough they can't smoke because they

350
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,479
can't hold the pipe properly they can't

351
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,879
roll joints um

352
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,800
man you're they are very lucky to have a

353
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,799
friend like you that is something that

354
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,799
is very beneficial to this person not

355
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,759
only are they going to get medicated

356
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,278
through cannabis they're going to get

357
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,639
some relief that way once we get them

358
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,320
dialed in with their dosage and the

359
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,838
proper strain and all the stuff that

360
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
they need but also

361
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,920
a huge part of medicating with cannabis

362
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,200
and my opinion and my experience in my

363
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:54,159
belief is uh the social aspect we feel

364
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,680
better when we are with people that we

365
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,519
enjoy being with it just feels good

366
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,919
right what's like being here right here

367
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,600
by me by myself this is cool but if you

368
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,360
put mike right there or clint right

369
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,040
there the party's gonna be way better

370
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,879
there's gonna be two of us to be twice

371
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,559
the vibes twice the energy you could

372
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,759
even put somebody i don't know right

373
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,119
there and as long as they're not a

374
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,559
[ __ ] psycho and even if they are a

375
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,159
psychopath i could still probably have a

376
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,119
good time with them it's going to get

377
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,719
better

378
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,919
almost everything you do is better with

379
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,278
people and if you had a couple more

380
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,439
people and a couple more people that's

381
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,439
why festivals are so cool the vibe just

382
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,519
gets stronger we all spread the energy

383
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,360
it feels good to be social i think that

384
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,839
smoking with this person and being a

385
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,440
good friend to this person and being uh

386
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,120
we call this a caregiver situation is

387
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,040
what this used to be in colorado you are

388
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,039
this person's caregiver you've decided

389
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,199
to take caregiver responsibilities as a

390
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,078
cannabis caregiver to this person uh

391
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,839
that is a huge part the social aspect in

392
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,239
hanging out smoking caring for this

393
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,240
person is a huge part of the medicinal

394
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,159
aspect of cannabis when you smoke at

395
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,480
least for me if you've ever been around

396
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,000
me in person i'll take a big dab and set

397
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,320
down the dab rig and blow off the smoke

398
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and just start [ __ ] talking i love

399
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,320
being social and hanging out and being

400
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,240
around people after i smoke and this

401
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,079
person they're in pain they're hurting

402
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,440
they're not feeling good and so as soon

403
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:06,559
as they smoke they're gonna feel better

404
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,680
and they're going to want to chit chat

405
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,439
and you're going to be there and you're

406
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,199
going to fire their conversation up and

407
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,360
give them ideas and you're going to help

408
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,040
them mainly forget that they're in pain

409
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,560
forget that they've got problems that's

410
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,480
that's what our friends do for us we've

411
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,000
all got bills to pay and [ __ ] on our

412
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
mind and things to worry about but when

413
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,440
you got friends and you smoke a lot of

414
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:24,958
that [ __ ] goes out of your mind for a

415
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
minute you can't escape it you can't run

416
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,719
from it it's got to be dealt with but

417
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
it's good for you to get away get some

418
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
giggles get some laughter get some

419
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,159
social interaction so your friend is

420
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,919
very lucky to have you very blessed to

421
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,519
have a caregiver like you that is

422
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,399
concerned enough to reach out to me to

423
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,000
find better ways to help i am rambling

424
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,759
here you said that you want to let her

425
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
try the volcano on the next trip i

426
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,319
really think that's going to be the best

427
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,320
ways to go about it it does say though i

428
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,160
recently pushed her some info on how to

429
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,720
make some can of butter out of the flour

430
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,198
i gave her as it seems lightly ingested

431
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,600
doses through the day may be her best at

432
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,958
managing pain that is probably accurate

433
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,680
but you've got to be careful in

434
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,518
adjusting her into edibles because

435
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,159
you know as well as i do

436
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,879
a little bit too much edibles can be way

437
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,559
too much edible so that five milligrams

438
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,480
over the limit for a new consumer could

439
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,559
definitely take the experience from like

440
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,560
oh this feels good to oh [ __ ] this is

441
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,078
not a good time i never want to do this

442
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,679
we definitely don't want to scare your

443
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,919
friend away from cannabis we want to

444
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,278
ease her into cannabis as medicine and

445
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,719
that's how you do any other medicine

446
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,799
anybody's in you wouldn't jump in with a

447
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,800
[ __ ] heroic dose of anything so be

448
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,599
careful ease her in slowly with the

449
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,120
doses it says there's another option in

450
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,879
tinctures but i don't have the knowledge

451
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,360
or equipment to make it and it's

452
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,439
expensive locally might not be her first

453
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,440
choice is there any way of consuming dry

454
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,760
flour that is a bit more accessible with

455
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,920
limited use of the hands depending on

456
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,159
how the butter works for her it might be

457
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,439
the best fit thanks in advance then he

458
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,039
wraps it up here with a lot of great

459
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,800
stuff dio thank you for the great

460
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,759
message big up on you for helping this

461
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,439
patient

462
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,519
this client of yours

463
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,760
i really think that the edibles would be

464
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,839
a great way to go she's going to get

465
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,519
longer relief uh

466
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
better acting relief more effective

467
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,039
relief that it's going to get inside the

468
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,799
body and get in there deeper i feel like

469
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,919
edibles when you eat it and knows where

470
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,359
to go and it's like i'm going to go

471
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,078
right there and make your pain go away

472
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,519
and the edibles will work um

473
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,120
also

474
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,560
smoking isn't really healthy it sounds

475
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,560
like your friend's got enough health

476
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,479
concerns and enough problems already

477
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,799
smoking isn't really

478
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,839
i i'm i guess i'm a hypocrite here

479
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,319
because i take gigantic dabs all day but

480
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,240
if this person isn't already smoking and

481
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,160
doesn't have the habit and the comfort

482
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,159
of it maybe edibles would be the way to

483
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,679
go let's just save their lungs and keep

484
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,719
them healthy they have enough enough

485
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,719
health concerns we don't need to

486
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,199
introduce lung problems and a cough into

487
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,000
this scenario here uh so let's give them

488
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,399
edibles and see how that goes um

489
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,759
also i do really think that the volcano

490
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,759
is going to be a great option a great uh

491
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,240
effective way of consuming because you

492
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,759
can fill that bag and then you got to

493
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,360
push that little thing in all the on the

494
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,839
volcano to make it work but as long as

495
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,278
she can use two hands or make that click

496
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,959
that would work also there's got to be a

497
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,879
way you can rig the volcano back open

498
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,278
for her so that she can use it when

499
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,879
you're not there um

500
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,958
yeah smoking isn't really good so i

501
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,919
would say work on the edibles would be

502
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,319
one of the things that i would

503
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,919
definitely work on now i did compliment

504
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,759
you on being a great caregiver a piece

505
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,159
of advice that i would recommend is if

506
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,839
you do go the edible route maybe give

507
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,240
her the edibles when you can be there

508
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,079
for the next at least two to four maybe

509
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,159
six hours you might want to hang out or

510
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,559
at least be able to stay for a few hours

511
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,719
and shoot see if she freaks the heck out

512
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,239
or just be able to pop in occasionally

513
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,680
and make sure she doesn't need anything

514
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,959
if you can't stick around for the whole

515
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,638
duration of the time make sure you can

516
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,559
stay until it kicks in make sure she's

517
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,399
comfortable then go handle your business

518
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,239
then come back maybe every hour maybe

519
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,919
every hour and a half or two hours make

520
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,919
sure she doesn't need anything uh

521
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,679
sometimes around hour four maybe hour

522
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,439
six those edibles will change gears on

523
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,479
you and she'll just be stuck in a corner

524
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,839
wishing that you'd bring her a peanut

525
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,600
butter and jelly sandwich and a dr

526
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
pepper or something maybe that's all she

527
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,839
needs to save her life at that point but

528
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,599
i reck i do recommend going to edible

529
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,439
route i also highly recommend you hang

530
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,798
out while you give her the edibles stick

531
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,319
around make sure she's safe make sure

532
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,480
she's comfortable

533
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,399
get some good snacks available some

534
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,160
healthy snacks uh get some good

535
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,480
conversation in your mind prepared maybe

536
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,279
have some good netflix prepared do a

537
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,160
friendly netflix chill and edibles

538
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,918
session see how that goes uh one ironic

539
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,519
thing it's terrible that i think this

540
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
route but one thing i think is ironic in

541
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,200
the cannabis industry we sell all these

542
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,038
products to people to make them feel

543
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,640
better then one of the most frustrating

544
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,480
things is that we put all these products

545
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,400
in child proof containers and the people

546
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,319
with hand problems can't even open them

547
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,759
so i understand the struggle sometimes

548
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,599
i've got good hands and sometimes i

549
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,359
can't even get the products open so i

550
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,759
understand how frustrating it could be

551
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,439
uh my dude dio you're a great person for

552
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,759
helping out your friend

553
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,440
i really hope that the edibles work

554
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,160
i really hope you can find a way to dose

555
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,320
the edibles properly if you could get um

556
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,759
some lab tested edibles that would be

557
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,960
ideal but i understand we've all got to

558
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,240
work within our means and with our

559
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,640
budget i don't even know if you're in a

560
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,720
legal place but i think edibles would be

561
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,280
the way to go definitely oh i was going

562
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,679
to recommend also another vaporizer you

563
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,480
said the volcano i have experience with

564
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,880
the vapor brothers vaporizer it's a

565
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,480
small uh looks like a wooden box with

566
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,640
the whip the tube comes out of it that

567
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,440
you hit that's real easy for someone to

568
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,720
manage even if you have minimal hand

569
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,320
abilities

570
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,319
all you have to do is grind up the herb

571
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,678
that may maybe you could go pre-grind up

572
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,038
a bunch of herb for or give her like an

573
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,038
eighth or a quarter of ground up herb

574
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,558
that's ready to go then all she's got to

575
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,000
do is fill the whip you know what i mean

576
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,440
like if if you guys have used a

577
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,519
vaporizer you know which part the whip

578
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,880
is you just got to fill the whip and get

579
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,960
it up onto the heating element and then

580
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,559
let it heat all she's got to do at that

581
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,319
point is grab the other end of the whip

582
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,678
and inhale and smoke the vape um and you

583
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,678
know it won't even if you set at the

584
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,519
right temp the herb doesn't burn until

585
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,480
your it doesn't vaporize until you draw

586
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,720
through it because you have to move the

587
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,798
heat over the over the herb it's not

588
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,240
constantly heating so the vapor brothers

589
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,639
device is another option that i may

590
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,720
recommend uh check out vapor brothers

591
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,720
good product again those guys don't pay

592
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,000
me at all it's a good product i used to

593
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,000
have one i used it it was great um also

594
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
the buddha is very similar the buddha

595
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,440
and the silver surfer they're all the

596
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,519
vapor brothers the buddha the silver

597
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,240
surfer in my opinion they're all going

598
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,440
to be similar quality for their price

599
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,880
point they're all going to be great for

600
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,120
what they cost they're all effective for

601
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,880
their price point again nobody pays me

602
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,519
i'm just talking out of experience and

603
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,280
things that i have used um

604
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,720
my other advice eventually you said that

605
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,639
she's a new smoker and dabs would

606
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,279
probably wreck her eventually she's

607
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,520
going to want to move up to dabs because

608
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,678
concentrates are more cost effective in

609
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,119
my opinion and at that point that's when

610
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,880
i would go with the puffco the puffco

611
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,678
would be super easy for this person

612
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,919
however right now i think the vapor bros

613
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,240
the volcano or some good old-fashioned

614
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,520
edibles are the way to go my dude dio

615
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,759

good grower

627
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,879
all the other stuff is questionable this

628
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,519
message says just in case you read this

629
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,600
on the podcast big salute to the irie

630
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,119
army big salute brother thank you for

631
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,038
being a part of the irie army thank you

632
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,359
for letting me pick on you always a good

633
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:32,158
time it says i have a question about

634
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,319
small scale pheno hunting that is a very

635
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,000
good question it says if the goal is to

636
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,000
sift through as many new plants as

637
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,519
possible while identifying the keepers

638
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,679
and winners do you think it would be

639
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,000
better to clone everything before i flip

640
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,679
or re-veg plants that show themselves to

641
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,079
be the most worthy once they have

642
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,000
flowered that is a very good question

643
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,000
i've got a very good answer for that

644
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,240
however there is more to the message it

645
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,159
says typically i try and make it my

646
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,960
practice to always take at least one

647
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,280
clone of every every plant

648
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,440
before i flip it to flower however that

649
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,839
is a lot of clones and a small space to

650
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,840
hang on to while determining if i need

651
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,558
to run them again yes that is completely

652
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,240
understandable i totally get it being a

653
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,480
breeder doing some being somebody that

654
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,558
does a lot of phenol hunts this is one

655
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,480
of my struggles especially since

656
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,879
colorado has got me limited down to so

657
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,640
few plants to do a phenol hunt i

658
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,799
definitely cutting clones you just

659
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,640
doubled your numbers immediately so i

660
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,720
understand the struggle here

661
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,080
it goes on though there's more it says

662
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,159
it's a lot of clones are turning okay

663
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,319
recently i recently had a round of

664
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,240
clones fail and i have one plant that

665
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,839
i'm thinking i will have to re-veg

666
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,279
because i want to take her out on some

667
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,519
more dates i love the way you think

668
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,519
about that as i'm thinking about this i

669
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,079
realize that re-veging those that stand

670
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,000
out only might make might take a bit

671
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,918
longer but would lessen the amount of

672
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,839
clones that i care for and potentially

673
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,360
could save me space

674
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,439
it sounds like you're on the right track

675
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,798
bro it sounds like you're on a good path

676
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,038
one thing i'm going to jump in i'm going

677
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,200
to interrupt myself here

678
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,359
the re-vegging process might take a

679
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,519
little bit longer

680
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,199
do you do the 18-6 method that i talk

681
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,879
about at the end of flower when you

682
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,240
begin flushing flip those lights to 18-6

683
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,080
then the plants will speed up a little

684
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,038
bit more quickly then they're already

685
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,720
going back to reveg of course uh this is

686
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,079
hard to do because you're doing a pheno

687
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,400
hunt so maybe you haven't ran these

688
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,759
plants before but when you know you're

689
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,960
going to harvest in a couple days you

690
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,480
could flip them early you could turn

691
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,279
them back it doesn't matter if it's

692
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,960
fourteen days ten seven five any days

693
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,359
ahead are days ahead so that will get

694
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,919
you sped up on the re-veg process

695
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,079
that'll get you going there's more to it

696
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,679
it says i also like the idea of not

697
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,158
growing out a bunch of clones just to

698
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,600
kill them that is a very very great

699
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,200
point if they're not what i'm looking

700
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,038
for or growing out something okay just

701
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,000
because i had a clone oh that's another

702
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:49,599
good thing i didn't think about

703
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,038
sometimes you might just grow that plant

704
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,359
just because the clone exists you didn't

705
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,640
even need it not a quality plant never

706
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,879
thought of that route that's a good way

707
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,038
to give yourself some discipline

708
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,120
he wraps it up by saying i feel that

709
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,200
both cloning and reveg arguments have

710
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,119
their merits and i'm curious to get your

711
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,200
thoughts on the topic what strategy

712
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,599
would you use if you were hunting in a

713
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,640
basement with a few tents big love and

714
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,158
respect from your dude ye mother [ __ ]

715
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,480
ha thank you bro this is a great

716
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,039
question um i understand i understand

717
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,319
the struggle completely i definitely do

718
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,400
because i like to do a lot of final

719
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,399
hunts myself and like i said earlier

720
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,038
if i pop a pack of seeds i'm allowed 12

721
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,640
plants if i pop 10 seeds i'm already

722
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,720
really close to the limit if i cut

723
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,159
clones of all of those i'm definitely in

724
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,960
the illegal zone by the time those

725
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,919
clones root i am in an illegal time

726
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,679
frame

727
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,440
one thing you could do is you could cut

728
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,120
those clones a little bit later you can

729
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,360
cut them right as the plant goes into

730
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,879
flower then cut the clones

731
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,399
that'll save you a couple of weeks but

732
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,000
that's not the way that i'm going to

733
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,840
recommend i think you've got the right

734
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,200
idea the way that you are thinking about

735
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,879
re-vegging

736
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,159
i definitely think you've got the right

737
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,200
strategy

738
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,840
the idea is to grow a pack of seeds and

739
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
find the best one out of there right and

740
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,519
people talk about growing a bunch of

741
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,038
seeds i think you should find i think if

742
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,038
you buy a 10 pack of my seeds you'll

743
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,879
probably find the keeper and the 10 pack

744
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,079
there'll be one maybe two gems in there

745
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,760
that really stand out you shouldn't have

746
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,599
to buy too many packs

747
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,558
but so the idea is to run the 10 pack

748
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:19,278
and find the gem in there i do agree

749
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,960
that uh the reveg since we're so limited

750
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,720
on numbers i agree completely that the

751
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,038
revenge is a great strategy for doing

752
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,798
this so i would run my 10 and then i

753
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,558
would early on i'm going to eliminate a

754
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,079
bunch of boys so now i can just cut out

755
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:31,678
a bunch of boys i've probably got five

756
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,798
left i'm going to keep an eye on them

757
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,200
you're already going to know that that

758
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,798
one over there is too stretchy or just

759
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,240
too short or too shitty you already know

760
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,720
that number five is gone now you're down

761
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,880
to four so now you've only got four left

762
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,319
definitely i would reveg the best two at

763
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,840
the end

764
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,839
and we'll talk about revenge real quick

765
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,599
i would cut off uh harvest almost

766
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,439
everything except like

767
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,759
somewhere between two and five little

768
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,159
buds on the bottom just thumb size buds

769
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,400
my thumbs aren't super big uh thumb size

770
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,120
nuggets and leave foliage you need

771
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,720
leaves you can't just re-veg sticks you

772
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,319
need some foliage on there a bud with a

773
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,159
couple of leaves on it is ideal

774
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,720
somewhere between two and five thumb

775
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,039
size nuggets is all you need if your

776
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,558
plant is root bound i would repot it to

777
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,440
a bigger pot at this time that will

778
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,798
encourage the the re-veging process so

779
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,798
you've cut everything down you've left a

780
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,879
couple of buds at the very bottom two to

781
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,440
five buds the size of my thumb put that

782
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,640
plant under at least 18 hours of light

783
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,038
maybe 18 6 maybe 19.5 if you want to get

784
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,640
crazy put it under 24 hours of light i

785
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,319
really think some sleeping time does

786
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,278
everything nicely they really enjoy the

787
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,798
sleepy time ah you love a nap the plants

788
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,798
love a nap your equipment will

789
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,038
appreciate the nap your electricity bill

790
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,359
will enjoy the nap as well so maybe put

791
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,359
them under like 19 hours of light five

792
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,038
hours of darkness if you want to do 24

793
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,798
if you don't have a super intense light

794
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:50,960
do the 24 if you got a good light you

795
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,798
can adjust that so i would cut down

796
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,038
almost everything except the bottom five

797
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,200
ish nuggets

798
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,599
a pot it or do some root pruning if

799
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,159
you're experienced in that then put it

800
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,439
under 18 19 maybe 20 hours of light

801
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,960
depending on the quality of light which

802
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,960
you're able to give it then start

803
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,200
feeding it a vegetative nutrient mix

804
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,360
give it a high nitrogen diet

805
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,278
then just feed it as normal water it as

806
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,119
normal and then just wait eventually

807
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,798
that plant will start to spit out new

808
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,959
growth shoots

809
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,480
sometimes they'll come out looking crazy

810
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,159
they'll be twisty and spindly and

811
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,000
they'll look like they've got problems

812
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,000
that's what you expect from a reveg give

813
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,919
that a little bit of time it will begin

814
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,679
to turn into normal leaves you'll see

815
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,440
eventually it'll make one day it'll just

816
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,559
make a long normal shoot with beautiful

817
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,640
leaves coming out of the top you'd be

818
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,678
like oh that's a normal weed plant again

819
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,480
what i recommend is to clone that new

820
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,400
part

821
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,720
you've got that new fresh growth clone

822
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,360
that part make that the mother plant

823
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,120
grow that part out then cut clones from

824
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,519
that so it takes a little bit to get

825
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,798
there but that is the way i recommend it

826
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,639
re-veg it cut a clone veg out the clone

827
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,798
then cut clones from that one so that

828
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,720
you've got fresh plants to work with so

829
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,798
i think your strategy

830
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,558
is a really good idea that way you don't

831
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:03,839
have to wait for those clones to

832
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:05,839
root you don't have to try to keep them

833
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,038
alive you don't have to waste space

834
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,319
you don't have to cut the clones that

835
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:09,599
takes a whole that's a little bit of

836
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,119
time right there just depending on how

837
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,558
many plants you've got you want to get

838
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,839
two or three maybe five cuts of

839
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:15,119
everything that's going to take you a

840
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,879
couple hours maybe an hour right there

841
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,639
just to fill the clone dome so save

842
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
yourself some time don't cut the clones

843
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,080
that you don't need don't stress on

844
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,359
keeping them alive don't double up your

845
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:24,960
numbers

846
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,719
focus on finding that plant that is

847
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,640
perfect for you we talk about phenotype

848
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,480
selection a lot find that one that is

849
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,799
perfect for you find the two that may be

850
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,839
perfect for you select those keep them

851
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,599
get them in reveg get them cloned again

852
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,759
then what i recommend is have your

853
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,359
favorite one or two have a keeper plan

854
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,519
of that and then we're gonna do it again

855
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,199
we're gonna use your favorite two and

856
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,798
we're gonna veg those up but at the same

857
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,960
time we're gonna run another pack of

858
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,119
seeds so that we can compare another

859
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,200
pack of seeds to the two keepers the one

860
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,278
keeper we've already selected and keep

861
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,519
doing phenol hunts to find the best

862
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,759
plants until you've got a room filled

863
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,240
with the best plants right now let's say

864
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,558
that your legal limit is 10 let's run 10

865
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,079
seeds and find a keeper out of that now

866
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,240
you got one keeper out of that now let's

867
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,319
run nine more seeds and fill all 10

868
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,159
spots and then find a keeper out of that

869
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,918
one and now we've got eight spots left

870
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,159
let's pop eight more seeds until we fill

871
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,759
that whole room with nothing but badass

872
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,960
keepers or at least the amount of

873
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,319
keepers you desire or at least maybe one

874
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,519
marvelous plant that you just keep

875
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,960
upgrading all the time you're like this

876
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:26,639
one's better we're keeping that this

877
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,798
one's better we're keeping that keep

878
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,559
striving hunting for that best one then

879
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,720
cut a bunch of clones of that

880
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,359
then fill all of those tents with that

881
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,038
bad [ __ ] that you do fine so i think

882
