34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,840
you haven't already joined I do invite

35
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,519
you come hang out with us there are a

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,159
lot of great things on the the Discord

37
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,879
server uh first of all there is a strain

38
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,439
description and a strain report on

39
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,319
almost every strain available from IR

40
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,078
genetics right now they're in

41
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,319
alphabetical order they're separated by

42
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:45,078
regular and feminized uh you can click

43
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,519
on those strains and you can see grow

44
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:50,519
reports from the grow Community from the

45
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,158
IE Army you can see pictures uh grow

46
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,438
details you can ask questions you can

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,680
interact with people that have grown

48
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,959
those strains so if you want full grow

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,320
reports full grow details join us on

50
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,359
Discord those reports are on the Discord

51
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,000
server there are also a lot of grow

52
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:08,318
guides there are Sops on there uh clone

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,038
care sop uh the STS and reversal sop is

54
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,519
on there a lot of great things on the

55
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,399
Discord server also there are several

56
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,200
lounges where you can come smoke and

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,680
hang out with us there's a smoker Lounge

58
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,719
at Gamers Lounge come hang out join The

59
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,719
Vibes uh we have changed a lot of Vibes

60
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,519
and a lot of energy in the room lately I

61
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,800
Cally invite you to come hang out with

62
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,560
us on the Discord server there will be a

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,879
link in the show notes and the video

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,439
description also there is a link on my

65
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,959
website iry genetics.com okay I feel

66
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,959
like I've been rambling for a long time

67
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,598
let's get out of that let's work our way

68
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,800
here into the question and answer

69
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,280
portion of today's podcast I did say

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,200
we're going to talk about selecting a

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,080
phenotype I have a question that came

72
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,399
from my website iry genetics.com this

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,760
question came from my new friend

74
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,920
Alexander K the question goes a lot like

75
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,280
this it says rosted Jeff when you were

76
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:00,199
pheno hunting what parameters do you

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,400
personally search for in flowers and

78
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,079
hash this is a very good question so in

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,879
this episode we are going to focus on

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,480
selecting a phenotype for flour I mainly

81
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,840
grow personally for flour um I'm working

82
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,399
my way towards growing things for

83
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,239
concentrates but I'm not a concentrate

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,640
maker I do love to smoke the

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,200
concentrates but I grow mostly for

86
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,719
flower when I do grow the flower the

87
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,238
flower gets smoked as flowers um there

88
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,120
are plenty of other great concentrate

89
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,439
makers out there doing that uh let's

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
stick to the point here so in this

91
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,719
episode we're going to talk about

92
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,200
selecting a phenotype for flower now

93
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,560
what do I mean about this what do I mean

94
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,318
by selecting a phenotype a lot of people

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,878
uh might not even know what that means

96
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,560
what am I talking about when we buy a

97
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:42,158
pack of seeds uh whether they are

98
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,158
regular or feminized or even autoflow

99
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,239
seeds when you make seeds uh depending

100
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,199
on the filial generation of how far down

101
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,360
those seeds have been bred when seeds

102
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,919
are created there are going to they're

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,239
going to express different phenotypes

104
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,919
when they are grown so if I take we'll

105
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,360
just say we're going to say Golden Goat

106
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,280
and daybreaker I cross those two plants

107
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,360
together that makes my famous strain

108
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,000
called arise when you grow the arise f1s

109
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,799
that first filial generation not all of

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,759
the seeds look exactly not all of the

111
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,879
plants that come from those seeds will

112
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,280
look exactly the same some are going to

113
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,918
look more like golden goats some are

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,918
going to look more like a r or more like

115
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,079
daybreaker some are going to look just

116
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,120
like both parents perfectly combined

117
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,240
some are going to be weird mutants weird

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,800
different uh weirdos uh different

119
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,478
expressions of the genes however they

120
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,160
collided within that uh that breeding uh

121
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,519
think think about if think about

122
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,520
families that you know think about

123
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,000
brothers and sisters that you know uh

124
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,879
they've got the same parents but the

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,720
brother and the sister they'll have

126
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,560
similar uh characteristics and also uh

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,560
very different characteristics maybe one

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,918
of them's got so we'll say dad's got

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,319
blue eyes mom's got brown eyes maybe one

130
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:49,959
of The Offspring maybe both of The

131
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,759
Offspring have brown eyes that means

132
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,079
dad's got a dominant gene that he's

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,560
passing down that browney genan uh if

134
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,359
they both have different color eyes then

135
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,399
nobody's carrying a dominant eye color

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
Jean so it just depends on how the jeans

137
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,719
col slide when the breeding happens I

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,400
think I said that correctly that all

139
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,680
came out of the top of my head somebody

140
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,159
check me on my [ __ ] breeding chart

141
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,959
right there with mom and dad and my Gene

142
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,199
passing uh Theory there uh argue about

143
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,599
it in the comments I encourage you

144
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,800
educate me please if I said something

145
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
because I said it really quickly I'm

146
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,400
guessing second guessing myself so a

147
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,600
phenotype is just the different

148
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,839
expressions of those genetics also it's

149
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,479
based on it could be based on

150
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,918
environment a lot of this could be based

151
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,719
on how the plants are fed so it's a the

152
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:30,079
expression of a plant in a certain

153
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,280
environment the expression of that

154
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,359
genotype in a specific environment so

155
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,159
we're going to run uh we'll say that you

156
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,879
got 10 we'll just go with femin seeds

157
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,960
this time we'll say you got a six pack

158
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,000
of seeds we're going to see some

159
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,318
differences in there when we grow those

160
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,360
plants we're going to see uh maybe very

161
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,759
drastic differences maybe very minute

162
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,280
differences maybe you won't see a lot of

163
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,960
visual difference but when you smoke

164
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,198
them you might notice a lot of aromatic

165
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,120
or flavor or effect differences so a

166
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,840
phenotype a phenotype is the different

167
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,639
variation that we're seeing amongst the

168
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,879
population in the room I didn't Google

169
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,879
gole that I'm just pulling that

170
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,199
definition out of what I understand as a

171
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,759
grower that's what a phenotype is to me

172
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,520
uh the different when we grow plants we

173
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,360
see different Expressions that is a

174
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,079
phenotypical expression it can change if

175
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,439
you so if we take the same clone and

176
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,279
grow it in a different room we'll see

177
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,918
different Expressions that's a whole

178
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,279
another thing to [ __ ] talk about so

179
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,159
how do you find or how do I find when

180
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,758
I'm hunting what parameters do I

181
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,759
personally search for uh when finding a

182
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,520
phenotype one thing I want to touch on

183
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,840
is um when I've started putting strains

184
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:34,198
out on the internet and talking about

185
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,119
strains that I've bred I highlight

186
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,759
specific phenotypes that I have found

187
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,959
amongst these seed packs or amongst

188
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,038
these breeding projects or amongst the

189
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,638
progyny of cultivars I'm just trying to

190
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,879
use big words at this point um I have

191
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,079
given some of these phenotypes like

192
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,079
people know about the Mean Girl

193
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,399
phenotype and people know uh they're

194
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,879
just certain phenotypes that come from

195
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,918
certain plants they've been given names

196
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:57,240
and labeled uh they've gotten wellknown

197
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,279
I like doing that that's really cool

198
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,319
there's the uh the Painted Lady cut of

199
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,758
the Afterglow which has gotten famous at

200
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,400
this point kind of that's the Painted

201
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,560
Lady cut it's got its own name because

202
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,318
it came from the Painted Lady so those

203
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,120
cuts have their they get their own names

204
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,759
but what I saw the downside to that is

205
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
now sometimes you guys will run a pack

206
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,319
of seeds and you'll be looking for the

207
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,120
phenotype that I liked which is super

208
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,080
cool I bred it I understand why you want

209
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,720
the one that I liked but I'm not going

210
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,079
to smoke the pack that you're growing

211
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,000
you are so find the phenotype that you

212
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,680
like I appreciate I love I respect I

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
admire the fact that you guys want to to

214
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,560
find the phenotype that I'm smoking and

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,399
uh you want to find that one but what

216
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,439
about the one that grows best for you um

217
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,839
the way I like to describe it is you

218
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,279
agreed when you bought the pack of

219
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,719
whatever you got we'll say arise um

220
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,799
we'll say that arise I'm just making

221
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,199
[ __ ] up as we go here is Italian food

222
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,560
right you'll say you went through the

223
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,840
website you're like I'm not sure what I

224
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,319
want you settled on a certain pack of

225
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,959
seeds for a reason you're like oh it's

226
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,199
got this it's got this and it does this

227
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,279
I want this so you bought it you know

228
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,360
that the the thing you want is in that

229
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,719
pack of seeds that you've got the Allure

230
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,000
already you're looking you've got a

231
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,400
taste you've got an idea of what you

232
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,800
want you have to find the phenotype that

233
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:12,399
your brain makes you think you want the

234
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,840
way I describe it is that arises Italian

235
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,318
food right you're scrolling around

236
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,839
you're like what restaurant do I want oh

237
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,919
Italian food sounds good you've settled

238
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:21,758
on Italian now the phenotype is which

239
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,478
dish at that Italian restaurant do I

240
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,360
want because it's mostly all going to be

241
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:26,680
red sauce it's going to be noodles or

242
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,840
maybe you want the white sauce and the

243
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,319
Noki but it's all going to be Italian

244
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,278
it's going to have that Italian flavor

245
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,080
to it so you bought a pack of Italian

246
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,759
food now it's just your turn to pick off

247
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,440
the menu the favorite Italian food that

248
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,599
you want the way to do that don't listen

249
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,959
to me um I'm not going to choose you

250
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,560
don't want me to choose your meal for

251
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:46,278
you I'm uh mostly vegetarian most of the

252
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,119
time and I like garlic [ __ ] I like kind

253
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,799
of spicy I put some capers in there that

254
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,200
might not be for you at all you may be a

255
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,879
full red sauce and meatballs kind of guy

256
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,480
I don't judge you just don't order my

257
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,600
food I won't order yours so what I'm

258
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,839
saying is don't pick the phenotype that

259
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I want pick the phenotype that you want

260
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,079
the way to do that is to grow those

261
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,159
seeds grow them and I highly recommend

262
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,199
grow them all in the same conditions you

263
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,480
can't tell uh what's standing out you

264
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,160
can't tell who's better if you didn't

265
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,600
give everybody the same thing if you

266
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,360
gave this one plant recharge you gave

267
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,320
this one grow dots you gave this one uh

268
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,360
green sensation of course you're going

269
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,959
to see different [ __ ] give them all the

270
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,720
same exact thing uh do the feno Hun so

271
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,078
grow your plants until you can get a

272
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,480
clone take two or three clones off of

273
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:32,599
Every Plant label your plants I like to

274
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,240
give them numbers or letters plant one

275
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,320
plant two plant three it's not that hard

276
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,480
um especially if you're just running

277
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,800
small numbers a six pack of seeds 1 2 3

278
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,680
4 5 six label them when you take clones

279
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,078
give the Clones the corresponding number

280
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,639
clone one goes with plant one clone

281
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,879
number two came off of plant number two

282
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,439
then now we've got clones for those now

283
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,200
we we've got Keepers just in case we do

284
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,959
find something phenomenal and we want to

285
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,759
run that again we've got Keepers in the

286
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,639
Clone Dome they're over there waiting

287
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,600
for us pot those later when the time

288
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,720
comes so you run the pack of seeds you

289
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,159
get clones from everybody put them into

290
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,240
flour feed them all the same thing take

291
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,278
some notes as they're growing here's

292
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,120
where you're going to have two different

293
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,559
um different opinions as a grower

294
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,919
there's going to be one phenotype that

295
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,919
[ __ ] bangs out for you it's going to

296
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,919
put out all the weight uh it's going to

297
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,159
be huge it's going to be Frosty there's

298
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,159
going to be another one that smells

299
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,439
super good there's not those are never

300
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:29,039
the same [ __ ] phenotype the super

301
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,880
good smeller or the Frosty and the big

302
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,159
weight two different phenotypes you'll

303
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,600
get all three of those traits broken

304
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,919
down maybe two of those traits into two

305
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,839
different phenos but it's hard to get

306
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,639
all three when you find all three that's

307
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,000
a [ __ ] 10 that's a keeper so run the

308
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,278
pack of seeds watch them as they grow as

309
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the grower take notes which one was the

310
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,639
easiest or most pleasurable to grow also

311
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,120
take notes which one was the most pain

312
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,399
in the ass to grow there will be one

313
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
that's harder than everybody else to

314
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,919
grow that's just how it goes uh one's

315
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,120
going to be harder one's going to be

316
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,399
easier were those your favorite or least

317
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,399
favorite plants to grow think about that

318
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,000
then later on or also did one of did you

319
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,839
get spider mites did one handle that

320
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,360
better uh did one give you more weight

321
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
did one taste better did one give you

322
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,399
more tricomes uh did one have just a

323
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,919
crazy good [ __ ] smell uh was one

324
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,799
indestructible did you beat the [ __ ] out

325
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,838
of the plants and this one just shine

326
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,439
through like a warrior uh pay attention

327
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,480
to the plants as the grower then uh

328
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,560
Harvest them finish the plants grow them

329
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,680
to your best possible ability then

330
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,239
Harvest them dry them cure them trim

331
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,439
them to the best of your ability

332
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,519
then put them have them all in separate

333
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,880
jars the entire time plant one through

334
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,000
six all in separate jars all the buds

335
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,240
all the way through so that when we

336
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,399
smoke them we can take a bong rip or

337
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,278
smoke a bowl or smoke a joint or vape it

338
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,759
however you want to do it if you're

339
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,958
boofing it whatever you're up to but

340
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,240
take sample number one start with the

341
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,638
fresh clear head first smoke of the day

342
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,519
and take a smoke or a boof of sample

343
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,560
number one and see what it does to you

344
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,639
sit there for a minute taste it does

345
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,518
that taste real good does it taste bad

346
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,039
does it taste like what I want uh does

347
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,639
it taste like something I do not want or

348
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,399
maybe does this taste like something I

349
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,919
can sell that might be what you got to

350
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,958
worry about then enjoy number one take

351
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,120
notes if you're that kind of person um

352
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:16,319
write down your notes try not to let

353
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,198
here's the hard part try not to let your

354
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,760
um your bias as a grower uh come into

355
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:24,679
play as the smoker you may already be

356
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,559
thinking number two was the easiest to

357
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,479
grow put out all those tricomes I want

358
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,399
number two to be the winner don't do

359
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,399
that separate the grower from the smoker

360
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,958
you and let's just smoke them uh very

361
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,759
discerningly uh smoke number one get

362
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,958
your judgment then the next day wake up

363
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,000
fresh whenever you start smoking smoke

364
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,039
sample number two think about it how

365
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,240
does it taste how does it feel is it

366
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,879
what I want is it not what I want uh

367
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,440
there's a lot of things that you can

368
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,039
think about when it comes to selecting

369
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,959
your product uh is it first you're going

370
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,679
to see visually is it visually appealing

371
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:58,359
to me is it bright green is it dark

372
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,439
green is it blue is it black we is crazy

373
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,879
colors now is it [ __ ] purple is it

374
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,240
visually appealing does it smell good

375
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,720
not only does it smell good does it

376
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,919
smell like the flavor I was hoping to

377
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,519
get out of this package of seeds smoke

378
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,759
it does it taste the way that I was

379
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,560
hoping to get out of this package of

380
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,799
seeds the buzz exactly the same story

381
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,518
how is the buzz is this what I want are

382
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,039
you an Indica guy is this indica weed uh

383
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,159
are you a daytime smoker is this going

384
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:24,078
to be good for a daytime smoke do you

385
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,679
have a medical requirement will this

386
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:29,919
meet that requirement uh will this reach

387
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:31,359
your clients your client tells demands

388
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,159
so think about that as you're smoking it

389
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,720
work your way through sample one through

390
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,879
six try them all um try some with your

391
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,519
friends if you got a couple of good

392
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:40,799
friends at like I've got Mike that would

393
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,879
come over if I was like Mike we got to

394
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,679
do a feno hunt smoke selection Mike's

395
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,039
[ __ ] by the time I hung up the phone

396
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,919
the door would open he'd like come here

397
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:50,000
buddy let's smoke like everybody wants

398
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,639
to come help you out with a feno hunt so

399
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,278
do that pay attention to the jars the

400
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,720
first jar to get empty in your feno hunt

401
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,120
it's probably the plant that you should

402
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,199
keep that's probably the one you should

403
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,278
smoke the first one to go empty is the

404
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:04,278
one you liked the most uh you don't go

405
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:05,879
for your least favorite [ __ ] candy

406
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:07,919
every time you go for the first favorite

407
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,759
candy if there's a color of whatever you

408
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,240
got some candies INF ferny you got a

409
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,440
chocolate strawberry vanilla whichever

410
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,198
one your favorite is disappearing first

411
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,959
right you're going to take that

412
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:17,159
chocolate one every time most people

413
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,319
they going to be left with strawberry

414
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,719
and vanilla and be sad but that's how

415
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,879
you know which one is the best one that

416
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,320
jar that runs out of weed first grow

417
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,838
more of that that is probably the

418
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,160
phenotype that you want not even looking

419
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,800
at the notes let me get back on track

420
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,399
grow the pack run them do all the same

421
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,519
[ __ ] to every single one of them uh take

422
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,600
a clone from them so that oh yeah we've

423
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,519
got that clone that we took earlier that

424
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,959
one maybe two maybe do like a a tiered

425
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,399
system do a bracket match start with six

426
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,000
narrow it down to two take your favorite

427
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:50,000
two phenotypes and if you're allowed to

428
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,639
grow six plants cut three of each one if

429
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,679
you're allowed to grow you see the point

430
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,399
here fill half the room with one half

431
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,159
through them with the other run them

432
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,078
exactly the same round two fight let's

433
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,559
see who comes out better this time one

434
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,198
of those phenotypes is going to stand

435
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,599
out now you only got two to choose from

436
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,039
now which jar empties more quickly yeah

437
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,159
let's see how that happens so narrow it

438
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,278
down like a cage match start with six

439
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,480
then run your favorite two but you got

440
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,639
those clones back there that's what I

441
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,440
was [ __ ] talking about we got the

442
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,480
Clones keep the clones from your

443
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,880
favorite too we can run that forever we

444
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,000
got a mother plant if you took

445
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,000
successful clones don't let those clones

446
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,879
go away take clones keep Cuts

447
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,320
preservation all the time you can always

448
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:30,360
have those always do your bracket uh

449
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,639
cage match system so run the pack run

450
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,600
them all the same get your clones finish

451
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,919
them properly smoke them enjoy them try

452
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,199
not to let the grower in you be the

453
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,039
judge and let the smoker be the judge

454
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,240
because that's really what matters

455
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,719
that's where the money is no one's going

456
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,318
to see what happens in the grow except

457
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,879
you if one plant yielded you two pounds

458
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:52,198
and one yielded one pound I get why that

459
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,360
one even if it [ __ ] smokes the best

460
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:54,838
you still may have to do some

461
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,879
consideration with that if you're a cash

462
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,720
Cropper but weigh your pros and cons and

463
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,759
see what you got to do so um let me make

464
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,519
sure what Fen what are your parameters

465
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,318
now I've talked about I told you to how

466
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,639
to check yours I'm going to kind of tell

467
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:12,318
you how I do mine um most important to

468
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,399
me and I've kind of hinted at this um

469
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:16,318
the most important is Buzz and effects

470
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,240
where I'm not smoking just to taste it

471
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:20,439
I'm not smoking I'm not growing to look

472
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,680
at it I'm not grow growing I am not

473
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,120
growing just to post the [ __ ] to

474
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,719
Instagram I'm smoking this [ __ ] growing

475
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,759
it to smoke it to get high that's what

476
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,199
I'm trying to say here uh you take seven

477
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,199
dabs and come do a podcast and don't

478
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,559
stutter seven times you'll be all right

479
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,719
uh most important thing to me is of

480
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,518
course the buzz what else matters we're

481
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,920
we're going to [ __ ] smoke this to get

482
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,198
high that's what I want so the buzz does

483
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,719
it have a good Buzz a strong Buzz a

484
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:46,078
longlasting buzz and the type of Buzz

485
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,920
that I enjoy I like a lot of different

486
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,559
buzzes I like a nice head ringer

487
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,759
something that makes me [ __ ] like

488
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,399
when you're doing a podcast you think

489
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,159
you saw [ __ ] moving over there but

490
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,600
there's nothing over there about a wall

491
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,039
but sometimes bro the shit's moving over

492
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,240
there that's how you know you're smoking

493
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:01,719
good [ __ ] right or when you go to Target

494
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,720
and you got a shopping cart filled with

495
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,078
stuff and something in your head goes

496
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,519
hey man we got to leave man and you're

497
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,959
like but we're just shopping and your

498
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,439
heart goes I'm racing man we got to go

499
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,480
man and you just have to leave Target

500
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,279
that's the [ __ ] smoke I love so if

501
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,759
it's got that kind of buzz for me

502
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,558
awesome uh some people don't want that

503
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,879
kind of buzz some people smoke that buzz

504
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:23,038
and just grab their head and be like bro

505
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,199
I got to go lay down like it's just not

506
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,720
for some people so does it have the buzz

507
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,558
I want uh does that buzz have legs does

508
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,440
it last a little while for me I noce

509
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,119
some stuff I could smoke it and I get

510
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,200
[ __ ] wrecked for a minute and I'm

511
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,918
like that was really good weed hey wait

512
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,798
a minute I'm I got to smoke more weed

513
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,799
and I'm just not even high anymore like

514
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:43,918
some weed has no legs is what we what we

515
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:46,319
call that the next category that I think

516
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,000
I check on and this is as a smoker this

517
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,798
is not as a grower I'll talk about as a

518
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,119
grower I guess next um the next most

519
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,879
important thing is flavor and Aroma it's

520
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,319
got to taste good like if it doesn't

521
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,200
taste and smell good uh what's the point

522
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:00,639
there's so much good [ __ ] out there why

523
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,640
have something that doesn't taste

524
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,960
[ __ ] delicious so it's got to taste

525
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,759
good it's got to burn right um that goes

526
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,319
along with it that's the smoke ability

527
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,759
the flavor the aroma and overall smoke

528
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,639
ability do I enjoy the smoke does it

529
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,558
taste good how does it feel some weed

530
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,320
will leave a a funk on your lips some

531
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,879
will make your tongue [ __ ] dry and

532
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,000
crusty which sometimes I'll enjoy if

533
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,280
it's good weed uh the GMO will leave

534
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,558
that just coating on your tongue so we

535
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,240
going and everybody knows you got truck

536
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,599
mouth and you're like [ __ ] my [ __ ] is

537
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,679
dry bro

538
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,158
uh but smoke ability does it burn good

539
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,840
um most of the time that's a dry and

540
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,240
cure issue but some of it you just don't

541
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,158
like the way it even [ __ ] smokes it

542
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,759
gets hot it doesn't burn well it's a dry

543
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,520
and cure issue but uh flavor and Aroma

544
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,158
are my next uh categories there then

545
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,960
obviously visual I talked about that a

546
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,880
moment ago um visuals are a lot of it

547
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,519
even if the visuals don't have anything

548
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,480
to do with how it tastes or how I get

549
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:56,918
high from it but I like looking at

550
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,839
beautiful photogenic quality well done

551
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,038
weed so first C atory Buzz it's got to

552
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,000
get me [ __ ] lit up second category

553
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,440
flavor that shit's got to taste good

554
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,599
third category it's got to look pretty

555
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,000
for the bag so now let's talk about

556
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,279
growth characteristics and then we're

557
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,919
going to get out of this fine show here

558
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:16,599
uh growth characteristics that I do look

559
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,679
for in a pheno uh hunt uh basic shape

560
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,759
and structure and frame of the plant can

561
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,840
it hold itself up is it going to is it a

562
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,240
wispy piece of [ __ ] is it toppling over

563
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,798
can it support itself are the is it big

564
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,599
enough strong enough branches to hold

565
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,158
gigantic buds um then the next thing I

566
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,759
think about is leaf size and shape

567
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:36,080
because that's going to indicate a lot

568
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,200
of the buzz to me like it tells me long

569
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,279
skinny leaves probably [ __ ] crazy

570
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,400
sativa going to give me that [ __ ]

571
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,279
sort of Buzz that I like also going to

572
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,480
take a while to grow if it's got those

573
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,558
big fat indicia leaves uh that you could

574
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,960
camp under and build a shack with uh

575
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,399
it's not going to take as long to flower

576
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,720
it's going to give me a nice chilled out

577
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,679
sedative Buzz so that's a good hint of

578
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,319
what's going to happen uh then Bud type

579
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,159
and density how does that bud grow

580
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,519
um if it just grows wispy and shitty I

581
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,280
might not want to [ __ ] with it if it's a

582
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,918
nice looking bud is it Rocky is it

583
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,639
fluffy is it cone shaped is it got a

584
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,600
bunch of rocks a bunch of Blockhead at

585
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,360
the top I pay attention to that sort of

586
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:17,759
stuff then I want to think about like

587
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:21,158
tolerance uh can it handle uh problems

588
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:25,038
like heat cool overfeed underfeed uh

589
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:27,039
forgot to feed uh too much humidity um

590
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,279
drought all of the above problems

591
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:29,798
whatever you're going to do to it all

592
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,000
the things you [ __ ] up and forgotten

593
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:33,720
or accidentally did to your plants how

594
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,558
are these going to react that's what I

595
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,960
want to know like cuz sometimes I'm

596
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:39,079
going to [ __ ] up I'm a really good

597
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,159
experienced grower sometimes I [ __ ] up

598
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:43,079
sometimes the equipment [ __ ] up just

599
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,240
[ __ ] goes wrong so are the plants going

600
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,759
to handle it if there's a small medium

601
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,079
problem in the grow uh resistance then

602
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,359
or tolerance was what I was talking

603
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,000
about now resistance do these plants are

604
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,399
they prone to getting insects there are

605
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,759
some strains they just [ __ ] love bugs

606
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,559
and some strains uh blue dream is such a

607
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,919
shitty strain that spidermites don't

608
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,359
even like it I'm just joking around you

609
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:04,640
guys there's a bunch of hate for blue

610
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,639
dream in the commercial industry um it's

611
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,080
just a joke it's not that bad but um

612
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,360
yeah spidermites don't even like blue

613
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,960
dream so there are some cultivars that

614
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,759
spidermites won't go toward them there's

615
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,079
some that you could put three cultivars

616
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,200
in a room and the mites go that one and

617
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,879
they just head right for that

618
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,798
[ __ ] for some reason so is it

619
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:26,200
resistant uh to spider mites thrips

620
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,599
fungus snats powdery mildew Bud rot uh

621
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,640
is it the right type of so maybe perhaps

622
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,839
you're going to be growing outdoors in a

623
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,278
specific climate is it the right kind of

624
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:36,798
phenotype for your environment all my

625
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:39,038
friends on the coast up in the North

626
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,599
Coast the East and the West like do have

627
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,240
something that can handle a lot of fog a

628
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:44,199
lot of moisture and finish before I get

629
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,519
[ __ ] too wet outside that's a

630
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,120
phenotype that you guys could look for

631
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,519
um so those are things that I would pay

632
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:51,959
attention to the growth uh the shape the

633
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,158
structure a lot of same things I look

634
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,120
for when breeding um how does it grow is

635
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,159
it a pain in the ass does it handle does

636
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:01,199
it handle my room my program my feeding

637
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,360
that's also going to be a big factor CU

638
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,960
I'm not going to change the entire room

639
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,599
for one [ __ ] plant it's got to fit in

640
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,558
like fit in or get out that's the way I

641
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,719
feel about it so let me make sure that I

642
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:12,720
have covered all of my notes here

643
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,120
because I got a lot of stuff going on

644
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,400
basically pick the grow it grow that

645
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,879
[ __ ] pick the phenotype that you want

646
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,000
all of the advice that I give you about

647
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,799
phenotype the bottom line is pick the

648
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,400
one that you want the one you love to

649
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,400
grow and the one you love to smoke the

650
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,960
bottom line probably I must have watched

651
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,159
some Stone Cold [ __ ] cuz that's the

652
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,440
bottom line and and Stone Cold said so

653
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,960
but [ __ ] the end of the day the empty

654
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,240
jar is the one that people like the most

655
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,319
uh the one that's going to sell the best

656
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,400
it will probably get smoked up and

657
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,038
consumed the quickest so I think I've

658
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,080
covered more than enough on how to

659
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:45,919
select a phenotype this is going to be a

660
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,119
quick episode I'm not even sure how long

661
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,799
