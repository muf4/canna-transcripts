joining me you know I like to start the

show off by letting you know what I am

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,549
smoking today I'm taking dabs of the

32
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:16,589
copper Tim nectar from Green Dot labs

33
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:19,140
the copper chem is a combo of chem 4 and

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,420
star dog it's described as perfumey chem

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,670
with assorted fruit candies you know

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,350
when I smelled it it smells like like

37
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,109
chem dog to me it smells a lot like chem

38
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,969
dog but then there is a hint of copper

39
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:32,310
or pennies inside of there it's like you

40
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,810
ran a batch of chem dog hash you had the

41
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,549
chem dog nectar and then you just poured

42
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,439
some copper pennies right into it is

43
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,799
what this smells like to me then when

44
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:43,319
you dab it it's got a tennis ball fresh

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,450
tire sort of a smell Plus that copper

46
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,459
penny kind of stays on your tongue at

47
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,710
the end I do enjoy it and the high from

48
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,969
this is amazing it's got me going it's

49
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,279
got me talkative it's got my eyes

50
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,129
bugging out of my head this should be a

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,899
great podcast also I should give a shot

52
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,118
it's my friends at elevate glass today I

53
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,950
picked up a new banger I was taking dabs

54
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,409
of the copper chem nectar out of a brand

55
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,930
new banger with the insert and I got

56
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,700
smart I took one of my we call him

57
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,009
Turtles or turf spinners it's just a

58
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,139
little glass bead basically I took an

59
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,299
eight millimeter glass bead and I put

60
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:17,519
that inside of my insert where my insert

61
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,350
the insert that drops into the Banger so

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,510
I put my dab in there then I dropped the

63
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,250
tert pearl the spinner on top of the dab

64
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:26,429
inside of the insert then I heat the

65
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,740
banger then I drop the insert inside the

66
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,900
banger with the dab and the Terp spinner

67
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,490
in there then I carb cap it give it a

68
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,159
couple of seconds for that dab to start

69
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,320
melting then I start drawing on it and

70
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,659
moving the carb cap around and I noticed

71
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,109
that that Terp pearl or that Terp

72
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:45,180
spinner inside my insert dish really

73
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,530
helped to move that concentrate around

74
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,629
in there the more I wiggled that carb

75
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,860
cap I could watch the Terp spinner move

76
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:51,840
and then it would just push the puddle

77
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,450
of oil from one spot to another and I

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,489
feel like it really made my dad it

79
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:59,039
didn't burn it vaporized much more

80
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,300
evenly at a nicer speed at a nicer

81
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,400
temperature and I feel like none of it

82
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,989
settled on the bottom and started to

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,909
singe there because that Terr pearl was

84
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,610
moving it around so much so I did an

85
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:10,349
insert dab with the tur pearl inside the

86
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,410
insert I did not use the appropriate

87
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:15,180
carb cap to make the pearl spin but I

88
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:16,799
was able to move it around enough with

89
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,930
my carb cap something I have noticed you

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,410
guys just a change I've made in my

91
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,079
dabbing most of my carb caps have a semi

92
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:27,479
large opening for the air to flow

93
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,879
through my newest carb cap has a really

94
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,889
small opening it's really restrictive

95
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,799
and I feel like I'm getting better dabs

96
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,509
with a more restrictive carb cap I was

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,459
really satisfied with a thermal banger

98
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:40,349
but I think I am kind of slowly making

99
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,670
the switch to these insert dabs they're

100
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:43,169
a little more work they take a little

101
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:45,089
more to to prepare and a little more to

102
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,458
clean up but you don't need as many of

103
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,979
them and sometimes I actually enjoy the

104
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,530
ritual I think a lot of cannabis users

105
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,539
pot smokers we just enjoy the ritual of

106
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,729
getting our stash and spending a moment

107
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:58,530
with your stash whether it's grinding up

108
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,789
a little bit of weed to roll a joint or

109
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,019
maybe your old school maybe you're still

110
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:03,359
picking the seeds out of your herb

111
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,099
that's part of the ritual you get your

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,170
stash out your little secret stash and

113
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,030
you got your album cover or whatever it

114
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:10,048
is that you use to work on your stash

115
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,030
and then you go through the little

116
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,310
ritual actually enjoy the ritual of

117
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,750
which tab do I want to hit I grab a

118
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,280
little container and like ooh the copper

119
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,199
cam and then I pick myself out of dab

120
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,089
and which-which rig am I gonna hit I'm

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,620
gonna do an insert dab so I put a little

122
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,299
dab in the insert and then I thought ooh

123
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,038
I'm gonna put a pearl in there and then

124
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,900
I'm gonna heat up a rig and it's just a

125
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:30,719
really nice ritual I've been enjoying

126
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,459
the new rituals of preparing the insert

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,840
tab then enjoying the insert tab and

128
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:35,459
then of course there's a little bit of

129
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,779
cleanup you got to pull the insert out

130
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:38,279
then you got to clean up the insert then

131
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:39,929
you got to clean up the Banger and then

132
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,579
hopefully you just repeat the process

133
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,680
and take a couple of more dabs but

134
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:44,969
insert dabs have been a lot of fun for

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,889
me I've really been enjoying it getting

136
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,870
a lot more flavor and I feel like it is

137
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,150
conserving my concentrates a little bit

138
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,769
better since I'm not burning that first

139
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,508
initial part of the dab off as soon as

140
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:57,329
it hits the Banger I feel like I'm

141
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:59,788
getting more I'm getting to consume more

142
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:00,839
of my dad's that I'm paying for so

143
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:02,459
that's what I'm smoking on today you

144
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,288
guys I'm taking dad's of the copper chem

145
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,959
nectar I'm hitting a hit man

146
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:09,120
hammerhead sidecar rig with a quartz

147
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,878
banger I'm loading the dab into an

148
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,250
insert I drop a Terp spinner or a pearl

149
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,259
inside of the insert a Heath Ian or heat

150
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,348
the bangor drop the insert into the

151
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:21,538
bangor then i cap it with a bubble cap

152
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:22,769
that is also very restrictive and i give

153
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:24,418
it a couple of seconds to start melting

154
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:26,788
and you guys i've been getting some of

155

the main topic of the show a lot of

165
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:48,240
people listen to the podcast on stitcher

166
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:50,399
radio stitcher radio is an application

167
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,199
if you're not using stitcher that's fine

168
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,698
you're not missing anything your life is

169
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,228
probably better for it already

170
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,090
if you're listening to the show on

171
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:59,968
stitcher and you are still experiencing

172
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:02,008
problems I do apologize I've been in

173
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:03,718
contact with stitcher quite frequently

174
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,848
over the past couple of weeks and we are

175
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:08,519
working to resolve the issue we are not

176
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:10,918
sure why my show is having problems on

177
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,418
stitcher radio what I would recommend if

178
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,128
you were a stitcher listener and you're

179
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:16,198
having issues I would recommend you just

180
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:18,750
jump over to youtube and watch the show

181
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,379
on youtube every episode is available on

182
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,968
YouTube episode 1 through 346 is up on

183
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,849
youtube so you can watch everything

184
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:28,680
there YouTube does not compress my sound

185
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:31,589
quality so it probably sounds better on

186
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,060
YouTube anyway and the loading issues

187
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:34,679
that people are experiencing will not

188
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,300
happen on YouTube like they are on

189
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,949
stitcher so if you've been listening on

190
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,050
stitcher and having issues again

191
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:42,240
do apologize I encourage you just to

192
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,319
jump right over to YouTube and if you're

193
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,569
not already subscribed to the YouTube

194
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,069
channel I encourage everybody to go

195
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,259
subscribe to the Grove from your heart

196
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,939
podcast YouTube channel I'm getting a

197
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,339
lot of subscribers and I do appreciate

198
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,259
that support alright you guys I feel

199
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,509
like that's a solid intro for a podcast

200
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,370
I'm gonna press pause I'm gonna take one

201
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,469
of these insert dabs and when I come

202
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,569
back I'm going to talk about the

203
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,030
function of carbohydrates in your

204
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:17,879
cannabis grow take a dab with me you

205
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:20,159
guys I'll be right back all right

206
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,159
podcast world I am back I am well

207
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,650
hydrated I am heavily medicated I took a

208
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,300
big old dab of that copper Kim I had to

209
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:28,829
go chill out on the couch for a second I

210
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,600
had to go get some Instagram time in

211
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:32,579
after that that was a little bit more

212
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,320
than I bargained for thanks for hanging

213
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,689
out with me I hope you took a fad I hope

214
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,949
you're smoking something delicious just

215
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,300
know that if you're stuck at work if

216
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,579
you're in a cubicle or something I'm

217
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,650
probably high enough for both of us

218
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,539
right now but that's okay I'm not

219
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:47,969
driving I'm sitting in a chair I'm safe

220
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,890
I'm not at work so nobody can fire me

221
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,780
and hopefully when you get off work

222
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,550
you've got a big fat joint rolled up at

223
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,099
home so you can get as high as I am

224
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,230
right now now let's turn down that music

225
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,170
a little bit and get into a podcast

226
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:04,040
about carbohydrates let's start right

227
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,270
off at the top what are carbohydrates I

228
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,150
guess I should be more specific because

229
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:11,629
these are carbohydrates in plants in

230
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:13,620
cannabis plants even more specifically

231
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,959
carbohydrates are compounds produced

232
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,439
during photosynthesis and plant

233
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,939
carbohydrates have two main purposes

234
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,370
their first purpose is to provide

235
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,110
building blocks for plant structural

236
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,139
components such as cellulose which is

237
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,970
important in building cell walls the

238
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:34,110
second purpose of carbohydrates is to

239
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,090
deliver energy for plant growth plants

240
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,430
make food in the form of carbohydrates

241
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,889
by combining carbon dioxide and water

242
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,529
and using energy from either the Sun or

243
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,629
our grow lights now our plants can

244
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,919
immediately use or they can store the

245
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:48,809
carbohydrates and those stored

246
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,569
carbohydrates can be converted to

247
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:53,839
cellulose or other

248
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,450
structural carbohydrates now excess

249
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,790
carbs are stored in the plants roots and

250
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,600
leaves and primarily are stored in the

251
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:04,219
form of starches the plants store those

252
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,409
carbohydrates to use during the

253
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,779
flowering phase when the daylight hours

254
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:10,909
are reduced the plants aren't able to

255
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,309
produce as many carbohydrates because

256
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:16,009
the lack of sunlight or grow light

257
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:17,329
energy so they have it stored up for

258
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,279
when that time comes now

259
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,410
most of the carbohydrate production and

260
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,959
our plants will happen during the

261
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:26,839
vegetative phase and it will taper off

262
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,320
during the first three weeks of the

263
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,090
bloom phase so basically by the end of

264
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,280
the third week the start of the fourth

265
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,440
week of bloom the carbohydrate

266
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,679
production in cannabis plants basically

267
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,330
has stopped without our assistance if we

268
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,489
don't step in and add something there

269
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,710
will be no carbohydrate production

270
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,279
through the rest of this plant's life so

271
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:51,290
that's when we step in and we add

272
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:53,419
carbohydrates now just because the plant

273
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:55,669
stops producing its own carbs around

274
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:57,769
week three or four a flower doesn't mean

275
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:59,870
you have to wait until then to start

276
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:01,850
supplementing the carbs you can add them

277
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,259
early on in the plant's life you can

278
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,269
start them when the plants get big when

279
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:07,009
they're in veg because the carbs do have

280
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:09,289
another function that I'll talk about a

281
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:11,090
little later in the show so you don't

282
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:12,769
have to wait until the plants stop

283
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,230
producing their own carbs to introduce

284
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,329
your own now we understand that

285
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,129
carbohydrates are a source of energy and

286
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,500
also major building blocks for our

287
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:23,779
plants and we also understand that our

288
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,789
plants stop producing them on its own

289
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:27,589
around the third or fourth week of

290
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:29,299
flower now that's right when our plants

291
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:32,030
really start taking off we start seeing

292
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,409
bud set happen that stretches over and

293
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:35,809
we're starting to get chunky buds right

294
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:39,230
around that time so that's when we need

295
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:42,769
a lot of energy that carbohydrate energy

296
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:46,129
is used to produce big buds big robust

297
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:49,429
stems lots of trichomes and then a lot

298
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:51,080
of essential oils so our plants running

299
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:54,049
out of carbohydrates right at that

300
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:57,440
crucial time that essential time is kind

301
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:59,750
of detrimental to a cannabis grower now

302
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,690
most plants aren't designed or expected

303
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,009
to perform the way we expect our

304
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,550
cannabis plants to perform

305
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:09,379
we want the biggest fattest most potent

306
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:11,959
product we could possibly create in the

307
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:13,939
shortest amount of time in the smallest

308
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,650
amount of space with the best resistance

309
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,880
to bugs and the best resistance to

310
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:22,610
pathogens but nature didn't intend for

311
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:25,039
this plant to become a rocket ship or a

312
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,610
Formula One race car nature intended

313
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,929
this plant to survive and be good enough

314
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,629
nature made this plant to where it would

315
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:34,639
grow and get an apical dominant top that

316
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,409
would receive pollen more likely than

317
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,909
the lowers so where it had that that

318
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:39,500
huge hey look I'm right here to

319
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:40,969
pollinate me and it made a tour of the

320
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,889
male plants grow taller it's where it

321
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,230
would drop pollen down and it knew if I

322
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:48,429
do this I should survive so cannabis

323
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:51,529
evolved to be a survival plan we

324
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:53,599
manipulated it and bred it to be this

325
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,519
high-performance plant that we're trying

326
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,220
to get out of it nature never intended

327
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,049
this from the cannabis plant it evolved

328
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,090
fir the tons of years I don't have any

329
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:04,189
idea how long honestly but the plant

330
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,350
evolved for thousands of years by itself

331
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,690
without humans touching it it survived

332
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,060
we're trying to push it to do something

333
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,680
it was never expected to do of course

334
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:14,629
we've done some breeding to create

335
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,669
genetics that were ideal for our indoor

336
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:19,309
environment we've done breeding to find

337
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:21,399
the high testing cultivars we have bred

338
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,809
it to be a high-performance machine

339
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,120
because we've realized that it's a

340
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:28,219
commodity and so now after realizing

341
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,830
it's a commodity we want to push our

342
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,560
plants to the extreme and we expect them

343
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,210
to outperform themselves crop after crop

344
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,819
you always hear a grower would you pull

345
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,050
this time I got two pounds perlite cool

346
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,629
bro you better get two and a quarter

347
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,949
next time you're like oh [ __ ] not only

348
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:44,210
is that a lot of pressure on the grower

349
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,790
that's a lot of pressure on that

350
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,220
cultivar maybe that plant can't do that

351
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:52,219
maybe like if you've got some of the

352
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,810
older more finicky og cush is two pounds

353
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,550
of light you should be happy you know

354
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,119
what I mean if you're like I got two and

355
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:58,309
a quarter

356
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,570
you're [ __ ] you're Jesus of growing

357
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:01,429
back in the day if you were doing that

358
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,080
with some of the og plants and some of

359
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:04,669
the equipment that we had and then you

360
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,009
were expected to do even better on the

361
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:09,079
next grow so that's crazy so we've got a

362
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:11,299
lot of expectations for these plants and

363
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,580
we've bred them to try to meet these

364
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:16,009
expectations so now that we've bred

365
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,720
monsters we've got to feed them like

366
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:20,629
monsters we've got to meet their

367
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,839
expectations which is now more energy in

368
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:25,730
the form of more carbohydrates so to

369
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,529
keep our plants running strong after

370
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,639
their natural carbohydrate production

371
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:32,778
has ended we step in and we add our own

372
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,970
carbohydrates if you ever seen your

373
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:37,490
plants slow down like right around week

374
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,860
four maybe the start of week five a

375
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,560
flower and you can't figure out why like

376
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,810
your pH is on point the co2 is cool

377
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:48,378
the lighting is just fine you got enough

378
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:50,568
airflow in there the VPD is good maybe

379
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:52,490
those plants were lacking carbohydrate

380
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:53,899
energy that's why they just slowed down

381
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,430
just a little bit they could have gone a

382
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,980
little bit faster you've seen them go

383
00:13:55,429 --> 00:14:01,219
faster before maybe they just ran out of

384
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,778
energy so consider your physical

385
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,519
performance right now like just think

386
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:06,559
about what you do your physical

387
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,379
performance level on a daily basis

388
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:13,039
consider your nutritional intake and

389
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:14,870
what it takes for your body to perform

390
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,909
the way you do what do you have to eat

391
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,188
to keep your body in shape to do that

392
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:21,379
how many calories do you have to consume

393
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:23,870
to have the energy to perform your daily

394
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:26,539
tasks now you're performing at your

395
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,578
normal natural level your expected level

396
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:30,588
now let's say if I expected you to

397
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:33,109
increase your performance by thirty

398
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:36,170
percent I want you to work 30% harder

399
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:39,019
30% longer and I need a production of a

400
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:41,088
minimum of 30% more do you think I'd

401
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,379
probably have to increase your feed and

402
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,850
your pay I don't have to increase your

403
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:46,100
pay also but but I'm gonna have to

404
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:49,308
increase your feed by a minimum of 30%

405
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,649
to try to get 30% more production out of

406
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:53,299
you or you're gonna burn out now keep

407
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,938
that in mind with your cannabis plants

408
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:58,099
it's the same sort of thing with your

409
00:14:55,938 --> 00:15:00,889
plants when we start introducing things

410
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,430
like high end nutrients double-ended

411
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:06,438
Gavita bulbs co2 supplemental LED

412
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:08,599
lighting and then we start implementing

413
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,919
things like pruning the bottoms off and

414
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,470
then we do things like cracking the

415
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,360
stems we're expecting a lot from our

416
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,790
plants and we need to provide those

417
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:21,139
plants with the proper nutrition to see

418
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:22,818
the results which we demand alright now

419
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:24,799
that we understand what carbohydrates

420
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:26,568
are and what they do in our plants and

421
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,789
why we need them and why we need to add

422
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:30,678
them ourselves let's talk a little bit

423
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:32,339
about how we can add the carbohydrates

424
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:34,449
our

425
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,820
don't try to fool your feed a

426
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,440
carbohydrate product to your plants if

427
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,910
you go spraying carbs onto your plants

428
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,450
are just gonna clog [ __ ] up it's gonna

429
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:46,000
be a gross mess don't do that the best

430
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,490
way to feed carbohydrates is to add a

431
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,889
carbohydrate product to your water and

432
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,700
your nutrient solution just like any

433
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:56,350
other bottle nutrient and water it in

434
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,850
carbs are best absorbed through the

435
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,769
roots now right away a lot of people are

436
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,110
gonna tell you to add molasses to your

437
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:04,059
feed solution to increase your

438
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,250
carbohydrates I have used molasses in

439
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:09,129
the past but I wouldn't recommend just

440
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:12,100
store-bought molasses I wouldn't do that

441
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:13,779
back in the day yes I did do that maybe

442
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,340
back in the day I have said to do that

443
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:17,289
but I wouldn't do it anymore

444
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,830
store-bought molasses is really

445
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:23,079
unreliable it's very inconsistent not

446
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,060
only from brand to brand from region to

447
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,950
region but you could buy the same brand

448
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:28,689
you could buy two bottles and you could

449
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,879
pour that molasses into two bowls and

450
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,110
there'll be two different consistencies

451
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,120
two different colors two different

452
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,639
smells and we like a little bit of

453
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,379
regulation in cannabis growth so that we

454
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,330
know what we are feeding our plants that

455
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:43,090
way if we see a problem we know it was

456
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,900
that and maybe not maybe that I don't

457
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,750
want to say it could have been the

458
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:49,329
molasses so stick with a horticultural

459
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,830
product you organic guys they like to go

460
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,990
all organic you're gonna probably just

461
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:55,509
want to use molasses that's fine you

462
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,029
know what you're doing go for that in my

463
00:16:55,509 --> 00:17:00,789
opinion the molasses is a little bit too

464
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:02,620
thick it also invites other problems you

465
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:04,720
can kind of suffocate your roots with

466
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,359
too much molasses in your feed solution

467
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,000
and it also molasses contains other

468
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,399
elements a lot of molasses will contain

469
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,588
sulfur and like I said earlier we don't

470
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,180
want to add a random feed to our plants

471
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:19,629
we were only trying to add carbohydrates

472
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,370
not sulfur so the molasses is not a good

473
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,079
idea that's gonna disrupt your feed

474
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,309
program throw off your plants health

475
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,959
it's gonna be hard to monitor because

476
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,419
you don't know what's in that molasses

477
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,000
it could be a myriad of things messing

478
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,130
up your process so if you're using any

479
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,890
hydro definitely stay away from the

480
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,840
thick molasses II type syrupy kind of

481
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,480
products those are really just gonna

482
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:43,269
clog up your entire hydro system so be

483
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,880
very careful with that also if you

484
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:46,619
overuse the molasses

485
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,900
you can't flush it out and your buds

486
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:51,089
will burn like [ __ ] in the end like I'll

487
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,350
admit it a long time ago I wasn't always

488
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:54,359
a really good grower I had to be a

489
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:56,129
shitty grower to become a good grower in

490
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,479
a long time ago I wouldn't always read

491
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,420
the internet I wouldn't do the proper

492
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,069
research but I did have a grower friend

493
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,050
that I trusted and he said bro just pour

494
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:06,000
this much molasses into your 5-gallon

495
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,710
thing a [ __ ] nutrient solution mix it

496
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,660
up get all that molasses mixed in there

497
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,970
then water the plants with it and it

498
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,460
will be great I weigh over did the

499
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,289
molasses in my opinion because when I

500
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,779
smoked those plants they burned like

501
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:20,279
[ __ ] I it was like smoking a charcoal

502
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:21,629
okay you put it in the grinder and he'd

503
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,990
grind it up in the grinder would like

504
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,610
skip because the buds were so hard and

505
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,950
that was I'm certain it was from the

506
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:30,509
molasses and when they burned it was it

507
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,039
just all stayed there there was no white

508
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,109
ash crew in there that was black

509
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,129
charcoal ash and it was from way too

510
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:39,569
much molasses so I recommend not using

511
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,430
molasses but if you're going to use it

512
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:43,379
use it sparingly and if you're an

513
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,480
organic grower that's probably going to

514
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,690
be your first option for a carbohydrate

515
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,059
sweetener type of project product is the

516
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,529
molasses just read a little bit and see

517
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,539
if there are any other options that will

518
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:55,710
satisfy you for your organic grower I

519
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,569
understand if you want to go completely

520
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,549
organic and molasses is your thing don't

521
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,679
let me stop you make yourself happy I'm

522
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:03,000
just giving you my two cents and if you

523
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,710
want to take it go for it if you want to

524
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,569
grow your way I encourage that grow your

525
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,340
way that's one of my favorite things

526
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:09,839
about cannabis is that my grow is

527
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:11,490
totally different than your grow and

528
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,199
they both work we both put a product on

529
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,730
the table at the end of the day that is

530
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,769
a top shelf product that people enjoy

531
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,420
and it works for our needs so that's the

532
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:21,180
beauty of growing cannabis do what works

533
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:24,210
for you this is just my uh my input so I

534
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:26,250
know I said I wouldn't use molasses and

535
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,400
I try not to pitch products too much on

536
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:32,009
my show but here are three products that

537
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,290
I am familiar with that I have used that

538
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:37,440
have worked great for carbohydrates in

539
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:39,930
my grow a long time ago one of the best

540
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,759
crops I ever grew I used a product

541
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,310
called Humboldt honey

542
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,379
Humboldt honey has yucca extract

543
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,809
Humboldt honey has a lot of great things

544
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,050
in it and it really made my product

545
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:53,970
taste nice and sweet humble honey they

546
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:56,849
have regular humble honey and they have

547
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,230
a humble honey hydroponic blend which is

548
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:58,769
a little thinner so you're not gonna

549
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,539
mess up

550
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:04,920
your lines so humble honey is a great

551
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:06,359
product also I like high bricks high

552
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,240
bricks is from a company called earth

553
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:12,149
juice I really like the way Hybris mel's

554
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,509
it's mostly molasses another product I

555
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:19,950
really do enjoy is called suka nat sugar

556
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:21,299
cane natural suc ca na t suka nan i

557
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,509
learned that one from our friend sub

558
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:26,940
cool probably 10 years ago and those are

559
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:29,339
three products that you can use for

560
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,900
carbohydrates again I don't get paid by

561
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:32,549
a carbohydrate company those are things

562
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,880
I've got experience with it worked for

563
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:34,440
me

564
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,000
I like the hybrids because it's very

565
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,600
natural it doesn't have a lot of

566
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,670
additives

567
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,259
I liked the Humboldt honey because of

568
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,090
the additive I like that

569
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:44,099
yucca extract in there I feel like it

570
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:45,809
did a little something for my plants the

571
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:47,639
sukkah net that's old-school I was using

572
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:50,549
that a way long time ago

573
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,770
now some of those products will be a

574
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,049
little molasses C and earlier in the

575
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:57,200
show I said don't buy molasses now why

576
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:59,669
am i recommending molasses-based [ __ ]

577
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,799
because this stuff has been filtered and

578
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,090
it's a little more consistent than the

579
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,740
stuff it's being sold for a

580
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:07,289
horticultural product it has to meet a

581
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,269
standard it's not just food food can

582
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:10,319
have a little variation because it could

583
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:13,139
taste different it can look a little

584
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,730
different its food we expect that as a

585
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,560
horticultural product they put a little

586
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,180
different standard to it I would like to

587
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,669
think I can't promise you that I can't

588
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,990
assure you that but the consistencies

589
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,640
are a little better to work with when

590
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,000
you're buying them as a horticultural

591
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,759
product the botanic air blackstrap

592
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,140
molasses is really thick and a pain in

593
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,299
the ass to work with if that's what

594
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,100
you're thinking you're gonna do I'm not

595
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:36,809
gonna try and discourage you that stuff

596
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,240
is a pain in the ass to work with you

597
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:41,159
get a big old container of just it looks

598
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,859
like tar and it's really hard to work

599
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,750
with but back in the day I went through

600
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:48,329
several containers of it and it was all

601
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,460
very consistent so that's what I'm

602
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:52,139
saying about don't buy molasses from the

603
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,569
store like the grocery store don't go

604
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,430
buy granny's blackstrap molasses go to

605
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:58,919
the Hydra store go to a gross store and

606
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,769
get a horticultural product that is more

607
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,289
homogenized more regulated and more

608
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:06,960
uniform and more consistent so that that

609
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:08,490
way you can dial it in and that's

610
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,840
usually the opposite of what I would say

611
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,700
usually I would say if you can find that

612
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,029
product and not at a gross store go get

613
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,009
it

614
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:15,750
at a gross store but for this one

615
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:19,019
occasion I'm gonna recommend that you

616
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,490
get an actual growing product now I just

617
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,619
did a quick google search just so I

618
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,390
could do some price checking and it was

619
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:26,069
funny because I was ended up on a forum

620
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,600
and everybody says that the blackstrap

621
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:29,009
molasses is a pain in the ass because

622
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,959
they end up wasting half of it because

623
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:32,519
of the stupid container that's what I

624
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,710
said before I even went for the Google

625
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,029
search now what comes up when I look for

626
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,480
high Brix and when I look for Humboldt

627
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:38,399
honey

628
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,630
high Brix is mostly molasses it's a

629
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,280
little bit diluted so that it works

630
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,960
better they don't say that they add

631
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,579
anything to it they just say that it's

632
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,829
been thin to where it works for your

633
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:49,829
plants the Humboldt honey has additives

634
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:51,539
and it is quite pricey compared to the

635
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:53,129
high Brix if you've got a little money

636
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,629
to spend I would say throw it at the

637
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,850
Humboldt honey if you're trying to go

638
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,070
low budget I think that high Brix would

639
00:22:56,849 --> 00:23:00,899
make you and your plants just as happy

640
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:02,849
and like I said earlier if you're trying

641
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,830
to go all organic I think the hybrids

642
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:06,599
may qualify I think it is listed as

643
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:08,879
organic but if you want to stick with

644
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,919
just molasses that is up to you just

645
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,780
keep in mind if they do add things or

646
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,720
there could be things in the molasses

647
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:18,029
that you're not aware of and if you do

648
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,950
choose to use either the blackstrap

649
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:23,009
molasses from the store or the botanic

650
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:25,650
hair kind stir it up make sure it gets

651
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:27,629
diluted or dissolved or whatever because

652
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,820
it's really really thick and it's gonna

653
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,860
take a long time a lot of stirring to

654
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:33,779
break that stuff down so that's another

655
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:35,639
reason just to work toward either some

656
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,769
humble honey or the high Brix it'll make

657
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,450
your life a lot easier and you'll find

658
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:42,389
yourself spending less time cleaning up

659
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,160
sticky [ __ ] honestly I'm using the

660
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,930
Hybris right now because I stopped at a

661
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,730
local grocer and they did not carry

662
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,950
Humboldt honey and the hi brick was

663
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,289
quite affordable so that's the product I

664
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,330
chose and I've been using the Hybris off

665
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:56,279
and on for several years shot it's my

666
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:58,559
friend Donovan from way back in the day

667
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,470
who introduced me to earth juice

668
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,990
nutrients all right you guys earlier I

669
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,809
mentioned that carbohydrates had an

670
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,630
additional benefit to our grow that they

671
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:11,399
would be useful from early on in our veg

672
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,350
stage all the way through the end of

673
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,180
flower so let's talk about that added

674
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:17,250
benefit that I hinted about earlier

675
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,500
another added benefit of carbohydrates

676
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,410
is that they will feed your microbes in

677
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,210
your root zone all that recharge or that

678
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,350
mammoth pee or that great white shark

679
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,630
that you've been pouring in there

680
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:30,298
it needs to be fed all that beneficial

681
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:33,750
fungus is hungry and it will use these

682
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:37,168
carbohydrates as food and fuel to keep

683
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,460
living and reproducing so your carbs are

684
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:40,679
working double-time they're giving your

685
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,929
plants extra energy and they're also

686
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,519
feeding your microbes which are keeping

687
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:46,890
the roots healthy keeping the roots

688
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,990
happy which are also helping the plants

689
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,490
absorb more carbohydrates which are

690
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,829
making the plants healthier you see how

691
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,940
it all works it's all in symbiosis here

692
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:56,609
when we get everything dialed in

693
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,529
everything works together so well in the

694
00:24:56,609 --> 00:25:00,750
garden all right you guys that is my
