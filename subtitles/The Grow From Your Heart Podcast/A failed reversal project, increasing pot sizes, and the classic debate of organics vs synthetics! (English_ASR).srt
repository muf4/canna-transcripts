00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,919
start of the podcast um I do want to let

61
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,280
you know that we made a few changes to

62
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,318
the Discord server that's right uh we

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840
changed the rules and we added a new

64
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:34,439
chat room along with that came a new

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,400
gate to get into the Discord server it

66
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,120
appears that many people are hung up on

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,920
that new rules gate when you go to the I

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
Army Discord server and it appears that

69
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,359
you are stuck click on that little box

70
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,598
that says rules or new rules I'm going

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,280
to go look I can't see it because I've

72
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,359
already clicked on it there's a new box

73
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,158
that says rules click on those rules and

74
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,200
reclick that you agree and then you will

75
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:56,000
be allowed into the server it seems like

76
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,919
many people are stuck on that age gate

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,959
on that new rule gate uh if you can't

78
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,719

83
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,840
when we added the new chat we had to add

84
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,679
the new box and that seems to be

85
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,840
tripping a few people up so the Discord

86
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,400
did not go away the Discord is still

87
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,560

102
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:45,598
us in The Smokers Lounge there is a new

103
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,000
chat that is called the gloves off

104
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,798
lounge or the gloves off chat it is

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,079
exactly as described uh it is gloves off

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,920
people may say things to you that bother

107
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,280
you in there but you can say [ __ ] that

108
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,759
bothers them WR back in that chat uh

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,560
keep it respectful keep it fun it's all

110
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,479
in good fun but there are no rules in

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,239
that chat so if somebody pisses you off

112
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,518
and says something weird you just got to

113
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,959
deal with it in there if you're not into

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,719
that stay upstairs in the smoker's

115
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,000
Lounge the Grover's Lounge there are a

116
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,719
lot of rules there but be prepared for

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,280
that gloves off Lounge because it is

118
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,040
exactly what it sounds like all right

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
I've made the Discord update we have

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,799
talked about oh the next thing I want to

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,959
talk about if you've been following

122
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,758
along you have heard that I have been uh

123
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,279
working on some GMO reversals that's

124
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,919
right I've got the skunk Master Flex cut

125
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,879
of the GMO plant uh quickly that does

126
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,719
not stand for garlic mushroom onions in

127
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,719
any way the reason that GMO is named GMO

128
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,520
is because when that plant became

129
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,240
popular also at the same time the Girl

130
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,959
Scouts of America were selling their

131
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,600
cookies and it was discovered that those

132
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:48,038
cookies were highly made with a lot of

133
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,080
GMO products there's a lot of

134
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:53,120
genetically modified product going into

135
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,159
the Girl Scout cookies so uh the GMO

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,079
plant is a Girl Scout cookies cross it

137
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,360
is chem dog I think it's chem 4 uh and

138
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,359
the Girl Scout cookies they br that

139
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,439
together to make a plant uh a dude named

140
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,879
skunk Master Flex was growing it he

141
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,319
found a phenotype uh that smelled super

142
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,439
funky and he called it GMO because the

143
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,639
Girl Scout cookies of America Scandal

144
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,600
had been so popular in the news so the

145
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,639
GMO idea kind of inspired the name to go

146
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,800
with the GMO plant it does not stand for

147
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,478
garlic mushroom onions quit saying that

148
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,759
that's not real it's because of the Girl

149
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,599
Scouts of America controversy at the

150
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,199
time uh that's what that name came from

151
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,680
uh I love the plant it grows really well

152
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,160
it grows kind tall and stretchy but you

153
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,478
guys know that's the [ __ ] that I seem to

154
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,840
like uh it makes amazing concentrates it

155
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,839
makes super funky Aromas and flavors

156
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,079
like this uh garlic pungent funky dirty

157
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,359
bar trash can sort of a garlicky mashed

158
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,959
potatoes sort of thing I really love

159
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,080
that Aroma and flavor I wanted to

160
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,719
reverse the GMO and put that pollen on

161
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,399
nine different females I had nine ladies

162
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,039
in a tent ready to rock everything

163
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,198
looked like it was going well you can

164
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:59,038
see where I'm headed with this cuz I'm

165
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,720
talking that it failed ladies and

166
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,599
gentlemen I Ed used three different

167
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,479
solutions of products to reverse the GMO

168
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,800
all of the reversals were successful I

169
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:10,199
got beautiful anthers pollen sacks if

170
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,000
you will I treated a female plant with

171
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,759
three different Sol three different

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,839
clones of the same plant with three

173
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,199
different solutions in an attempt to see

174
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,279
which would work best for reversals all

175
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,478
three reversed the plant beautifully

176
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,519
lots of male flower clusters on this

177
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,439
female plant lots of pollen sacks if you

178
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,279
will all over this plantet looked ready

179
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:32,680
to go uh but one thing I noticed it was

180
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,439
not making any pollen I let these plants

181
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,840
go much longer than I've ever let

182
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,439
reversals go before and I did not get

183
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:43,399
one single flake or dust of pollen out

184
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,360
of the reverse GMO plants um they went

185
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,679
for a long time I gave I gave up on them

186
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,919
I let them go and I just put them in the

187
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,598
dark I thought [ __ ] it we'll see what

188
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,159
they do they didn't even do anything

189
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,478
after being left in the dark for several

190
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,080
days they turned really purple and

191
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:58,120
looked really beautiful but I did not

192
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,758
get any pollen from the Reversed GMO so

193
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,639
if you're out there working with GMO and

194
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,120
you've reversed it and made pollen share

195
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,560
your secrets with me I [ __ ] give up

196
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,439
I'm not doing it again I wasted too much

197
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,680
time on that but uh so the reverse GMO

198
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,038
project did not work a lot of people ask

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,478
me have you ever had reversals or

200
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,560
breeding projects that just completely

201
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,758
failed uh yes reversed GMO was a

202
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,199
complete waste of time I've got nine

203
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,919
females in an AC Infinity tent that are

204
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,079
uh ripe and ready for pollen and that

205
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,639
reversed GMO looked like it was going to

206
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,639
give me pollen It reversed it made the

207
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,038
pollen sacks they were empty his nuts

208
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,720
were empty no pollen at all I put some

209
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,478
on black paper and rubbed it around and

210
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,479
you could not find one flake of pollen

211
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,279
on the black paper uh completely empty

212
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,839
dry no pollen at all so that was a

213
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,559
failure what I did since I had a bunch

214
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,239
of female plants that were ready to go

215
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,360
they were itching for pollen it was

216
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,439
prime time I had some other pollen in

217
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,158
the freezer I grabbed that pollen I let

218
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:51,319
it adjust to room temperature before I

219
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:53,519
used it I didn't want to go sprinkling

220
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,960
Frozen pollen that didn't seem smart I

221
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,198
put it on the table right here I let the

222
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,079
pollen warm up for several hours uh

223
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,079
later on that night I had a nice bag of

224
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,198
pollen uh then I took that pollen and I

225
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:05,800
sprinkled that bag of pollen all over

226
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,038
the room the pollen was a little bit old

227
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,478
so I'm not sure how well it took some of

228
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:11,598
the pistols have turned brown and

229
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,240
withered up that could be because of the

230
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,240
age of the plants that could be because

231
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,199
of the pollination at this point it's

232
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,360
too early for me to tell if any seeds

233
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,240
have formed if the pollination took

234
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,080
however if it did take I will let you

235
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,759
know which plant I used for that

236
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,240
pollination right now I don't want to

237
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,879
tell you what pollen donor it was

238
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,639
because if it doesn't work that's two

239
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,639
times that I've hyped you up on a cross

240
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,639
let you down so I'm not going to do that

241
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,799
but the update is that the GMO reversal

242
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,718
simply did not give me any pollen so all

243
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,120
of those GMO reversals we were drooling

244
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,919
over we were excited about not going to

245
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,080
happen I apologize [ __ ] happens that's

246
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,278
breeding life um as a breeder as a

247
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,680
grower as a farmer I understand that's

248
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,600
[ __ ] life that's how it went that's

249
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,958
how it goes guess what I'm going to

250
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,120
gather my sticks and I'm going to move

251
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,719
on and keep going and try again I had a

252
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,959
backup plan I used other pollen we'll

253
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,839
see if that pollen was viable if not I

254
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,879
get a whole 5x5 full of great flowers

255
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,680
that Mike and I are going to get to

256
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,919
smoke and we will try again with a

257
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,239
different plant in the near future I

258
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,199
know what the next crosses are going to

259
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,519
be I've got another feminized cross

260
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,399
coming up um then after that we'll be

261
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,879
more Golden Goat crosses but yes it's

262
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,799
just keep going keep trying uh so the

263
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,519
reason for this was to let you know uh

264
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,519
the GMO did not make any pollen those

265
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,679
crosses are not coming and then also

266
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,919
just to share with you not everything is

267
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,639
a wild success this was a crazy

268
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,919
miserable failure not miserable there's

269
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,399
no misery to it it was heartbreak breing

270
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,958
watching these plants build these

271
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,480
beautiful flowers and no pollen come out

272
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,919
of them for days and watching the girls

273
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,600
go hey we want pollen so bad and this

274
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,919
guy's going I just can't do it bro I

275
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,920
just can't do it uh that was

276
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,919
heartbreaking but bottom line pollen

277
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,278
didn't work the next bottom line going

278
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,159
to keep moving forward the crosses

279
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,720
aren't coming we adapt we adjust we

280
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,838
overcome we keep going that's what we do

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,360
question came from my new friend Vince

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,759
the question goes just a little bit like

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,278
this it says hey rosta Jeff I'm a new

316
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:09,480
listener and a new subscriber I just

317
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,000
popped my first seeds in Rapid rooters

318
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,519
and I transplanted straight into 5

319
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,799
gallon fabric pots all right so you got

320
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,839
your first seeds they popped in the

321
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,958
rapid rotter then you pop them into 5

322
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,959
gallon fabric pots all right this makes

323
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:25,000
sense I understand it says my question

324
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,439
what is the benefit in transplanting

325
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,440
into smaller pots first and have I

326
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,160
hindered M grow in any way by by

327
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
skipping the smaller pots thank you for

328
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:35,600
your help your new friend Vince hey

329
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,879
Vince this is a great question uh

330
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,240
quickly just to make you feel better

331
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,919
right at the beginning you did not

332
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,720
hinder the plants in any way um I will

333
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,838
talk about why we do this the reasoning

334
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,079
we do it the pros and the cons and then

335
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,240
next time you can decide if it's

336
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,159
something you want to do or not the

337
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,240
first reason I myself and most uh

338
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:56,439
cultivation spaces Growers areas prefer

339
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,240
to go we call it graduated pot size I'll

340
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,480
start off with a 6-in net pot maybe a

341
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,720
small 1gallon pot so my clone comes out

342
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,759
of the cloner or my seeding Sprouts goes

343
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,200
into a 6-in net pot or a 1gallon pot the

344
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,399
reason I like that is because that

345
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,600
little tiny pot only takes up this much

346
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:17,600
space in my grow room so while my plants

347
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:20,320
are only 1 in 2 in 3 5 7 8 9 in tall I

348
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,519
only need a 6in net pot one gallon pot

349
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,800
that's probably 10 in in diameter 8 in

350
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,320
in diameter worth of space for that

351
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,679
plant um I'm probably going to pop a 10

352
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,399
pack of seeds so now I've got 10 small

353
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,559
pots if I put all of those pots in 5

354
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,159
gallon pots or all those plants in 5

355
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,078
gallon pots my 10in root zone now

356
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,360
becomes what is that like 20 in it's

357
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:42,838
probably 18 inches for a 5 gallon pot at

358
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,759
least 14 inches I'm a drummer so I'm

359
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,160
going off snare drum size it's about the

360
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,759
same size as a snare drum maybe a little

361
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,480
bigger you're looking at 14 or 16 in I'm

362
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:54,679
able to fit those 10 one gallons under a

363
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,879
very tiny light and very little space so

364
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,838
the First Advantage is the amount of

365
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,039
space I can get them all in a smaller

366
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,839
space since they're in a smaller space I

367
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,759
can use less light because they're not

368
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,279
spread out so far they're all in one

369
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,519
confined contained area so I'm using

370
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,519
less space as a grower you're a new

371
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,278
grower it sounds like um space will

372
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,440
become very valuable to you the more you

373
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,519
grow the longer you grow the one thing a

374
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,440
grower wants more of is more grow space

375
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,519
constantly so that real estate is very

376
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,440
expensive so the smaller pots for

377
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,039
smaller plants give me more real estate

378
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,160
I don't have to waste big pot space for

379
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,480
little tiny plants then I can cram more

380
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:32,319
in there and then I can veg more and

381
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,639
then if you're setting up a Perpetual it

382
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,120
gives you more space space is the bottom

383
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,799
line then the second uh issue is light

384
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,879
if I've got uh 10 pots in big [ __ ]

385
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,359
space I need more light to cover that

386
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,278
that starts to get expensive now I'm

387
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,278
running light which costs energy when I

388
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,679
run that light now I have to have a fan

389
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,919
now I have to have possibly an air

390
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,519
conditioner a humidifier a dehumidifier

391
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,078
the more space you use the more light

392
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,278
the more gear it starts compounding and

393
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,239
getting more expensive quite quickly at

394
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,000
that point the next thing I think about

395
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,600
is feeding and watering these plants uh

396
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,799
there's a couple things to think about

397
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,399
if your root zone is only this big you

398
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,439
only need this much water to saturate

399
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,679
your plant and water it satisfactorily

400
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,639
sat to satisfaction fill in the words

401
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,439
there ad lib however you will but you

402
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,079
only need so much water to water this

403
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,040
little space there's a couple of

404
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:21,559
advantages to that uh water costs money

405
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,799
the nutrients you are feeding those

406
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:26,078
plants cost money if you've got to feed

407
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,719
a one gallon pot you only need one

408
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,319
portion of water if you're feeding a 5

409
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,600
gallon pot you need five as much water

410
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,000
hypothetically that brings me to another

411
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,879
issue when that small plant is in that

412
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,278
big root Zone in that big pot and all

413
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,039
that soil it's easy to overwater and uh

414
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:44,120
flood that plant and drown it because

415
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,919
you've got such a big root Zone such a

416
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,000
big dirt area that you need to get water

417
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,919
to the whole Space where the roots are

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,360
but the roots aren't established and

419
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,958
strong enough and big enough and going

420
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,759
deep enough to handle all the water that

421
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,919
you're giving it so now you're creating

422
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,039
issues with that the soil is nice and

423
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,278
saturated but the plant is actually [ __ ]

424
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,879
[ __ ] struggling because it doesn't

425
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:03,879
have the root Zone to handle that much

426
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,639
water so in a smaller container The

427
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,078
Roots would develop more and they would

428
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,120
establish more and you wouldn't over

429
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,599
water is easily because you don't have

430
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,560
there's not much room for as much water

431
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,680
so it makes it easier to water it makes

432
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,599
it safer to water and it saves you water

433
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,599
and nutrients so we're already saving

434
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,800
lights air water oh and it doesn't take

435
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,360
as much soil to fill that space so if

436
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,159
you need to if you're on a budget you're

437
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,600
going to buy that soil next week you can

438
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,159
just let them grow in those small pots

439
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,680
for a couple of weeks once they get

440
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,838
bigger start to get rootbound then put

441
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,479
them into those bigger pots so the first

442
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,120
thing is space the second thing is light

443
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,560
the next thing is watering and feeding

444
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,879
them you're going to need more water and

445
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,799
more feeding so your bottom line is did

446
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:44,639
I mess up by not uh graduating pots what

447
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,439
I prefer to do is I go from that clone

448
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,159
into the one gallon I let it grow until

449
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,720
it's almost root Bound in there I like

450
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,838
to if I lift that pot off the plant I

451
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,879
like to see Roots all over that pot I

452
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,680
like to see it nice and full then I'll

453
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,759
take that one gallon and move it into

454
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:00,638
either a three a five or a seven and

455
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,079
this situation just like you I'm going

456
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,399
to go to a five I would fill up my 5

457
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:07,599
gallon pot and then I would take the pot

458
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,440
that the plant is in and I would plop

459
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,519
that pot right into my my pot my new pot

460
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,319
follow along it makes sense and bury

461
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,560
around that pot what I'm doing now is

462
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:18,919
making a template of where that pot is

463
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,000
going to go then I take that pot out of

464
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,439
the dirt and remove the pot off the root

465
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,559
ball then I grab the root ball from the

466
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,399
bottom and I kind of stick my fingers in

467
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,399
there and pull that root ball apart a

468
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,198
little bit those roots in and that dirt

469
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,639
are super tight in that pot they've kind

470
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,799
of grown into there they've made this

471
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,639
nice perfect cylinder shape just like

472
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,120
the pot they came out of I want to grab

473
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,079
that and disrupt that I want to break

474
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,600
that a little bit up then I want to put

475
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,479
that into my new soil and I want to

476
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,759
leave maybe a/ inch exposed uh out of

477
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,920
the new soil I don't want to bury that

478
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,079
whole that whole thing I want to leave

479
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,078
excuse me I'm burping and trying to

480
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,120
fight through this but I want to save

481
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,919
about a half inch exposed because that

482
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,560
is a good space for air to get to my

483
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,439
plant if I do over water those roots can

484
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,599
receive oxygen through that top little

485
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,880
layer of soil there I will not drown the

486
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,679
plant so I pop I dig that hole I make

487
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,959
the little template hole take the pot

488
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,798
off break up that soil a little bit and

489
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,000
then just plop that right into that hole

490
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,160
and leave it up just just a little bit

491
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,558
just a fraction of an inch maybe a half

492
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,000
of an inch just to leave a little bit of

493
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,678
air space for that uh for those roots

494
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,038
then I back fill it and then I water it

495
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,759
just like that but my reason for

496
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:25,519
breaking up those roots a little bit is

497
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,160
I believe that that encourages them

498
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,918
they've been going into that pot and

499
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,120
wrapping around and spinning and just

500
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,880
trying to find somewhere to go they

501
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,959
filled all the space within that pot

502
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,760
within that soil if I break them up a

503
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,600
little bit it kind of encourages them it

504
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,359
goes hey we can go play guys we've been

505
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,879
freed up a little bit and they start

506
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,119
traveling different directions and it'll

507
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,160
fill your soil your container much more

508
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,519
evenly and much more rapidly if you

509
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,038
break them up a little bit give it a

510
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,558
little Head Start give it some

511
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:52,599
encouragement uh so I fill the pot with

512
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,359
dirt most of the way put that pot with

513
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:55,918
the plant in it in there fill it up

514
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,479
around the pot make myself a nice

515
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,320
template take that out uh pull the pot

516
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,079
off the the plant break up the roots a

517
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,038
little bit plop that in there and then

518
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,279
just bury it kind of kind of nice and

519
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:07,960
not snug not tight just pack it in there

520
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,759
just brush the dirt over it don't cover

521
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,600
that top you you might see just a little

522
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,400
ring right at the top in the middle

523
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,519
that's your little air area and then I

524
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,080
mix up a decent feed I'll do a basic

525
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,480
base mix uh maybe a light CAG a little

526
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,839
bit of liquid Karma um depends on if

527
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,720
you're going to put potassium silicates

528
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,399
in there or not that's up to you but at

529
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,839
this point I would definitely feed some

530
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,200
sort of root inoculant uh some sort of

531
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,158
microbes of course I'm going to

532
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,200
recommend recharge shout out to my buddy

533
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,520
Scotty reel uh but get some microbes in

534
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,120
there and get those roots grow and you

535
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,798
got a really good opportunity to feed

536
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,319
those roots and get them going shebang

537
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,798
right now so that is my basic how I

538
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,158
transplant and that is why uh because I

539
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,798
don't want to waste all that space the

540
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,440
plant's only this big why do I need a

541
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,319
pot this big for it wait till the plant

542
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,120
gets this big then give it a pot this

543
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,519
big I think it'll really help out save

544
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,839
you some space water time energy maybe

545
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,720
you can build a Continuum with all your

546
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,000
free prizes my friend Vince I think I've

565
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,880
question goes a little bit like this it

566
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,640
says hey rosta Jeff I appreciate all the

567
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,520
knowledge you have been dropping on us

568
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,038
hey I'm glad you're here for it it says

569
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:49,319
my question is about organic versus

570
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,359
synthetic nutrients that's a this is a

571
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,519
very good question and a great debate it

572
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,879
says which one is best for H Growers to

573
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:59,480
use and with what growing medium this is

574
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,320
a very good question um I am a little

575
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,558
bit biased but let me try to stay uh

576
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,798
even here and not biased at all and stay

577
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:10,839
objective and give you some solid advice

578
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:13,400
um both work very well for you both will

579
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:15,918
work very well for home Growers both uh

580
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,559
will give you very great results it is

581
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,600
kind of what you prefer there is no

582
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:21,720
better or best I'm not going to there is

583
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,240
not a better or best when it comes to

584
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,600
synthetic or organic uh there are pros

585
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,120
and cons to both uh the pros I think to

586
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,918
synthetic nutrients or you can buy a

587
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,918
bunch of bottles from the grow store and

588
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,600
you can go to the website uh let's just

589
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,200
say you went to the store and you bought

590
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,439
botanic hair you bought five bottles of

591
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,798
Botanicare nutrients you can go home and

592
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,159
you can go to the website type in

593
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,440
Botanicare Nutrient calculator and it

594
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,600
will show you on week one feed 10

595
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,200
milliliters of this per gallon feed five

596
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,319
Ms of this per gallon on week two feed

597
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,360
this and this and this on week three so

598
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,918
the advantage the pros to bottled

599
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,119
nutrients is you can go to the store and

600
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,600
buy everything you need in a bottle go

601
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:02,839
to the website and find a recipe week by

602
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:05,678
week that will work for your garden and

603
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:08,158
you will have a successful grow that's a

604
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,640
huge Pro it's that easy they hold your

605
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,640
hand they sell you the [ __ ] they tell

606
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,919
you how much to put in how often to do

607
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,200
it you do it if you pH it correctly and

608
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,038
feed it like they say it works every

609
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,880
time repeatable process repeatable

610
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:22,319
results that is the pro my favorite pro

611
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,320
to bottled nutrients you can go to the

612
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,439
store when you buy bottled nutrients

613
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,278
it's the same thing every time it's

614
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,798
there all the time you can order it all

615
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:32,720
the time it's reliable repeatable

616
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,359
processes and results that's my favorite

617
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,558
thing that is the pro the cons uh it's

618
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,678
not organic there are you're paying for

619
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:40,278
a lot of the time you're paying for

620
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,600
water to be shipped across the country

621
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:44,240
you're buying bottles of water [ __ ] that

622
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,038
is mixed with water and you're paying

623
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,880
for it also it's not organic let's talk

624
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,759
about the pros and cons of organic a lot

625
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,880
of people like the pro of organic

626
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,720
because the word organic it means it

627
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,400
comes from the earth it is healthy it

628
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,240
gives us the idea that it's safer and

629
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,880
cleaner organic just basically means

630
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,440
that it is carbon based so now let's

631
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,559
talk about the cons of organic cyanide

632
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,840
is organic and it can [ __ ] kill you

633
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:11,798
so don't get too caught up in the word

634
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:13,720
organic um in this case when we're going

635
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:17,000
to talk about Organics we're going to

636
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,600
focus more on the products and the idea

637
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,558
of building an organic uh product and

638
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,158
not the buzzword of it's natural so it's

639
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,038
better for me because like I said a

640
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,919
moment ago if we put cyanide in our weed

641
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:30,519
it's not going to be good so let's just

642
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,640
focus on the organic construction we're

643
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:34,119
not being sold by the it's better cuz

644
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,799
it's organic we're just going we're

645
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,798
going to use the natural version like

646
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:39,720
the building blocks naturally version

647
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,038
organic for this conversation here I

648
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,200
hope that makes any sense to you because

649
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,558
it barely makes sense in my [ __ ] head

650
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,759
so organic I like the organic idea

651
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,079
because depending on which meth there's

652
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,480
so many different methods you want to

653
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,000
take to you could take to this you could

654
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,159
go to the store and you could buy boxes

655
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
of uh all the meal the bone meal blood

656
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,720
meal fish meal Kel meal you could go get

657
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,400
all that stuff that is organic um to

658
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,278
that you're going to premix all of your

659
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,159
soil and let that cook and then you'll

660
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,640
put the plants in there and that stuff

661
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,000
will become bioavailable over time so uh

662
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,520
that is how the Organics are going to

663
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,599
work for your bottle nutrients you're

664
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,400
going to feed today and basically what

665
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,480
you feed today those plants are going to

666
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,440
start eating that today with the

667
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,278
Organics you got to let it break down

668
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,440
it's got to become bioavailable to the

669
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:26,240
plants um the bottled nutrients have

670
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,720
what are called keates and buffers

671
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,720
inside of them those keates basically

672
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,120
force your plant to eat so with the

673
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,798
Organics The Roots roam around and go

674
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,599
hey there's minerals and nutrients and

675
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,879
vitamins and [ __ ] that I need over here

676
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,079
oh look nitrogen oh phosphorus potassium

677
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,679
I'm going to eat some of that and then

678
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,678
it goes oh I'm hungry I've had a lot of

679
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,000
phosphorus there's some here but I'll

680
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,640
kind of wait until I need that we'll

681
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,440
metabolize that later when you're

682
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,600
feeding the bottle nutrients the plant

683
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,558
goes ah [ __ ] phosphorus I'm going to

684
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,959
take all that just because the way that

685
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,278
it's chelated the way that it's

686
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,519
processed in that bottle the way that

687
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,440
it's formulated the roots touch it and

688
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,599
the roots go I'm supposed to eat this

689
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,360
and they just take it up right away so

690
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,678
there's pros and cons there with the

691
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,918
Organics you're going to mix your

692
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,278
nutrients all into that mostly into that

693
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,278
soil depending on how you do it that's

694
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:11,599
why I'm talking about the so many

695
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,640
methods uh if you go buy all the boxes

696
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,079
you premix it make sort of a a super

697
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,038
soil sort of an idea out of your

698
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:19,158
Organics that's going to cook and it's

699
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,798
got to release over time and your PL if

700
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,440
it's not in there if you did not already

701
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:23,679
put it in there it's not going to be in

702
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,480
there for your plants it's going to take

703
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,320
a little while for your plant if you do

704
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,839
feed a tea or a top dress it's going to

705
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:31,480
take a while for the plants to notice

706
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,158
that if I'm feeding bottled nutrients uh

707
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,399
they're going to notice right away very

708
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,720
quickly if I'm feeding a soilless mix

709
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:39,839
I'll see results two to three maybe five

710
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,919
days if I'm feeding cocoa I may see

711
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,038
results within four to 6 hours maybe

712
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,240
even quicker depending on how badly I

713
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,879
[ __ ] up feeding those plants so there

714
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,159
are a lot of pros and cons the the

715
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,840
chelation is a big difference it's like

716
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,880
um it's sort of like eating I'm trying

717
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:57,000
to exp it's sort of like uh so it's like

718
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,399
eating a big healthy meal or taking a

719
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,720
bunch of steroids um the Organics is

720
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,918
like eating you got a plate of food in

721
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,759
front of you you just keep eating and

722
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,320
you eat and you get what you need with

723
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:06,839
the bottled nutrients it's like I'm just

724
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,879
shooting the minerals and the nutrients

725
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,079
and the vitamins directly into your neck

726
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,760
and you're [ __ ] getting them if you

727
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,158
need it or not you're going to get too

728
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,798
much of something you're going to get

729
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,320
possibly overloaded on something and you

730
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,679
might see some detrimental effects so

731
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:22,038
that's the kind of the differences on

732
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:24,519
Organics and synthetics uh I prefer and

733
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:26,440
this is just me I run fully bottled

734
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:29,158
nutrient systems a lot of dry nutrient

735
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,360
powder nutrients but I do the synthetics

736
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,120
the salt system is my way to go the

737
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,038
reason I do that is because I came I

738
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:38,278
developed I learned very strongly in a

739
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:40,319
commercial production environment and a

740
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:41,798
lot of times I'm teaching other dudes

741
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,678
how to do this I'm the cultivation

742
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:45,158
leader I got a group of dudes that are

743
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,320
going to mix up these nutrients when I'm

744
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:47,919
not there there are going to be guys

745
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,119
mixing up these Solutions and feeding

746
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,759
the plants so like I said earlier I need

747
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:55,000
to be able to write a recipe on Monday

748
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,558
feed it like you're going to mix up 500

749
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,599
gallons of water and put this many

750
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,038
milliliters of Base nutrients this much

751
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:04,119
cow mag this much Bloom booster this

752
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:06,398
much cic uh cissi oh excuse me for the

753
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:08,199
burps but I want to write down a recipe

754
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:11,199
that the guys at the grow or the gals at

755
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,200
the grow can repeat to Perfection on a

756
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,679
daily basis and in a commercial

757
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,399
environment I need to be able to adjust

758
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,159
on the fly if I see that this room is

759
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:20,759
doing something weird I need to be able

760
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,399
to feed it and correct it Organics is

761
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,079
just not my my way for a commercial

762
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:26,918
environment many people out there do it

763
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,319
successfully and they do it very well

764
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,960
it's just not how I prefer to Do It um

765
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,240
they're mixing up their super soil their

766
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,519
living soil before they even put plants

767
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,880
in it they're letting that cook for a

768
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:37,798
little bit they plant the plants and the

769
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,399
plants live in that soil forever they

770
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:41,639
don't ever have to get fed any bottled

771
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:43,519
nutrients but if that mix is not right

772
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,679
at the beginning you're screwed all the

773
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,278
way through you're going to be mixing up

774
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:49,200
teas and chasing it and trying to find

775
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:50,759
Solutions so in a commercial environment

776
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,000
I think that for a large scale

777
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,759
production for me the bottle nutrients

778
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,480
are just easier and more repeatable uh

779
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,480
every time there's the same amount of

780
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,679
everything in the those bottles in the

781
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,880
Organics um if you're making ferments if

782
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,120
you're making teas depending on how much

783
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,520
of what you put in you could get highly

784
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:09,918
variable results so but that's not as

785
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,519
critical because your plants are going

786
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,440
to take that up as it needs it so there

787
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,599
are pros and cons I keep saying there

788
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,120
are pros and cons I'm going to tell you

789
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:20,439
there's no better uh neither one is best

790
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,918
or uh least least or less than is what I

791
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,399
think I'm trying to say they're both

792
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,120
great it's all about your approach how

793
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:28,759
do you want to do it do you want to do

794
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:30,439
like fermented fruit juices and um fruit

795
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,278
extracts and [ __ ] like that to feed your

796
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,640
plants which I'm not knocking it it

797
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:35,398
sounds like a lot of fun I have a couple

798
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,880
friends who are into jadam and my

799
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:38,199
buddy's like bro I was out hiking today

800
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,679
and I came across a whole bunch of

801
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,399
whatever flowers and I cut a bunch of

802
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,720
them put them in a bag brought them home

803
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:43,879
made a [ __ ] tea out of them and fed

804
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,720
it to my plants and I'm like that's

805
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,600
actually pretty cool like that's much

806
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,278
more sustainable than what I'm doing

807
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,278
I've got to go to the store and buy [ __ ]

808
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:54,319
so if the store runs out of [ __ ] I can

809
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,159
fall back on those Organics uh but uh I

810
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,678
don't know how to do it right now but my

811
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,278
buddies that are doing the Organics

812
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,080
they're all already doing it uh one

813
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:05,640
friend that I do have that uh grew

814
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:07,398
organically uh with Organics for several

815
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,600
years since I met him he's been growing

816
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:11,879
Organics then our friends at New

817
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,079
Millennium gave him a box set of all the

818
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,640
New Millennium nutrients and he ran it

819
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,240
and the first thing he said to me was

820
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,440
that he wished he had all of the weed he

821
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,960
had been shorting himself by running

822
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Organics uh he was quite impressed with

823
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,640
the uh the size of the yield he improved

824
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,240
his yield quite a bit by shifting to the

825
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,038
bottle new nutrients I was the only

826
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,120
thing that he mentioned was different

827
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,919
he's like bro I wish I had all the weed

828
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,639
I've been shorting myself all of these

829
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:37,799
years I'm not going to call you out bro

830
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,200
you know who you are still a great

831
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:41,278
grower he's actually running a

832
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,798
commercial facility now and I'm pretty

833
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,278
sure it's all on bottles and not organic

834
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:48,240
so he shifted uh went from the Organics

835
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:50,720
to the bottles I am rambling let me

836
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,640
check my notes Here I said cide is

837
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,278
organic don't get caught too much caught

838
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,200
up on buzzwords if you're going to grow

839
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:57,640
organically uh make sure that there's a

840
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,720
reason behind it make sure that you

841
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,278
didn't just choose it for hippie

842
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,319
nonsense reasons um also the Organics is

843
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:06,079
much more long-term and sustainable if

844
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,839
you want to do this forever if you want

845
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,839
to do this when Babylon Falls and the

846
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,720
lights go out and we're relying on the

847
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,759
sun and mixing our own nutrients the

848
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,519
organic way will still be viable I won't

849
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,038
be able to go to the grow store and buy

850
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,359
a bottle of liquid Karma I'm going to

851
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,158
have to learn how to make that [ __ ] on

852
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,319
my own which I got all you hippie

853
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,278
friends for that thank you I'll trade

854
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:24,720
you seeds for some knowledge but um

855
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:26,240
that's one of the big advantages when

856
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,640
Babylon Falls when the trucks quit

857
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,960
running when the stores are gone jadam

858
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,278
will be jaming still um it's um it's

859
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,000
sustainable that's the best part of the

860
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,599
Organics in my opinion um and you don't

861
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
have to keep going and buying bottles

862
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,839
I'm getting bottles shipped to me and

863
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,079
there's water in them and that feels a

864
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,678
little bit ridiculous uh both can have

865
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:46,599
repeatable results if you understand

866
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,278
what you're doing I can't repeat the

867
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:50,158
results in the Organics because I don't

868
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:52,000
know what I'm doing yet so I think I've

869
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,278
been rambling long enough the question

870
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,119
is my question organic which one is best

871
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,038
um and with what growing medium uh

872
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,278
neither one is best they are both

873
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,038
equally awesome um you can mix them but

874
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:05,759
when you mix them you're not organic

875
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:07,158
anymore because organic means when

876
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:08,839
you're growing organically it means you

877
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:11,080
haven't added those synthetic salts as

878
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,599
soon as you add that no longer organic

879
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:14,879
the word Sanic is not a thing organic

880
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,359
means you don't have the synthetics in

881
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,000
it to say I I mixed the two don't say

882
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,759
Sanic people are going to comment on

883
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,720
that you already know what I'm talking

884
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:23,759
about um I think I've been rambling on

885
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,079
about this one for long enough I'm

886
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,240
trying to pull more info out of my head

887
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,398
cuz I know I got more to say uh the te's

888
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,159
are fun I love Brewing up a good tea uh

889
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:32,518
you can feed a compost tea too your

890
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:34,640
synthetic mix if you want add those

891
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:37,000
Organics in there but the Organics are

892
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,960
beautiful especially see I'm a city boy

893
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,798
maybe that's part of my thing I'm a city

894
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,200
boy my neighbors can hear me [ __ ]

895
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,679
recording this podcast right now with

896
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,519
three different directions that side

897
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,159
that side and the folks behind me

898
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,919
they've heard every [ __ ] episode

899
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:51,840
every edit they know the whole podcast

900
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,519
by now I'm a city boy growing um with

901
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,079
bottle nutrients in the city just seems

902
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,200
to be a little bit easier for me if I

903
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,319
had some land a more private backyard

904
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,038
where I could do some [ __ ] uh I may work

905
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:03,558
on some Organics and do it that way if I

906
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,519
were growing outdoors I would probably

907
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:08,079
go organically if I grew outdoors I

908
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,880
Would Do It full hippie organic style uh

909
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,960
but indoor commercially production wise

910
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,039
I feel like bottled nutrients are the

911
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,159
way to go uh my dude black Ray 3K bro

912
