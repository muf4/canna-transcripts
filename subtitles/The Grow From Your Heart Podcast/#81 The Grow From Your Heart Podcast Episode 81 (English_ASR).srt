increased demand for it uh he means for

174
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,799

smoking it in public is illegal but in

176

181
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
have a tent set up at the west side of

182
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,280
the Burnside bridge for a midnight

183
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,680
countdown to the end of marijuana

184
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,159
prohibition the site offers a big neon

185
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,439
sign in the shape of Oregon as a

186
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,720
background for selfies of revelers who

187
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,598
light up oh I could just imagine that

188
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,160
you guys a big ass sign shaped like

189
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:18,399
Oregon with people just dabbing out and

190
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,520
puffing down in front of it that's

191
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,799
pretty great I'll continue with the

192
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,240
article it says adults will be allowed

193
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,520
to possess up to a half a pound and grow

194
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,560
four plants but not yet to buy or sell

195
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,240
it I will be a few months uh to more

196
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,199
than a year before it is legal to sell

197
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,800
and then only with a state permit uh so

198
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,680
right now it says adults will be allowed

199
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,720
to possess up to a pound and they'll be

200
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,400
allowed to grow up to four plants we

201
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,280
talked about the last episode that pound

202
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,318
or that half a pound I'm sorry that half

203
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,918
a pound has to stay at home and you're

204
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,720
allowed to carry up to 1 ounce with you

205
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:54,598
and just in case you were confused

206
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,240
Oregon issued a nice little statement

207
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,279
that showed you that one ounce of

208
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,478
cannabis is approximately the size of

209
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,719
one voodoo donut so that's how much

210
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,279
you're allowed to carry around with you

211
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,440
the article goes on to say the

212
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,279
legislature is continuing uh considering

213
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,279
I'm sorry the legislature is considering

214
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,878
a bill to allow medical marijuana

215
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,038
dispensaries to start selling small

216
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,639
amounts to anyone 21 and over on October

217
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,959
1st in order to get over the

218
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,720
in in congruity of marijuana being legal

219
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,478
to have it and grow but not to buy sorry

220
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,199
I stumbled over that word you guys a

221

222

until late next year Growers are are

224
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,720

225

for licenses in January with permits for

226
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,680

228

in somebody's land or out in some land

especially on somebody else's land pay

249
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,639
attention to what you're doing uh your

with the legalization of recreational

253
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:32,120
marijuana I think that we are seeing a

254
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,918
move to our area by people who may be

255
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,719
from out of state out of the area who

256
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,399
don't really know or understand our land

00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,919
me tell you that here in Colorado when

330
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,680
we rolled out recreational Cannabis it

331
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,719
looks like we have turned our back on

332
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,799
medical marijuana completely we have

333
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,600
given the finger to the medical

334
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,958
marijuana patients and this this is not

335
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,759
me this is just how I feel about the

336
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,518
industry it looks like the industry does

337
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,399
not care about medical marijuana anymore

338
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:22,320
there's more profit uh there's more uh

339
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,639
more demand in recreational Cannabis so

340
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,079
it feels like the medical side in

341
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,799
Colorado is being forgotten and almost

342
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,519
be trying they're almost attempting to

343
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,359
eliminate is what it feels like to me

344
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:36,000
it's being pushed away so I feel that uh

345
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,759
the medical rules are going to affect

346
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,799
your area probably very similarly The

347
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,519
Growers are going to see more profit in

348
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,958
the recreational side of things and

349
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,600
they'll start getting greedy and they'll

350
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:48,759
stop giving to the patients like they

351
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,040
have been The Compassion will go away uh

352
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,278
they're going to start uh raising prices

353
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,240
and they're going to start selling

354
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,439
everything on the commercial side of

355
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,919
things instead of the medical side of

356
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,560
things that's what I predict all right

357
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,879
now I have to open up a couple of notes

358
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,039
that I have in my computer here because

359
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,879
I wrote a nice list of things the other

360
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,639
part of your question is what are Niche

361
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,639
businesses that I think might open up uh

362
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,799
and maybe some information or tips about

363
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,320
uh since Oregon is going recreational so

364
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,319
I've got a list here if I can close this

365
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,440
one I will be able to open the next

366
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,399
thing here we go I'm fighting with my

367
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,839
computer while we're at this all right

368
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,159
so uh businesses and business

369
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,880
opportunities that will arise with

370
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,679
recreational cannabis in your area and

371
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,120
this will go for everywhere not just uh

372
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,599
Oregon where it has just become uh

373
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,198
recreational legally recreational legal

374
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,720
that was hard to say but this will go

375
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:43,399
along with everywhere where cannabis

376
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,399
becomes available medically and

377
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,078
recreationally businesses that I have

378
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,360
seen pop up personally that are attached

379
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,120
to cannabis but this is not a cannabis

380
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,720
related business say you're not wanting

381
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,039
to be in the dispensary game you don't

382
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,800
want to work at a dispensary you want to

383
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,879
open another business here was a nice uh

384
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:03,159
list of opportunities

385
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,000
electricians certified electricians are

386
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,360
getting paid huge money if you're an

387
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,759
electrician and you're willing to work

388
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,278
with the dispensary or a grow you are

389
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,360
making huge money right now that's

390
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,240
that's the first step I think um when it

391
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,680
was when we were able to grow medical

392
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,919
cannabis here in Colorado uh everybody

393
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,679
built a grow room in their house

394
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,159
everybody that had a med card that's my

395
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,359
next uh somebody on Periscope just made

396
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,120
a great recommendation and that's the

397
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,079
next one on my list so electricians uh

398
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,440
everyone's going to need an electri

399
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:32,120
nurition as soon as it goes commercial

400
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,880
and everyone's allowed to grow four or I

401
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,078
keep saying commercial uh recreational

402
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,399
as soon as it goes recreational

403
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,078
everyone's allowed to grow four plants

404
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,879
in their house so that means everyone's

405
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:42,359
going to want to build a grow room most

406
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,799
houses aren't equipped to run a couple

407
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,639
thousand watt lights so everyone's going

408
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,958
to need an electrician and then shit's

409
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,000
going to go wrong and people are going

410
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,278
to want to upgrade so more electricians

411
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,919
all the time following electricians

412
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:57,198
would be HVAC technicians all of the

413
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,439
dispensaries have super fancy super

414
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,719
high-tech HVAC systems if if you could

415
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,959
design state-of-the-art HVAC systems for

416
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,519
grow facilities Andor residential grows

417
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,559
that would be very useful also

418
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,879
construction Crews that are familiar

419
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,319
with growroom construction if you had a

420
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,838
crew that knew how to build a grow room

421
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,879
if you're a consultant and you can

422
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,959
design a nice grow room and you can have

423
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,120
a construction crew that knows what the

424
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:25,518
goal is on building a grow room that

425
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,560
would be super helpful so HVAC

426
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,679
electricians and construction Crews to

427
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,638
design and build dispensary grows and

428
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,758
personal grows after that um

429
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,560
photographers I know that sounds crazy

430
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,919
but there are two or three photographers

431
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,198
in the Colorado Cannabis scene that if

432
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,879
you told me right now I need a

433
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:43,479
photographer for cannabis I would say is

434
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,759
it for like an event where we're photo

435
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,879
photographing people or is it something

436
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,360
where we're going to take pictures of

437
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,439
plants and if you said and I'm going to

438
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,240
give two shout outs here I'm going to

439
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,480
give two huge shout outs to two people

440
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,480
if you said I want to take pictures of

441
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
cannabis plants I would definitely

442
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,320
recommend a guy named Ri Richard he is

443
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,560
the guy you want to take pictures of

444
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,920
your ganja plant

445
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,638
and if you were taking pictures of a

446
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:04,439
cannabis event where there are people

447
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,839
and things happening you want Kim

448
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Sidwell of cannabis camera and they

449
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,480
didn't pay me to say that those are just

450
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,199

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,800
like head shops and grow stores you guys

494
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,800
like H gr indoor growing supplies those

495
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:44,198
guys are aiming at the outdoor and

496
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:46,159
indoor uh farmer that is producing

497
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,559
Tomatoes but this cannabis business is

498
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,278
also boosting their sales ridiculously

499
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,479
so a grow store a head shop uh most of

500
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,759
the dispensaries have smoking gear they

501
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,600
have dab rigs they have bongs they have

502
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,720
pipes they have papers but it's grossly

503
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,759
overpriced in that son of a b bch if you

504
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,078
opened up a head shop down the street

505
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,038
from a dispensary and sold things at a

506
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,759
decent markup you would make money

507
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:10,078
because they people will know that this

508
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,318
dispensary charges me good price for

509
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,078
weed ridiculous prices for glass I'm

510
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,599
going to go to the glass shop and buy my

511
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,198
smoking accessories there um somebody

512
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,359
just wrote on Periscope they said

513
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,798
security um security guards are always

514
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,719
needed at the dispensaries we need

515
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:26,240
security guards for our grows for the

516
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,439
dispensaries uh for all of our

517
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,599
businesses um packaging if you know how

518
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,080
to make packaging if you can design

519
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,599
packaging if you are a packaging person

520
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,599
that sort of stuff is needed in our

521
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:39,199
industry um something that people

522
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:42,079
Overlook is clothing people cannabis

523
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,558
clothing locally aimed cannabis clothing

524
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,519
sells if you've got your state if you

525
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,399
can make your state flag into something

526
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:51,440
color or kind of cannabis e then that

527
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,240
will sell in your area uh web design all

528
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,320
of the dispensaries need some sort of

529
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,960
web design something that Colorado

530
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:59,359
specializes in we have something called

531
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,000
a compliance specialist if you run a

532
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,158
dispensary or work in a dispensary or

533
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,200
own a dispensary everything has to be

534
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,320
done under a certain set of rules that

535
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,798
are set by the me you need one or two

536
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,200
people that know all of those rules and

537
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:13,319
if you ask them a question it's their

538
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,919
job to go in the office and get the book

539
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,079
and figure out that rule that's your

540
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,720
compliance specialist and he needs to be

541
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:21,519
finding out all the new rules as they

542
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,519
come out he needs to be uh walking

543
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,079
through the grow through the sales area

544
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,038
through all of the dispensary and making

545
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,960
sure that everything is under compliance

546
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,640
so that if the inspectors come in you

547
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,558
are cool and legit and he keeps you out

548
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,080
of trouble so the dispensaries need

549
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:37,798
assistance from everywhere um also a

550
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,960
taxi service of some sort would be

551
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,279
really cool or if you can open this is

552
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,519
the obvious one if you can open a

553
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,839
smoking club that would be cool as [ __ ]

554
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,158
but the rules are always going to be

555
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:49,879
strict for that sort of stuff uh what I

556
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,600
have seen is a lot of smoking buses they

557
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,919
have the Cannabis tour bus because it's

558
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,399
a little bit different I don't know the

559
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,038
rules on it You' have to find out that

560
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,960
in your area but a taxi service of some

561
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,519
sort would be really cool transportation

562
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,200
for intoxicated people makes you look

563
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,558
good and it's a good business um what

564
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,319
else do we have oh there's a service

565
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:09,359
around here that actually hires

566
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,558
specifically for dispensaries it's a

567
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,839
temp agency and you go and apply and you

568
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:14,319
have to get your med badge and once

569
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:16,399
you've got your med badge they send you

570
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,279
to a dispensary and you work there and

571
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,200
it could lead to permanent employment

572
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,359
just like a normal job at a normal temp

573
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,080
agency and they're designed specifically

574
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,000
for the Cannabis industry so you could

575
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:30,199
open your own temp agency to hire people

576
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
for the dispens Aries so that dispensary

577
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,080
owners and managers don't have to spend

578
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,599
their day interviewing people they pay

579
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,199
you to do that you send these people to

580
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:40,839
The Dispensary they work they get paid a

581
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,679
certain amount of money and then you

582
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,319
take a dollar whatever you know you make

583
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,960
sure that they get paid minimum wage but

584
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,279
then you take a dollar a portion of

585
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,400
whatever they get paid to make your

586
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,480
business work so that happens around

587
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,798
here um like I said there'll be a need

588
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,599
for lodging hotels uh hotels will be

589
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,918
serious when cannabis goes recreational

590
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,719
in your area because people will be

591
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,000
coming from a far to the nearest

592
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,600
dispensaries to get cannabis like we get

593
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,519
people we're in Colorado we get people

594
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,918
from Texas Wyoming uh Oklahoma they come

595
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,079
from all over to get weed from us here

596
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,080
and they're filling up the hotels

597
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,558
they'll come take weekend trips just to

598
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,558
buy weed all over and they'll have to

599
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:18,119
stay in a hotel somewhere uh let's see

600
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,720
so that's a lot of things that you guys

601
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,678
could those are business opportunities

602
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,679
that you could take advantage of if you

603
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,400
could open somewh to actually consume

604
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,640
cannabis in your area that would be

605
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,679
ideal because here you can buy weed at

606
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,880
13 different places within 10 miles of

607
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,360
each other but there's nowhere to

608
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,120
legally consume your

609
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,639
cannabis all right so that's a big ass

610
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,678
list of ancillary and Niche businesses

611
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,159
that you could participate in without

612
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,080
opening up your own cannabis but you

613
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,640
could still capitalize on this cannabis

614
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,240
industry also there's those little

615
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,679
hippie stores that sell like hippie

616
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,798
clothing like Patchwork pants and

617
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,798
tie-dyed t-shirts and [ __ ] hemp

618
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:55,200
jewelry and all that kind of [ __ ] I

619
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:56,759
think if you open one of those near a

620
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,600
dispensary and you capitalize on that

621
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,480
cannabis theme and like I said ear

622
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,158
earlier if you use your state or your

623
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,480
city and weed out your slogan like my

624
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,240
logo for iy genetics is the Colorado

625
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,240
flag that's turned into the roster

626
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,558
colors and people don't even know about

627
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,519
the company when they see it and they're

628
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,879
like holy [ __ ] I love that shirt so that

629
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,400
would be a good way to take your state

630
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,840
flag or your city logo or whatever and

631
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,200
turn it into some sort of cannabis

632
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,639
themed flag and make a spoof of it and

633
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,919
sell that in your store in your area

634
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,080
that would that would sell that would

635
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,360
crush but all right I've gone on a long

636
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,720
time about subject I'm going to take a

637
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,558
drink of root beer and then we're going

638
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,038
to um actually check it out we have been

639
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,240
on Periscope the entire time I've been

640
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,158
recording and I told those people on

641
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Periscope that we would take questions I

642
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,320
see that we have 17 people on Periscope

643
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,759
right now we've got I'd like to go about

644
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,720
nine or eight more minutes in this

645
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,640
podcast so if Periscope has got any

646
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,319
questions for me please type in your

647
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,080
questions while I take a drink and I

648
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,439
will read uh my favorite questions and

649
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,960
then I'll try to answer them the best

650
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,159
that I can for you so while I take a

651
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,519
drink you guys start typing your

652
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,520
questions there on Periscope for me

653
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:09,839
all right that's funny because usually

654
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,640
Periscope is filled with questions and

655
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,199
now they seem like they are stumped uh

656
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,799
earlier on Periscope somebody asked me

657
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,120
what is the difference between wax and

658
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:21,000
shatter so um basically I am not the

659
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,759
hash maker here this is my experience

660
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,599
from watching and hearing my hash maker

661
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:29,640
friends talk the difference between wax

662
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,798
and shatter uh most BHO

663
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,679
okay somebody asked me a question there

664
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:33,960
and I'm going to write it uh I'm writing

665
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,038
it down how do you feel about smoking

666
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,120
and driving we're going to ask that and

667
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,759
uh we're going to answer that in a

668
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,158
second I'm writing it down smoke and

669
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,319
drive all right but I was answering the

670
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,400
first question uh what's the difference

671
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,399
between wax and shatter basically when

672
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,000
you make BHO if it's done right they'll

673
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,480
both come out very near uh when it's

674
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,359
done right it'll come out very near

675
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,319
shatter the consistency will be very

676
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,558
near shatter if not sappy so at this

677
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:01,399
point if you vac hum Purge it properly

678
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,399
and don't mess with it too much it will

679
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,640
stay shatter it will come out shatter is

680
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,240
more like sorry I'm burping after my

681
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,799
drink shatter is like a Jolly Rancher

682
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,558
consistency where it's kind of Snappy

683
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:12,720
it'll break that's why we call it

684
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,759
shatter it's like a little piece of

685
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,240
glass if you chip it at chip at it too

686
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:21,038
hard it'll shatter so most hash most BHO

687
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,960
ran properly will turn into shatter now

688
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:26,720
the way that you make it into wax is

689
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,278
right before it's done right before it

690
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,640
cools how tight the open container law I

691
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:32,079
don't know somebody asked me a question

692
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,278
on Periscope that said how tights the

693
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,839
open container laws I'm not experienced

694
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:37,839
with that in my area they don't give a

695
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,599
[ __ ] but in some areas they really do so

696
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,558
let me continue with my hash ver or my

697
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,639
shatter versus wax part so now we've got

698
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:46,558
this shatter right it's hard it's stable

699
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,440
now you could turn that into Wax By

700
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,038
heating it or before you even let it

701
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,000
warm just keep it war or before you let

702
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,839
it cool keep it warm and what you do is

703
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,640
whip it and I don't know what they use

704
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:59,959
to whip it I've seen a few things like I

705
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,880
saw one guy used use a metal pick like

706
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,480
for your afro because it had uh four or

707
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,039
five little fingers coming off of it I

708
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,278
guess their teeth if they're on the pick

709
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,919
but he would put that in the Pyrex dish

710
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:13,038
of hash and just Stir It Around really

711
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,440
rapidly and what he was trying to do is

712
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,960
whip it like it was like he was stirring

713
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,360
some kind of food and trying to put air

714
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,798
into it and make it fluffy and so what

715
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,759
that does is it fluffs it up and then

716
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,599
when it dries there's air trapped in

717
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:26,079
there and it just dries up a little bit

718
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,439
differently I don't know the science

719
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:31,720
behind why but it makes it waxy and it's

720
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,480
a little bit easier to handle um then

721
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,480
they put that in the back oven just like

722
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,159
they do the uh the shatter and they

723
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,679
clean it up so I know that's not the

724
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,480
most technical answer but the main

725
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:42,759
difference between wax and shatter is

726
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,839
the whipping action that happens right

727
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,079
before it's finished you just whip it up

728
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,839
and put a little bit of air in it and it

729
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,199
makes it a little bit

730
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:53,199
fluffy uh somebody on Periscope says

731
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,200
keep the VAC at 120 and it will bubble

732
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,600
uh yeah but 120 is a little high that's

733
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,880
when you start burning off turps is

734
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:00,319
about 106 110 is

735
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,520
all right so somebody asked me how I

736
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,678
feel about smoking and driving it's a

737
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,599
really good question um I cannot

738
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:10,240
Advocate you smoking uh cannabis and

739
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,079
driving I can't say to do that but again

740
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,079
I can't be a hypocrite because I do it

741
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,678
myself

742
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,480
occasionally how I feel about it is if

743
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,200
you know your limits and you're not

744
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,599
going to be a [ __ ] out there on the

745
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,558
road uh and you're not [ __ ] up drive

746
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:26,359
if you've had a little bit to smoke but

747
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,278
if you're the kind of person that smokes

748
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,119
and goes [ __ ] full [ __ ] don't

749
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:32,319
don't get behind the wheel know your

750
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:34,000
limitations check yourself before you

751
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,918
hurt somebody or yourself that's what

752
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,319
that's how I really feel about it uh I

753
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,919
would be a hypocrite if I came on here

754
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,759
and I said don't take dabs and drive uh

755
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,000
maybe don't take D dabs and drive

756
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,519
simultaneously try not to smoke in the

757
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,240
car just don't be that [ __ ] think

758
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:50,839
about the news article about you when

759
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,038
you [ __ ] up in the future check out what

760
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:54,759
you're doing and say huh I I'm I'm about

761
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,839
to be a news story you know what I mean

762
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,960
like if I crash into somebody right now

763
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:00,678
while I'm smoking this bong in the car

764
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,960
I'm going to be on the news I'm going to

765
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:03,960
look like an [ __ ] I'm going to be a

766
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,079
black eye for the Cannabis Community or

767
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,720
I don't want to get pulled over while

768
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:09,199
I'm taking this dab let think about that

769
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,798
kind of [ __ ] but if you want to get

770
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,640
blazed before you drive and you can

771
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,119
handle it and you're not an idiot that's

772
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,720
your thing do that uh don't drink a drop

773
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,479
of alcohol and drive because I'm a

774
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,200
hypocrite maybe but I feel alcohol

775
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,000
really [ __ ] with your equilibrium your

776
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,840
balance your depth and perception it

777
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,919
really [ __ ] you up but if you're a

778
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,398
medical marijuana consumer you're

779
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,159
probably you've got a tolerance you're a

780
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:32,038
experienced and you're not smoking it

781
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,039
just to get [ __ ] high if you're

782
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:35,879
smoking just to get [ __ ] High don't

783
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,879
drive chill out for a little bit let

784
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,679
somebody drive for you call in Uber do

785
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,679
whatever you got to do that's my opinion

786
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,200
on that all right Periscope you have one

787
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,640
more question for me it'd be perfect to

788
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,840
get one more question in and on

789
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,759
Periscope they're sending me a bunch of

790
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,240
Hearts which means they got love for me

791
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:51,879
it's technically illegal is it

792
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,240
technically illegal to drive high yes it

793
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,760
is technically illegal to drive high uh

794
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,640
if that's driving under the influence of

795
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,440
drugs or driving with ability impaired

796
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,640
depending on how they book you or how

797
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,360
they write it down or whatever I don't

798
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,320
know what the difference would be but it

799
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:06,599
is absolutely illegal to drive while

800
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,839
you're high and it's definitely looked

801
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,839
down

802
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,798
upon DUI somebody on Periscope says DUI

803
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,038
it's driving Under the Influence so yeah

804
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,720
don't don't be high when you're driving

805
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,640
and if the cops ask you how long ago you

806
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,360
smoked say six hours ago be like it's

807
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,679
been at least 6 hours ago unless you but

808
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,158
if you're smoking a joint in the car if

809
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,000
you got a blunt burning that's no

810
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,360
excuse all right I'm waiting for

811
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,640
periscope to throw up one more question

812
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,000
if they don't throw up one more question

813
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,759
we will start closing up the

814
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,240
show what's my favorite part of my job

815
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:40,759

questions I'm going to answer these so

831
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:10,479
if you throw up more questions I'm sorry

832
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,398
I probably won't get to them unless it's

833
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,000
a really good question so here we go

834
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:19,479
what's my favorite part of my job my job

835
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,720
is to provide the best quality cannabis

836
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,200
that I can for the customers at the spot

837
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,640
dispensary my other job is to provide

838
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,319
the best quality cannabis that I can for

839
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,240
the medical marijuana patients which

840
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,599
have designated me as their caregiver uh

841
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,120
the other part of my job is to host a

842
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:39,199
podcast that teaches other people how to

843
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:42,319
grow better cannabis to improve the

844
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,679
quality of their own lives um another

845
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,079
big part of my job that people don't

846
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,120
realize is I'm a father so I am shaping

847
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:51,278
somebody I am creating another person

848
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,479
into what I hope to be a successful and

849
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:56,960
happy human being so the favorite part

850
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,558
of my job is uh helping other people out

851
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,038
and seeing the positive effect that the

852
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:03,398
the work I do has on other people's

853
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:07,240
lives

854
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:10,479
because honestly I grow weed and I'm a

855
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,919
dad and play on Instagram and I play on

856
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,798
Periscope and it feels like I'm just

857
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,679
playing I'm a big Manchild because my

858
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,720
job is what I love so it doesn't feel

859
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,200
like I'm working and that right there

860
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,360
may be my favorite part of it it doesn't

861
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,798
feel like I'm working ever I'll be

862
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,798
completely

863
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,480
sweaty um that's a good question but I'm

864
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,480
probably not going to get to that one

865
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,679
text that to me on uh on Twitter and

866
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,880
I'll answer that and yes I do play the

867
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,200
drums so I do a lot of things and I

868
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,000
think my favorite part of my job is

869
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,038
seeing people happy like I've got a

870
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,919
patient named Doug he's a 60-year-old

871
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,200
guy and he feels like [ __ ] half the time

872
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:46,679
and I grow cannabis that I know he loves

873
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,319
and I go to his house and I roll up a

874
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,480
big fat joint or I give him a dab and

875
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,519
I'm like hey Doug let's hang out and

876
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,798
smoke this and when I get there he's

877
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,240
hurt or sick and depressed and he's got

878
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:56,879
a shitty look on his face and by the

879
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,480
time I leave the dude's got a smile on

880
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,919
his face and he loves the world and he

881
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,919
loves life again and part of that is my

882
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:04,960
interaction with the guy but a large

883
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:06,320
portion of that is the cannabis plant

884
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,840
and a large portion of that is the

885
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:11,079
Cannabis that I grew from my heart and

886
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:12,678
gave to this whole guy to feel better so

887
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:14,558
that's probably the favorite part of my

888
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,640
job is that I get I'm healing people

889
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,759
even the people that are smoking

890
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:21,000
cannabis recreationally it's healing it

891
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:23,038
feels better to take a fat puff of ganja

892
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,960
and blow out that smoke and just feel

893
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:27,278
better so I get to do that to people

894
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,480
every day I get to see that it is all in

895
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,798
the love that's absolutely correct so

896
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,558
somebody asked me what's my favorite

897
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,759
part I think that is it I get to see

898
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,200
people improve their lives with from my

899
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,480
work and that makes me feel [ __ ]

900
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,440
golden

901
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,240
inside uh somebody asked me about an

902
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,120
open container law here in Colorado

903
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,880
we've uh We've started treating cannabis

904
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:47,879
like alcohol is our new model here so

905
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,320
we've got What's called the open

906
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,480
container law unfortunately I am not up

907
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,678
to date on the open container law I

908
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,278
don't know enough about it in my city

909
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,278
you can drive around with your dab rig

910
00:30:56,278 --> 00:30:59,839
on the dash my city is a little bit

911
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:00,759
gangster and nobody cares what you're

912
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,199
doing here as long as you're not

913
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:04,879
shooting at each other when you drive by

914
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,840
um in other places you've got to have

915
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,880
your stuff in a childproof container or

916
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:10,439
a sealed container in your vehicle and

917
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,240
it's got to be out of your reach and in

918
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,080
the trunk I think but my vehicle doesn't

919
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,919
have a trunk so I put it in my backpack

920
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,359
uh and then I put it in the back seat

921
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,559
but quite often honestly there's a dab

922
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,638
rig in my center console but if I'm

923
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,319
driving from here to rev's house what am

924
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:28,240
I going to do I'm I just put the dab rig

925
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,638
in the center console I put my hash my

926
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,960
carb cat my torch in there and I drive

927
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,719
over to aasa and I carry it into the

928
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,240
house and I take a couple dabs so

929
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,720
honestly I don't know enough about that

930
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,359
open container law to be useful and I'm

931

00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:14,638
resume and explain to them why you're

978
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,080
the employee that they want and if

979
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:18,000
you're not experienced in the Cannabis

980
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,519
industry here in Colorado it's going to

981
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,519
be difficult getting getting your foot

982
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,599
in the door because the dispensaries are

983
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:28,120
full people have been employed there for

984
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:29,359
quite a while um I don't know if can get

985
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:31,199
into the Cannabis industry with

986
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:34,359
marijuana misdemeanors I really do not

987
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,798
know the I don't know sorry I apologize

988
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,719
I don't have that right on hand if I

989
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:37,679
would have prepared that question I

990
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,278
would have researched it for you but

991
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,639
since we're doing it right off right off

992
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,720
the cuff here I'm not sure but so you

993
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:44,439
get your badge and then you come here

994
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,960
and then you apply and then hopefully

995
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,720
you get somebody's attention and you're

996
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,079
probably going to have to start by being

997
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,839
like a trimmer or a bud tender or

998
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:55,439
something like that so I would uh learn

999
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,638
how to trim weed is probably where

1000
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,440
you're going to start because unless

1001
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,879
you're a master grower and you can prove

1002
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,639
it nobody's going to let you start off

1003
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,799
being a master grower it's not going to

1004
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:06,000
happen you're going to be an hourly

1005
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:08,159
trimmer so work on your resume start

1006
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,960
learning how to trim weed uh learn how

1007
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,200
to be chipper grow some boobs I hate to

1008
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,240
say it but dispensaries will hire you if

1009
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,118
you have got some boobs uh if you're a

1010
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,479
cute 22 25y old chick and you can flirt

1011
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,838
with the customers and you can sell them

1012
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,679
some [ __ ] there's a good chance you're

1013
