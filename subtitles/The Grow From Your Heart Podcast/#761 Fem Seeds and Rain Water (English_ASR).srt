70
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,878
all right i did start off the show by

71
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,958
talking about listener emails that i was

72
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,280
going to read let's jump right into that

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,199
portion of the show this one comes from

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,479
our friend chase and it goes a little

75
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,639
bit like

76
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,639
this it says yo what if you have a pack

77
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,919
of femme seeds but you really want to

78
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,238
breed or make seeds can you just use sts

79
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,958
on a female plant and get normal seeds

80
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,719
or will they always be feminized that is

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,920
a very good question

82
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,400
if you only have fem seeds there is not

83
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,399
a way to make a male plant unless you do

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
something to one of those female plants

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,560
to make it create pollen so

86
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,559
without introducing a male plant to that

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,719
mix without having some male pollen

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,120
there is no way to make regular seeds

89
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,680
your seeds will always be female unless

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,519
you do introduce a male if you do put a

91
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,080
male plant into the mix and you

92
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,599
pollinate a female a feminized female

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,680
plant with a regular male plant the

94
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,518
seeds that come from that will be male

95
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,920
and female it's all about that pollen

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,439
donor so your original question is if

97
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,439
you've only got fems and you want to

98
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,199
make seeds can you make a female plant

99
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,079
get normal seeds or will they always be

100
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,000
femmed

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
these will always be femmes if you only

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
have femmes to work with you're only

103
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,238
going to make more fems there is nothing

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,000
wrong with breeding from feminized seeds

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,560
but i would recommend doing some sort of

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,120
outcrossing not just taking it further

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,039
filial generations i would add some more

108
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,959
plants to the mix but this is your

109
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,239
project you do what you want breed with

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,319
love grow from your heart most

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,080
importantly have a good time i hope i

112
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,518
answered your question the real quick

113
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
answer they're always going to be

114
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,519
females uh and then i do encourage you

115
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,199
to do your breeding project all right

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,720
big shout out to my buddy chase for the

117
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,478
great question

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
let's keep it moving i've got another

119
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,159
question here this one says hey man can

120
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,879
i use rain water instead of distilled

121
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,560
water the quick answer is going to be

122
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,560
you could you can

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,478
i would at least do a basic water test

124
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,478
maybe uh find out what's in that water

125
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,719
maybe at least check the ec in the uh

126
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,800
the tds of that water definitely check

127
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,639
the ph but maybe do a quick test and

128
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
find out what's in there it kind of

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,840
depends on what's in your area i live

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,560
near a steel mill that puts off a lot of

131
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,359
disgusting chemicals the rain in my area

132
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,600
will probably have steel mill chemicals

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,199
in it which will end up in my plants

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,439
which is probably going to be some form

135
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,439
of heavy metals or some sort of junk i

136
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,000
don't want in my plants honestly i don't

137
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,360
know enough about water science and what

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,279
can travel through the water and through

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,120
the air that way to have a solid

140
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,159
testimony but i wouldn't recommend it if

141
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,360
you live

142
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,439
in the city or near chemical plants or a

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,800
lot of factories and [ __ ] if you're on

144
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,560
the trees and out in the woods where the

145
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,079
water tastes good then i would

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,560
definitely recommend it then i would use

147
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,478
that water but before i use any water

148
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
that doesn't come from a regulated sort

149
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,879
of a municipal system and municipal

150
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,720
source i would check on it see what's in

151
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,319
that water if you don't have a way to

152
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,320
test it if you can't scoop up some water

153
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,680
and take it to a water testing place or

154
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,680
at least do a little bit of testing on

155
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,280
your own maybe at least just feed it to

156
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,759
a couple of plants before you give it to

157
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,918
the entire garden and see what a few

158
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,759
plants do that is my version of testing

159
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,240
if you were isolated don't have a lot of

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,560
resources so the short answer is yes you

161
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
can use rainwater but think about what

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
are you collecting the water in how are

163
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,000
you collecting it what is that water

164
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,918
running over as you collect it is it

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
running off of your roof of your house

166
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,918
onto your car then into a bucket are you

167
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
actually collecting it in some sort of a

168
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,719
semi-clean manner where you're not

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
gathering a bunch of [ __ ] whatever it

170
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
washes over it's going to end up into

171
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
your collection vessel i'm not trying to

172
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,520
discourage you but i want it to be clean

173
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,439
now something that caught my attention

174
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,599
you said you're using distilled water

175
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,079
why what are you using distilled water

176
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,680
for why are you doing that that's um

177
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,639
nobody else does that we use filtered

178
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639
water

179
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,439
maybe ro water maybe water that went

180
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,360
through a big boy most of the time my

181
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,038
water here in colorado is pretty cool i

182
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
just run for the home grow i don't even

183
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,879
use a filter for the commercial grow i

184
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,038
choose a big boy so i'm not sure why

185
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,279
you're using distilled water that may

186
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,800
not be the best idea but if it ain't

187
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,918
broke don't fix it all right thank you

188
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,840
for the great question that one came

189
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,198
from our friend joseph i told you i had

190
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,478
a few messages here in front of me we're

191
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,960
just going to keep cooking right through

192
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,240
them this one came from you know we're

193
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,198
not going to say their name because they

194
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,519
have a question that says should i worry

195
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,400
if my buds have started throwing nanners

196
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,000
at week six of flour then it says in

197
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,918
light depth um

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,240
yes i would be concerned if my plants

199
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,799
started showing nanners at week six of

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,478
flour that is a sign of intersex

201
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,160
or hermaphroditism which is not

202
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,560
desirable when it comes to a cannabis

203
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,439
plant we don't want that trait

204
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,280
those nanners if they are uh if they're

205
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,199
viable they can have pollen in them

206
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,638
they'll open up and they will pollinate

207
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,280
at least the buds right next to them

208
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,038
possibly the entire crop and having

209
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,879
nanners at week six is not a good thing

210
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,560
i would definitely kind of freak out a

211
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,879
little bit since you say it's a light

212
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,439
depth garden i'm going to assume that

213
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,360
there is a little bit of a light leak

214
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,519
somewhere probably right where you're

215
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,038
seeing those nanners light is probably

216
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,439
getting in there when you think it is

217
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,839
dark that would be my main assumption so

218
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,839
i would uh assess the situation see if

219
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,478
you've got total darkness if not correct

220
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,439
that then i would work on what to do

221
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,800
with these uh intersex plants you've got

222
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,800
a couple of options are they throwing

223
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
just a few nanners if it's just a few

224
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,000
maybe you could cut them out if it's a

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,439
lot i would really start freaking out if

226
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,879
it's just a couple

227
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,639
spray them with water and pluck them out

228
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,919
with tweezers and then keep an eye on

229
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,160
that plant

230
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,758
if they reappear you got [ __ ] to think

231
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,520
about if they don't come back you're

232
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
okay if you've got a lot i would

233
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,878
probably just cut them down you are past

234
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,478
the point now

235
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,039
where i don't think those plants are at

236
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,719
risk of getting seeded but it still

237
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,719
isn't going to make the crop any better

238
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,599
to have a hermaphroditic plant inside of

239
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,280
the

240
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,560
the greenhouse the what is it a hoop

241
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,758
house probably in the light depth

242
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,079
situation

243
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,680
so it is probably detrimental to that

244
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,758
crop i would pay very close attention if

245
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,120
you've got all clones of the same strain

246
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,319
it's a very good likelihood it could

247
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,158
happen across the room if you got

248
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,399
different strains different plants will

249
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,879
have different resistances also again i

250
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,799
would check um wherever that plant is i

251
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,320
bet you it's on an outer edge at a

252
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,240
corner or something where the tarp isn't

253
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,560
covering perfectly at night maybe the

254
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
wind is blowing it's still daytime

255
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,079
outside but it's nighttime in your grow

256
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
environment the wind is blowing there's

257
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,278
a crack in the tarp something like that

258
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,120
the light's coming in right there that

259
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,679
is probably right where the culprit with

260
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,440
the intersex plant will be found so uh

261
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,599
yes you should worry if your buds have

262
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,839
started throwing manners at week six of

263
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,200
flower that is called an intersex plant

264
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,040
that is a breeder's nightmare that's

265
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,360
also a grower's nightmare i hope you've

266
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,799
ran this plant in a smaller environment

267
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
to figure out if it's a good plant

268
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,799
before you put it out in the light depth

269
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
either way sounds like you've got some

270
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,838
problems time to start thinking about

271
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
what to do

272
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,519
all right this next question is sort of

273
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,679
a change of pace this one is a little

274
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,000
bit different and it goes a little bit

275
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,759
like this it says i have sent someone

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,879
who is very popular in the cannabis

277
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,360
field 500 pheno hunted seeds he was

278
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,838
supposed to work with and his girls too

279
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,839
oh and add his girls too so our friends

280
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,040
sent 500 i'm not sure what you mean by

281
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,800
feno hunted seeds you can't really

282
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,480
phenoh hunt they haven't been pheno

283
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,240
hunted yet he's got tofino hunt them

284
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,720
maybe they were especially bred or

285
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,240
specially selected seeds anyhow our our

286
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,160
listeners sent 500 seeds to a very

287
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,799
popular grower who was supposed to work

288
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,039
with them and add his girls to the mix

289
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,120
this popular breeder claims he lost all

290
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,278
of the seeds that's kind of sketchy

291
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,278
sounds sketchy to me it says my question

292
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,039
is what's the best way to do a collab

293
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,120
with someone without them [ __ ] you

294
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,719
over my other question well let's talk

295
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,799
about that part first best way to do a

296
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,639
collab without getting [ __ ] over uh

297
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,159
build a solid relationship work with

298
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,958
people that you know

299
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,559
um

300
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,919
meet people face to face it's great that

301
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,838
we're making friends on the internet and

302
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,360
we're so spread out and that like-minded

303
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,640
people in one part of the country are

304
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,839
meeting like-minded people in the other

305
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,958
part of the country and we're doing [ __ ]

306
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,880
together

307
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,719
but if you're gonna send somebody 500

308
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,799
seeds and it bothers you enough that

309
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,639
you're gonna send me an email about it

310
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,799
maybe you need to meet these people face

311
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,559
to face shake hands make an agreement do

312
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,719
some things like that before you go into

313
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,599
business like this my other line of

314
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,079
thought is um this is partly why

315
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,920
sometimes i don't do business with some

316
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,359
of my friends

317
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,599
i started doing when i started my

318
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,759
business my company i relied on friends

319
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,839
for a lot of their services i like

320
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,200
having my stuff made by my friends

321
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,519
because then they get to make some money

322
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,600
their business moves my business moves i

323
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
see them get to buy groceries with the

324
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,560
money that i gave them and then my

325
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,440
business moves there's moves it feels

326
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,359
good

327
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,720
but sometimes it's hard to do business

328
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,240

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,839
last forever ah

351

that [ __ ] sort of sucks so a lot of the

352
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,519
times i choose to not even do business

353
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,799
with my friends at this point if there's

354
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,200
somebody else out there that can do the

355
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,719
job i may hit them up for it um if

356
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
you've recently done artwork for me or

357
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
done some [ __ ] don't feel like i'm

358
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,120
saying you're not my friend i'm saying

359
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,200
in most cases uh but

360
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
uh i do love feeding my friends and

361
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,800
giving my friends work but oftentimes

362
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,800
i'll just skip them and go somewhere

363
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,559
else because it it causes less headaches

364
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,919
honestly but don't let that sway you

365
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,359
don't let that stop you from doing

366
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,599
business with your friends with your

367
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,000
crew how i started saying this was build

368
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,759
solid relationships with solid people

369
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,919
spend time with people get to know them

370
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,679
vet them see how they act go to dinner

371
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,958
with somebody how do they treat the wait

372
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,479
staff are they cool to the waiter are

373
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,399
they cool to the waitress are they

374
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,839
respectful do they treat the waiter do

375
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,039
they treat the waiter just like they

376
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,800
treat you or do they treat the waiter

377
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,399
like their waiter is a piece of [ __ ]

378
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,838
that stuff matters you'll learn a lot

379
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,519
about those people so just go spend a

380
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,040
few minutes spend some time with them

381
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,799
before you jump into big 500 seed

382
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,399
relationships and business proposals

383
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,719
with this people so

384
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,559
the best way to do a collab is to do it

385
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,759
with somebody that you trust and you

386
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,679
know and that there's a reason for you

387
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,200
to be doing the collab

388
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,559
i'm not just doing collabs with random

389
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,160
people on the internet because there are

390
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,239
plenty of other people that i know and

391
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,838
trust and have a reputation that i am

392
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,680
doing collabs with and it works better

393
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,839
that way so the best way to do it is

394
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,479
just build a reputation the other option

395
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,040
is contracts you can write a contract

396
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,560
contracts are very easily uh established

397
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,799

00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,479
contract or maybe you've got a basic

406
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,559
lawyer or maybe you could just find a

407
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,120
basic contract online that will cover

408
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,838
what you need done but have an agreement

409
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,399
have it in writing have a paper trail my

410
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,880
expectation is this you agreed to do

411
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,958
this together we expect to do this the

412
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,278
outcome will be this the proceeds and

413
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,278
profits will be divided this way in the

414
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,360
case that this goes wrong this is how we

415
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,519
will deal with it have all that [ __ ] in

416
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,039
paper in writing before you get to that

417
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,000
point that's why when you go to the car

418
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,159
dealership you got to sign your

419
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,240
signature 7 thousand times they're

420
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,319
covering their ass every way that they

421
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,759
can so that you two are entering a

422
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,680
contract you're saying i'm gonna get

423
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,519
this car they're gonna give you the car

424
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,120
the bank is gonna help you out you don't

425
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,198
get any extra [ __ ] other than what's on

426
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,959
the car but you do have a warranty

427
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,198
you've all got to sign all of that [ __ ]

428
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,359
so that if anything comes up every nut

429
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,799
and bull on that car is covered you've

430
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,480
got to do the same thing when it comes

431
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,319
to making a contract with your friends

432
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,039
with your partners when it comes to a

433
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,240
500c deal i would definitely have some

434
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,799
sort of arrangement some sort of

435
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,159
protection in place but first of all man

436
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,919
meet these people

437
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,519
uh go shake their hands be friends see

438
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,278
if they're cool see how they interact

439
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,480
with the community see how are they cool

440
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:27,679
with their girlfriend are they cool with

441
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,680
wait staff are they cool with their

442
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,599
grandma see who they're cool with see

443
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,879
see how they act in traffic just see how

444
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
they are you can learn a lot about

445
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,278
people it says my other question is

446
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,039
because he says he lost my seeds

447
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,600
shouldn't he pay me for my time and

448
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,078
effort he's now going to send me 100

449
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,920
seeds of his and his pollen but i feel

450
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,319
i'm owed more for all of my time and

451
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,519
effort a year of projects lost what do

452
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,040
you think

453
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,198
i think that if you would have had that

454
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,120
contract with a stipulation of if you

455
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,879
lose my seeds then i get to take your

456
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,639
firstborn child and i get to smash your

457
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,000
car with a hammer you probably wouldn't

458
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,440
have lost the seeds you might not have

459
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,120
signed the contract

460
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,120
also get your contract notarized but

461
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,480
that's a whole other can of worms he

462
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,240
probably would not have gone into

463
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,639
business with you if you would have been

464
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,480
uh more strict more of a stickler people

465
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,799
that have contracts and cover their

466
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,879
asses don't get taken advantage of so

467
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,278
the other part of this was uh he should

468
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,039
pay you for your time and effort but

469
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,278
who determines what your time and effort

470
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,278
is worth is that you or is that him you

471
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,879
probably both totally disagree on what

472
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,559
your time and effort is worth you

473
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,799
probably totally disagree on what your

474
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,879
seeds and pollen are worth uh you feel

475
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,799
you're owed more uh it was a year of

476
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,120
projects lost what do you feel a year

477
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,879
worth of breeding projects was worth uh

478
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,399
not only the year worth of the seeds but

479
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,240
the year it sets you back the year you

480
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,320
could be in progress that's a lot of

481
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,120
stuff to think about right there

482
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,278
so

483
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,799
um man this is there's a lot to think

484
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,399
about here i would have had a contract

485
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,159
in place i would have had agreements in

486
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,958
place i would have had goals in place

487
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,120
and

488
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,439
500 seeds is a lot to send somebody that

489
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,839
you don't really know at all and really

490
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,639
have a bonafide relationship with so

491
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,160
my advice um your first question is how

492
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,320
do i do a collab without someone [ __ ]

493
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,919
me over get to know people understand

494
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,959
how they do business understand how they

495
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,479
operate

496
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,838
are they hiding behind the internet or

497
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,440
are they right here transparent with

498
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,959
their face out on the internet pay

499
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,360
attention to stuff like that the second

500
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,799
question is um he lost my seeds

501
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,079
shouldn't he pay me

502
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,879
of course we shall be paid for our

503
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,159
product our time and our energy but

504
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,439
how do we determine how much that was

505
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,799
worth without some sort of that's why

506
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,160
you decide how much the car is worth

507
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,519
before you test drive it so that way if

508
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,958
you crash it they know how much you got

509
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,959
to [ __ ] pay them

510
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,399
so my advice is next time have some

511
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,958
contracts in place have some

512
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,639
preparations in line have an agreement

513
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,159
and stop messing with people who you

514
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,680
can't trust all right thank you for the

515
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,519
great message i would say your name but

516
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,519
you did not say if you wanted on here

517
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,120
you know who you are thank you my friend

518
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,480
for the great support

519
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,759
all right i've got one more email

520
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,278
question here in front of me that i want

521
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,278
to read on this show this one came from

522
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,799
my buddy newbie nuggs shout out to my

523
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,039
buddy noob nuggs what's up bro hope

524
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,359
you're well the question goes a little

525
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,719
bit like this it says hey ross to jeff i

526
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,839
have a question about when a seed

527
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,038
description says indica and sativa

528
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,880
percentages is this just breeder's

529
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,199
opinion from the phenos they have grown

530
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,839
or tested and seen or an estimation

531
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,839
based on what's in the lineage or some

532
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,078
lab tested data to come up with this

533
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,918
number thank you for everything you do

534
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,359
bro this is a really good question i

535
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,038
think i could ramble on this one for a

536
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,159
couple of good minutes here

537
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:26,078
um currently we are shifting away from

538
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,240
the terms indica and sativa those are

539
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,918
going to be expired terms in the next

540
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,880
few years we're going to have updated

541
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,480
new modern terms for that broadleaf drug

542
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,919
cultivar and weird [ __ ] like that are

543
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,079
all gonna take over but we're gonna have

544
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,679
to reassess what we're calling indica

545
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,119
and sativa one author says we got it

546
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,360
backwards a long time ago we've been

547
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,439
doing it wrong a lot of authors say that

548
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,279
those are expired terms i know what you

549
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,200
mean when you say indica and sativa so

550
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,519
they are valid terms for the purpose

551
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,279
we're using them right here most of the

552
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,440
time an indica plant is going to be your

553
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,798
shorter squatty plant with the big white

554
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,240
leaves when you smoke it you get a

555
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,079
little bit more of a mellow buzz you

556
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,240
want to chill out the things we call

557
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,678
sativa are usually a taller thinner

558
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,839
plant with the skinnier leaves when you

559
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,440
smoke that you get that psychedelic buzz

560
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:08,798
you want to get up and do [ __ ] we're

561
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,798
going to stick with that description for

562
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:14,000
sativa and indica for the purpose of

563
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,319
this podcast question so is it just

564
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,440
breeder's opinion based on phenos

565
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,159
they've grown

566
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,000
honestly there's no really like uh tried

567
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,798
and true hard and fast system or way to

568
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,960
identify this it is honestly um the

569
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,480
breeders we kind of take the plant that

570
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,440
we started with the two plants we say

571
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,679
well that one's like 50 sativa 50 indica

572
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,279
this one's like 70 30 and we breed them

573
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,559
and then we have a kind of a prediction

574
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,399
i've always got a prediction when i put

575
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,720
them together then we just see how they

576
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,880
grow a lot of times most of the stuff

577
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,640
that i breed is straight up sativa heavy

578
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,240
because i am breeding for that sativa

579
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,080
head buzz so we kind of watch the

580
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,798
phenotypes that come out watch the

581
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,359
majority of the phenotypes and then when

582
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,279
i say that is 70 30 that's because out

583
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,519
of all of the plants that i have seen

584
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,119
the majority of them would be on that

585
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,359
average it's based on the average of

586
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,399
what i see there are always going to be

587
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,399
outliers there are going to be

588
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,798
phenotypical differences

589
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,160
outliers anomalies and everything in

590
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:11,679
every population when it comes to

591
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,840
working with plants or anything with

592
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,919
nature with genes and chromosomes any

593
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,959
kind of breeding there will be outliers

594
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,640
but

595
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,480
the way that i compile most of my

596
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,559
information is by watching a lot of

597
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,480
grows i grow the seeds i've talked in a

598
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,798
previous episode about testers growing

599
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,640
it i give it out as freebies we start

600
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,240
selling it i'm constantly updating

601
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,720
descriptions and details about my

602
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,720
strengths as i see things evolve so

603
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,640
basically the way that i do it is i

604
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,640
watch the plants if i see traits i know

605
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,720
that that's an indica trait if i watch

606
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,799
traits i know that that's a sativa trait

607
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,440
so i just decide overall by what i've

608
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,599
seen from every version of that plant if

609
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,558
you've grown a million seeds of dark

610
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,480
hollow and i see how it grows then i say

611
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,038
70 of those is an indica we're going to

612
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,038
call it mostly indica just i use it by

613
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,359
observation and details and then just

614
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,119
base it off of averages of what i see is

615
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,119
how i do it i cannot speak for other

616
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,959
breeders i can't tell you how other guys

617
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,798
are doing things sometimes i have no

618
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,519
idea how they're doing some of those

619
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,519
things honestly those ah those phrases

620
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,240
indica and sativa are going to disappear

621
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,400
i've stopped putting that on my website

622
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,319
uh most of what i make is really heavy

623
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,240
sativa if it's indica then i do try to

624
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,519
indicate that this is more of an indica

625
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,359
dominant thing if you're looking for

626
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,079
indica stuff in my lineup i would

627
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,759
recommend the moon tower the dark hollow

628
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,119
maybe the double dose

629
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,960
and in the future there will be some

630
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,678
more stuff that is a little bit indica

631
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,759
heavy for you maybe some indica dominant

632
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,280
crosses coming in the future i did hint

633
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,200
that there may be an indica male in the

634
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,038
vault all right newbie nugs i do thank

635
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,558
you for the great question i hope i gave

636
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,558
you a useful answer it feels like i kind

637
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,639
of danced around it and avoided it but

638
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,319
honestly there's no real tried and true

639
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,840
way you asked if there's a lab test

640
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,000
there's not really a lab test it would

641
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,079
tell you if it's indica or sativa a lot

642
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,839
of it is based on growth structure leaf

643
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,759
size and then i think a lot of it is

644
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,000
determined by terpenes how does it feel

645
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,839
when we smoke it what kind of buzz does

646
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,839
it give us so i wish i had a better

647
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,000
answer for you i make my decision by

648
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:11,119
looking at plants and just deciding is

649
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,558
this indica or is this sativa

650
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,558
all right ladies and gentlemen boys and

651
