00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I said at the beginning of the show that

183
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,720
I had a bunch of news and stuff to talk

184
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,240
about so let's uh click on some stuff

185
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,479
here we go clicking away click click

186
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,598
click and I'm finding the first news

187
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,159
article the first news article is um a

188
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,560
kind of hits home here because I

189
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,120
actually am a medical marijuana

190
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,240
caregiver the way you become a caregiver

191
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,240
um all you really have to do is have um

192
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,160
so I'm a there's a patient there's

193
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,519
that's what we call the person that

194
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,039
smokes a medical marijuana there's a

195
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:46,598
patient that person goes to the doctor

196
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,240
they get their medical marijuana

197
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,639
recommendation and then when you send

198
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,280
that into the state of Colorado you can

199
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,079
assign a caregiver and that's where uh

200
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,000
my name goes onto that paper my name and

201
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,159
my address and a copy of my ID gets sent

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,839
to the state and I become a caregiver

203
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,879
which means I am now responsible for

204
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:07,439
growing medical cannabis for my friend

205
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,840
who signed me up and um there is a limit

206
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,319
of five people that you're allowed to be

207
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,359
a caregiver for so you can be you can

208
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,439
have yourself plus five other people and

209
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,120
you can grow cannabis for them um that's

210
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,879
kind of how it was and before you were

211
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,160
allowed to have six plants per person

212
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,120
but then there are doctors that are

213
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,199
willing to write you an extended plant

214
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,879
count so if you say uh my back hurts a

215
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,720
lot or I've got fibromyalgia and I don't

216
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,639
smoke cannabis I actually make oils out

217
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,120
of all of this and I need a lot more

218
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,840
plants the doctors will be a little

219
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,038
compassionate and they will write you

220
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,679
what's called an extended plant count

221
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:43,360
and sometimes that costs you more money

222
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,240
but in the long run that's worth it

223
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,919
because you need your medicine and that

224
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,199
just allows you to grow more plants and

225
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,878
possess more cannabis so the state has

226
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,319
kind of caught on that some of some

227
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,319
people are going to the doctor and there

228
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,960
are some doctors in Colorado that it

229
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,800
just costs money if you want the

230
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,680
original six plants it's cheap you go in

231
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,199
there and pay a cheap like $45 $50 visit

232
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,639
if you want uh 12 plants they double it

233
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,759
if you want 25 plants they pretty much

234
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,879
quadruple your price if you're wanting

235
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,879
50 plants you're paying five times what

236
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,919
you did before there are some doctors

237
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,158
that will write a 99 plant

238
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:23,359
recommendation for $500 flat uh so you

239
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:26,918
can grow 99 plants in your house for

240
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,158
$500 for one year um that's how it was

241
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:29,598
but now they're making all kinds of

242
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:31,000
rules because they have seen that what

243
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:35,278
happens is a lot of people sign up for

244
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,958
99 plants and if you grow 99 sgon pots

245
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,958
hopefully you're pulling a whole bunch

246
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,838
of weight and then that's hitting the

247
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,000
black market and they're kind of aware

248
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:43,399
of that and they don't want that

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,799
happening in the state of Colorado

250
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,039
anymore they're really trying to crack

251
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,439
down and tax every gram of pot that's

252
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,639
produced I'm going to take a sip here

253
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,839
and then I'll read you this news article

254
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,838
I've

255
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:57,759
got I've got some yba mate here it's

256
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,119
nice and hot got to be careful with that

257
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,879
woo all right so the uh this news

258
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,320
article comes from a website called the

259
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,240
Cannabis shout out to the Cannabis I uh

260
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,760
I pull a lot of news articles from this

261
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,879
site this was actually published

262
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,000
February 26th so I'm a little bit behind

263
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:14,200
but this is still relevant the article

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,278
was by Joey bunch of the Denver Post the

265
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,920
headline is Colorado MMJ caregiver Bill

266
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,320
clears senate

267
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,078
committee the article says a state

268
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,360
senate committee on Thursday unanimously

269
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:26,759
approved a bill that would require

270
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,720
medical marijuana caregivers to register

271
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,600
and allow state agencies to share enough

272
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,240
information to to ensure pot grown for

273
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,079
medicine isn't sold

274
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,839
illegally while pot sold for

275
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:37,559
recreational use has been subject to a

276
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,399
battery of tests and regulations since

277
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,958
it became legal last year medical

278
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,679
marijuana has gone relatively

279
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,958
unregulated requiring only that

280
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,078
caregivers be at least 18 years old and

281
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,319
have sub significant responsibility for

282
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,519
the care of a licensed medical marijuana

283
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,760
user uh there's actually a spot on the

284
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,639
application that asks what services you

285
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,600
provide for your patient um I write

286
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,120
spiritual counseling I write that I

287
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,839
drive them to from their doctor's

288
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,200
appointments uh because a lot of that is

289
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,200
true uh I prepare meals for some of my

290
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,640
patients um yeah they ask for what you

291
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,320
do and so you got to fill that in and

292
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,000
actually they have they denied one of my

293
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,440
caregiver requests I had to refill out

294
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,320
the paper and put better reasoning

295
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,040
because they did not like my reasons why

296
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,720
I was part of their significant

297
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,838
responsibility so they are paying a

298
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,000
little bit of attention I'll get back to

299
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,120
the article it says the regulatory bill

300
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,679
was characterized by the state agency

301
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,679
and law enforcement officials as a

302
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,439
benefit to caregivers because those

303
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,239
registered would not have to face arrest

304
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,519
or cost or costly legal proceedings if

305
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,919
they're registered with the state the

306
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,240
bill is supported by the Colorado

307
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,120
Cannabis Chamber of Commerce the medical

308
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,919
marijuana supporters testified they were

309
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,120
concerned about cost from regulations

310
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,919
patient privacy and the risk risks of

311
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,480
untested medical marijuana this bill is

312
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,039
re really about assessing law

313
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,639
enforcement but it's doing so at the

314
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,559
expense of the rights of patients and

315
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,000
caregivers said Colorado marijuana

316
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:01,239
activist Robert Chase who opposed the

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,120
legislation leg ation I'm sorry uh in

318
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,839
2009 when the US Attorney General's

319
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,839
office advised federal agents not to

320
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,800
intervene in cases that are compliant

321
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:13,079
with state laws medical marijuana licens

322
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:16,000
have exploded in Colorado in 2008 there

323
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:18,359
were 4,819 licensed medical marijuana

324
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,360
patients in Colorado said Senator Irene

325
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:25,919
agular as of last December there were 11

326
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,919

327
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,879
the bill Senate sponsor but to keep

business the state must regulate it

330
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,879
adequately she said the federal

331
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,120
expectation is that states that have

332
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,879
allowed marijuana to be legal and local

333
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,919
governments will be implementing strong

334
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,039
and effective Regulatory and enforcement

335
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,479
systems that will protect Public Safety

336
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,120
public health and law enforcement

337

338

2013

344
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,720
Colorado had 35 patients younger than 18

345
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,600
by last December the number of miners

346
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,160
had grown to 462 agular said Sierra

347
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,079
riddle of Colorado Springs said she

348
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,759
moved from Utah in 2013 because her son

349
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,638
has cancer and needs medical marijuana

350
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,759
um big shout out to team Landon what's

351
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,198
up I didn't even know Sierra was going

352
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,838
to be mentioned in this article those

353
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:24,278
are uh people that we support in

354
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,000
Colorado Springs so support team Landon

355
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:27,600
and Sierra riddle if you can big shout

356
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,159
out uh the amount of children that are

357
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,759
increasing on the medical marijuana

358
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:32,319
registry needs to be considered because

359
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,399
it's only going to increase more she

360
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,480
said these rules and laws need to be put

361
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,278
in place to protect our children to

362
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,360
protect their plant count and to protect

363
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,838
our rights to grow their plants now this

364
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,480
article kind of hits home because I'm a

365
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,399
caregiver myself and the local rules are

366
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,199
changing here to where uh we are we are

367
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,559
being reduced on the number of patients

368
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,000
we are allowed to have which will also

369
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,638
reduce the number of plants we are

370
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,039
allowed to have and they have also

371
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,079
reduced the amount of space we are

372
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:02,799
allowed to use so that means the five

373
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:05,319
people that I'm responsible for

374
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,240
providing medical marijuana to somebody

375
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,360
is going to have to find somebody else

376
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,079
to grow their medicine for them and the

377
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,240
state doesn't give a [ __ ] that I've have

378
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:17,039
been responsible for them for the past

379
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,879
seven or eight years it has been my

380
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,480
responsibility and my duty to take care

381
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,439
of these people I have established a

382
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,000
relationship with them and I have a

383
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,920
significant role in caring for these

384
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,559
people but the state does not care they

385
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,599
need to end that and find a new

386
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,039
caregiver to grow their medical cannabis

387
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,560
for them uh I think that's [ __ ]

388
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,278
because I know these people I know what

389
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,518
strains they like I have bred strains

390
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,679
for my patients yes that's what I do I

391
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,399
have people that smoke medical cannabis

392
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,278
and I will breed strains for them the

393
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,360
night nurse was inspired by my friend

394
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,039
Doug um he's an older cat and his body

395
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,919
hurts and he has a hard time sleeping

396
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,519
when he smoked the torab Bora he said

397
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,399
holy [ __ ] and when he smoked the

398
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,120
Grateful Dog he said holy [ __ ] those

399
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,399
were two of his favorite strains ever so

400
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,240
I felt like it was my job to make a

401
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,120
hybrid of the two and then find the

402
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,639
right phenotype that worked for Doug and

403
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,799
when I grew those he loved it and now

404
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,198
guess what sorry Doug I don't get to be

405
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,799
your caregiver anymore because the state

406
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,679
doesn't give a [ __ ] about our Bonafide

407
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,919
relationship that we've developed over

408
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,239
years not really Doug I'm keeping you

409
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,519
but that's my example and team Landon

410
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,360
there are little kids out there with

411
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,839
brain tumors cancers seizures lymphoma

412
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,120
kids have all kinds of bad things that

413
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,680
adults have and now we need to let these

414
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,159
kids have their caregivers have plant

415
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,679
counts this is messed up this is why I'm

416
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,838
fired up because this is what medical

417
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,359
this is what started the Cannabis

418
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,800
movement in Colorado was medical

419
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,440
cannabis and caregivers caregivers are

420
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,639
what started it the patients and the

421
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,079
caregivers are ground zero and now guess

422
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,240
who's being screwed right out of this

423
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,078
steel the patients and the caregivers

424
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,440
because they want us to be forced to

425
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:53,719
shop at Recreational dispensaries where

426
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,199
taxes are [ __ ] ridiculous and we

427
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,639
cannot afford it how are we going to

428
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:57,879
medicate ourselves that way the reason

429
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,240
we are medicating ourselves with

430
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,919
cannabis is so that we don't have to

431
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,079
jump through somebody else's Hoops so

432
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:04,599
that we don't have to go stand in line

433
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:07,359
to pay ridiculous prices for medicine

434
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,000
you're [ __ ] us over guys sorry end of

435
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,560
rant I'm passionate about this it pisses

436
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,320
me off because the patients that started

437
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,479
medical cannabis are now the people that

438
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,199
nobody I can't say nobody the people

439
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,519
that most of this industry is looking

440
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,120
over right now we've forgotten them it's

441
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,078
all about the patient Patients First

442
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,159
without the patients there would have

443
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,359
been no medical marijuana movement there

444
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,639
would not have been caregivers there

445
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,919
would have not been hom grows and we

446
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,959
would not have gotten as far as we've

447
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,159
gotten today we be years behind if we

448
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,518
did not start this with medical

449
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,480
marijuana all right so think about the

450
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,278
patience you guys I'm going to do the

451
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,720
best I can I'm going to have to register

452
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,000
my grows with my city and with my state

453
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,160
they're going to come to my private grow

454
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,559
and they're going to look through my

455
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,039
grows and make sure that I'm following

456
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,039
all of the laws and that everything is

457
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,639
done up to code I'm going to sign up to

458
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,559
do that because I'm well known around

459
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,839
here and if I don't do it I know they

460
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,719
will come here and they will try to

461
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,480
press some kind of legal charges on me

462
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,480
um there are paper papers that I can

463
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,399
fill out to have an excuse or an

464
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,560
exception to have more uh patients but I

465
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,078
don't see I'm going to really have to

466
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:08,799
pull a lot of reasons out of the air

467
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:10,159
because their their paperwork they don't

468
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,399
have any compassion they have check

469
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,639
marks you know what I mean does this

470
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,198
this and this happen then no and it's

471
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,600
just like talking to a computer instead

472
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,958
of a person with compassion it sucks all

473
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,000
right that's enough on that article give

474
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,679
me a second all right guys I'm back I

475
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,440
took a couple dabs I calmed down I'm not

476
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,359
so pissed off about that last article

477
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,000
anymore but we have a whole new article

478
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,199
coming up and this could uh this could

479
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,839
do a lot of things to to us uh the sub

480

headline is another lawsuit has been

481
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,199

amendment 64 what makes the new suit

486
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,278
unique is that it is also asking for a

487

federal judge to overturn Amendment 64's

Denver Post let's get right into into it

492
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,119
six Colorado sheriffs sued their own

493
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,720
governor in federal court on Thursday

494
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,479
arguing that state laws legalizing

495
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,679
marijuana require them to violate

496
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,798
federal law joining the sheriffs in the

497
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,079
lawsuit the fourth to be filed against

498
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,519

499
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,159
the sheriffs and prosecutors from

500
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,119
Nebraska and Kansas the suit argues that

501
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,319
federal law Supremacy means Colorado

502
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:24,599
cannot allow people to possess or use

503
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,759
marijuana for recreational purposes and

504
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,359
it cannot license stores to sell it the

505
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,919
law does not challenge Colorado's

506
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,879
medical marijuana laws or stores the

507
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,919
suit is about one thing the rule of the

508
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,720
law larer County Sheriff Justin Smith

509
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,919
said in a news release release I said

510
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,279
released geez uh the Colorado

511
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,440
Constitution mandates that all elected

512
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:47,000
officials including sheriffs swear an

513
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,080
oath of office to uphold both the United

514
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,160
States as well as the Colorado

515
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,839
constitutions the suit names Governor

516
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,798
John Hickenlooper as the lone defendant

517
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,319
Colorado's attorney general Cynthia

518
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:59,519
Kaufman will defend the State against

519
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:02,439
the lawsuit of spokesman for her

520
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,519
said the lawsuit excuse me the lawsuit

521
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,600
has the backing of national

522
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,720
anti-legalization groups and its

523
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,279
Nationwide Ambitions were apparent in

524
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,960
the choice of where to announce the suit

525
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,200
in a news conference Thursday morning at

526
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,000
the national Press Club in Washington DC

527
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,240
Smith told reporters that Colorado's

528
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,798
passage of amendment 64 created a

529
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,279
constitutional shutdown in the state the

530
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,359
amendment which voters approved in 2012

531
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,240
made it legal for people over 21 in

532
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,079
Colorado to possess limited amounts of

533
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,759
marijuana and for licens stores to sell

534
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,399
marijuana cannabis we think that col we

535
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,599
think that what Colorado has done is

536
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,798
illegal we think it's unconstitutional

537
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,678
Scots Bluff County Nebraska Sheriff Mark

538
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,038
Overman who is also a plaintiff in the

539
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,559
suit said at the news conference I

540
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,440
believe my fellow plaintiffs believe

541
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,038
that this case is going to have National

542
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,038
ramifications and if we win then we can

543
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:56,319
reverse what looks like a surrender to a

544
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,759
pro marijuana crowd the lawsuit follows

545
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,158
another legal challenge filed in

546
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,400
December by Nebraska and Oklahoma which

547
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,120
asked the US Supreme Court to strike

548
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,440
down the history-making law two lawsuits

549
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,479
filed earlier this year by the

550
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,000
anti-legalization group Safe Streets

551
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,798
Alliance on behalf of several Colorado

552
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,798
residents are also pending against the

553
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:18,000
state over amendment 64 similar to the

554
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:19,798
previous lawsuits the new suit seeks to

555
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,279
close all of Colorado's recreational

556
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,480
marijuana stores but it also asks

557
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:27,079
Federal a federal judge to overturn

558
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,360
Amendment 64's protections for marijuana

559
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:31,599
use and possession the law enforcement

560
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,119
officials suit claim that local officers

561
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,678
are breaking federal law and

562
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,158
international treaties when they find

563
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,200
marijuana but they do not seize it at

564
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,080
Thursday's news conference Yuma County

565
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,080
Sheriff Chad day said Colorado's

566
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:46,279
marijuana laws now prohibit officers

567
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,480
from seizing marijuana in C certain

568
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:52,639
circumstances putting officers he said

569
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,960
in an inevitable uh position that's kind

570
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,360
of funny uh by supporting and upholding

571
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,880
one we violating the other he said I'm

572
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,479
excited to very least get an answer from

573
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,080
the courts D these cops are not robots

574
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,440
they are people and they know they're

575
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,759
they know what they're supposed to do

576
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,159
these guys are acting like we've got

577
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,558
droids out there acting as police

578
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,200
officers and we're going to flip their

579
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,038
switch and make their computers crash

580
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,159
this is ridiculous dude uh Sam Cayman

581
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:19,480

law professor at the University of

583
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,519
Denver was skeptical of the sheriff's

584
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:26,480
argument he said no law requires local

585
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:29,440
officers to act as deao federal drug

586
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,640

store regulation piece but they're also

590

more arrests and strain their budgets um

622
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:54,000

626
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,120
worry about arresting more people and

627
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:03,599
straining your budget you'll be able to

628

00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,639
related to hallucinogenic drugs so more

649
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,038
[ __ ] they call cannabis a

650
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,278
hallucinogenic drug which is right in

651
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,720
the same category as probably LSD

652
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:57,599
mushrooms

line that this is now a hallucinogenic

657
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,520
drug and you cross this invisible line

658
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,440
and now it's recreational cannabis and

659
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:13,240
then you can cross another line and it's

660
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,360
medical marijuana this is so good I love

661
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,919
the uh time and place that we live in

662
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,678
this is so amazing to me all right uh

663
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,960
where was I Colorado officials have not

664
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,038
yet responded to any of the pinning

665
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,640
lawsuits previously State Attorneys have

666
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,440
argued that Colorado's more permissive

667
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,840
marijuana laws both for medical and

668
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,919
recreational use and sales do not out to

669
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,678
legalization of marijuana instead they

670
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,000
contend that marijuana remains illegal

671
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,159
in Colorado aside from the specific

672
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,640
exemptions allowed under the medical and

673
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,080
recreational marijuana laws when

674
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,360
Nebraska and Oklahoma filed their

675
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:45,278
lawsuit against Colorado last year then

676
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,199
Colorado Attorney General John John

677
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,038
suthers said in a statement that it

678
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,759
appears the plaintiff's primary

679
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,440
grievance stems from a non-enforcement

680
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:55,759
of federal laws regarding marijuana as

681
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,038
opposed to choices made by the voters of

682
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,519
Colorado Mason tvert one of the lead

683
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,278
proponent on of amendment 64 said if the

684
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:04,158
lawsuits are successful in Striking down

685
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:06,400
the measure it would lead to a system of

686
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,760
marijuana chaos which I would love to

687
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,000
see what happened I don't want it to

688
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,759
happen but it'd be really neat to see

689
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,038
how it's dealt with because there are

690
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:15,119
dispensaries on every other Corner in

691
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:18,079
Denver every other Corner in Colorado

692
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:20,079
Springs bublo West has 12 or 15

693
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,678
dispensaries now in that small community

694
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,319
they are everywhere they'd be hard to

695
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,600
come and they'd have to go to California

696
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,319
they'd have to go to every state that's

697
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,678
got medical cannabis they couldn't just

698
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:32,038
come here cuz then that would be uh

699
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,159
they'd be singling us out says this is

700
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,640
just another case of the arrest and

701
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,278
prosecution industry teaming up with

702
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,720
marijuana prohibition groups to roll

703
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,278
back the progress that has been made in

704
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,960
Colorado he said in a statement Thursday

705
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,679
uh us rep Jared pus said in a statement

706
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,200
that the US Department of Justice and

707
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,798
President Obama have made clear that

708
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
they will not interfere with the states

709
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,319
whose citizens voted for recreational

710
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,240
marijuana use this lawsuit is a silly

711
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,519
attempt to circumvent the will of

712
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,839
Colorado voters and is a waste of time

713
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,519
po statement said says unfortunately

714
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,398
these frivolous lawsuits will likely

715
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,599
continue until we pass my bipartisan

716
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:08,918
regulate marijuana like alcohol act and

717
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,359
finally end the outdated Federal

718
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:12,520
prohibition of

719
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:13,879
marijuana so these states have filed a

720
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,398
suit and they're trying to sue us to

721
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,399
shut down our recreational marijuana

722
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:22,000
program because they can't get cannabis

723
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:23,959
to stop coming into their states I think

724
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,319
I said it the first time stop [ __ ]

725
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,079
with us and do what you can to make

726
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:33,000
respectable responsible cannabis laws in

727
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,798
Nebraska and Kansas and Oklahoma and

728
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,880
then the states bordering those will

729
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,798
have to follow suit and then eventually

730
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,360
it'll just be a whole green map instead

731
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,319
of having a red and blue map we'll start

732
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,879
having all green States this will be

733
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,398
great all right so here's another

734
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,039
article that I keep seeing pop up on

735
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:49,639
social media I'm finding this article on

736
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:51,879
the Cannabis I get a lot of my articles

737
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,880
from there this was written by

738
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,080
Christopher Ingraham from The Washington

739
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,559
Post there's a cute little headline

740
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,240
article here or headline picture of a

741
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,960
little bunny rabbit sitting on a digital

742
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,759
scale and the bunny weighs 93.2 grams

743
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,278
that's kind of cute um the headline says

744
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,119
Utah DEA warns of stoned rabbits if

745
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:15,278
State passes medical marijuana bill I'll

746
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:17,879
say it again DEA warns of stoned rabbits

747
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,679
if State passes medical marijuana bill

748
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,278
now let you take that in now I'll read

749
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,640
the

750
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,960
article Utah is considering a bill that

751
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,640
would allow patients with certain

752
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,759
debilitating conditions to be treated

753
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,960
with edible forms of marijuana

754
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,558
if the bill passes the state's Wildlife

755
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,480
May cultivate a taste for the plant lose

756
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,359
their fear of humans and basically be

757
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,240
high all the time that's according to

758
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,398
testimony presented to a Utah State

759
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,960
panel last week by an agent of The Drug

760
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:45,959
Enforcement Administration IDE deal in

761
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,919
facts IDE deal in science said special

762
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,480
agent Matt Fairbanks who's been working

763
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,278
in the state for a decade he is a member

764
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,519
of the marijuana eradication team in

765
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:57,000
Utah some of his colleagues in Georgia

766
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:59,240
recently achieved notoriety by re raing

767
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,398
a retirees Garden and seizing a number

768
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,359
of okra plants Fairbanks spoke of his

769
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:06,798
time eliminating Backcountry marijuana

770
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:08,639
grows in the Utah mountains specifically

771
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,599
the environmental costs associated with

772
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,960
large-scale weed cultivation on public

773
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:15,000
land personally I've seen entire

774
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,319
mountainsides subjected to pesticides

775
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,960
harmful chemicals deforestation and

776
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:22,200
erosion he said the ramifications to the

777
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,880
Flora the animal life the contaminated

778
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,679
water are still unknown Fairbanks said

779
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,640
that at some illegal marijuana grow

780
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,960
sites he saw rabbits that had C ated a

781
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,320
taste for the marijuana he continued one

782
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,480
of them refused to leave us as we took

783
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:38,119
all the marijuana around him but his

784
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,558
Natural Instincts to run Were Somehow

785
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:42,000
gone it's true that illegal pot farming

786
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,879
can have harmful environmental

787
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,519
consequences of course nothing about

788
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,720
these consequences is unique to

789
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,159
marijuana If corn were outlawed the

790
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,240
cartels would start growing it on

791
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:53,559
national forests the per plant

792
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,880
environmental toll would be about the

793
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:57,720
same which is kind of a neat fact uh but

794
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,039
Bounty marijuana grows are a direct

795
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,839
result of marijuana's illegal status if

796
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:04,119
you're concerned about the environmental

797
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,079
impact of the grows an alternative is to

798
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:07,959
legalize and regulate the plant so that

799
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,519
people can grow it on farms and in their

800
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,440
Gardens rather than on remote Mountain

801
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,278
sides now regarding Stone rabbits some

802
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,558
wild animals apparently do develop a

803
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,440
taste for

804
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,240
bud but I don't know that the occasional

805
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,159
High rabbit constitutes for grounds for

806
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,759
keeping marijuana Prohibition in place

807
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,240
any more than drunk squirrels are an

808
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:29,079
argument for outlawing alcohol and let's

809
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,919
not even get started on the Nationwide

810
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:34,480
epidemic of catnip

811
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,278
abuse there was a time not too long ago

812
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,159
when drug Warriors terrified a nation

813
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:40,319
with images of the devil's weed and reer

814
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,480
Madness now it seems that enforcers of

815
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,759
marijuana law Conjuring up a stoned

816
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Bunny not scary enough for the Utah

817
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,038
State it seems the panel approved the

818
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,038
bill and sent it to the full Senate

819
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:52,759
where it will be debated this week well

820
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,558
good luck to you Utah I hope that this

821
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,240
bill passes I hope that you're allowed

822
00:28:54,558 --> 00:29:00,918
to consume an edible form of marijuana

823

from across the country and around the

845
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,720
world along the way we've covered the

846
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,079
huge progress many states have made

847
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,640
toward legalization and wondered why

848
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:51,119
others are so far behind this country

849
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,960
still has a long way to go but things

850
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,719
are looking up and we have our fingers

851
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,558
crossed that 2015 will be another big

852
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,038
year for legalization but the to won't

853
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,839
be around to see it at least not in its

854

the year uh don't worry we're not

858
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:11,278
