00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:34,359
today's show I do have a website that

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,320
main website is iy genetics.com on that

36
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:38,239
website you will find a row of tabs at

37
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,599
the top there's a row of tabs one of

38
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,199
them says grow help or grow questions if

39
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,959
you click on that growel or grow

40

46
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,438

like this it says Hey Rasta Jeff I love

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,879
learning all about plant breeding from

53
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,840
your show and I appreciate all you do

54
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,280
for the community bro you are very

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,800
welcome thank you for the great uh

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,919
compliment there it says on several

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,719
occasions I have been successful in

58
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,238
reversing a female photo period using

59
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,439
collodial silver okay so this person is

60
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,840
uh using idal silver which is a common

61
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,840
practice to reverse plants to create

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,560
feminized pollen to make feminized seeds

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,759
uh it says uh they've been successful

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,120
doing it so they're off to a good start

65
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:46,158
it says my question is here's where we

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,120
get fun uh once the plant shows signs

67
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:50,799
that it has been reversed an example

68
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,439
it's starting to grow uh pollen sacks

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,519
would I then be able to cut clones and

70
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:59,840
grow these plants out as male plants to

71
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,800
be used for future breeding purposes if

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,000
so what would be the best time to take

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,920
clones from my new father plan all right

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,639
that's a very good question it makes a

75
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,318
lot of sense I understand exactly what

76
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:13,199
you're asking unfortunately it does not

77
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,798
work the way you are kind of hoping that

78
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,598
it is going to work so let me kind of

79
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,480
retrace this question here frame it in a

80
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,280
way that everybody is going to

81
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:24,479
understand um this person is taking a

82
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,878
female plant they are treating it with

83
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,518
colloidal silver that colloidal silver

84
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,959
will in turn there's a a chemical

85
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,959
process that happens inside the plant

86
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,199
we're not going to focus on that today

87
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,239
what happens is that causes that plant

88
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,958
to create pollen that pollen is all

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,239
female because hopefully they chose a

90
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,360
plant that is all female there are only

91
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,759
X chromosomes in there there will be a

92
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,760
lack of Y chromosomes when that pollen

93
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,318
is transferred to another female plant

94
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,120
that is all X chromosomes there's no Y

95
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,878
chromosome available in this breeding

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,039
project we will make all female seeds

97
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,919
that is what is supposed to happen here

98
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,000
this person is asking when they treat

99
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,238
this female plant that becomes the

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,598
pollen donor can they then cut clones of

101
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,560
that plant and treat that clone as if it

102
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,878
were a male plant so to speak a constant

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,000
pollen donating plant uh would that

104
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:16,199
trait continue would that process stay

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,279
permanent unfortunately uh no that is

106
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,759
not a permanent process uh that plant

107
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,279
eventually over time will uh grow out of

108
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,080
that chemical treatment that you've been

109
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:28,000
giving it it'll say hey all that

110
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,918
chemical spray is gone the Silver's not

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,240
coming in my copper is not disrupted I

112
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,680
don't have to [Â __Â ] with my ethylene

113
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,840
response uh I can start going back to a

114
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
normal female plant and growing female

115
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,279
again so if you cut that clone of that

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,600
reversed plant uh let it grow it will

117
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,638
take some time it's just like reving but

118
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,560
it will reveg and it will go back into

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,720
its female form this is why we've got to

120
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,280
spray the plants so many times when

121
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,680
we're using uh colloidal silver silver

122
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,198
tho sulfate um you've got to spray them

123
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,120
that week before and then uh I do it

124
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,960
every 3 days for seven or eight

125
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,319
sometimes 9 or 10 times I keep going

126
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,478
depending on um so if it's like a 9 or

127
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,000
10 week plant I just spray it up to day

128
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:12,439
21 if it's an 11 or 12 week plant any

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,959
further than that I will spray it like

130
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:19,000
um up to day 24 27 maybe even day 30

131
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,680
because I needed to continue uh to stay

132
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,720
uh reversed for longer and it may uh it

133
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,759
may decide to go back to its original

134
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,639
female form if I don't keep treating it

135
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,319
with that silver product so um your idea

136
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,560
is awesome it's a really good idea I

137
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,680
wish it worked that way it would save me

138
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,038
uh time money space effort energy a lot

139
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,280
of headaches a lot of heartaches a lot

140
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:40,959
of questions a lot of concerns a lot of

141
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,359
stress but uh it does not work that way

142
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,478
unfortunately that female will find its

143
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,600
way back to female uh you're just giving

144
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,159
it uh you're just giving it a chemical

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,560
that's confusing the plant it's going

146
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,120
hey I'm not sure what to do so this is

147
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,959
how I'm acting now uh once you put that

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,240
plant back in its normal condition quit

149
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,758
giving it that chemical uh that that

150
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,918
silver disappears uh grows out of that

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,520
all that hormonal disrupt uh disruption

152
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:05,918
uh goes back into balance sorry I'm

153
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,839
thinking as I'm speaking I'm trying to

154
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,318
have nine thoughts ahead of myself once

155
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,318
all that hormonal imbalance is

156
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,520
rebalanced then the plant will just be

157
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,720
your normal female plant once again just

158
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,439
like it was when you started so I think

159
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,599
I answered that one pretty good if uh if

160
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,000
we cut clones and grow them out will it

161
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,959
be a male no those will go back to

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,360
female plants just like you started with

163
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,560
you have to reverse it all over again uh

164
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,800
that's why I'm always doing the

165

this one also did come from that growel

189
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,399
tab on IR genetics.com this one is from

190
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,519
our new friend chony chony thank you for

191

inbox you've got a coupon code for free

193
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,639
seeds what's better than free seeds you

194
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,918
guys free seeds are the best all right

195
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,038
here we are the question goes hey rosta

196
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:36,598
Jeff hey Chanty good to meet you says

197
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,159
thank you for the podcast and for always

198
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:42,360
being there with hundreds of episodes to

199
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,919
escape into I love that uh I'm a podcast

200
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,479
consumer as well I listen to podcast

201
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:48,038
when the days not going even when the

202
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,000
day is going the way that I want it to

203
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:51,318
but sometimes if I just need my head on

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,199
something else something else in my

205
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,158
brain I just go to one of my favorite

206
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,478
podcast click play and I can escape into

207
00:07:55,158 --> 00:08:00,000
that show I'll be laughing at LS and

208
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,439
Zach or uh getting grossed out Legion of

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,879
skanks or something great will be

210
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,038
happening in no time so I understand and

211

I appreciate it thank you I like being

212
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,560
your uh your little escape and you're

213
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,639
learning something while you're escaping

214
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,639
so that's even better uh there is a

215
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,598
point to this question it says have you

216
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,280
found any companies that can perform hlv

217
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:21,360
testing on seeds that is a very good

218
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,959
question is a seed seller a seed breeder

219
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,199
a seed maker uh I am a very good person

220
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,198
to ask about this it said did they

221
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,598
validate their test to be performed on

222
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,479
seeds uh than thanks as always have an

223
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,718
amazing day uh cheers Chanty Chanty big

224
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,320
cheers my dude this is a great question

225
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,320
so the question is about testing seeds

226
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,080
actual seed batches batches of seeds for

227
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,080
hop latent vroid um I have been in

228
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,160
contact with somebody I can't say too

229
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,320
much cuz uh things are uh things are in

230
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,679
development man but I can't talk too

231
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,680
much about what's being worked on and

232
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,278
the conversations that have been had

233
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,799
what I can tell you is right now there

234
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:02,639
is not a way to test the SE seeds

235
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,519
without destroying them to put uh to

236
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,519
test the seed to see if it's got hyate

237
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,919
and thyroid in that individual seed that

238
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,679
seed must be crushed and destroyed uh in

239
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,120
the testing process that's just how the

240
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,199
test Works uh you basically crush the

241
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,720
seed rub the inside onto a little it's

242
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,079
it's easy but you got to crush it and

243
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,160
rub it onto something and then that is

244
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:25,159
your sample that the test is taken from

245
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,480
but um you have to destroy the seed

246
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,838
basically to do that and then now you

247
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,600
can't grow the seed so so far what we

248
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,320
have come up with the method that we are

249
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,040
using is we can test the batch of seed

250
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,278
and tell you if the seeds that were

251
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:41,399
tested themselves had hlate and vroid in

252
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,720
them uh so what we're doing is testing

253
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,799
somewhere between 10 and 30% of a

254
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,560
population of seeds so let's just say

255
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,679
I've got a 100 seeds of a new cross

256
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,919
which would be a small number it's

257
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,719
generally going to be a thousand so

258
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,199
we'll say a thousand we'll say we've got

259
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,360
a thousand seeds right I just made a

260
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,440
thousand seeds from a batch we want to

261
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,079
test these and see if there's any hlv in

262
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,440
there out of that thousand we would

263
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:05,159
scoop out somewhere between 100 and 300

264
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,200
seeds 10 to 30% of those seeds and we

265
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,799
would test those seeds and hopefully we

266
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,040
don't see any virus in there if that

267
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:13,958
batch of those seeds is clean that's how

268
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,559
we're mostly going to say that we trust

269
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,518
that this batch of seeds is clean if

270
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,199
we've tested 30% of them and the virus

271
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,240
is not present the seeds should be clean

272
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,399
that is the standard at this time it may

273
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,759
improve we may find something different

274
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,440
that's what we're working with now uh

275
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,679
the other thing the other Safeguard the

276
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,839
other uh the other uh redundancy that

277
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,879
we're doing is we are uh checking each

278
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,480
parent plant of those seeds well so if

279
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,679
we made uh let's just hypothetically say

280
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,480
we made so um I don't want to give any

281
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,838
details away I want to share strain

282
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,120
names and things but I don't want to

283
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,480
delve into the future and tell you

284
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,560
what's coming up let's just say we made

285
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,039
some lemon Jeffree seeds we got the

286
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:52,359
Golden Goat we got the Lemon Skunk uh

287
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,879
both of those have been tested for hlv

288
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,519
both of those have recently been sent in

289
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,000
for hlv tests those two plants are clean

290
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,639
the Golden Goat I think I did Golden

291
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,519
Goat lemon skunk uh those are STD free

292
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,799
ready to go those are clean plants so I

293
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,399
breed with those and then as a double

294
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,679
check a triple check we send in the

295
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,519
seeds as well those seeds are destroyed

296
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,239
and tested but we know that ah three out

297
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,720
of 10 of those seeds do not have the

298
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,799
virus that's uh the mom the dad and the

299
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,600
babies have all kind of been tested but

300
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,399
so far there's not a way without

301
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,959
destroying the seed that we can test to

302
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,399
find the presence or the absence of hlvd

303
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:31,239
in there unless we Crush destroy and use

304
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,360
that crushed seed as the testing agent

305
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,759
uh it's just how it's got to be done

306
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,200
right now those are the tests that are

307
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,600
available uh when that when it does

308
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,519
evolve and we have more stuff to go by I

309
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,000
definitely will update you because I

310
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,039
would love to brag about it I'd love to

311
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,480
say that every one of my seeds is hlv

312
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,159
tested but if I did that every one of my

313
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,600
seeds would be crushed and destroyed and

314
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,719
it doesn't work that way uh they're bred

315
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,040
from hlv tested plants is what I can

316
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,040
guarantee you um I do a random process

317
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,719
um and I don't I'm not paid by anybody

318
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:01,759
nobody pays me to advertise with them I

319
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,920
actually use two different hlvd testing

320
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,360
companies one of them is quicker one of

321
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,199
them is cheaper uh just depends on if I

322
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,360
want my stuff right now or if I want it

323
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,639
more affordable uh sometimes they do

324
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,199
sales all bu uh like sometimes far

325
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,240
farmer Freeman will do a holiday sale

326
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:17,759
and you can get them for 10% off so if

327
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,600
you buy like 10 tests you're basically

328
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,639
getting two for free is the math on that

329
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,560
I think uh and I'll just buy from farmer

330
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,120
Freeman I also use Tumi genomics uh

331
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,559
they're a little bit cheaper but they do

332
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,759
take longer sometimes uh pros and cons

333
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,559
with both plac

334
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,000
uh they don't pay me um and I'm not

335
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,278
going to tell you who I'm talking to and

336
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,679
working with to develop this testing but

337
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,000
occasionally randomly um about once

338
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,879
every two or three weeks I go through

339
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,759
the room and I just pick how about that

340
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,799
one and that one and that one and I'll

341
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:46,799
just clip off the hlv testing samples

342
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,359
and send those in we'll get them tested

343
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,078
randomly it's like testing the team I

344
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,360
just go into the locker room and I'm

345
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,599
like Bro you've been playing way too

346
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,278
good we got to give you a drug test um

347
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,000
i' just go test everything if anything

348
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,278
looks slow or sad it definitely gets

349
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,159
tested but uh I've been using all the

360
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,958
testing on the seeds um yeah so um

361
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,879
unless we crush and destroy the seeds at

362
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,439
this this point uh we can't really test

363
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,278
each seed for hlvd we can test each

364
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,600
parent plant and we can test populations

365
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:41,039
from the batch of seeds but so far

366
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,000

382
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,719
here in front of me for today's episode

383
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,360
this one also came from the growel tab

384
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,320
this one is from my new friend Jerry

385
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,720
Jerry thank you for the good question

386
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,959
this is just a quick one it says Hey are

387
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,639
spiders bad in your grow this one is

388
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,359
controversial it says I have a lady that

389
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,959
I keep finding webs on should I be

390
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,800
worried I always give a little wash

391
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:36,719
after harvest so does the web actually

392
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,799
matter uh my first question is that a

393
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,360
spider do you have a spider in there

394
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,799
like an arachnid big kind of spider uh

395
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,440
that eats bugs uh keeping an eye on your

396
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,240
plants playing Security in there to eat

397
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,800
up all the freebies that come around or

398
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,519
do you have spider mites in there a

399
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,439
bunch of little creepy crawly plant

400
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,278
sucking leeches um do you have spiders

401
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,800
or spider mites that is my first

402
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,639
question I would say uh verify can you

403
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,120
find find the spider um do you know

404
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,600
where the spider is can you tell the

405
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,759
difference between and I'm not doubting

406
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,839
you I'm just giving you solid advice

407
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,680
that we can cover all of our ground here

408
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,399
can you tell the difference between

409
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,120
normal spider webs that like a spider

410
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,639
would make and spider might webs that

411
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,078
would go across the tops of your plants

412
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,278
can you identify the difference in those

413
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,078
uh let's be very clear which spiders are

414
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:24,078
present in the grow spider mites we need

415
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,120
to take quick immediate action

416
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,838
especially if you're seeing webbing

417
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,560
regular spiders that's up to you my dude

418
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,120
um a lot of people will say that that

419
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,559
spider like I said a moment ago he's

420
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,159
working security there will not be any

421
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,078
other bugs in there that'll be the only

422
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,198
bug in the room is that spider he'll eat

423
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,359
everybody else nobody else wants to come

424
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,799
around if he's there that's cool uh you

425
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,000
don't want other bugs you really don't

426
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,240
want any bugs but one good spider might

427
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,720
work security uh he's the bouncer at the

428
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,759
door making sure you don't get any Riff

429
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,278
Raff so I would identify is it a spider

430
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:57,240
or is it spider mites uh once you

431
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,639
identify that it is a spider is it a

432
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,919
spider that you're okay with there are

433
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,079
some spiders you might not want around

434
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,838
uh I don't know your region of the

435
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,278
country but a brown recluse a black

436
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,120
widow you may want to relocate remove

437
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:10,519
that spider uh do whatever you do in

438
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,519
your humane way that you choose to do it

439
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,198
but I would identify is it a spider or

440
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,679
spider M that would be my first uh my

441
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,919
first plan of attack here um if it's a

442
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,120
spider he's working security verify that

443
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,360
it's a spider uh then see what kind of

444
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,959
spider you've got as for that web that's

445
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,360
gross dude I don't want to smoke any of

446
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,078
your weed with spider webs in it maybe

447
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,399
um work on keeping them off the plants

448
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,479
do what you can do there uh that's just

449
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,240
gross uh even and whatever it is I don't

450
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,039
want any food or smokable products with

451
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,159
spiderwebs on it just doesn't make me uh

452
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,120
gives me the makes me itchy bro is

453
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:45,519
really what it does and then spider

454
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,679
mites if it's spidermites uh spidermites

455
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,078
are bad okay we don't want that at all

456
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,318
we got to get rid of those immediately

457
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,399
we need to come up and if you've got

458
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:54,039
webbing you've got serious spidermites

459
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,120
if that's what what is in there so you

460
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,480
need to come up with a strategy very

461
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,278
quickly I would uh consider shop vacing

462
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,278
those spidermite webs off the top if

463
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:03,919
they made little teepees little domes

464
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:06,318
getting there at the shop vac suck that

465
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,438
right off uh you can use a rag in hot

466
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,399
water you can use a rag and a spray

467
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,558
bottle spray those webs down and wipe

468
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,839
them right off uh after you do that

469
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,759
clean yourself you're going to be

470
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,038
contaminated with spidermites all over

471
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,798
you uh then we're going to need to apply

472
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:23,000
either some aggressive Predator bugs or

473
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,160
sprayed pesticide applications designed

474
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,960
to eradicate spider mites uh probably

475
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,759
one or two pesticides together or and

476
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,558
rotation and go hard and get rid of

477
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:35,558
these bad [Â __Â ] depending on how far

478
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,759
uh into the progress into the cycle you

479
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:40,720
are as well but uh yeah if you got

480
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,839
spiders it is time to consider an

481
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,798
integrated Pest Management option step

482
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:47,839
up your game and consider going hard but

483
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:50,240
the first thing we got to do is find out

484
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,519
like I keep saying is is it spiders is

485
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,000
it a spider or is it spider mites that's

486
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,918
where we're going to make our big

487
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,440
difference here if it's a spider you can

488
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,520
make your own judgment call do you want

489
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,038
that spider there uh maybe you got a

490
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,400
cool spider maybe you got a terrible

491
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,879
spider I don't know how you feel on

492
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,280
spiders plenty of people would say any

493
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,960
spider has got to go but many people

494
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,119
would say that that spider is just fine

495
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,798
there so that's up to you um the webbing

496
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:15,000
is gross to me I would probably

497
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,759
reconsider that part but like I keep

498
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,839
saying make sure it's not spidermites if

499
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:21,558
it's spidermites send me another email

500
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:23,399
we will plan a uh mode of attack because

501
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,158
if you're getting webbing that's a lot

502
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,720
of spidermites all right I think I said

sold out that were extra packs left

533
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,679
because uh orders were made and payments

534
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,640
didn't go through or orders were

535
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,640
cancelled or inventory was miscounted or

536
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,240
[Â __Â ] goes wrong and things happen

537
