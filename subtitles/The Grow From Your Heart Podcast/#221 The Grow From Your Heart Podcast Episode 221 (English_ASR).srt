32
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,170
some air conditioning fans aren't gonna

33
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,818
cut it you need to replace that hot air

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,679
with fresh cool air you need to cool

35
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,939
down the hot air a fan is just gonna

36
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:31,769
blow that heat around and piss your

37
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,908
plants off so figure out some air

38
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:34,500
conditioning for your grow room soon

39
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,740
ladies and gentlemen cuz it's only going

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,060
to get hotter also speaking of heat if

41
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,408
you hear a little rattle noise in the

42
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,179
background a little fluttering sound

43
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,679
that of course is the air conditioner

44
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:45,750
that is the only thing keeping me sane

45
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:48,569
right now I apologize if that is

46
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,450
interrupting the podcast without that I

47
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:52,500
I may go crazy and smash some [ __ ] to

48
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,880
tell you the truth it's too [ __ ] hot

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,079
I hate the heat I'm not a fan of the

50
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,250
heat which sucks because when it gets

51
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,959
cold I'm gonna [ __ ] and complain about

52
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,519
the cold also I wish we could just have

53
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,320
a nice even climate make everything

54
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,060

my next grow thanks for explaining in a

121
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:19,759
simple way I'm gonna skip the next

122
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,988
couple of lines because it reveals too

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
much about you and I'm not sure that you

124
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:23,689
want people to know who you are and

125
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,430
that's a little personal something to

126
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:26,779
skip that and then you say and we'll

127
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,370
probably bug you in the future with a

128
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,859

174
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,880
somebody out if you ask me this question

175
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,839
you obviously need the answer so I'm

176
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,819
trying to get through as many of these

177
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:01,279
emails as I can and give them solid

178
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:03,169
answers so let's get right into this one

179
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,750
this one starts off in big bold capital

180
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:08,329
letters please try not to use my real

181
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,579
name in my email address if you do this

182
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:12,348
in the podcast then he says if you do

183
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,180
it's cool I'm not super worried thanks

184
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:15,379

185
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,459
worry bro I'm not gonna say your name

186
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:18,500

187
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,359
you could be incognito with me he goes

188
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,860
on to say sort of longtime listener here

189
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,569
I love listening to you in the gang get

190
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,430
high as [ __ ] and do your throwback

191
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:27,259
podcast they've been great for real

192
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,788
istening while I set up a new grow I've

193
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,800
been growing underground in Illinois

194
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,899
until the last couple of years then took

195
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,718
a break so things have changed for sure

196
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:37,579
I just to kind of explain what this

197
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:40,490
guy's talking about he said I do like

198
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:41,930
your throwback podcasts on Thursdays

199
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,509
I've been putting out what I call

200
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,370
throwback Thursday episodes where I take

201
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:48,229
chunks of old episodes usually three

202
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,228
four maybe five episodes and I put them

203
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:53,149
into one chunk of of one file and then I

204
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:55,129
post that up to iTunes and stitcher and

205
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:57,439
wherever else it goes my website I regen

206
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,180
attics Colorado calm which that website

207
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,620
sucks you guys I apologize the website

208
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,050
is kind of a piece of [ __ ] it needs some

209
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,030
love I don't have time or motivation to

210
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,658
work on that the podcast works that's

211
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:10,279
what we need so that's there but uh I

212
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:12,918
put up the episodes and they're old

213
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,408
episodes iTunes and stitcher and my

214
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,500
website only hold 100 episodes in the

215
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:20,658
feed we are currently at episode number

216
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,709
221 is what I think this is so that

217
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:24,728
means there are a hundred and twenty-one

218
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:27,019
episodes not available to you anywhere I

219
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:29,360
that are not in that feed so I'm putting

220
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:30,978
them out in old chunks I am also putting

221
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,379
them up on YouTube but that's taking me

222
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:35,028
a little while I do have the first 60

223
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:36,230
videos up on YouTube but I've been

224
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:37,670
putting out the old throwback there

225
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,840
the episode so that people can go back

226
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,970
and listen to that because there are

227
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:43,219
some great episodes in there from about

228
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,960
episode 50 to about a hundred there are

229
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,200
some really golden episodes like

230
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,519
scheduling a perpetual harvest and just

231
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,339
stuff along those lines

232
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,109
lots of improving harvest and harvest

233
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,729
weights stuff like that

234
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,500
I absolutely is one of my favorite

235
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,730
episodes personally but those those

236
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,709
aren't in the feed anymore

237
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,890
so I've been throwing those old episodes

238
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:05,419
back in chunks so that if I put that way

239
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,099
when I put three episodes out I'm only

240
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,140
losing one episode and there are three

241
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,400
freshies for somebody to listen to I'm

242
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,229
trying to keep content fresh for you

243
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,449
guys and as I'm going I'm making videos

244
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,129
for YouTube I'm just simply putting the

245
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,139
girl from your heart podcast logo up on

246
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,909
the screen and then running the audio in

247
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,349
the background I'm doing very little to

248
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,600
the videos I just want to get them out

249
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,340
there so that they're listenable I will

250
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,140
catch up thanks for being patient with

251
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,669
me on that holy crap that's a lot of

252
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,979
ranting let me slap myself in the face

253
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,570
and get back focused you do like to

254
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,190
throwbackthursday podcast thank you

255
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,870
because they're kind of a lot of work it

256
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,310
takes my computer a long time to process

257
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,960
that big of a file putting it together

258
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,969
kind of takes me a minute so I'm glad

259
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,530
you appreciate that they're great for

260
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,810
listening while setting up a new grow

261
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,339
yes I love listening to podcasts while

262
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:48,979
setting up a new grow just helps me get

263
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,450
in the zone and get in the flow I'm glad

264

Illinois until the last couple years so

268
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,190

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,930
goes for you then you do have some

273
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,070
questions let me get to the first

274
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,659
question it says just a couple of

275
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,030
questions what are your thoughts on LED

276
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:12,860
setups I can't recall you talking much

277
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:15,799
about them or was I too stoned and

278
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,960
missed it but I'm curious my thoughts on

279
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:20,629
LED setups honestly I don't have enough

280
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,269
personal experience growing under LEDs I

281
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:25,639
have grown under go Vitas I've grown

282
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:27,439
under T fives I have grown under high

283
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:31,100
pressure sodium zai have grown under

284
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,560
metal halides ah but I do not have any

285
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:37,310
personal experience with LED lighting I

286
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:40,669
have seen some amazing crops grown under

287
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:42,829
LED lights my friend Nancy Budd well is

288
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:44,120
a was I'm not sure if she still is I

289
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,070
don't want to speak out of line but

290
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,529
Nancy Budd well was a rep for lush

291
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,030
lighting for quite a while

292
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,789
and her lush lights were putting out

293
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:53,769
very beautiful crops she's growing some

294
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:55,599
Firefly right now under lush lights and

295
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:57,970
it looks very beautiful she took some

296
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,680
amazing pictures of Bounty Killer that

297
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,560
were grown under her lush lights and

298
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,379
they were gorgeous so I don't know

299
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,839
enough about any specific brands to love

300
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:09,700
or hate them what I do know is that if

301
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,500
you're getting a quality light that's

302
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,330
putting out the right lighting the right

303
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,820
colors the right spectrum and it's wired

304
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,860
properly and it's safe I have seen some

305
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,379
good [ __ ] happen I've also seen people

306
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,509
buy cheap shitty lights and it just

307
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:24,639
makes their plants look like [ __ ] so I

308
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:26,230
don't know what brands to recommend but

309
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,179
if you can do some research and

310
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,460
eliminate the crap brands you could

311
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:32,769
probably grow a decent crop with an LED

312
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,990
light is my opinion I don't have any

313
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,639
first-hand experience so this is not my

314
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,430
area of expertise but I've seen it done

315
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,809
and I've seen Nancy grow some great herb

316
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:42,849
I've seen a few other people grow a

317
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:45,159
great herb under LED lighting I just

318
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,830
haven't done it so if you're looking to

319
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,209
save money on electricity on cooling and

320
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,100
if you're just growing for yourself in

321
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,269
like a closet or a spare bedroom or

322
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,220
something and you're not trying to do a

323
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:55,929
big production crop to like pay the rent

324
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,430
or something if you're just a medical

325
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:59,169
patient trying to grow your own medicine

326
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:01,479
and LED should be perfect for you to

327
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:03,399
LEDs one for vegging one for flowering

328
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,350
you should be right where he need to be

329
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,299
so that's that's pretty much all I know

330
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,610
about LEDs is they're better for smaller

331
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,829
setups I saw some cool do a side-by-side

332
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,440
he ran his normal white his thousand

333
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,300
watt high pressure sodium and then he

334
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,860
put an LED in one section of the room

335
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:19,629
and he said that he had to feed the

336
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,610
plants differently they were underneath

337
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:23,889
the LED which I would believe because

338
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,000
they will photosynthesize differently

339
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:27,279
because they are getting completely

340
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,110
different spectrums of light so you may

341
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,610
have to change your feeding and he may

342
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,339
have to change your flowering times in

343
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,529
your veg times but it could be

344
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:37,089
beneficial and that's I wish I had more

345
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,199
info for you but I've never done it and

346
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,660
I don't want to talk out of my ass

347
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,250
any more than I just did so question

348
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:44,230
number two I came across the idea of

349
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,179
having a grow that works as a small

350
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,539
scale assembly line for lack of better

351
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:52,838
term the general idea is to have 12 to

352
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:55,179
16 plants total one for every week a

353
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,370
plant is alive so you want to have your

354
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:59,199
plants alive for 12 to 16 weeks total

355
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,799
which makes sense you got about a nine

356
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,410
week flower time

357
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,178
I've been probably four or five weeks of

358
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:07,278
veg onto that that's putting you have 14

359
00:12:05,178 --> 00:12:09,708
weeks and then two more weeks of as a

360
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,328
clone is 16 weeks so you can shave off

361
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:13,428
whatever you need to Mitch you're 12 but

362
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:15,799
that's a 16 week plant life which is

363
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:18,019
acceptable then you go on to say

364
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,238
planting one every week harvesting one

365
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:22,730
every week moving one two veg every week

366
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:25,278
etc other than not being able to

367
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,989
deep-clean do repairs between cycles are

368
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,149
there any problems with this way of

369
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:31,189
growing should I even try something like

370
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,568
this then you wrap it up by saying I

371
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:34,488
hope the second question is clear enough

372
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:36,919
I'm based in Durango so I hope I can

373
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:38,720
meet you and dab you out sometime I have

374
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:41,149
way more questions but I feel bad you

375
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,610
have to read my rambles this far so

376
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:45,409
until next time the rain grow during

377
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,089
grow great question dude there's a

378
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:49,009
question number two right here I love

379
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:51,649
this this is this is a great question

380
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:52,879
and this is clear you are very well

381
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:54,198
spoke and you wouldn't believe some of

382
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,308
the emails I get dude you wouldn't

383
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:57,258
believe some of the people I speak to

384
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:59,298
send me more [ __ ] I like the way you

385
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,860
write I can tolerate you I want more

386
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:04,338
send me more questions I want to hear

387
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,959
them now let me answer your question yes

388
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,970
this is a great [ __ ] idea this is

389
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:10,248
kind of I run a giant computer not a

390
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,928
giant I run a medium-sized commercial

391
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:14,360
grow and this is the idea we don't do

392
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:16,159
things every day we do things in about

393
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,869
three weeks cycles because we cut down a

394
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,480
lot of herb it takes us an entire week

395
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:22,759
to finish a harvest we have a whole trim

396
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,949
crew come on Friday they cut down every

397
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,480
plant in the room it's usually one room

398
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:28,368
is a hundred and twenty six plants the

399
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,889
bigger room is a hundred and sixty-eight

400
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:33,709
plants or somewhere around there so

401
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:36,139
between 125 and 170 ish plants is what

402
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,729
we cut down at a time they cut it all

403
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:40,009
down on one day it hangs upside down

404
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,319
they do that on Friday then they come

405
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:43,999
back Monday usually ish or they'll cut

406
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:45,649
down on Monday come back Friday depends

407
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:47,569
on their schedule we have an outside

408
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,828
trim crew that comes I shout out to the

409
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:51,828
trim crew if you're listening thanks for

410
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:53,479
helping us out ah they come and they

411
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:55,068
chop it down on Monday hangs upside down

412
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,528
then on Friday they come and buck all

413
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:59,778
the buds off of the sticks into buckets

414
00:13:57,528 --> 00:14:01,489
and then the next Monday they come and

415
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:04,009
start trimming it all up and it usually

416
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:05,360
it takes them until Friday to finish

417
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,850
sometimes on Friday they get off early

418
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,589
but usually on Friday it's a scramble to

419
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,389
get that last bit of blood trimmed up so

420
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,610
it's a 40-hour workweek trimming

421
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:16,039
trimming our weed so we only cut down

422
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,659
we have three flowering rooms so we cut

423
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,179
down about every three weeks is our

424
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:23,828
cycle so yes this is what you want you

425
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:26,809
want to always have things running odd

426
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:28,819
why I want to know why do you want to do

427
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:30,828
one plant constantly instead of having

428
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,209
the room come down all at once that's a

429
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,009
thought that I would put into this and I

430
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,569
know why because I'm a grower and I'm

431
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:37,909
experienced but I want you to think to

432
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,339
yourself why you want to do this instead

433
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:41,899
of taking down twelve or sixteen plants

434
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:45,140
at once and then having a pound of herb

435
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:47,240
as opposed to having an ounce every week

436
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,949
yeah and I get why because you want to

437
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,360
smoke an ounce a week and it's easier to

438
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,220
trim an ounce every week instead but

439
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,620
you're gonna have this is gonna create

440
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,200
constant work which is not a bad thing

441
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,810
but if you [ __ ] up then your rhythm is

442
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,670
[ __ ] up if you if one clone dies or if

443
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:03,528
one plant goes wrong or if you can't do

444
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,539
something right then you're really

445
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,039
screwed also this locks you into a cycle

446
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:09,528
it's where you can only grow one strain

447
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,899
that fits this program so this is a good

448
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:14,528
idea yes this is kind of the goal for

449
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:17,809
production two one in one out constantly

450
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:19,730
but the way I would recommend you say 16

451
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:23,259
plants here I would do four plants at a

452
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,970
time just to keep it that way you have

453
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:27,740
then you can put some weeks a week of

454
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,449
space four weeks of space or something

455
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,269
in there two weeks of space instead of

456
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:35,028
every Monday cut in a clone cut in a

457
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:36,350
plant down and it sounds awesome yes but

458
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:38,360
it's gonna get tedious and it's gonna

459
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,860
get overwhelming and when it gets

460
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,209
tedious and overwhelming that's when the

461
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,800
love comes out of it and it starts

462
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,119
becoming a production line and you want

463
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,469
to keep as much love into growing

464
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,019
cannabis as you can that's something

465
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,089
that we overlook we often see it on

466
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,740
baked goods and they printed on a lot of

467
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:53,420
packaging in the end the dispensaries

468
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,100
that this product was made with love and

469
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,229
the ingredients we have to remember to

470
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,610
put that into cannabis if you're smoking

471
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,039
cannabis recreationally if you're

472
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,659
smoking cannabis medically loved is a

473
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,129
required ingredient this is a plant this

474
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,049
is something that's growing from a seed

475
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,490
from Earth this has got some earth life

476
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,578
energy no matter what you believe in

477
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,198
this has got some connection to you

478
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:13,909
somehow and you got to put love into it

479
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:15,319
anything that you put love into grows

480
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:16,789
better anything you nourished properly

481
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,060
grows better and then I think it's

482
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:21,110
better to if you're smoking

483
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:23,929
recreationally you're medicating because

484
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:26,419
you feel better and it's even if it's

485
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:27,259
just to make your mind smile and make

486
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,019
your bits

487
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:31,639
that's a medical treatment too because

488
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:34,579
it's a relief in some way you you're

489
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,350
you're it's it's relief in my opinion so

490
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,090
it needs to be nourished as a medical

491
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,620
product or as a real product that we're

492
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,230
going to put into our bodies and it will

493
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,029
medicate us better so you need to treat

494
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,240
your plants with love and I think if you

495
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:49,610
have too much of a production the love

496
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,320
kind of falls out and I may be a [ __ ]

497
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,060
hippie for thinking that and that's cool

498
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,260
maybe you don't believe that there needs

499
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:55,879
to be loving your plants I'm not single

500
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:57,319
India I'm not saying I'm maybe other

501
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:01,159
people don't believe there needs to be

502
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,230
love maybe aa kind of a good friend who

503
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,990
I'll see him tomorrow afternoon he

504
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,450
doesn't love the plants he knows that

505
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,680
that's a production line this is a

506
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,720
product and he's going to grow this

507
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,580
product it's a commodity we will cut it

508
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,750
down we will sell it we will do more he

509
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,059
doesn't love the plants I love the

510
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,769
plants I feel like it's something you

511
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:21,169
should do sorry I get sad treks I love

512
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:23,210
the plants but yes so your your idea is

513
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,550
perfect but I would do instead of doing

514
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,620
16 plants and doing one every week I

515
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:30,799
would kind of break it down into four in

516
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,509
four out that way you can get three

517
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,559
weeks of not having to trim because if

518
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,480
you're gonna have to trim one plant

519
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,089
every week and then you're gonna have

520
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,079
one plant curing it's been in the jar

521
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:40,759
for a little bit you're gonna have to

522
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,309
birth that jar and I don't know how big

523
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,629
your plants are gonna be but it's gonna

524
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:47,240
be a lot of work it's gonna be a lot of

525
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,240
excess work if you chop the harvesting

526
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,299
things in larger batches is just easier

527
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,589
for burping and stuff like that but I'm

528
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:56,659
not trying to shoot down your idea if

529
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:59,539
you are dedicated and you think you want

530
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,430
to do that if you don't have another job

531
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:02,599
and if you don't have a busy life this

532
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,549
would be [ __ ] awesome for you this

533
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,369
would not work for me I am way too busy

534
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:09,319
to chop down a plant every week cut a

535
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:11,809
clone every week it just seems tedious

536
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:13,759
to me but that is the idea what you're

537
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:16,579
getting at is ultimately the idea there

538
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,950
are large grows in Colorado that work on

539
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:21,259
basically this plan they put but if they

540
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,700
do it every week every Monday plants go

541
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:24,650
in and plants come down every Monday

542
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,269
plants go in plants come down and that's

543
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,860
there's just crude you are right the

544
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:30,920
only downside to it is not being able to

545
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:32,599
deep clean and do repairs but there's

546
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,279
nothing stopping you from pulling every

547
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,509
plant out of that room or over to one

548
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,920
side of the room and cleaning the [ __ ]

549
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:38,059
out of where you can and move the plants

550
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,340
the other side of the room clean the

551
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:41,230
[ __ ] out of where you can

552
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:43,869
or you've got 12 hours during a

553
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,519
flowering cycle you should be able to do

554
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:48,128
just about any kind of repairs you need

555
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,230
to do during a 12 hour cycle that's my

556
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:52,298
opinion I don't know I don't know how

557
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,980
physically able you are or what kind of

558
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,028
work skills you've got but most stuff

559
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,950
that needs to be done in there cleaning

560
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:59,019
wise you can take down I have taken down

561
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,759
an entire room Mike and I have taken

562
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:02,859
down every bit of ducting every light

563
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,019
pulled out the flooring redid the

564
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:06,758
flooring in the room we actually painted

565
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,950
the whole room with kills redid all the

566
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,749
ducting we did it all in 12 hours those

567
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,519
plants didn't skip a day they didn't

568
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,079
miss a minute of their night cycle they

569
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,149
were all back on the right cycle so I

570
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,378
think it can be done just about however

571
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:19,298
big the room is you may need a friend

572
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:22,569
it's got a dedicate and if you're down

573
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:24,490
to do this [ __ ] 16 plants every 16

574
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:25,720
weeks idea you got to be down to clean

575
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,058
and do stuff like that it sounds like

576
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,440
you're a savage during grow whenever

577
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:31,509
you're up in the Pueblo area or if

578
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,190

580
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,308
lot of comedy shows and stuff like that

581
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:38,168
so if you're going to comedy shows if

582
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,700
you're going to the any of the the fish

583

my head is vibrating ooh yeah I just

598
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:14,299
took a big old gigantic dad of lemons

599
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:16,970
skunk dunked in lemon Geoffrey hi

600
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:20,089
terpene full spectrum extracts and it

601
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,799
tastes like I just ate an entire so if

602
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:23,869
you took the powdered sugar stuff off of

603
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,480
a lemon head just the lemon candy flavor

604
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:28,159
and just concentrated that into one bite

605
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,690
like the the whole the powder from one

606
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,519
bag it tastes like I just ate that much

607
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,680
of that flavor it's strong on my tongue

608
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,349
like it tastes as lemons and there's

609
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,420
like this real smooth flavor I really

610
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:40,250
enjoy that but yeah that is intense holy

611
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,730
crap there's talking to the friend it in

612
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,740
I have we all agree that lemon and

613
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,180
limonene stuff and lemon flavored Terps

614
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,890
are really good for your head injuries

615
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,630
so if you got a head injury you guys we

616
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,660
can all recommend the limonene and

617
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,860
lemony Terps that just makes my head

618
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,230
feel better I talked about that on a

619
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:58,099
recent episode but somebody else agreed

620
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,950
with me all right I'm gonna get my [ __ ]

621
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:02,779
together I was just talking about the

622
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,490
email from our friend to rein grow

623
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:05,899
thanks for the email if you guys want to

624
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,400

625
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,890
heart at hotmail.com I want to answer

626
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,450
your grow questions but I want to remind

627
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,630
you that I think it was episode number

628
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:17,150
73 was all about scheduling a perpetual

629
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:20,720
grow and it was basically what you were

630
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:23,150
talking about but it was using a 5x5

631
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,269
flowering space and another 5x5 space to

632
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:28,220
feed that to pull down one plant every

633
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:30,170
four weeks is what I think I was doing

634
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,610
unfortunately that episode is not in the

635
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,590
feed because like I rambled about

636
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:36,679
earlier iTunes and stitcher only hold of

637
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:39,169
100 episodes but I am very close to

638
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,759
getting back up on iTunes so bear with

639
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,800
me and within the next few weeks here

640
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,240
we'll get that up on iTunes and everyone

641
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,509
can listen to these scheduling a

642
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,640
perpetual grow episode alright I've got

643
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:51,890
another email here on my phone this one

644
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,650
I found very interesting a few episodes

645
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,240
ago I spoke of my head injury I don't

646
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,370
want to ramble on about it right now for

647
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,870
too long but about two and a half years

648
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:00,529
ago I suffered a traumatic brain injury

649
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:02,449
ie

650
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,609
I'm 6 foot 5 and I walked through a

651
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,680
doorway that apparently was 6 foot 2 and

652
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:08,659
it knocked me the [ __ ] out I don't

653
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,710
remember hitting I remember thinking I

654
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,880
need to go get a chair it's at the

655
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,490
bottom of those stairs

656
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,990
and then I remember uh kind of sound

657
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,759
like a cymbal crash maybe a little bit

658
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,109
of lightning maybe a tailgate of a truck

659
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,430
slamming and I remember being at the

660
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:22,369
bottom of the stairs and all my friends

661
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,690
saying my name and I was like what the

662
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:26,239
[ __ ] you keep saying my name it was like

663
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,070
why am I on the floor I [ __ ] myself up

664
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,700
I knocked myself clean the [ __ ] out I

665
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:33,079
was not right for a long time I spoke

666
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,370
about it on a recent podcast I don't

667
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:36,139
need to go too far into it right here

668
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:38,689
but I'm much better now much better I

669
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,950
feel like I'm Way better now I ramble a

670
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,970
lot now but I feel like I'm Way better

671
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,640
anyway

672
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:46,700
a listener wanted to email me and I

673
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,420
found this to be a very great email it

674
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,970
goes like this

675
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,640
rhasta Jeff I heard your podcast on TBI

676
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:56,029
and what happened to you much love bro I

677
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,420
suffer from chronic PTSD and my doctor

678
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:02,329
suggested I try THC it has changed my

679
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,550
life and my outlook on it your podcast

680
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:08,059
puts a positive note to the change we

681
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:12,339
all want to see so far so good right you

682
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:16,099
guys this guy suffers from chronic PTSD

683
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:18,230
I've got a little bit of PTSD from I had

684
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:19,399
a friend who discovered they had a

685
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,110
seizure disorder she wasn't my friend

686
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,880
she's my girlfriend I lived with her and

687
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:25,939
we discovered that she had a seizure

688
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,330
disorder and her seizures were [ __ ]

689
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,670
horrible and I wasn't prepared to live

690
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:33,710
with that at that time in my life and I

691
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,960
watched that person have some serious

692
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,980
medical problems and it [ __ ] me up I

693
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,009
don't think I've ever talked about that

694
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:43,730
on a podcast but I've got some PTSD from

695
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:45,980
watching a girlfriend from my past have

696
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,380
grand mal seizures and nearly died

697
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,470
multiple times so I've got some PTSD and

698
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,510
I believe that the THC kind of it

699
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,460
doesn't allow those shitty thoughts to

700
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:56,690
come up when they do you could be and I

701
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,240
know that's a shitty way to cover your

702
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,130
problems but it does kind of the PTSD

703
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,720
triggers weird [ __ ] and it makes other

704
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,910
emotions start going and it gives you

705
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,559
more things and it stops at that so I

706
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,750
agree that it does work it does change

707
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,539
your life I'm glad that it changed your

708
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,519
outlook on it and dude I am glad that my

709
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:15,139
podcast puts a positive note because

710
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,670
that's what that's what I try to do I

711
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,470
try to be a good ambassador for this

712
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,330
point so that means a lot to me here's

713
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,880
the part of the email that everybody is

714
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:24,529
gonna go Wow because I really did this

715
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,690
listener says I am

716
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:29,480
former law enforcement officer and never

717
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,400
thought I would be using THC so sad to

718
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,980
know how ignorant I was for all those

719
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,200
years thank God I found cannabis and

720
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,450
added it to my daily life

721
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,009
dude I am very grateful that you have

722
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,230
found cannabis and added it to your

723
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:44,509
daily life it's helping with your PTSD I

724
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,039
had helped me with my head injury it

725
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:47,779
helped a couple of guys I was talking to

726
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:49,220
today with their head injuries it is

727
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,660
helping a lot of people take care of

728
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,779
their heads and manage their head

729
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:57,050
problems so I'm glad you found it what I

730
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:59,359
want to know is are you sharing any

731
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:01,519
information with your fellow law

732
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,889
enforcement friends I it says that you

733
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,930
are a former law enforcement officer so

734
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:08,480
if you've got people that are still in

735
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:11,240
law enforcement still active are you

736
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,730
doing anything to kind of educate them a

737
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,370
little bit are you doing it are you

738
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,960
sharing is your cannabis use your THC

739
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:20,809
use is this public knowledge with

740
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,309
anybody as your family knows your do

741
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:24,919

742
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,869
know I kind of want to know and if this

743
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,250
is too much I won't share on the podcast

744
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:30,259
or anything send me an email and let me

745
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,150
know how are you using the THC to

746
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:34,190
control your PTSD is one thing I'd like

747
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,009
to know not control but help and then

748
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:40,660
how public and/or private are you about

749
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:44,150
your cannabis use and would you maybe

750
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,860
share my podcast with some of your law

751
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,440
enforcement colleagues so that we could

752
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:50,569
show them that we aren't all just pot

753
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,250
heads trying to smoke to get high to

754
00:25:50,569 --> 00:25:54,980
giggle and watch teach and cheong that a

755
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,750
lot of us have medical conditions that

756
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,329
without cannabis we wouldn't be able to

757
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:02,599
function and have a daily life and I

758
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:04,730
don't say that lightly I am a caregiver

759
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,039
I provide medical cannabis for a couple

760
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,990
of people that I don't know if one guy

761
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,450
would still be here if he didn't smoke I

762
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,890
don't know how I would be able to handle

763
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,569
my brain injury if I didn't have

764
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,730
cannabis available to me I don't know

765
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:18,970
how your PTSD would treat your life if

766
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,990
you didn't find THC things may be

767
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,360
drastically different if we didn't have

768
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:26,000
a little THC in our lives so maybe you

769
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,159
could share my show with your law

770
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,240
enforcement friends or I don't know if

771
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,560
you want to do that because you don't

772
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,910
want to out yourself but you've already

773
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,039
you were no longer a law enforcement

774
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,930
officer so I mean you know they're gonna

775
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,369
fire you I'm just trying to do it maybe

776
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,808
you can share this for us and spread the

777
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:39,579
word

778
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:40,898
and you're on our team now so so help us

779
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:44,048
out if you can I appreciate it

780
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:46,449
it's always great to hear people change

781
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:49,298
and come to the green side from the dark

782
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:52,028
side I just made that up anyway I hope

783
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:55,108
THC keeps your PTSD under control and I

784
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:56,858

grows cost millions of dollars but for

810
00:27:44,138 --> 00:27:48,338
some reason there's always a little

811
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:49,899
[ __ ] it doesn't seem to matter how

812
00:27:48,338 --> 00:27:52,739
much money you spend how much you

813
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:54,548
prepare something goes wrong randomly

814
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:55,749
overnight when you're gone it always

815
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,190
happens when you're gone if you watch

816
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:58,569
the cameras it always happens right when

817
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,369
you leave you lock the door and then

818
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:01,569
click something goes [ __ ] wrong and

819
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:03,249
you don't notice it until you get there

820
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:04,838
twelve hours later you walk in at 7:00

821
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:06,329
or 8:00 in the morning and there's 50

822
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:09,190
gallons of water in the floor or

823
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:10,598
something weird happened that you never

824
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,979
would have foreseen you never could have

825
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:14,408
predicted but now you've got to deal

826
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:15,639
with it so always keep in mind that

827
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:17,019
there's gonna be [ __ ] popping up

828
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:19,088
tomorrow that you're not prepared to

829
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:20,618
deal with so clean up do whatever you

830
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:22,450
can today if you're gonna do foliate

831
00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:24,368
defoliates a day if you could trellis

832
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,169
trellis today don't wait until tomorrow

833
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:28,329
because tomorrow is going to have its

834
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:30,249
own [ __ ] up surprises knock [ __ ] out

835
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:32,408
get it out of the way do what you need

836
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:34,538
to do early and then you can just kick

837
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,739
back and relax if you let [ __ ] wait

838
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:36,908
until tomorrow that means you're

839
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:38,469
probably gonna let something else wait

840
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:39,969
until tomorrow which means you got

841
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:41,889
tomorrow's work plus that [ __ ] you

842
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:43,538
waited for and then you're not gonna get

843
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:45,398
it all done so now that shit's gonna

844
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:46,898
fall onto Wednesday and now Wednesday is

845
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:49,449
gonna [ __ ] suck because you've got

846
00:28:46,898 --> 00:28:51,619
Monday's work fell onto Tuesday

847
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,299
Tuesday's work fell into Wednesday

848
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:54,500
you're doubled up on Wednesday now I'm

849
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,480
simply getting off at 5:00 we're not

850
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,730
gonna get off till 6:00 and then [ __ ]

851
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,400
Thursday already sucks so just do the

852
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:03,170
[ __ ] you can do get it done have it done

853
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,400
and then when Friday and Saturday come

854
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:07,100
it's kicking it time you don't have to

855
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,390
worry so much that's my advice if you

856
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:10,149
can get it done today get in there and

857
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:13,880
get it done today because tomorrow

858
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:15,470
tomorrow you never know I'm the manager

859
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,150
the facility manager that grow the

860
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,339
cultivation manager the cult leader at

861
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,140
my grow and if a contractor shows up I

862
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:24,289
have to follow them around and talk to

863
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,730
them if the meed shows up I'm the one

864
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:27,980
that has to follow them around and talk

865
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,110
to them when the consultants come when

866
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,660
the investors come when the owners come

867
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:34,669
that's right I follow them around and

868
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,980
talk to them so if I've got some work

869
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:39,529
planned for tomorrow and I stacked up

870
