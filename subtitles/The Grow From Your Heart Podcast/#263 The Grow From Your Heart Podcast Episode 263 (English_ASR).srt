invited me here to do this podcast

113
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,539
deceive you guys probably remember if

114
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:10,449
you listened to the show he is the

115
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,780
founder president chair dude main

116
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:15,449
veteran of the veteran farmers Alliance

117
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,619
my listeners that haven't been following

118
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:25,479
you give us a little description of what

119
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:28,689
the VFA does give him $100 in cash and

120
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:32,730
prizes we feed them we give medicated

121
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:35,050
cookies medicated barbecue ribs chicken

122
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,660
we're eventually gonna move to live

123
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,689
music but we give away genetics soil

124
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,730
nutrients just grow gear everything so

125
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:44,709
you basically hold big parties at

126
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,840
cannabis friendly venues and invite

127
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:53,409
veterans that are in need get them out

128
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:56,469
of their house to do right and in the

129
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,300
way it works is I get companies and

130
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,870
other organizations involved in they

131
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:06,340
make a donation to where it's it's what

132
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:08,379
they provide as a product to the

133
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:10,689
industry right and so they give it away

134
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:12,250
and basically you know we're gonna

135
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:14,168
probably have around forty thousand

136
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,408
dollars in genetics to give away

137
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:19,060
I mean it's serious that's amazing do

138
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:21,209
you want to list off some of the people

139
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,098

143
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,379

144
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:34,419
proactive for his fellows I'm sure we've

145

about it please respect the veterans not

308
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,629
agree with war but these are

you got to respect them either way and

310
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:43,730
believe it sounds exactly like it from

311
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,110
distance last year was the first year I

312
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:50,899
ever went to the fourth of July in eight

313
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:52,490
years it was like like man okay I can do

314
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,079
this and I just remind me a lot I was

315
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,570
like all right yeah that sounds like it

316
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:01,129
but I know it's not real I'm just my

317
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,530
wife okay okay I'm good I'm like I think

318
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:05,090
I'll be alright and that was kind of

319
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:06,439
last year about this time is when I

320
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:20,230
first started taking the steps to

321
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:20,230
recovery new or new freshly out of your

322
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,129
trauma right it's the word for it but

323
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:26,719
you know I just got tired of it I got

324
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:28,340
tired of being in my head all the time I

325
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,930
got tired of isolating I got tired of

326
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,170
being this [ __ ] [ __ ] all the time

327
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,639
and it just got to the point where so

328
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:37,129

351
00:16:51,159 --> 00:18:00,339
first in Denver and there's a bunch of

352
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:24,219
people I just walk in after work and

353
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:25,689
just drop on the maybe keeping your own

354
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,409
head straight sometimes there's plenty

355
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,750
of work for you

356
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:37,570

359
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,319
[Music]

360
00:18:47,589 --> 00:19:05,689
like put you back into the mindset it's

361
00:18:50,150 --> 00:19:09,890
like I play with video games I had to

362
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,179
give them up completely popular I would

363
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:23,320
show up at work and my friends would be

364
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:25,909
like did you have to check this problem

365
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:28,129
the next time I move I got rid of all my

366
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:50,960
gaming consoles and I try really hard

367
00:19:28,130 --> 00:20:07,280
not to put games in my new computer have

368
00:19:50,960 --> 00:20:09,259
a bunch of likes I used to take all my

369
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:23,418
time and dedicate and Instagram it was

370
00:20:09,259 --> 00:21:21,380
just it's it's like a one way over there

371
00:20:23,419 --> 00:21:22,880
and really sure we jumped off the deep

372
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:30,500
end on this one but we got on a pothead

373
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:39,620
rant know what to expect when they

374
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:41,480
listen to this show hang out and

375
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:44,119
medicate and get away we jumped off on

376
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,130
fireworks we got a place for the

377
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:47,808
veterans to go get away from everything

378
00:21:46,130 --> 00:22:04,760
and medicate properly and hang out with

379
00:21:47,808 --> 00:22:06,769
other veterans and be cool what we're

380
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:11,869
doing now we have the funds to really

381
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:13,519
start looking I think that's okay that

382
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:22,879
makes good sense I admire what you're

383
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:26,119
trying to do that's awesome all right so

384
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,880
basically City Council limits car

385
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:30,589
Springs now and all of El Paso County on

386
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,510
a twelve plan count limit no matter what

387
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:35,269
so even if you have a medical marijuana

388
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:38,839
card from the doctor

389
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:41,119
is that up hold a bull in court oh well

390
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:50,629
if you go to if you go up to like Denver

391
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:51,859
quarter that's to the first cats cat and

392
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,110
dogs on this show

393
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,939
you lose in El Paso County you lose and

394
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:57,500
you lose in the Colorado Springs if you

395
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,880
get busting collar Springs you lose in

396
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,660
Colorado Springs you lose in El Paso

397
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:18,860
County until you gotta go up to Denver

398
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:20,540
you go through when I heard them start

399
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:32,769
doing raids I just pretty much cut

400
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:32,769
everything down I'm like okay you know

401
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:49,879
it wouldn't be a surprise to smoke maybe

402
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:54,558
maybe maybe two and a half grams a day

403
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:56,030
just to not run out so my buddy called

404
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,980
me because he knew I was frustrated

405
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:59,839
things like man you gotta call this

406
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,759
other guy he's like he will tell you how

407
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:05,470
to do it and get into the industry where

408
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:08,210
you can be legit a hundred percent and

409
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:10,460
you can operate to where you can still

410
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,440
help veterans you can help them in a way

411
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,470
where you couldn't do it before which

412
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,679
was I can recuperate the cost through my

413
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:24,798
labor right so I can do that and then

414
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:32,269
also now I can re what's what's the word

415
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:34,970
I would say I can like so basically I

416
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:38,480
can resupply the VFA with free cannabis

417
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:41,298
okay nations from the CVC right so now

418
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,740
we're all in-house this is going okay so

419
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:44,808
now we're keeping everything in-house

420
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,370
it's all quality controlled we know

421
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:49,339
exactly who grew it where it's coming

422
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:54,099
from is the the CVC going to be

423
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:57,279
regulated by the Colorado meed no okay

424
00:24:54,099 --> 00:25:00,230
so what we're looking for is basically

425
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,898
it's a place where

426
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,419
we basically have a warehouse for your

427
00:25:02,898 --> 00:25:07,759
six plants because a lot of people you

428
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:09,889
know cannot grow their plants whether

429
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:16,339
they can and just can't in their living

430
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:18,319
space or to do so so are the time we are

431
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:21,109
gonna provide a place for their six

432
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,629
plants and we'll take care of it for

433
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:26,148
them and it's just like babysitting them

434
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:30,799
and having them place to grow and then

435
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:32,658
we will return their product to them and

436
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,418
all they have to do is reimburse us for

437
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:38,240
you know our time and our costs and

438
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:39,860
through that we'll be able to help a lot

439
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,269
of people that would normally have to go

440
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:46,490
to another recreation to get a red card

441
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:53,288
after that we operate according to a

442
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:56,778
minute 6464 says is what we're doing and

443
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:59,119
for that we're we're not scheduled in

444
00:25:56,778 --> 00:26:03,019
amendment 64 what it says specifically

445
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:05,388
is it lists out you know personal uses

446
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:08,419
of marijuana you can grow you can store

447
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:12,259
you can consume all of these things and

448
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:17,330
in the last section in that part of the

449
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:21,980
amendment it says that anyone can assist

450
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:23,689
you with any category so therefore you

451
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,339
can have somebody babysitting your

452
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:30,230
plants for you because they are allowed

453
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:37,250
to assist you in growing right and we do

454
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:38,960
so why not do this and this is a way for

455
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,009
us to be able to provide a service that

456
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,460
normally wouldn't be able to be provided

457
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:45,408
right and now you know with this service

458
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,389
being the way it's gonna be set up is

459
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:49,100
now we can take in people like we're

460
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:50,629
gonna take in five interns starting

461
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:53,269
beginning of the year for an entire year

462
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,860
we're gonna train five veterans up to

463
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:57,230
get into the industry to learn how the

464
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:59,538
process works through the meed by their

465
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,190
licenses to get into the meed get all

466
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:03,710
that paperwork done so when they're done

467
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:07,100
after that year we bring in master

468
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:09,169
growers like you or your boss or other

469
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:11,028
bosses from different dispensaries and

470
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:13,190
they get to see stats and paperwork on

471
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:13,940
these guys how consistent they were what

472
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,830
their testing

473
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:19,220
what the tests were on their on their

474
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:20,928
cannabis was and and basically you get

475
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,839
to cherry-pick and you get to figure out

476
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:25,100
who's gonna be your new grower and you

477
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,189
hire them on the spot

478
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:30,349
so you're making kind of a master grower

479
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:34,580
farm league right that's awesome

480
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:36,408
yeah like these guys I mean a lot of

481
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:38,839
these guys need a job or something to do

482
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:40,669
and we can train them as best we can and

483
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:44,628
get them into these positions to keep

484
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:46,850
them busy and in that way we're helping

485
00:27:44,628 --> 00:27:49,339
the community even more and they'll get

486
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:51,548
to grow the plots for the veterans that

487
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:54,199
are giving you their plant counts right

488
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:56,538
and you guys are gonna train them right

489
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,058
you guys grow skills well thank you

490
00:27:56,538 --> 00:28:00,558
literally just tether them to us we're

491
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:04,190
gonna just take them down the line this

492
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:06,918
is what we do this is why we do it and

493
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:09,288
it's not oh this is just it's in the

494
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,970
book and this is why no this is why we

495
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:12,769
do it from personal experience here's

496
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,058
the book for reference you know like

497
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:14,750
teeming with microbes teeming with

498
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:16,579
nutrients

499
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,819
those are good books for these guys to

500
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:22,730
read not the the grow Bible when you got

501
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:24,558
a one that has like 600 pages I mean if

502
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,778
you're gonna do it like that I mean

503
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,178
that's great but I'd rather read

504
00:28:26,778 --> 00:28:31,159
something that's 200 pages and where you

505
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:32,629
got to look up [ __ ] and it's like oh wow

506
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:33,919
that's really amazing like you're

507
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,928
actually learning it's retroactive

508
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,519
instead of comprehensive instead of an

509
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:46,429
encyclopedia this is why it's green

510
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:48,019
because it works growing knowledge is

511
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:51,288
just your experience so we're giving

512
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:53,990
these guys experience and knowledge for

513
00:28:51,288 --> 00:28:55,819
free and eventually a job hopefully out

514
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,200
of it that's pretty red right so maybe

515
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:59,269
one day across Colorado

516
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,370
there'll be veterans running these grows

517
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:05,538
or across the nation that's the whole

518
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:07,278
point once we go federal or really we're

519
00:29:05,538 --> 00:29:09,079
really just gonna blow up with it

520
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,179
because now we're gonna be the only

521
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,638
training facility in the United States

522
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:15,440
that can train people and then send them

523
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:17,418
out anywhere in the United States after

524
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,629
one year the dogs make the buds smell

525
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:19,629
great

526
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:31,778
I mean that don't do that they can just

527
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:34,000
they can just take control of the

528
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:36,700
industry because they're some of the

529
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,808
most disciplined hard-working I've been

530
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,669
through three people in the girl

531
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:41,349
facility so far that I have have not

532
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:48,640
made the cut I think some veterans might

533
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:52,750
be the next work they need a prize he's

534
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:59,950
loyal he just he wants he wants to to be

535
00:29:52,750 --> 00:30:01,898
a part of something team that knows how

536
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,278
to build a good commercial size grow to

537
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:06,250
keep everything that you're trying to do

538
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:25,659
sustainable I would say between Joe and

539
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:37,298
I we have it covered his wife we need a

540
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:48,250
building to come out surveil in the

541
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:51,548
concrete this whole last year I've been

542
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:53,528
focusing on Grover design and you know

543
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:57,369
maximizing yields through that so I

544
00:30:53,528 --> 00:31:00,548
think that after a year focusing on that

545
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:03,398
we can create create the grow that we

546
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:05,109
need to be able to provide medicine for

547
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:08,139
these guys at the cheapest cost possible

548
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:10,959
it's good to see the owners and founders

549
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,038
and CEOs of agro be the people that are

550
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,769
gonna be in there get in there hands

551
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:17,648
dirty because too often in regulated

552
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:19,240
industry there are guys that own big

553
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:20,558
businesses that just want to make more

554
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,019
money and they buy into the cannabis

555
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:27,700
industry and then the growers are forced

556
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:29,589
to just have to face conditions and do

557
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,169
things that would have to compromise

558
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:33,548
their integrity and a grow often right

559
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:35,020
because the owner doesn't want to spend

560
00:31:33,548 --> 00:31:36,638
the extra money to do it the way it

561
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:38,289
should be so it's good to see and I'm

562
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:41,939
not calling anybody out my my

563
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:41,940
I read a shopping list when it shows up

564
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:46,599
[Music]

565
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:47,919
down a shopping list and take a picture

566
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:49,599
of it and send it to him and then the

567
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:57,460
next day when he comes in all that [ __ ]

568
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:58,599
you need to love that you go to the

569
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,980
store for my brother that helps me out

570
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,849
get those co2 tanks filled they're

571
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,420
sitting in their room waiting for you

572
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:08,129
but facilities have a lead guy that is

573
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,130
just throwing dollars it's somebody that

574
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:16,270
we agreed I was employed by one facility

575
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:20,049
where all of the upper management were

576
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:27,609
snobs about hating potheads because I

577
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:29,319
was my lunch break I go and spend half

578
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:31,689
my paycheck and then I go home and enjoy

579
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:33,250
it and come back and yeah you shouldn't

580
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,680
be mad at us pause we're making a rich

581
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,739
bro we got that new Hummer

582
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,739
[Music]

583
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:45,069
you know you know necessities taking

584
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:48,370
care of and stuff but nobody's gonna get

585
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:50,109
rich out of this you know like the only

586
00:32:48,369 --> 00:33:10,539
way looks like they really want to be

587
00:32:50,109 --> 00:33:12,269
blinging rich almost any conditions yeah

588
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:15,210
you're good I got most of that okay

589
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:19,329
notice reliable and that's really it I

590
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:21,880
like it grow cannabis for veterans yeah

591
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:23,819
alright so how long until this will

592
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,320
realistically be going the collective

593
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:29,019
we're thinking that you can get the guy

594
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,460
to move the damn building right and if

595
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:35,680
that happens we're thinking we'll have

596
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:38,170
our facility built September early mid

597
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,750
September mid late September September

598
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:45,950
whatever plans first October in there

599
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:48,829
October's drop dead right now we're

600
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:51,400
waiting on a lawyer visit and buying our

601
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:53,569
business license for you know our

602
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:57,410
warehouse facility that we're creating

603
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:59,000
and after that we wait what was it six

604
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,009
to eight weeks for that license and then

605
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,809
we can start signing people up once we

606
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:04,640

like to know where the resources came

628

from and where things went and who heard

629
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:14,690

630
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,550
back and then they'll know where the

631
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:20,240

treat you like a VIP I'll take care you

633
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:32,029
no matter what absolutely was always

634
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:35,409
super kind of read that you saved the

635
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,410
day by fixing this D card so we're

636
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:07,480
so so basically to keep our costs low to

637
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,098
keep our costs low I'm gonna pass this

638
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,389
over to John because he's gonna read off

639
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:14,230
some of the main sponsors that are

640
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:18,608
helped us for the CBC these are for the

641
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:21,670
CBC to get you guys started okay from

642
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:24,250
these guys our first sponsor and the one

643
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:27,369
that makes this incredibly possible for

644
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:30,130
us to do and cheap for the veterans is

645
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:32,980
nectar for the gods steve has been

646
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:36,550
growing with nectar for the gods for few

647
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:41,409
years yeah like two years now and he's

648
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:44,080
gotten to know the owner really well yes

649
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:46,329
and he's been sponsored for a while by

650
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,299
them so we went to him with this idea

651
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:51,130
that we had and Steve emailed him or

652
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,680
Facebook to him and asked if he would

653
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:56,440
continue the sponsorship and he agreed

654
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,838
with it and so we were getting our

655
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,960
nutrients and soil for free which helps

656
00:36:58,838 --> 00:37:04,210
us keep the cost down for the veterans

657
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,679
the reimbursement fees plan to be at a

658
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,960
hundred dollars at first and remember

659
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:10,239
this is recreational at a hundred

660
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,608
dollars first and every sponsorship we

661
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:16,629
get we can take that chunk out our goal

662
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:18,639
is $50 reimbursement because our cost

663
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:21,220
drops so do the prices because that's

664
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:36,279
what we're doing I know we're not again

665
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:38,649
open I hear fireworks oh I've had some

666
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,089
interesting neighbors all right and

667
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,880
let's see what else we got some seed

668
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:45,179
sponsors we got gonzo seeds

669
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,650
giving us this genetics we need

670
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:51,309
obviously we've been on talk radio on

671
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:53,170
Monday they enjoyed our time up there

672
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:55,599
and we will probably be going back those

673
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,539
guys are really awesome they're going to

674
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,619
have our commercials run on their radio

675
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:03,070
show cool

676
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:05,049
we got pollination Steve knows Ryan

677
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,880
really well and there they have some

678
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,860
killer strains and so they're gonna be

679
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,940
sending us some of their genetics to

680
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:15,519
work with CB one analytics Steve got in

681
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,700
contact with those guys and they Tuesday

682
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,469
and they're gonna be running all of our

683
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:22,269
all of our testing for us for free as

684
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:24,189
well so we can know exactly what we're

685
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:25,539
giving these guys very cool you guys

686
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:31,720
will have some Irish genetics in that

687
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:33,039
garden also for school guaranteed I've

688
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:41,949
got some high yielding stuff that you

689
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:44,019
guys will appreciate oh yeah we just

690
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:47,319
those we're able to keep the cost down

691
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:49,389
as best we can everything else we can

692
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,480
add on there we'll just be cutting off

693
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:54,129
and making it cheaper for these guys yep

694
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,719
every time we can chop at that price to

695
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,579
bring it down it's just a better vintage

696
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:59,079
for these guys so if I were a veteran

697
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:01,000
and I sign my plants over to you and

698
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,289
then I wait probably 60 or 90 days so

699
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,840
that you could pull my plants down and

700
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:07,329
get a harvest out of them for a hundred

701
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,100
dollars to start what realistically what

702
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:13,239
ammount of Medicine can I expect from

703
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:17,199
you on the size of the plants we grow

704
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:29,139
but I'm thinking three gallons three to

705
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:30,879
five gallon plants okay okay we'll keep

706
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:32,619
it on a pretty nice rotation for

707
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,140
everyone everything will be numbered by

708
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:38,019
patient and everything like that so

709
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:40,839
we'll be able to keep it constant and of

710
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:43,329
course you know the better we grow the

711
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,329
more we'll come out of each plant and so

712
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:47,590
eventually they'll be getting

713
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:50,679
potentially more that then they can

714
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:53,610
actually consume and at that point there

715
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,500
they can waive their cost

716
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,120
give their product back to us and that's

717
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:03,360
where we're gonna be able to start

718
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:05,279
giving away free product through that's

719
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,610
working really well for you there's no

720
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,680
loose ends where money or anything just

721
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:14,039
sits around we're always just trying to

722
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:16,109
give back as good as fast as we can well

723
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,460
it's like city council when they did the

724
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:22,740
whole 12 point count it really just

725
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:24,539
broke mo you know there's such a

726
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:26,129
ridiculous way to do it because nobody

727
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:27,929
at that meeting oh we've been over this

728
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,590
nobody at that meeting wanted that to go

729
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:33,389
through no not one person there's four

730
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:37,050
people that wanted to go through plus

731
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:39,809
the City Council members and that was

732
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:44,789
about 150 to 200 that were opposed to

733
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:47,009
that I watched that on the internet and

734
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:50,309
you couldn't even feel the vibe of the

735
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:57,240
room coming from the computer screen as

736
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:58,590
well yes four hours of testimony it was

737
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:09,239
13 minutes

738
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:12,269
that's not injuries part yeah right so

739
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:15,119
apparently somebody's gathered enough

740
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:17,070
signatures to possibly add this to the

741
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,489
ballot for this year and it's to limit

742
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:22,080
the percentage of THC in every single

743
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:27,000
product whether it's medical or

744
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:29,429
recreational at 16% 16 percent THC and

745
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,349
anything everything so the font rates

746
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:36,149
flower I'm flabbergasted how I would

747
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:36,779
have to get rid of every flower in my

748
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:40,160
garden

749
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:43,230
or five

750
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,230
[Music]

751
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:58,858
does that mean this slab of shatter

752
00:41:47,989 --> 00:42:00,269
could only test it okay

753
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:04,438
pretty sure you're correct with the

754
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:06,328
flower I mean if it's from what I heard

755
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,438
last night it was everything and if

756
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:11,999
that's the point whether it's

757
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:14,368
recreational or medical it's gonna

758
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:28,139
destroy dispensaries it's gonna destroy

759
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:29,849
everyone that's just such a waste I'm

760
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:31,588
not a quitter but if you told me that I

761
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:34,829
couldn't grow cannabis over 16 percent

762
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:36,748
THC anymore I might quit I'd move yeah

763
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:38,039
yeah I just have to move the operation

764
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:40,139
somewhere else there's no way to really

765
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,900
I mean terpenes are great but the only

766
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:45,449
tip I mean in in in th he's great but

767
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:51,298
there's the combination of both Dave in

768
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:53,338
high forms that are perfect either one

769
00:42:51,298 --> 00:43:04,369
and it's just gonna be you know

770
00:42:53,338 --> 00:43:06,838
synthesized THC or it's gonna be wow

771
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:12,088
somebody trying to control the industry

772
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:14,369
I think I think they make so much money

773
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:16,558
in the black market like busting people

774
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:18,568
in the black market that they're trying

775
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,640
to revert it back a little bit so they

776
00:43:18,568 --> 00:43:22,708
can just keep going after and just keep

777
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,808
yelling that each nail into the coffin

778
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:26,568
just to make it worse to make us

779
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:29,400
criminals again I'm kind of like

780
00:43:26,568 --> 00:43:30,929
flabbergasted me you gave us this and

781
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:40,559
now you want to take it away and they

782
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:43,349
like it's like here take this just

783
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:46,109
kidding sex one I just made it illegal

784
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:49,588
in a different twist you can't grow at

785
00:43:46,108 --> 00:43:51,478
home because you are just gonna cause

786
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:53,188
problems and now you can't buy good weed

787
00:43:51,478 --> 00:43:54,969
at dispensaries so go home and grow your

788
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:58,750
good weed oh you can't do that yeah

789
00:43:54,969 --> 00:44:01,119
no no yeah dream can pop all your pills

790
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:04,389
and I just hate to go back to all that

791
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,299
but it's like come on man right how many

792
00:44:04,389 --> 00:44:08,739
people do you see when you're out in

793
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,390
Colorado Springs how many people do you

794
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:11,769
see that are just too high for their own

795
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:15,369
good on cannabis that are causing a

796
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:17,710
problem none a lot of meth heads that's

797
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:19,659
I wasn't trying to go there but how many

798
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,010
people do you see on a bicycle as soon

799
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:25,199
as the Sun Goes Down with a [ __ ]

800
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:27,400
headlamp on they're in every trash

801
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:29,909
everywhere you got a Dodge them on your

802
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,910
car right now

803
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:44,829
the ones that are the problem are less

804
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:57,579
than 1% but they're going after them and

805
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:59,559
then punishing the rest we want to be

806
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:02,769
able to support our community able to

807
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:06,400
show people that this isn't the black

808
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:09,190
market this is we just need to get rid

809
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,530
of just all these regulations just

810
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:14,289
trying to tie us down I mean yeah

811
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:15,970
there's there is too many plants in the

812
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:17,920
house I mean if it's too powerful for

813
00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:19,269
the grid it'll burn the grid up I get

814
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,420
that you'll get a house fire

815
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:25,030
so whatever on that but there's people

816
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:29,349
that need 40 50 60 plants and that's

817
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:30,700
perfectly acceptable in a home there's

818
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:33,159
no reason you can't I mean especially

819
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:35,619
with kids that like parents that there's

820
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:38,679
one Li that has 19 different strings for

821
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:40,719
her child and it works and she can't she

822
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:44,230
loses those strains it's like she's

823
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,909
screwed and that's the kid that kid

824
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:48,190
needs that and I mean it's it's pretty

825
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:50,259
powerful to be able to provide something

826
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,720
like that for a child in your own home

827
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,190
and then somebody tries to say no it's

828
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,079
like [ __ ] you

829
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:59,440
you can't do that go to the store right

830
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,569
yeah yeah it doesn't work the same as

831
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,210
missing [ __ ] this mass-produced it's

832
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,750
like

833
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:07,510
[Music]

834
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:09,489
yeah for the prices I don't exactly know

835
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:10,870
what a gram cost to produce at home I've

836
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:12,909
done math and it's come out somewhere

837
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:14,679
between 50 cents and two bucks a gram I

838
00:46:12,909 --> 00:46:16,239
think to produce cannabis at home just

839
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:17,769
depends what kind of nutrients and what

840
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,959
your electrical happens to be where you

841
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:21,909
are yeah I've heard as low as 30 cents a

842
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,940
gram what dispensary can you find

843
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:26,769
anything for 30 cents I'm probably

844
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,720
cheaper and then in my house 10 or 12

845
00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:32,199
dollars a gram at a dispensary minimum

846
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:34,299
plus taxes plus getting there right plus

847
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:35,919
we'll look at recreational tax too and

848
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:43,320
who knows what was sprayed on it who

849
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:45,579
knows what kind of nutrients it was so

850
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,950
all of the recreational products are

851
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:49,360
currently tested July 1st was supposed

852
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:50,529
to be the day I was gonna do another

853
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,769
show about this bull just talk about it

854
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,300
now

855
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:53,860
July 1st was supposed to be the date

856
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,300
when all of the medical products were

857
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,890
tested but they've pushed it back to

858
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,600
later in the year it's gonna be closer

859
00:46:56,889 --> 00:47:11,710
to September or October before they're

860
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:13,989
able to test every cuz nobody can test

861
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:15,670
the products it's like why are we

862
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:18,549
focusing on that where are we going

863
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:20,139
after less than 1% and punishing

864
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:21,850
everybody else we could be going about

865
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:24,219
the regulation just setting the standard

866
00:47:21,849 --> 00:47:28,509
and making a good presentation for the

867
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:31,000
rest of the you know if we had eight or

868
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,530
twelve good solid standardized testing

869
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,570
facilities that were bringing in an

870
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:36,460
excise tax every time that product got

871
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,530
tested do you think they would replace

872
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:46,449
the revenues that they're making off of

873
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:48,430
busting petty weed crimes we just need

874
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:50,529
some sort of operation people will see

875
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:51,250
it they will start to accept it it just

876
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:54,010
takes time

877
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:56,079
you know there's like my wife three and

878
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:58,600
a half four years ago she was like no no

879
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,969
we hid in my house I think I'm like wow

880
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,489
yeah and now it's she's like well this

881
00:48:00,969 --> 00:48:09,789
you know it works she believes him she

882
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:10,419
hates the smell she's actually allergic

883
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:12,730
to it

884
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,230
she tries really hard to like it

885
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:17,860
does a good job she does she's a good

886
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:29,590
supporter she says well it's just saved

887
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:32,349
me yeah probably saved our money go

888
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:34,120
shopping again and get food on the table

889
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:36,549
again once I started growing for myself

890
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,259
it was like wow I wasn't spending twenty

891
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:42,190
seven hundred three thousand dollars a

892
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:44,290
month dispensary how many prescriptions

893
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:56,740
were you able to eliminate using

894
00:48:44,289 --> 00:49:00,250
cannabis 24 different prescriptions with

895
00:48:56,739 --> 00:49:01,989
cannabis and if you were gonna if you're

896
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,039
having a shitty week and you're not

897
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:04,389
feeling your bass you need extra

898
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:10,059
medicine how much are you gonna smoke in

899
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:10,359
a whole week now this week maybe an

900
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:13,299
ounce

901
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,890
okay so somewhere between 150 and 200

902
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,760
bucks worth of quality cannabis but if

903
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:18,699
you grew it yourself

904
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:23,110
we're looking at 28 grams maybe 28 bucks

905
00:49:18,699 --> 00:49:25,000
worth maybe $10 $10 okay everything's

906
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:28,150
pretty much sponsored for me so the

907
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,110
nutrients are paid for and water and

908
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:34,269
lights okay I mean your effort well yeah

909
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:42,670
but I don't really know what I include

910
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:52,449
okay but that's it so I mean growing of

911
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:53,980
it is therapeutic for you also details

912
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:55,929
here and there shows you every single

913
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,849
plan that's definitely part of the

914
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:59,409
healing process and that's another

915
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:01,239
reason why we want to bring these guys

916
00:49:59,409 --> 00:50:03,279
in cuz it will work for other people I

917
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:06,039
know I feel calm in my garden me too I

918
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,690
could be happy I have to drive 55 miles

919
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:10,119
from my house to the office every day

920
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:13,809
and the last 10 miles of that drive is

921
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:15,460
like bumper-to-bumper madness probably

922
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:16,900
park my car run up to the guy in for me

923
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,280
and punch him in the face six times and

924
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,280
get back in my car before traffic

925
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:39,360
get in the girl is just like I love to

926
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:43,319
get it done in like 72 in the last two

927
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,640
and a half weeks okay I would do things

928
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,680
a little bit differently but with the

929
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,230
perpetual you have to keep it ideal

930
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:50,969
across the boards I've got there are

931
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:52,440
plants three every three weeks or new

932
00:50:50,969 --> 00:50:56,129
plants going in so I've got stuff at

933
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:59,309
week 1 week 3 and week six week 9 6 &amp; 3

934
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:02,960
so I have to have 12 12 and 74 degrees

935
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:07,049
smoke smoke yeah I've been playing with

936
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:10,650
with light manipulation lately like I

937
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:13,050
did it 35 days I flipped into 1113 I did

938
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:15,450
the last one at 15 days and then I did

939
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:18,960
want to just straight 11 13 and I'm

940
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:20,639
gonna see how if anything any flavor

941
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,429
changes or anything's enhanced or

942
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:25,379
anything what I noticed from the 11 13

943
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:28,289
was when I was doing Fino hunts I would

944
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,570
see much more Fino typical expression

945
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:33,119
with a dark period I would see much more

946
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:34,830
variation from different phenotypes so

947
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,569
for a breeder that was really handy what

948
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:40,739
I did notice was it kind of diminished

949
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:42,450
on my harvest weight seem to finish a

950
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:45,659
little quicker to finish quicker

951
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:55,319
absolutely I've actually gotten a

952
00:51:45,659 --> 00:52:02,759
bumping away from switching over to huge

953
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:05,010
for me I love that product is it a media

954
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,840
proved can we use it in the meed grows I

955
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:08,520
don't see why you couldn't okay a lot of

956
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:12,890
products are banned a lot of [ __ ] is

957
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:12,889
banned right he's a microbial inoculant

958
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,059
compared to the other things that I use

959
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:22,889
I can't talk about one of the products

960
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:25,469
that I use secretary-- thing but we also

961
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:26,879
use the veg bloom plus life it's all

962
00:52:25,469 --> 00:52:28,919
compared to that and see if it's got the

963
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,450
same stuff you don't pee on your plants

964
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,450
do you know what do you say that

965
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,210

refill his water

970
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:13,610
almost an hour talking to folks you're

971
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,349
already going for a while before to

972
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:17,550
spend 30 minutes get my sd card fixed

973
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,019
because for some reason it didn't want

974
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:20,640
to work when I showed up to record which

975
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:24,710
is almost embarrassing but we pulled it

976
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,710
off electronics man that just happens

977
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:30,359
all right I feel like since Steve left

978
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:46,500
we're all stuck at a low because he's

979
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:48,960
got a notebook over there and he was the

980
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,059
nectar number 8 soil is the one we like

981
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,829
we add a little extra perlite and it's a

982
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:58,320
cocoa base and their whole line is just

983
00:53:55,829 --> 00:54:02,429
or all the organic things I would use in

984
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:06,120
my soil but in bottles and pH so that it

985
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:07,949
doesn't go bad and that stuff works

986
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:09,299
great half the time me and Steve can't

987
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:10,980
even tell the difference between our

988
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,980
weed sweet they have like different

989
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,539
overtones and stuff but I'm very

990
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,090
impressed with the nectar further with

991
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:21,029
God's line and organics guy I don't like

992
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:22,530
any lines really I understand that I

993
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,510
have a friend named Shawn who's been on

994
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:26,670
the podcast a lot of times who doesn't

995
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:28,530
use any bottles nothing he's using comes

996
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:30,480
from a bottle that's where I am his

997
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,040
product is definitely you can tell that

998
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,599
it's a different product it's cleaner it

999
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:37,029
burns better though ashes are as white

1000
00:54:33,599 --> 00:55:16,670
as this parchment paper fish bone meal

1001
00:54:37,030 --> 00:55:18,410
he's got the dog on the podcast oh yeah

1002
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:29,269
it's been trimmed cycle and we just give

1003
00:55:18,409 --> 00:55:31,099
the dogs the leaves eat the leaves off

1004
00:55:29,269 --> 00:55:34,030
and leave the stem and they'll nibble

1005
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:36,559
around the stem and they're just like

1006
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:38,840
they'll clean our floors afterwards

1007
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,210
they're hilarious cool dogs I got the

1008
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:45,140
brother of this dog to pony yeah so the

1009
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:47,090
black one is the mom and then this this

1010
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:50,799
gold one over here came out of her and

1011
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:53,600
Steve got one of the fall black ones and

1012
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:57,470
breeding dogs was an experience I like

1013
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,699
breeding plants way more okay well my

1014
00:55:57,469 --> 00:56:00,019
mind went somewhere really weird with

1015
00:55:58,699 --> 00:56:02,949
that because it's much easier to get rid

1016
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:02,949
of ugly plants

this podcast ironically I did not plan

1021
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:40,789
this is gonna come out on the 4th of

1022
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:49,769

boat drunk be careful if you're at a

1025
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:57,280
state park celebrating today be careful

1026
00:56:55,690 --> 00:57:11,500
with your cannabis and if you're

1027
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:47,290
listening after the holidays off your

1028
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:48,760
head burn a lot of joints yes but be

1029
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:51,250
careful wherever you are you're doing it

1030
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,960
burn some joints cannabis may be legal

1031
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:54,550
in Colorado but there's no legal place

1032
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,690
to consume it other than your house

1033
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:57,690
that's correct

1034
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,119
in the springs we have great open parks

1035
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:09,909
where people love to go and smoke down

1036
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,230
but for some reason there's a cop up

1037
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:12,699
there they'll get in trouble and I don't

1038
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:17,619
understand it they're not bothering

1039
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:20,649
anyone give a plan go to jail I I am a

1040
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:22,210
father and I don't want to be walking

1041
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:24,160
through the park with my daughter

1042
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:25,960
enjoying ice cream

1043
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:28,149
and have to explain to her what you guys

1044
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:31,329
are doing when you're else that's not

1045
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:32,950
that's not your guys's conversation to

1046
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:35,680
introduce to my daughter's life their

1047
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:37,118
mind is when the time is right kind of

1048
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:44,919
thanks for being there so now we can

1049
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:46,420
have that talk as my opinion plenty time

1050
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,650
past time to have a weed talk we've

1051
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:56,710
talked about weed a lot of times she

1052
00:58:47,650 --> 00:59:00,280
doesn't care she was about four it was

1053
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:02,619
like okay look she knows not to touch it

1054
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,900
not to get close to it she stays

1055
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:07,269
completely away from it you know she

1056
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,858
just know she's been educated she has no

1057
00:59:07,269 --> 00:59:12,269
desire for it she knows it's medicine

1058
00:59:08,858 --> 00:59:15,699
it's nice oh it's fun it's not like that

1059
00:59:12,269 --> 00:59:23,259
but I just I just don't want anybody to

1060
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:24,669
have to have the talk of drugs it's just

1061
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,470
gonna go down I just don't want to do

1062
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:28,568
that to our scene we should respect

1063
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:30,098
those parks a little better and I'm the

1064
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:36,190
hypocrites I took a DAB at the park the

1065
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:37,599
other day away from here and my friend

1066
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:39,010
was nice enough to bring me lunch and I

1067
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,450
thought she deserves some dabs for

1068
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:43,329
bringing me lunch I was like well let's

1069
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:45,548
go to that Park that's why we need our

1070
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:51,220
dab lounges around in the spring said no

1071
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:54,869
to those two places to ever go in

1072
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:54,868
Springs was to go hang out at the canyon

1073
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:05,679
regulated like alcohol we should be able

1074
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:07,838
to consume in a public place like a bar

1075
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:10,899
that's the most valid argument out of

1076
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:12,489
all of it you try to keep the officials

1077
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:14,170
the legislation is the one that made it

1078
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:16,659
regulated there was their idea regulated

1079
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:18,490
like alcohol there's an alcohol drinking

1080
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:19,778
establishment on every two blocks if

1081
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:24,159
you're a bubble there's one every 30

1082
01:00:19,778 --> 01:00:27,338
feet somebody drinking places and

1083
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:29,108
nowhere illegal to consume your house in

1084
01:00:27,338 --> 01:00:31,028
your house that's if you have permission

1085
01:00:29,108 --> 01:00:33,098
from your landlord if you rent and how

1086
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:37,798
am I supposed to medicate safely on a

1087
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:37,798
lunch break if I don't live here right

stepped up our game here in Colorado our

1214
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:16,810
friends at Evo labs so we they said we

1215
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:19,649
like I'm involved in the [ __ ] I smoke my

1216
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:21,840
role in the consumer

1217
01:09:19,649 --> 01:09:24,420
only I do a little product research for

1218
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,440
these guys but uh so I'll be your space

1219
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,300
monkey I don't care

1220
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:29,189
we take they take some shatter they take

1221
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:31,320
cash I think they're taking co2 oil I'm

1222
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:34,889
90% sure that this is made with co2 oil

1223
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:36,630
a co2 extraction and there's a lot of

1224
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:40,829
people right now in the industry playing

1225
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:43,199
with refining co2 oil in one way or

1226
01:09:40,829 --> 01:09:46,050
another and this seems to be my favorite

1227
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:50,279
way this is a fractal distillate home

1228
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:53,909
run I've got all of the clear the

1229
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:55,529
they're calling it distillate all of the

1230
01:09:53,909 --> 01:09:57,630
distillate is done with a fractal

1231
01:09:55,529 --> 01:10:00,149
distillation process and they're

1232
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:02,520
separating basically everything the

1233
01:10:00,149 --> 01:10:04,920
cannabinoids and terpenoids and the

1234
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:07,500
lipids are all pulled apart and this

1235
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,560
container right here is a container of

1236
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:12,479
nothing but the THC this is ninety

1237
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,580
percent ninety point nine four percent

1238
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:17,939
THC and one point one percent

1239
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:20,100
CBD this is raw distill it from Evo Evo

1240
01:10:17,939 --> 01:10:21,779
labs and open the jar here and try to

1241
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,860
contain describe what's in this

1242
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:28,250
container the best I can

1243
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:28,250
it looks like really runny honey or

1244
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,449
super clear olive oil maybe yeah but

1245
01:10:32,189 --> 01:10:38,460
it's got more of the consistency of like

1246
01:10:33,449 --> 01:10:41,939
honey or maybe color might be right

1247
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:43,649
though yeah yeah it's like honey almost

1248
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:48,239
in there but this doesn't have much

1249
01:10:43,649 --> 01:10:49,859
flavor it's it is just super stupid

1250
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:51,630
potent I put a little bit of this on the

1251
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:53,819
dabber and this is where it gets fun I

1252
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:56,279
take that little bit that's on the

1253
01:10:53,819 --> 01:11:00,989
dabber and I dunk that into the ghost

1254
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:01,769
train haze raw turps this is mostly

1255
01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:04,109
terpenoids

1256
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:06,360
with a little bit of cannabinoids like

1257
01:11:04,109 --> 01:11:08,460
one or two percent amaizing if I call it

1258
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:11,159
the adult version of fun dips this is

1259
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:12,420
definitely well we've oh I'm a Deadhead

1260
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:15,420
and we've got our own little version of

1261
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:18,930
fun dips but this is the weed of a fun

1262
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:22,109
dendrite this is it's a beautiful thing

1263
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:25,680
this is a you take that beautiful ninety

1264
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:28,079
percent THC distillate and then you dunk

1265
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:29,010
it dunk it and the glorious part is in

1266
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:31,949
my other hand

1267
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:33,900
I've got some og cush Turks so I can

1268
01:11:31,949 --> 01:11:35,579
either dunk it in my og cush burps or I

1269
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:38,339
can dunk it over here my ghost train

1270
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:40,019
haze turps or i could dunk it in one and

1271
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:42,659
then i could dunk it in the other balls

1272
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:44,970
and we're changing up the flavors it the

1273
01:11:42,659 --> 01:11:47,250
OG Kush chirps if you put it on this

1274
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:50,010
distillate and dammit it tastes like you

1275
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:52,079
if apples tasted like OG Kush and you

1276
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:54,329
bit into an OG Kush Apple it was just oh

1277
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:56,340
gee cush all in my mouth and you could

1278
01:11:54,329 --> 01:11:58,109
almost chew the flavor that's how much

1279
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:00,449
oh gee cush flavor these Terps put in

1280
01:11:58,109 --> 01:12:02,579
your face it's the flavor contents

1281
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:05,699
really really nice this way and then the

1282
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:07,350
high from the distillate comboed with I

1283
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:09,779
really like the high that I get from the

1284
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:12,090
ghost train haze it's uh this is sativa

1285
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:13,829
dominant strain I talk about this every

1286
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:15,930
day the other stuff that's in it that's

1287
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:18,809
the THC is definitely a big part of the

1288
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:21,869
high but everything else that that's in

1289
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:25,500
it really plays with that THC in some

1290
01:12:21,869 --> 01:12:27,720
fun ways I almost never go for the most

1291
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,920
potent on the shelf and if you think

1292
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,710
about the rest of your life you

1293
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:33,569
typically don't do that either you've

1294
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:35,100
got to get that other component to it in

1295
01:12:33,569 --> 01:12:37,829
this way you can get both you can get

1296
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:40,350
insanely potent and really really

1297
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:42,029
flavorful I've been kind of being a

1298
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:46,050
snobby [ __ ] I take some of this blue

1299
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:47,460
shirt 120 micron fresh frozen solvent

1300
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:50,100
less hash and I roll out a little patty

1301
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:52,109
and then i dunk some some some durbin

1302
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,880
poison shatter onto it then I rub the

1303
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:55,679
little cactus cooler live resin on top

1304
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,539
of that then I put a little bit of the

1305
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,700
Terps on it and then I put some of that

1306
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:01,789
90% of THC distillate on top of there

1307
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:04,139
and I took a big-ass dab of that

1308
01:13:01,789 --> 01:13:06,029
remember in high school when you used to

1309
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:08,760
go park somewhere and see how high you

1310
01:13:06,029 --> 01:13:12,090
could get I don't think we got that high

1311
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:14,340
what is when I took that big-ass dab my

1312
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:16,710
arm hair was wiggling around like it was

1313
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:20,550
visibly waving like something similar

1314
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:22,470
which is much much cheaper product with

1315
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:24,150
with just your typical waxes shatter

1316
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:26,520
I'll take a piece of shatter and kind of

1317
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:29,099
pancake it out real far throw a little

1318
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,380
wax in the middle row little taquito and

1319
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,850
dab that but mine are much smaller and

1320
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:34,319
much less fancy than the ones you've

1321
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:36,289
been throwing down I like to go big or

1322
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:39,619
go home and I take dad's home

1323
01:13:36,289 --> 01:13:44,359
go little and go often go big and go

1324
01:13:39,619 --> 01:13:47,000
often one of the best parts about taking

1325
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:48,920
dabs is that you can grab the dabber and

1326
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,380
Mike can take his dosage Mike's a

1327
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,670
cigarette smoker so when you get Mike

1328
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:54,409
worked up a little bit you can hear him

1329
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:57,260
gurgle he doesn't even need dabs to

1330
01:13:54,409 --> 01:13:59,239
start making funky like the bong

1331
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:02,300
occasionally so you give them I give

1332
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:04,189
Mike if you handed me the dabs that I

1333
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:06,380
gave Mike I would laugh at you I'd say

1334
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:08,809
can you maybe triple quadruple that up

1335
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:11,090
bread Mike takes just little pin sides

1336
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:13,430
dad's probably the dad's you take Mike

1337
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:15,350
takes that size of the dab us and he

1338
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:19,240
will cough and turn purple and get

1339
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:23,120
sweaty with the email carp cap set up a

1340
01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:24,889
beast it's not nearly as bad as cuz I

1341
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:27,529
don't have that curve cap to cut the cap

1342
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:29,390
adds quite a bit people get yourself a

1343
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:31,009
carp cap this is a 710 episode let's

1344
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:34,130
educate folks on the email right quick

1345
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:36,980
the the electronic continuously heated

1346
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:38,750
nail is a beautiful beautiful thing it's

1347
01:14:36,979 --> 01:14:42,289
also a little dangerous depending on

1348
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:45,380
where you dab I I had one in the car for

1349
01:14:42,289 --> 01:14:47,689
several days well the space I dab often

1350
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:50,930
is also shared by three large dogs that

1351
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:53,779
are really furry and psychotic and so

1352
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:55,520
like if I was gonna add an email to that

1353
01:14:53,779 --> 01:14:57,259
makes like something would get set on

1354
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,760
fire that I care about yeah dog would

1355
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:01,100
get burned on the bald spot somewhere

1356
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,320
there's kind of a reason I don't have

1357
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:05,060
one yet but it's it's on the short list

1358
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:07,630
of things to treat myself to I had to

1359
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:10,190
take mine out of the car I was getting

1360
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:13,130
careless I was getting too high in the

1361
01:15:10,189 --> 01:15:15,199
car which I was like I'm pretty pretty

1362
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:17,779
medicated here I gotta chill out on this

1363
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:20,510
and then also I had to set the rig in

1364
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:22,309
the cupholder and I forgot it was there

1365
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:23,900
and I felt warmth a couple times I don't

1366
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:25,250
know that I was gonna burn myself but I

1367
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:26,629
was like whoo that is warm over there

1368
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:28,670
and had to think about it again I'm kind

1369
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:30,130
of close to that so I took the email out

1370
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:32,750
of the car that doesn't happen anymore

1371
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:34,579
be careful you guys I can't tell you

1372
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:36,079
what to do but if there's somebody in

1373
01:15:34,579 --> 01:15:38,149
the backseat that needs to have their

1374
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:39,859
medical cannabis available while you're

1375
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:41,269
driving they can consume their medical

1376
01:15:39,859 --> 01:15:44,029
cannabis do your thing you're an adult

1377
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:47,090
but so the email there's a box on my

1378
01:15:44,029 --> 01:15:49,189
table it's uh six inches long four

1379
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:49,560
inches tall it's smaller than the

1380
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:51,809
original

1381
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,600
Nintendo but a little taller yeah okay

1382
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:56,280
yeah yeah and it's got a display on it a

1383
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,050
little LED display with the number it's

1384
01:15:56,279 --> 01:15:59,729
got a power switch on it one of the

1385
01:15:58,050 --> 01:16:04,890
coolest [ __ ] features it's got a USB

1386
01:15:59,729 --> 01:16:06,839
port Mike his last six months my phone's

1387
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:08,850
been charging on that USB slot there's a

1388
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:11,940
really beautiful shot it's my friend

1389
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:13,800
Gideon this was actually a gift from

1390
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:15,509
giddy up at emo Tech's a big shout out

1391
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,250
and shout out to Margolese for the

1392
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:19,530
replacement coils I appreciate that bro

1393
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:21,029
ah but so there's this box with an LED

1394
01:16:19,529 --> 01:16:22,800
screen on the front with numbers

1395
01:16:21,029 --> 01:16:24,689
displayed on it then coming out of that

1396
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,850
box is another cord it's a silver cord

1397
01:16:24,689 --> 01:16:32,309
it's a silver braided cord and it goes

1398
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:34,950
to if you're using any sort of nail

1399
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:37,830
setup instead of the little nail that

1400
01:16:34,949 --> 01:16:40,380
sits inside the rig and the dome or a

1401
01:16:37,829 --> 01:16:43,289
titanium domeless we've got a much

1402
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:45,600
larger titanium domeless that has this

1403
01:16:43,289 --> 01:16:47,460
coil leading to it and then it's tightly

1404
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,620
wrapped around the nail so that it can

1405
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:51,720
evenly heat that surface yeah to

1406
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:53,449
whatever temperature we feel like and

1407
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,530
that's where I want to jump in and

1408
01:16:53,449 --> 01:16:58,559
everybody talks about what temperature

1409
01:16:55,529 --> 01:17:00,539
is your email sent to I do not believe

1410
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,380
that that number right there where it

1411
01:17:00,539 --> 01:17:05,789
says 717 I don't think that's a

1412
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,859
temperature I don't think it correlates

1413
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:10,710
to the actual temperature on my nail

1414
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:13,349
surface because I think this box would

1415
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:15,359
cost much more money for it to actually

1416
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:18,240
have a thermostat inside it that's doing

1417
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:20,009
that one of our friends that is a guy

1418
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:24,630
that works on my website actually told

1419
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:26,250
me that's actually a frequency random

1420
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:28,319
frequency that it kicks out plus it

1421
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:44,430
gives you something to work it's like

1422
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:46,139
your speaker's I've posted pictures

1423
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:47,670
before us getting ready to record stuff

1424
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:50,280
somebody always chimed in and there's

1425
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:52,260
like dude your emails like 300 degrees

1426
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:53,909
too hot it's like that's not a

1427
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:57,659
temperature is always like the first

1428
01:17:53,909 --> 01:17:59,279
three i'm sure if you bought seven emo

1429
01:17:57,659 --> 01:18:00,590
tech units they'd all have seen this

1430
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:02,599
helpful that have the temp

1431
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:04,190
to display and I like that yeah the one

1432
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:05,840
task rock made the original and we're

1433
01:18:04,189 --> 01:18:07,759
gonna talk about task rock you guys this

1434
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,500
is the [ __ ] 710 episode you best

1435
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,050
believe in etosha by deloitte ask rock

1436
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,698
the original email that task rock of

1437
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:17,000
highly-educated the innovator the

1438
01:18:13,698 --> 01:18:19,969
originator that original email did I

1439
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,289
think that temperature did correlate to

1440
01:18:19,969 --> 01:18:23,329
the one on the box although I'm not

1441
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:25,519
certain but I'm pretty sure it did shot

1442
01:18:23,329 --> 01:18:27,529
it to Big D with the original he's got

1443
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:30,440
the museum version he's got the first

1444
01:18:27,529 --> 01:18:32,779
unit task made it's on Daniels shelf

1445
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:33,710
much loved and respected a big deep miss

1446
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:35,269
you bro hope to see you soon

1447
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:37,219
it's get you on the podcast the good old

1448
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:39,830
days I really don't think that that

1449
01:18:37,219 --> 01:18:41,510
number correlates I think that's

1450
01:18:39,829 --> 01:18:43,130
definitely not a temperature when you

1451
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:44,690
get in your car or whatever where do you

1452
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:46,368
like it where you really like to jam out

1453
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:47,868

1456
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:59,988
whatever

1457
01:18:50,829 --> 01:19:04,670
23:39 medium high right before it starts

1458

crackling I think my dad's kind of hot I

1459
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:08,210
like the email a little hotter than most

1460
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,889
people when Spence would come over shut

1461
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:11,779
up dispenser from the garden mmediately

1462
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:13,489

1463
01:19:11,779 --> 01:19:15,019
be like yo nail two hot dog and just

1464

1465
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,260
the n-word you're nailed to high and

1466
01:19:16,849 --> 01:19:20,179
work and reach over and just turn my

1467
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:21,530
[ __ ] now like it was his and I wouldn't

1468
01:19:20,179 --> 01:19:22,730
argue cuz that Spencer and he made the

1469
01:19:21,529 --> 01:19:24,590
hatch for about two dad so I'm just

1470
01:19:22,729 --> 01:19:25,908
gonna let him do his thing but he'd

1471
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:29,329
always turned it the [ __ ] down he'd be

1472
01:19:25,908 --> 01:19:30,170
like my stofflet gift it always says he

1473
01:19:29,329 --> 01:19:33,439
turned that [ __ ] down

1474
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:35,179
I take pretty low temps at home every

1475
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:37,368
now and then I understood it or like I

1476
01:19:35,179 --> 01:19:39,289
sneeze between heating the nail with the

1477
01:19:37,368 --> 01:19:42,229
torch and going to dab and then find

1478
01:19:39,289 --> 01:20:00,679
it's a little too cold my puddle I like

1479
01:19:42,229 --> 01:20:02,299
a big chunky grateful the remaining

1480
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:03,440
members is grateful that Phil Lesh

1481
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,810
doesn't or anymore so they call

1482
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:08,448
themselves dead and Coe I saw dead and

1483
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:10,010
co-ed in Boulder shot it's my friend

1484
01:20:08,448 --> 01:20:12,678
that took me to that show but I saw both

1485
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:14,320
the dead in Boulder and [ __ ] there

1486
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:15,880
were some kids taking dad's in the

1487
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:17,409
back of this SUV they had the tailgate

1488
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,640
up and they had the daybreak sitting up

1489
01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:20,529
on a little thing so that all they had

1490
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:22,210
to do is put it to their face and the

1491
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:23,710
dude heats it with the torch and I'm

1492
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:24,970
just walking toward this car walking

1493
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:28,840
through rows walking through the parking

1494
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:32,260
lot and I see him and I was like it's

1495
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:34,630
hot trying to turn that nail in the

1496
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:36,460
[ __ ] water right now I didn't see any

1497
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:37,779
business I was like oh he's gonna put

1498
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:40,390
the dome on or whatever and let it cool

1499
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:42,130
nah bro I did through the Dolan and

1500
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:44,770
[ __ ] put that dabber to that nail

1501
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:46,930
while it was glowing bright orange and I

1502
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:48,820
just cringed I was like oh my god like

1503
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:50,619
it was not my place to say anything but

1504
01:20:48,819 --> 01:20:54,250
my heart just tingled I was like oh god

1505
01:20:50,619 --> 01:20:55,989
that for poor [ __ ] damn it not only are

1506
01:20:54,250 --> 01:21:01,359
you ruining yourself for no reason

1507
01:20:55,989 --> 01:21:04,659
you're also losing so much flavor in the

1508
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:06,759
Terps I the downside is if you

1509
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:08,079
understood it you end up just wasting

1510
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:11,020
your hash on the nail it taught us

1511
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:13,239
instead of vaporize in our world

1512
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:15,190
so that's let me let me talk about that

1513
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:16,779
when I taught when I hid the email when

1514
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:17,919
I'm taking a big fat app a lot of times

1515
01:21:16,779 --> 01:21:19,539
you guys I come home from work and I

1516
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,069
want a dad like a half gram maybe a gram

1517
01:21:19,539 --> 01:21:22,659
of hash in one [ __ ] dab I'm not

1518
01:21:21,069 --> 01:21:24,069
kidding there are more people in this

1519
01:21:22,659 --> 01:21:25,569
room don't wait raise our hands a

1520
01:21:24,069 --> 01:21:27,880
[ __ ] testify Rasta Jeff will pull a

1521
01:21:25,569 --> 01:21:31,420
grandma dad Graham dad no problem we got

1522
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:33,130
hands up testify it's a lot like a big

1523
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:35,170
fat dad I will do that on the email a

1524
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:36,699
lot of times I'm smoking these Terps in

1525
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:40,779
the distillate I bust out this one right

1526
01:21:36,699 --> 01:21:42,489
here my elevator with a little bang yeah

1527
01:21:40,779 --> 01:21:44,439
it's got they say it's quartz I bet you

1528
01:21:42,489 --> 01:21:45,849
money that's [ __ ] glass I've got a

1529
01:21:44,439 --> 01:21:47,619
little glass of banger on there that's

1530
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:49,990
my flavour saber that I think it tastes

1531
01:21:47,619 --> 01:21:53,529
a little bit better I think quartz

1532
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:54,880
versus Thai I think sometimes gotta say

1533
01:21:53,529 --> 01:21:58,659
that the quartz tastes a little bit

1534
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:00,310
better in my opinion I I have that on my

1535
01:21:58,659 --> 01:22:05,019
short list of things I want to treat

1536
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:07,800
myself with is a nice quartz banger I do

1537
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:18,250
this one here this is a highly-educated

1538
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:19,900
titanium base with the quartz that likes

1539
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:21,489
to travel with a little rig like that

1540
01:22:19,899 --> 01:22:23,079
that's the way to go because this banger

1541
01:22:21,489 --> 01:22:25,840
the way that I travel with it that would

1542
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:26,739
get destroyed quickly well where were my

1543
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,220
Derrick's it

1544
01:22:26,739 --> 01:22:32,079
most of the time that would be safe like

1545
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:34,270
I can't risk that you know right now but

1546
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:36,850
I could risk the pup you could take the

1547
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:38,380
bucket but not the email hold it's safer

1548
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:42,700
it's the cord that's the problem on

1549
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:44,260
email like just in practice I know my my

1550
01:22:42,699 --> 01:22:45,970
household well enough to me

1551
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:47,800
to know that that rate would get yanked

1552
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:49,780
off that cord is dangerous at this table

1553
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:52,329
right that cord is knocked over and

1554
01:22:49,779 --> 01:22:54,039
broken this exact rig once before just

1555
01:22:52,329 --> 01:22:56,380
sitting there had just wobbled and spun

1556
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:58,119
itself over cuz the you guys the cord on

1557
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:59,650
this he knows it's was coiled in a box

1558
01:22:58,119 --> 01:23:01,779
for a hundred years it looks like and

1559
01:22:59,649 --> 01:23:03,219
shipped from [ __ ] China and vacuum

1560
01:23:01,779 --> 01:23:04,750
packed and so it's gonna be coy Li

1561
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:06,130
shaped for the rest of his life and

1562
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:07,510
sometimes you try to straighten it out

1563
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,140
and it makes you think it went straight

1564
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:14,140
but then it just starts coil and slowly

1565
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:15,460
itself up tip your rig over so turn your

1566
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:18,039
email off when you leave the house

1567
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:19,390
that's a reminder to myself also have no

1568
01:23:18,039 --> 01:23:28,630
idea how many times I've come home and

1569
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:30,039
been like oh lo tip is better what I'm

1570
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:31,720
doing a small dab is what I wanted to

1571
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:33,550
kind of take that email versus the

1572
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,930
quartz the titanium versus course the

1573
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,640
nice thing about the course is you can

1574
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:38,829
bring that temp down even further just

1575
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:41,350
let it cool get it get a glowy ha and

1576
01:23:38,829 --> 01:23:43,449
let it go do is don't be that don't do

1577
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,860
be that guy that's adjacent margulies I

1578
01:23:43,449 --> 01:23:46,449
got so many friends it'll heat the nail

1579
01:23:44,859 --> 01:23:47,739
until it's glowing orange and bust on a

1580
01:23:46,449 --> 01:23:49,329
[ __ ] timer and they have timed

1581
01:23:47,739 --> 01:23:51,069
exactly like from what it glows right

1582
01:23:49,329 --> 01:23:59,109
here bro you hit go and wait this many

1583
01:23:51,069 --> 01:24:01,090
seconds perfect [ __ ] die bro cuz it's

1584
01:23:59,109 --> 01:24:02,439
too cool for me I like a little warm if

1585
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:04,600
I'm trying to dad these Terps all

1586
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:07,869
oftentimes go for the courts and go low

1587
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,829
temp low temp we say you gotta taste it

1588
01:24:07,869 --> 01:24:11,979
to waste it

1589
01:24:08,829 --> 01:24:13,420
hit it low temp carb cap it just get all

1590
01:24:11,979 --> 01:24:15,549
that flavor in there take a little tiny

1591
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:16,899
dab and then grab a q-tip and heat the

1592
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,400
nail just a little bit and clean it out

1593
01:24:16,899 --> 01:24:20,559
with the q-tip and now you got a fresh

1594
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:22,479
banger again they call that the q-tip

1595
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,370
tech I don't play that way I heat the

1596
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:26,409
[ __ ] out of it until it's clean and then

1597
01:24:24,369 --> 01:24:28,180
I throw another dad in it that's that's

1598
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:30,279
how I roll with the banger I'm not on

1599
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:32,170
the q-tip Tech in the low temp tech all

1600
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:34,689
that I think take a fat dad and get it

1601
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:37,890
on right my buddy at a mill would say

1602
01:24:34,689 --> 01:24:37,889
red means go

1603
01:24:38,619 --> 01:24:44,680
in there now I can it's it's too much on

1604
01:24:41,829 --> 01:24:47,439
my throat yeah low tip is better for you

1605
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:48,310
low tip is better uh fine so guys when

1606
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:49,449
you're trying to set the temperature to

1607
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:51,610
your email everyone's like what

1608
01:24:49,449 --> 01:24:54,970
temperature do I said it go ahead Mike

1609
01:24:51,609 --> 01:24:57,849
you got something to jump in that's the

1610
01:24:54,970 --> 01:25:00,190
right set up is really key to getting

1611
01:24:57,850 --> 01:25:04,000
the most out of your hash you can take a

1612
01:25:00,189 --> 01:25:05,649
really nice low temp dab on an email and

1613
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,560
with the carp cap you don't waste

1614
01:25:05,649 --> 01:25:11,500
anything there's even if you go really

1615
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,539
low it's still gonna continuously heat

1616
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:16,479
that surface and vaporize everything off

1617
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:18,609
you've got a carb cap even if it takes a

1618
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:21,279
second to get it done you're not gonna

1619
01:25:18,609 --> 01:25:25,299
lose anything you can actually enjoy all

1620
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:26,949
of that and it just it's one of those

1621
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:29,020
things where it takes the time and

1622
01:25:26,949 --> 01:25:30,429
investing in the right tools to really

1623
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:32,470
get the best bang out of your product

1624
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:33,909
and that's part of the reason I end up

1625
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:37,240
so baked ears because I've only got like

1626
01:25:33,909 --> 01:25:39,069
half the pieces at home and so when I

1627
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:41,109
load template I end up losing a good bit

1628
01:25:39,069 --> 01:25:42,789
off the top of my nails or making small

1629
01:25:41,109 --> 01:25:44,739
dabs anyway and you gotta clean it up I

1630
01:25:42,789 --> 01:25:46,840
noticed it the first step every time I

1631
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:54,579
come over here I coughed way harder than

1632
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:56,650
I have in a week or two and then I think

1633
01:25:54,579 --> 01:26:00,880
is because I use a smaller rig than most

1634
01:25:56,649 --> 01:26:03,399
folks yeah I really like I prefer a

1635
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,900
smaller rig and I prefer an email on a

1636
01:26:03,399 --> 01:26:08,609
small rig right now I'm hitting the

1637
01:26:04,899 --> 01:26:11,259
Hitman sidecar the e-series sidecar

1638
01:26:08,609 --> 01:26:12,460
small to the point and it heats to the

1639
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:14,079
point where he's got to keep an eye on

1640
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:16,539
the water level because it will cook

1641
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:17,010
itself Drive yeah yeah that has happened

1642
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:20,319
before

1643
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:22,390
my mad Rob is like [ __ ] 4 inches tall

1644
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:28,989
I love these little rings I like this

1645
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:32,500
myself rod during a podcast taking a dry

1646
01:26:28,989 --> 01:26:35,559
dab this elevate Klein it's taller but

1647
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:37,510
it still got very very minimal amount of

1648
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,550
air space and that's it I don't want a

1649
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:41,800
lot of space from the time that I put my

1650
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:43,630
dab on the surface of this dad nail for

1651
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,880
it to go down here down this tube into

1652
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:48,039
the water and into my face I want as

1653
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:50,739
little resistance as possible I just

1654
01:26:48,039 --> 01:26:51,399
want to get that dab into my brain just

1655
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:52,000
give it to me

1656
01:26:51,399 --> 01:26:53,889
and

1657
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,600
feel like all the percolators and all

1658
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:57,340
the extra bubbles and [ __ ] that's just

1659
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,960
stealing your dad's still in your Terps

1660
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:01,000
stealing your flavor I don't want all

1661
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,500
that extra bubbling I want enough water

1662
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,750
just to cool it down from hitting that

1663
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:07,720
nail and then let me get it actually

1664
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:09,909
took dabs today through this little rig

1665
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:16,690
without enough water in it and I got

1666
01:27:09,909 --> 01:27:18,720
ultra high it made my throat tingle a

1667
01:27:16,689 --> 01:27:22,059
little bit but holy [ __ ] I was red-eyed

1668
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:25,180
the first time I used a really good

1669
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:26,980
portable hash pen they never last for

1670
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:29,050
very long but the first time I used one

1671
01:27:26,979 --> 01:27:37,049
they gave you like that first dozen hits

1672
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:39,340
well circulation tastes like hot plastic

1673
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:40,960
knows the different companies still

1674
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:44,500
tasted like hot plastic because the

1675
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:47,980
mouthpiece was plastic but [ __ ] dude

1676
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:49,720
that burn lasted all week throat burn

1677
01:27:47,979 --> 01:27:52,059
for a week remember like when you stay

1678
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,320
at a bong and fill it get it full and

1679
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:55,060
you keep sucking and that chamber would

1680
01:27:53,319 --> 01:27:56,500
fill and you keep sucking and all your

1681
01:27:55,060 --> 01:28:00,400
friends pull it pull it and you look

1682
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:01,630
like nope I'm gonna get high you pull it

1683
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:04,029
and then all that smoke goes in your

1684
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:05,980
head that's the point of a big pipe or a

1685
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:08,019
big bong or a big rig build that [ __ ]

1686
01:28:05,979 --> 01:28:10,629
up and then carpet and get smoke if you

1687
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:12,820
notice add a brig there's no carb you

1688
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:14,260
just want that [ __ ] smoke when you

1689
01:28:12,819 --> 01:28:16,210
throw the card cap on to trap the heat

1690
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:17,320
and in the nail and put a little vacuum

1691
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:19,270
in there you got a little tiny hole in

1692
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:20,619
the carb cap you get less air flow it

1693
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:21,880
through that heat stays in there every

1694
01:28:20,619 --> 01:28:23,260
bit air that comes through moves that

1695
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,609
oil around on the top of the nail then

1696
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:26,380
it goes into your brain and then you get

1697
01:28:24,609 --> 01:28:28,329
stupid high I don't feel the need to

1698
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:30,989
suck like a liter of oxygen through my

1699
01:28:28,329 --> 01:28:33,670
bong before I start getting I'm not a

1700
01:28:30,989 --> 01:28:36,309
song and I know a lot of people that are

1701
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:38,289
I sell an amazing nail that is it's a

1702
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:41,350
beautiful six in one that's designed for

1703
01:28:38,289 --> 01:28:42,640
rigs or bongs it'll fit anything on the

1704
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:44,710
market it's a copy of the

1705
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:46,780
highly-educated infinity nail I'm sure

1706
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:48,880
it is it's an awful beautiful invention

1707
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:51,219
completely as I'm talking about

1708
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,690
and every time I see it and I've got

1709
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:55,659
extra money in my pocket and I'm like

1710
01:28:52,689 --> 01:28:57,599
that's [ __ ] so much but then I

1711
01:28:55,659 --> 01:29:01,539
remember that I don't like dab bongs

1712
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,640
it's just way too much volume and it I

1713
01:29:01,539 --> 01:29:05,060
you can see it on the inside of the

1714
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:08,079
glass you like that sash

1715
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:10,250
it's supposed to be my brain yeah it's

1716
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:11,869
you cough and choke anyway you don't

1717
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:13,609
need to spend that extra energy on your

1718
01:29:11,869 --> 01:29:16,939
lungs pulling a liter of air up through

1719
01:29:13,609 --> 01:29:19,039
your it's funny I love a bond for flower

1720
01:29:16,939 --> 01:29:20,599
that's my primary smoking device clean

1721
01:29:19,039 --> 01:29:23,420
my bong yesterday loved it

1722
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:25,760
um picked up flower today and yesterday

1723
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:29,149
because that's mainly what I've been

1724
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:31,909
smoking at home um but for a nice nap

1725
01:29:29,149 --> 01:29:34,159
you gotta go with a small array yeah I

1726
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:35,210
prefer when you started talking about

1727
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,439
flower maybe you want to segue into

1728
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:39,109
something else that I wrote down I

1729
01:29:36,439 --> 01:29:40,279
prefer indica flowers if I was gonna go

1730
01:29:39,109 --> 01:29:41,899
shopping like right here on the table

1731
01:29:40,279 --> 01:29:43,569
I've got some blue shirt that I grew at

1732
01:29:41,899 --> 01:29:45,889
the green or healthy wellness garden I

1733
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:47,329
smell so yummy and then here in this

1734
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:49,250
container I got some Jeff Shoji that I

1735
01:29:47,329 --> 01:29:56,300
grew these are both heavy indica

1736
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:58,250
dominant strains thank you this so far

1737
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,989
is my proudest grow in this garden but

1738
01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:02,000
wait until you see the next couple runs

1739
01:29:59,989 --> 01:30:03,829
I'm already impressed but I prefer these

1740
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,310
indica dominant flowers to sit you down

1741
01:30:03,829 --> 01:30:09,529
chill you out cushy piney dank flavored

1742
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:11,060
flowers I'm gonna roll a joint with that

1743
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:13,639
and I'm gonna smoke it and it's just

1744
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:15,410
gonna taste earthy and funky and coffee

1745
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:17,570
like but then when it comes to my dad's

1746
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:19,099
if you notice all my dab selection

1747
01:30:17,569 --> 01:30:20,479
everything over here is like candy

1748
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:22,370
flavors and should I like the cactus

1749
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:24,319
cooler and over here this one doesn't

1750
01:30:22,369 --> 01:30:26,599
even have a label anymore whatever that

1751
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:27,920
was we got some of the blue shirt of

1752
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,110
course the solvent list we got super

1753
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,460
lemon haze over here this one is cold

1754
01:30:30,109 --> 01:30:32,210
treat cush because obviously like those

1755
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,189
cush Terps

1756
01:30:32,210 --> 01:30:36,560
I've been going super heavy citrus

1757
01:30:34,189 --> 01:30:38,239
lately for a while the only exceptions

1758
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,420
the durbin which is all pine I was

1759
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:43,909
building up to the lemon G oh there's

1760
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:47,239
nothing like lemon Jie Terps the flavor

1761
01:30:43,909 --> 01:30:50,269
of lemon G live resin in my face like if

1762
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:51,739
I could all if I can only dabble and you

1763
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:53,240
would be my water no lis but if I had to

1764
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:54,739
pick three strains that I had had to dab

1765
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:56,899
for the rest of my life lemon G would be

1766
01:30:54,739 --> 01:30:58,219
in that mix it may have to replace it

1767
01:30:56,899 --> 01:31:00,579
with lemon Geoffrey though I'm not sure

1768
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:02,960
I'd have to set him side by side diktat

1769
01:31:00,579 --> 01:31:05,569
I've been going sweet for a while I've

1770

1771
01:31:05,569 --> 01:31:09,949
while and I just went all sweet the last

six ones you like the feel yep this that

1773
01:31:09,949 --> 01:31:14,300
heavy diesel flavor I've loved since

1774
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:15,739
nearly 2000 sighs dad for my

1775
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:17,360

1777
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:21,679
I'm you know me I love the Sour Diesel

1778
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:24,079

sour decent live residents so taste you

1780

home right now I can treat myself with I

1781
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:30,139
don't enjoy Sour Diesel concentrates at

1782
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:31,520
all remember what time I ended up with

1783
01:31:30,139 --> 01:31:38,000
some Sour Diesel concentrates on

1784
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:40,340
accident I'm pretty sure I don't care

1785
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,050
for that flavor also good I saved I used

1786
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:43,130
it as treats for like my I did [ __ ]

1787
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:53,510
around the house that I didn't want to

1788
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:56,239
do it all really good strawberry

1789
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:57,889
strawberry banana tangi the SBT brother

1790
01:31:56,238 --> 01:31:59,718
everybody seems to be going cuckoo over

1791
01:31:57,889 --> 01:32:01,489
the strawberry banana tangi stuff from

1792
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:02,539
Krakow that's at rocket for makin killer

1793
01:32:01,488 --> 01:32:06,198
killer seeds

1794
01:32:02,539 --> 01:32:07,399
it's funny how being a breeder and

1795
01:32:06,198 --> 01:32:09,289
somebody that works in a large scale

1796
01:32:07,399 --> 01:32:12,289
cultivation facility seeing the

1797
01:32:09,289 --> 01:32:13,670
difference in buds that are grown in

1798
01:32:12,289 --> 01:32:15,439
plants that are grown for flower

1799
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:17,899
production and plants that are grown

1800
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:21,469
specifically for oil production we've

1801
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:25,158
got a cut but we gave it to somebody in

1802
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:26,719
another state and they grew it and once

1803
01:32:25,158 --> 01:32:29,029
they grew it out and saw it they're like

1804
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:31,069
[ __ ] this plant and they cut down all of

1805
01:32:29,029 --> 01:32:33,590
the remaining plants of it and they sent

1806
01:32:31,069 --> 01:32:34,759
the flowers to an extraction lab and

1807
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:36,920
that extraction lab was like what the

1808
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:38,210
[ __ ] did you send us I don't like some

1809
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:41,539
cuts that we got from our friends in

1810
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:43,969
Colorado that would be me like what the

1811
01:32:41,539 --> 01:32:46,099
[ __ ] is this [ __ ] and the extraction lab

1812
01:32:43,969 --> 01:32:47,448
ran it and they called the guy I like

1813
01:32:46,099 --> 01:32:49,010
bro you gotta come over here in the dude

1814
01:32:47,448 --> 01:32:50,839
went over there he took a DAB that's the

1815
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:52,489
best [ __ ] hash I've ever smoked and

1816
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:54,199
like this is the best hash anyone in

1817
01:32:52,488 --> 01:32:58,339
this [ __ ] building has ever smoked do

1818
01:32:54,198 --> 01:32:59,689
you have any more all of the [ __ ]

1819
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:04,690
plants that he had luckily I still have

1820
01:32:59,689 --> 01:33:04,689
it so it's still around it's still here

1821
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:13,880
we live in the future here forget it so

1822
01:33:11,238 --> 01:33:16,488
often here for the rest of the country

1823
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:19,159
and for for sure the rest of the world

1824
01:33:16,488 --> 01:33:21,319
oh when it comes to legal cannabis

1825
01:33:19,158 --> 01:33:23,629
products with cannabis products period

1826
01:33:21,319 --> 01:33:25,978
we have stuff that I mean if you guys

1827
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:30,300
went legal yesterday you wouldn't see

1828
01:33:25,979 --> 01:33:32,340
yes right this legend takes that kind of

1829
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,929
time this train will not finish for

1830
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:35,578
anything and it's ugly but it makes the

1831
01:33:33,929 --> 01:33:36,569
best oil bro so things are gonna change

1832
01:33:35,578 --> 01:33:38,458
you're gonna start seeing different

1833
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:39,929
different types of plants growing for

1834
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:41,219
different things we're growing specific

1835
01:33:39,929 --> 01:33:43,199
[ __ ] if they grow right now they will

1836
01:33:41,219 --> 01:33:45,300
only be made into oil these nuts transit

1837
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:46,828
I will never let anybody see that flower

1838
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:50,869
because they're ugly a [ __ ] but the oil

1839
01:33:46,828 --> 01:33:50,868
that comes out of it is tremendous

1840
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:56,099
through a while now the hash has been

1841
01:33:53,998 --> 01:33:58,828
stalled out it just wax and shatter and

1842
01:33:56,099 --> 01:34:00,809
butter and butters just basically wax

1843
01:33:58,828 --> 01:34:03,899
you you're kind of stumbled over if I'm

1844
01:34:00,809 --> 01:34:07,979
not mistaken hey maybe I'm wrong for

1845
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:11,488
butter lovers sorry but that was it and

1846
01:34:07,979 --> 01:34:12,840
then live resident came along and people

1847
01:34:11,488 --> 01:34:15,629
really started thinking about where can

1848
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:17,309
we go max with this yo and I love that

1849
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:20,510
people started playing with co2 oil

1850
01:34:17,309 --> 01:34:22,860
because there's a huge demand for that

1851
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:24,269
but then you're left with this goo in a

1852
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:28,139
syringe that's impossible

1853
01:34:24,269 --> 01:34:30,449
right so I used to hate co2 oil I was

1854
01:34:28,139 --> 01:34:32,609
like dying hate that goopy [ __ ] but it

1855
01:34:30,448 --> 01:34:34,348
didn't taste right now it cleaned it up

1856
01:34:32,609 --> 01:34:36,899
and it's now that they've cleaned it up

1857
01:34:34,349 --> 01:34:39,110
the taste is pretty good yeah um and

1858
01:34:36,899 --> 01:34:41,429
when it's further refined like this or

1859
01:34:39,109 --> 01:34:43,380
separated completely and then you

1860
01:34:41,429 --> 01:34:45,989
reconstitute it back on with your desk

1861
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:48,630
like do-it-yourself style it's a lot of

1862
01:34:45,988 --> 01:34:49,859
fun it is a lot of fun tails for

1863
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:51,208
yourself I like I've been just taking

1864
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:54,058
this chatter and dunking it straight

1865
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:56,399
into the Terps all night um it's the

1866
01:34:54,059 --> 01:35:00,719
long expensive process you guys don't

1867
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:05,629
even want to know but you could buy a

1868
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:08,729
house yeah yeah just for the equipment

1869
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:12,359
but this isn't the only variety I've

1870
01:35:08,729 --> 01:35:15,119
seen there's a local outfit that's been

1871
01:35:12,359 --> 01:35:18,058
bringing samples by in their first two

1872
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:21,779
samples were epic fails like

1873
01:35:18,059 --> 01:35:23,248
unmarketable unsellable not unsmoked

1874
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:26,038
bull way better than [ __ ] you're gonna

1875
01:35:23,248 --> 01:35:27,958
get in Florida the name of the company

1876
01:35:26,038 --> 01:35:32,819
have a family member in the name of the

1877
01:35:27,958 --> 01:35:35,550
company okay but it was just not at all

1878
01:35:32,819 --> 01:35:38,099
good a good concentrate ready to go like

1879
01:35:35,550 --> 01:35:41,998
nothing about it was was

1880
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:44,880
but attempts three and four were really

1881
01:35:41,998 --> 01:35:47,510
really nice final products that are

1882
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:51,210
probably gonna be really popular nice

1883
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:53,460
but I'm seeing a lot of that there's

1884
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:55,230
products that we get people who ask him

1885
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:57,118
by name this stuff and like I don't have

1886
01:35:55,229 --> 01:35:59,759
people asking for the Leafs by Snoop I

1887
01:35:57,118 --> 01:36:01,078
do have people asking for new styles a

1888
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,199
hash that come out every couple of weeks

1889
01:36:01,078 --> 01:36:06,479
nice yeah when we send material out to

1890
01:36:04,198 --> 01:36:08,189
Tirpitz does all these extractions for

1891
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:09,959
us from the green excuse me

1892
01:36:08,189 --> 01:36:11,219
tur packs does all the extractions from

1893
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:13,019
the green and healthy walnuts garden and

1894
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:15,569
when we send out material we send them a

1895
01:36:13,019 --> 01:36:17,550
lot of fresh frozen material we send

1896
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:20,729
them a lot of dry material the fresh

1897
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:21,960
frozen we can request it's obviously

1898
01:36:20,729 --> 01:36:24,299
gonna be live resin that's why it's

1899
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:32,309
fresh frozen in dab in your coffee

1900
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:34,110
you just hit material we chopped out a

1901
01:36:32,309 --> 01:36:36,269
plant we cut it into small buds we throw

1902
01:36:34,109 --> 01:36:37,828
those buds into freezer bags those

1903
01:36:36,269 --> 01:36:40,710
freezer bags go directly into the

1904
01:36:37,828 --> 01:36:42,899
freezer they get frozen immediately then

1905
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:44,998
we run to the store and get bags of ice

1906
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:47,308
and put those bags of ice into a giant

1907
01:36:44,998 --> 01:36:49,559
cooler put that frozen material into

1908
01:36:47,309 --> 01:36:52,079
that cooler drive that to a location

1909
01:36:49,559 --> 01:36:53,940
where it is then turned into live resin

1910
01:36:52,078 --> 01:36:57,479
at that point we can have it turned into

1911
01:36:53,939 --> 01:36:59,598
live SAP live sugar we can almost get a

1912
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:07,529
live shatter from some of the strains

1913
01:36:59,599 --> 01:37:08,730
the Sour Diesel won't live shatter once

1914
01:37:07,529 --> 01:37:10,050
you build a relationship with the

1915
01:37:08,729 --> 01:37:11,908
extraction company you're working with

1916
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:13,920
we have two specific extractors that we

1917
01:37:11,908 --> 01:37:15,149
talk to a lot they work with chirp X and

1918
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,828
we can tell them what we want and they

1919
01:37:15,149 --> 01:37:18,988
like that strains not gonna do that or

1920
01:37:16,828 --> 01:37:20,488
that straight is gonna do that and so we

1921
01:37:18,988 --> 01:37:22,439
know that we can get triangle killer

1922
01:37:20,488 --> 01:37:25,558
sugar and rudeboys SAP like on

1923
01:37:22,439 --> 01:37:27,569
consistent levels the Rudeboy Live resin

1924
01:37:25,559 --> 01:37:30,630
sugar is one of my favorite [ __ ]

1925
01:37:27,569 --> 01:37:32,279
things to dab ever it is so turbid ellic

1926
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:34,078
that the high is right where I want it

1927
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:35,399
like some things get you on the top of

1928
01:37:34,078 --> 01:37:36,808
the head something used in the back of

1929
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:38,578
the brain some you feel on the shoulders

1930
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:40,050
this rude boy hits me right in the eyes

1931
01:37:38,578 --> 01:37:42,929
and in the forehead and it makes me

1932
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:45,570
still it makes math skills go away it

1933
01:37:42,929 --> 01:37:47,788
just makes me Goofy's like I like pot

1934
01:37:45,569 --> 01:37:49,899

1935
01:37:47,788 --> 01:37:52,239
smoke that [ __ ] yeah

1936
01:37:49,899 --> 01:37:53,469
yeah all right so it is the 17 episode

1937
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:55,719
you guys we've been talking about 7/10

1938
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:59,860
for a whole long time we should talk

1939
01:37:55,720 --> 01:38:03,220
about the origin of 710 Mike you have

1940
01:37:59,859 --> 01:38:06,039
any idea where the number 17 lawless

1941
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:09,699
culture part of this community upside

1942
01:38:06,039 --> 01:38:11,739
down that's because a lot of the people

1943
01:38:09,699 --> 01:38:14,619
who started this movement were of the

1944
01:38:11,739 --> 01:38:16,659
age where they had beepers and that's

1945
01:38:14,619 --> 01:38:19,809
about as far as I've bothered to follow

1946
01:38:16,659 --> 01:38:21,639
it alright so 710 is the 420 my friend

1947
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:23,920
had a mill coined the phrase 710 is the

1948
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:25,900
new 420 back in the day it was all about

1949
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:27,489
420 let's get together at 420 and smoke

1950
01:38:25,899 --> 01:38:31,000
some weed now at 7:10 let's get together

1951
01:38:27,489 --> 01:38:34,269
710 take some dabs if you turn 710

1952
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:37,119
upside down it does say oil ah to the

1953
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:39,430
best of my knowledge task rock is the

1954
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:41,199
person that created the phrase 710 I

1955
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:43,600
think task rock and a couple other guys

1956
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:44,769
or either in a chat or on a conference

1957
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,060
call and they were talking about stuff

1958
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:47,890
we need they were like we need something

1959
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:51,570
a little more bougie than 420 let's

1960
01:38:47,890 --> 01:38:54,369
upgrade it let's do it with the hash

1961
01:38:51,569 --> 01:39:01,119
hash kids were separating from flour

1962
01:38:54,369 --> 01:39:04,689
kids kids you know I mean right the

1963
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:07,479
hustler kids so that's that's where 7/10

1964
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:09,129
came from 7-10 was coined as far as I

1965
01:39:07,479 --> 01:39:10,419
know to the best of my knowledge and

1966
01:39:09,130 --> 01:39:12,100
I've done a little bit of research but

1967
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:14,739
task rock and a couple other cats with

1968
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:16,690
the guys that coined the phrase 7/10 so

1969
01:39:14,739 --> 01:39:20,019
they created 710 shot it's a task rock

1970
01:39:16,689 --> 01:39:22,000
cast rock of course is he's a rapper

1971
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:23,590
TAS Brock has a couple of albums out one

1972
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,180
of my favorite songs is probably first

1973
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:27,880
place I like do it again

1974
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:32,770
of course boil that oil he also does

1975
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:34,300
hits from the nail music to listen to

1976
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:35,680
some task and take some dads or get

1977
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:37,840
dabbed out and drive around and listen

1978
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:40,180
to some task we're not like I didn't say

1979
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,829
that hypothetically I would like to get

1980
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:45,369
dabbed out driver as a passenger and

1981
01:39:41,829 --> 01:39:48,970
listen to tasks like an ass Brock is

1982
01:39:45,369 --> 01:39:51,640
also the founder proprietor this the

1983
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:53,800
dude for highly-educated titanium that's

1984
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:55,539
task rock a lot of the times if you go

1985
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:58,239
to a cannabis cup even in California

1986
01:39:55,539 --> 01:40:00,970
Colorado those are probably the ones he

1987
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:02,109
goes to if you go to those Cannabis Cup

1988
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:03,280
events and you go to the highly educated

1989
01:40:02,109 --> 01:40:04,598
booth to purchase

1990
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:06,939
highly-educated products you were

1991
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:08,770
probably going to pay your money to task

1992
01:40:06,939 --> 01:40:11,469
rock directly he will be the dude there

1993
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:13,599
that helps ya the task is integral in

1994
01:40:11,469 --> 01:40:14,828
the 7:10 community integral in the 7:10

1995
01:40:13,599 --> 01:40:15,880
movement he's been a big part of it

1996
01:40:14,828 --> 01:40:18,308
since the beginning he's a huge

1997
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:20,078
supporter a shot at the task has made up

1998
01:40:18,309 --> 01:40:22,599
the number 7/10 not the number but the

1999
01:40:20,078 --> 01:40:25,149
phrase 7:10 and that mic stands kinda it

2000
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:28,179
might need a little bit I just might get

2001
01:40:25,149 --> 01:40:30,839
droopy we have a quick equipment it

2002
01:40:28,179 --> 01:40:35,158
might be done I just have to hold it

dabs I want to give a shout out to Big D

2008

the one with the dragon in the logo the

2014
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:17,739
first hash competition I think I ever

2015
01:41:16,328 --> 01:41:19,109
attended

from health stone glass and of course

2020
01:41:25,868 --> 01:41:28,808
I'm gonna give a little bit of credit to

2021
01:41:27,038 --> 01:41:30,609
hitman glass dougie because he does make

2022
01:41:28,809 --> 01:41:32,800
the rigs that a lot of us are purchasing

2023
01:41:30,609 --> 01:41:34,750
and smoking hash through so the lot of

2024
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:40,300
those guys are pioneers of the industry

2025
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:43,359
old school folks in Colorado and the

2026
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:44,679
hash movement Spence did a lot I want to

2027
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:48,098
give a huge shout out to Spence in the

2028
01:41:44,679 --> 01:41:49,960
Whedon crew kind bill that whole crew

2029
01:41:48,099 --> 01:41:53,078
they did a lot in the hash but honestly

2030
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:56,349
we all owe a huge high-five - Derrick

2031
01:41:53,078 --> 01:41:57,788
Cummings [ __ ] Derrick that dude did so

2032
01:41:56,349 --> 01:42:00,880
much for hash that's what it's an inside

2033
01:41:57,788 --> 01:42:03,788
joke but hash tag [ __ ] Derrick joke with

2034
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:06,159
all his friends but Derrick did a lot

2035
01:42:03,788 --> 01:42:07,389
for learning about hash Derrick did a

2036
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:09,549
lot of research and learned a whole lot

2037
01:42:07,389 --> 01:42:11,349
of [ __ ] then of course there's Tony V

2038
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:13,659
there's a whole bunch of guys doing

2039
01:42:11,349 --> 01:42:15,788
stuff for hash in Terps but shadows all

2040
01:42:13,658 --> 01:42:17,139
the people that helped get 7-10 popular

2041
01:42:15,788 --> 01:42:18,519
originated that [ __ ]

2042
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:20,050
tasks rock we're gonna play task rock at

2043
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:23,380
the end of the shows the the original

2044
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:25,239
people as many people involved in

2045
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:28,720
keeping it as what it is today

2046
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:30,639
um it's been fun to watch it grow

2047
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,900
if it goes so rapidly would now that

2048
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:34,060
it's legal that we can do whatever we

2049
01:42:31,899 --> 01:42:36,399
want with this the equipment the

2050
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:37,750
products have just every couple months I

2051
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:39,489
gotta go buy all-new [ __ ] just to have

2052
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:42,159
what I need to have to be on top of

2053
01:42:39,489 --> 01:42:45,159
things it's like any other tech right

2054
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:48,099
now every six months it evolves two to

2055
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:49,059
three times faster and more effective

2056
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:51,940
than it was before

2057
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:54,090
the Terps will be part of the legal

2058
01:42:51,939 --> 01:42:56,859
marijuana industry which is fun to watch

2059
01:42:54,090 --> 01:42:58,750
we got a huge variety products about a

2060
01:42:56,859 --> 01:43:03,250
year and a half ago they're all getting

2061
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:05,560
really really really good now um it's

2062
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:07,079
just so much fun to see you guys gotta

2063
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:09,010
legalize it where you live

2064
01:43:07,079 --> 01:43:10,479
remember when I was like the only one

2065
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:15,010
that had little jars of Terps on the

2066
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:19,019
table there's a lot of people out there

2067
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:19,020
now they're available a lot of shops

2068
01:43:19,109 --> 01:43:23,889
eating them up it's really it's a whole

2069
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:30,159
new thing I really love it a lot of

2070
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:33,220
people probably the [ __ ] turps the

2071
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:36,250
compounds that mainly provide the flavor

2072
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:39,810
and aroma to your cannabis and or

2073
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:42,010
cannabis concentrates they are they're

2074
01:43:39,810 --> 01:43:43,270
part of the flavor the Paley it's and

2075
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:44,860
the esters have a lot to do with the

2076
01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:46,060
flavor the flavonoids have a lot to do

2077
01:43:44,859 --> 01:43:48,429
with the flavor obviously but the

2078
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:50,410
terpenoids are mainly what play the part

2079
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:52,270
of the flavor that work on your tongue

2080
01:43:50,409 --> 01:43:54,579
that's mostly the part that you get they

2081
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:56,710
also contribute to your high I think

2082
01:43:54,579 --> 01:43:58,569
that the OG Kush what makes me a little

2083
01:43:56,710 --> 01:44:01,390
more mellow it gives me a body thing it

2084
01:43:58,569 --> 01:44:04,779
kind of makes my body go wall and the

2085
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:06,880
ghost train haze makes my head go like I

2086
01:44:04,779 --> 01:44:09,969
just dabbed a [ __ ] bottle rocket well

2087
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:11,980
essentially that's what separates indica

2088
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:14,860
from sativa is what you've refined into

2089
01:44:11,979 --> 01:44:19,089
that tiny little jar it's everything

2090
01:44:14,859 --> 01:44:21,219
around the THC there's there's some

2091
01:44:19,090 --> 01:44:24,579
other stuff that goes into that but yeah

2092
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:26,710
it's it if you had to describe somebody

2093
01:44:24,579 --> 01:44:28,059
to somebody you had to show them

2094
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:29,800
strongly this is the difference between

2095
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:30,910
indica and sativa that would definitely

2096
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:33,130
be a good way to do it

2097
01:44:30,909 --> 01:44:35,769
just take that those two just like the

2098
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:37,420
Friday's a heavy sativa was a V Annika

2099
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:39,940
oh you're way too high watch try this

2100
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:44,310
one just put him to bed with the OG Kush

2101
01:44:39,939 --> 01:44:44,309
Oh their problem was I'm Way too I

2102
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:54,580
flavor but all right all this talk about

2103
01:44:52,539 --> 01:44:56,800
dads has got me wanna dad so I've got

2104
01:44:54,579 --> 01:44:58,420
some of this mob boss shatter and I've

2105
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,369
ducked it into some ghost train Hayes

2106
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:01,869
turps you can see the Terps on the tip

2107
01:45:00,369 --> 01:45:04,180
of the dab it just looks like a little

2108
01:45:01,869 --> 01:45:06,579
wet spot on there I'm gonna take a dad

2109

he's pasty white now he's going to read

2118
01:45:36,489 --> 01:45:39,648
[Music]

2119
01:45:40,829 --> 01:45:45,970
it's amazing it's just like heaven I've

2120
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:47,739
always described Hayes strains and the

2121
01:45:45,970 --> 01:45:48,880
ghost train Hayes is really uh it's

2122
01:45:47,739 --> 01:45:50,229
definitely stands out for what I'm

2123
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:51,520
talking about there's like a velvet

2124
01:45:50,229 --> 01:45:53,769
thing that happens on your tongue just

2125
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:56,170
feels like you know when you smell while

2126
01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:58,810
ax or lavender if there's that specific

2127
01:45:56,170 --> 01:46:00,520
thing there's it almost has a similar

2128
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:02,110
coating like that that happens but it's

2129
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:05,530
more enjoyable to me because I [ __ ]

2130
01:46:02,109 --> 01:46:17,319
hate lilacs I like the smell that should

2131
01:46:05,529 --> 01:46:18,819
makes my nose nuts yeah there's probably

2132
01:46:17,319 --> 01:46:20,319
worship that hotel rooms and that

2133
01:46:18,819 --> 01:46:22,149
lavender bro no I know but it's the

2134
01:46:20,319 --> 01:46:23,769
lavender that I've like choked on and

2135
01:46:22,149 --> 01:46:26,710
can feel in my mouth for like the next

2136
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:28,540
hour I think it's it definitely has a

2137
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:31,840
coating right I don't know maybe we're

2138
01:46:28,539 --> 01:46:33,399
just equally high all right shout out to

2139
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,210
710 shot at the task there's something

2140
01:46:33,399 --> 01:46:37,149
else I want to talk about on this

2141
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:40,090
episode that is not really dabbe related

2142
01:46:37,149 --> 01:46:41,309
not really 710 related but it needs to

2143
01:46:40,090 --> 01:46:43,940
be mentioned

2144
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:46,760
amendment 139

2145
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:48,589
man bump bump bomb there was a group I

2146
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:49,340
don't know exactly who put this petition

2147
01:46:48,590 --> 01:46:52,159
out there was a group that was

2148
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:56,960
petitioning to limit all cannabis

2149
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:59,210
products to 16 percent THC that's right

2150
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:00,770
the buds that we grow at the agreement

2151
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:03,130
healthy wellness this should test

2152
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:05,480
anywhere from 20 to 30 percent THC

2153
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:09,650
nothing is lower than 22 I wouldn't

2154
01:47:05,479 --> 01:47:15,319
guess the average THC content in

2155
01:47:09,649 --> 01:47:17,960
Colorado's 18 really know there's

2156
01:47:15,319 --> 01:47:21,409
actually a pretty solid demand for stuff

2157
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:24,800
that's between like 12 and 16 percent

2158
01:47:21,409 --> 01:47:26,630
people that retired after 35 hours doing

2159
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,430
[ __ ] they were drug tested for they

2160
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:32,060
really don't want our our moonshine

2161
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:33,800
potency weed they freak out when they

2162
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:38,780
try to roll it join us and smoke it like

2163
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:41,119
they did back but they like the whole

2164
01:47:38,779 --> 01:47:42,500
like passing back and forth with their

2165
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:44,630
wife for a while I have a friend who

2166
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:47,479
rents yes so they like stuff that they

2167
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:49,699
can smoke on it burn and was writing

2168
01:47:47,479 --> 01:47:53,718
yeah there is a call for that but the

2169
01:47:49,698 --> 01:47:54,889
average is is 18 and so the estimates

2170
01:47:53,719 --> 01:47:56,420
are that this should have shut down

2171
01:47:54,890 --> 01:47:57,800
eighty percent of the industry as we

2172
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:59,539
know right now I wouldn't want it I

2173
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:01,730
would move to a place where I could grow

2174
01:47:59,539 --> 01:48:03,590
high quality cannabis well know

2175
01:48:01,729 --> 01:48:10,009
immediately all conscience rates gone

2176
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:13,699
most of the edibles gone most of the

2177
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:17,090
vapor is gone like what's the point of a

2178
01:48:13,698 --> 01:48:21,198
vapor cart it's 16 percent that would

2179
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:23,989
feel the black market so well yep and

2180
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:26,359
that's the design is the people that

2181
01:48:23,988 --> 01:48:29,899
were behind it wanted it to kill the

2182
01:48:26,359 --> 01:48:32,630
industry they know that a public vote to

2183
01:48:29,899 --> 01:48:38,869
an amendment 64 statewide would die

2184
01:48:32,630 --> 01:48:40,819
laughably and so this was their more

2185
01:48:38,869 --> 01:48:43,130
reasonable attempt to give voters to go

2186
01:48:40,819 --> 01:48:44,779
along with gutting the industry so there

2187
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:46,640
were three parts to this they were gonna

2188
01:48:44,779 --> 01:48:48,979
add childproof packaging which we

2189
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:50,600
already do they wanted us to add a

2190
01:48:48,979 --> 01:48:52,759
health warning that said this root

2191
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:54,329
causes like a reparable brain damage or

2192
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:56,070
some [ __ ]

2193
01:48:54,329 --> 01:48:58,979
we already do health warnings that are

2194
01:48:56,069 --> 01:49:01,289
reasonable we're willing to add more

2195
01:48:58,979 --> 01:49:03,029
reasonable health warnings but we're not

2196
01:49:01,289 --> 01:49:06,239
really glad some random [ __ ] did you

2197
01:49:03,029 --> 01:49:09,630
just thought up um and then it was gonna

2198
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:12,210
limit potency to 16% the group behind

2199
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:15,600
this claims they have 80% of the public

2200
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:21,569
support on this but what public where

2201
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:22,470
that they won't tell you didn't ask any

2202
01:49:21,569 --> 01:49:24,179
dad kids

2203
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:26,130
I think it's 80% of the people at the

2204
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:28,590
last anti-pot meeting yeah

2205
01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:38,100
but 80% of the people in Parker that's

2206
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:39,989
just from they they really really want

2207
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:42,480
hate marijuana and they wanted to shut

2208
01:49:39,989 --> 01:49:44,510
us down this way they claim they have a

2209
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:48,919
huge amount of support which is nonsense

2210
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:51,270
they they withdrew their effort today

2211
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:54,090
they essentially said they could stop

2212
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:55,230
trying and the reason they stopped

2213
01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:59,880
trying is kind of funny

2214
01:49:55,229 --> 01:50:02,429
um they claimed that the group of

2215
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:04,199
marijuana industry supporters and

2216
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:07,409
businesses that formed to oppose this

2217
01:50:04,199 --> 01:50:09,029
effort called up all of the petitions

2218
01:50:07,409 --> 01:50:10,380
signature-gathering companies in

2219
01:50:09,029 --> 01:50:13,550
Colorado that are good at what they do

2220
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:16,470
and can actually get a statewide ballot

2221
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:17,640
effort on the signatures collective

2222
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:21,420
because it's like a hundred thousand or

2223
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:23,039
98 thousand signatures it's a lot there

2224
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:24,329
are companies in Colorado they can

2225
01:50:23,039 --> 01:50:26,100
definitely get that done for you

2226
01:50:24,329 --> 01:50:27,720
apparently they all got a phone call

2227
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:29,490
from the marijuana people like we're

2228
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:33,840
gonna hire you for this here's what you

2229
01:50:29,489 --> 01:50:37,949
got to do nothing oh go ahead and Bill

2230
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:39,989
us and just hung up the phone and they

2231
01:50:37,949 --> 01:50:41,670
raised enough money to apparently make

2232
01:50:39,989 --> 01:50:43,229
that offer to the two biggest companies

2233
01:50:41,670 --> 01:50:45,510
or three biggest companies in Colorado

2234
01:50:43,229 --> 01:50:46,769
and on the off chance the anti-pop

2235
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:48,239
people tried to hire all three they were

2236
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:51,000
prepared to pay all three to do nothing

2237
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:52,199
um and so the anti-pop people were like

2238
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,539
well if we have [ __ ] do this

2239
01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:57,510
ourselves let's go ahead and not do it

2240
01:50:54,539 --> 01:50:58,890
nice which makes me laugh especially

2241
01:50:57,510 --> 01:51:00,989
when they're like well we have at 80%

2242
01:50:58,890 --> 01:51:03,270
support of the public oh my god then

2243
01:51:00,989 --> 01:51:04,920
it's so easy you just they kind of

2244
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:06,270
played old-school drug dealer tactics

2245
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:09,600
though I like that you just

2246
01:51:06,270 --> 01:51:12,090
but up on Facebook in you say hey

2247
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:13,650
community that supports this so much we

2248
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:15,569
need all of you to grab a signature and

2249
01:51:13,649 --> 01:51:19,229
take it to work the next day and say hey

2250
01:51:15,569 --> 01:51:22,859
sign this the 80% of put this is just

2251
01:51:19,229 --> 01:51:24,479
such nonsense they didn't have 80% no

2252
01:51:22,859 --> 01:51:26,819
and then they claimed that the marijuana

2253
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:29,789
industry raised tens and millions of

2254
01:51:26,819 --> 01:51:32,099
millions of dollars to do this and the

2255
01:51:29,789 --> 01:51:34,050
digits public all you have to do is know

2256
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:36,180
where to Google and you can check how

2257
01:51:34,050 --> 01:51:38,070
much they're raised it's like for us is

2258
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:39,600
that if you hand in a petition to most

2259
01:51:38,069 --> 01:51:42,569
people and you're like hey would you

2260
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:55,140
like to limit the THC in cannabis to 16%

2261
01:51:42,569 --> 01:52:00,149
I mean sure people are just willing to

2262
01:51:55,140 --> 01:52:02,400
sign about by law you have to print the

2263
01:52:00,149 --> 01:52:04,289
actual language that you're asking

2264
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:06,389
people to sign for across the top of the

2265
01:52:04,289 --> 01:52:08,789
sheet they sign it can't be a separate

2266
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:12,450
page or nothing like it's there's a lot

2267
01:52:08,789 --> 01:52:13,529
of rules we've discussed this before on

2268
01:52:12,449 --> 01:52:19,050
the show a lot of the people that

2269
01:52:13,529 --> 01:52:20,639
Walmart are in their pajamas you're when

2270
01:52:19,050 --> 01:52:22,199
you're out really collecting this stuff

2271
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:27,060
and trying to get people to give a [ __ ]

2272
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:29,699
no one reads it you live in the county

2273
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:34,260
18 sign here son here that's pretty much

2274
01:52:29,699 --> 01:52:39,479
what you get all right so that dropped

2275
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:44,130
it did not the group behind it is has

2276
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:46,799
pledged to reform as a broader coalition

2277
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:48,900
of people uniting to [ __ ] over the

2278
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:51,510
marijuana industry sounds like a whole

2279
01:52:48,899 --> 01:52:54,420
bunch of [ __ ] bunch of bailiffs that

2280
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:56,489
the lawyer type for them the funny part

2281
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:58,079
is is a big part of their press release

2282
01:52:56,489 --> 01:53:00,329
today they're like will this former high

2283
01:52:58,079 --> 01:53:03,779
school principal who was who was behind

2284
01:53:00,329 --> 01:53:05,550
this said this and this this local

2285
01:53:03,779 --> 01:53:07,649
parent who's behind the other person

2286
01:53:05,550 --> 01:53:09,300
behind this said this and I'm sitting

2287
01:53:07,649 --> 01:53:11,429
there reading a press release from a

2288
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:14,010
major anti marijuana personality in

2289
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:16,320
Oregon and the press release talks about

2290
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:17,730
major funding from a national anti

2291
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:19,289
marijuana group

2292
01:53:17,729 --> 01:53:21,029
and if you keep reading the article it

2293
01:53:19,289 --> 01:53:23,789
talks about the actual people behind the

2294
01:53:21,029 --> 01:53:26,479
initiative who are these local lovable

2295
01:53:23,789 --> 01:53:29,760
characters like a teacher and a parent

2296
01:53:26,479 --> 01:53:31,738
their major politicians from around the

2297
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:34,829
country who make a living doing stuff

2298
01:53:31,738 --> 01:53:36,539
like this but they're able to portray it

2299
01:53:34,829 --> 01:53:38,729
is like oh there's there's just these

2300
01:53:36,539 --> 01:53:41,519
little folks being picked on by baking

2301
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:43,500
industry marijuana so do you threatened

2302
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:45,810
a billion-dollar industry and they

2303
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:48,238
raised 300 grand to knock you out of the

2304
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:49,980
fight like come on now so you just gave

2305
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:51,719
me a perfect segue before we start

2306
01:53:49,979 --> 01:53:53,399
wrapping up the show give me an update

2307
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:56,610
on what is going on with the effort to

2308
01:53:53,399 --> 01:53:57,960
eliminate and/or eradicate recreational

2309
01:53:56,609 --> 01:54:02,189
cannabis from Pueblo County

2310
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:05,279
ok so locally our petition effort has

2311
01:54:02,189 --> 01:54:08,219
been significantly more successful than

2312
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:09,899
the one statewide I there have all their

2313
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:11,430
signatures turned in it looks like

2314
01:54:09,899 --> 01:54:14,129
they've got more than enough valid

2315
01:54:11,430 --> 01:54:16,650
signatures to make the ballot there's

2316
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:19,440
two questions in front of the courts

2317
01:54:16,649 --> 01:54:21,000
right now the first question is how many

2318
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:24,599
signatures they should have collected

2319
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,939
they collected 5% of the voter

2320
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:29,360
signatures from that last election down

2321
01:54:26,939 --> 01:54:33,869
here which was like 5,000 signatures

2322
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:37,229
they collected 9,000 almost and so

2323
01:54:33,869 --> 01:54:39,510
they're covered there if it's 5% but

2324
01:54:37,229 --> 01:54:41,939
recently a bill was passed at the state

2325
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:43,800
level requiring this specific question

2326
01:54:41,939 --> 01:54:48,000
if it's going to be put on a ballot

2327
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:51,180
anywhere to have 15% of passed voter

2328
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:55,079
signatures which we jac that number to

2329
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:56,610
around 14 or 15,000 which means they

2330
01:54:55,079 --> 01:54:58,350
don't have near enough signatures

2331
01:54:56,609 --> 01:55:00,869
gathered and they need to get back out

2332
01:54:58,350 --> 01:55:04,590
there and gather signatures that

2333
01:55:00,869 --> 01:55:07,199
decision should come any day now well

2334
01:55:04,590 --> 01:55:10,350
it's Friday when we're recording this

2335
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:13,889
it'll be Sunday when it comes out so

2336
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:15,120
it'll probably be within 4 5 days of

2337
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:17,190
this coming out when we get that

2338
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:18,750
decision hopefully maybe as many as 15

2339
01:55:17,189 --> 01:55:22,739
but if your roster said this will be

2340
01:55:18,750 --> 01:55:25,920
Monday because he's from the future base

2341
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:27,840
um but hopefully within seven or ten

2342
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:29,909
days we get we get that first decision

2343
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:32,460
about how what percentage of the vote

2344
01:55:29,909 --> 01:55:34,439
they should have gathered odds are

2345
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:36,170
strong that the judge is gonna rule that

2346
01:55:34,439 --> 01:55:38,819
5% is fine

2347
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:42,750
recently we had a local politician make

2348
01:55:38,819 --> 01:55:44,939
a primary ballot and the it ended up in

2349
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:47,369
front of the same judge and the judge's

2350
01:55:44,939 --> 01:55:49,379
ruling was yes he failed to follow the

2351
01:55:47,369 --> 01:55:52,170
law here and here yes he broke that rule

2352
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:53,909
there but elections are about choices

2353
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:56,520
and why not give you guys him as one of

2354
01:55:53,909 --> 01:56:00,630
those choices and a lot of people were

2355
01:55:56,520 --> 01:56:03,780
like wait what really but kinda I guess

2356
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:07,770
like the judge gets to make the rules

2357
01:56:03,779 --> 01:56:09,630
that's why they wear the outfit it's why

2358
01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:11,790
they have the job so let him make them

2359
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:13,170
and that was the decision they made so

2360
01:56:11,789 --> 01:56:15,989
we're kind of expecting the same thing

2361
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:18,029
here there's another court issue that

2362
01:56:15,989 --> 01:56:21,119
involves some serious campaign finance

2363
01:56:18,029 --> 01:56:24,300
stuff that could really keep them off

2364
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:25,710
the ballot Colorado and pretty much

2365
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:29,150
every state in the Union has very

2366
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:32,220
serious laws that govern their elections

2367
01:56:29,149 --> 01:56:34,500
when you would like to put something on

2368
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:36,750
an official election ballot there are

2369
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:38,579
rules you must follow the anti marijuana

2370
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:42,779
people down here are terrible at

2371
01:56:38,579 --> 01:56:44,550
following rules it's a very fun

2372
01:56:42,779 --> 01:56:48,119
character trait for them to have if

2373
01:56:44,550 --> 01:56:49,619
you're me so as soon as they said they

2374
01:56:48,119 --> 01:56:52,739
were running a public ballot I was

2375
01:56:49,619 --> 01:56:54,329
hoping for like with complicated there's

2376
01:56:52,739 --> 01:56:56,069
a lot of important in ins and outs and

2377
01:56:54,329 --> 01:56:59,130
if you can't handle a licensing hearing

2378
01:56:56,069 --> 01:57:01,920
at the county level running a countywide

2379
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:06,900
ballot issue is probably gonna trip you

2380
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:09,119
up and it looks like it has one of the

2381
01:57:06,899 --> 01:57:11,369
things is you can't raise money in a jar

2382
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:14,640
at a fundraiser that's not a thing in

2383
01:57:11,369 --> 01:57:16,260
politics if this donations over $20 I

2384
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:18,869
gotta get your name I got your serial

2385
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:21,329
number um and that's just how elections

2386
01:57:18,869 --> 01:57:25,109
go the money is tracked like that unless

2387
01:57:21,329 --> 01:57:26,909
you're super rich and by which case you

2388
01:57:25,109 --> 01:57:28,259
invite you can donate hundreds of

2389
01:57:26,909 --> 01:57:31,199
millions of dollars to a company to run

2390
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:32,430
evil attack ads and [ __ ] that's fine but

2391
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:33,989
if you're a little guy trying to give

2392
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:35,250
twenty four dollars you got to give me

2393
01:57:33,989 --> 01:57:36,929
your name as your serial number

2394
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:38,939
you can't just throw a jar up on the

2395
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:40,710
piano and at the end of the night have

2396
01:57:38,939 --> 01:57:42,929
three hundred or a thousand bucks in

2397
01:57:40,710 --> 01:57:46,680
there and call it good enough so they

2398
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:49,369
did that twice and then there's major

2399
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:52,470
polling that they've bragged about and

2400
01:57:49,369 --> 01:57:54,659
most people don't understand what what

2401
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:56,730
kind of money's involved when you're you

2402
01:57:54,659 --> 01:57:58,800
when you poll people in a county like

2403
01:57:56,729 --> 01:57:59,789
Pueblo we're not a big County there's

2404
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:02,430
only a hundred fifty thousand people

2405
01:57:59,789 --> 01:58:04,739
down here a poll like that still costs

2406
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:07,619
ten fifteen twenty twenty-five thousand

2407
01:58:04,739 --> 01:58:10,679
dollars the good ones cost twenty five

2408
01:58:07,619 --> 01:58:12,059
thirty five forty thousand dollars the

2409
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:14,940
ones that'll really give you the

2410
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:16,410
information you want are expensive they

2411
01:58:14,939 --> 01:58:17,639
did one of these they paid for one of

2412
01:58:16,409 --> 01:58:19,319
these we know all about it

2413
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:22,200
and for some reason they're lying about

2414
01:58:19,319 --> 01:58:23,939
it that's gonna play out really

2415
01:58:22,199 --> 01:58:28,079
interesting Liancourt do we have access

2416
01:58:23,939 --> 01:58:30,029
to the truth on those surveys we we

2417
01:58:28,079 --> 01:58:31,949
don't know what the results they got

2418
01:58:30,029 --> 01:58:34,229
back but we know they bragged about them

2419
01:58:31,949 --> 01:58:35,880
enough to the local hospitals for the

2420
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:38,159
local hospitals to put literature

2421
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:40,590
together that involved or that

2422
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:42,689
referenced this the polling done we know

2423
01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:46,500
who did the poll we know who paid for

2424
01:58:42,689 --> 01:58:47,969
the poll we know who probably got handed

2425
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:51,810
the check they paid for the poll we know

2426
01:58:47,970 --> 01:58:53,280
who probably cashed it ah it's

2427
01:58:51,810 --> 01:58:54,270
disturbing that they're lying about it

2428
01:58:53,279 --> 01:58:55,949
all I had to do is put it on the

2429
01:58:54,270 --> 01:58:59,340
campaign finance report and nobody gives

2430
01:58:55,949 --> 01:59:00,449
you [ __ ] but they didn't and then they

2431
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:02,880
keep claiming to the press that they

2432
01:59:00,449 --> 01:59:05,789
didn't and eventually the judges

2433
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,960
couldn't want to know why and that's an

2434
01:59:05,789 --> 01:59:08,670
issue that could keep him off the ballot

2435
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:10,409
- same thing with the money in the jars

2436
01:59:08,670 --> 01:59:12,869
that's a big enough screw-up to keep you

2437
01:59:10,409 --> 01:59:16,019
off the ballot um if you want to make

2438
01:59:12,869 --> 01:59:19,229
law you gotta follow law it's really

2439
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:21,390
that simple they hire a lawyer they did

2440
01:59:19,229 --> 01:59:22,679
it's their main volunteer he's donated

2441
01:59:21,390 --> 01:59:25,410
like ten or twelve thousand dollars

2442
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:28,380
worth of lawyer hours to their effort

2443
01:59:25,409 --> 01:59:30,090
like six hours I have no idea what he

2444
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:33,869
charges but that's not that campaign

2445
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:35,159
finance reports okay um I've spent it a

2446
01:59:33,869 --> 01:59:38,849
disturbing amount of time going through

2447
01:59:35,159 --> 01:59:39,449
those reports um it's fun to work on

2448
01:59:38,850 --> 01:59:41,970
campaigns

2449
01:59:39,449 --> 01:59:44,460
I'm sure the look on your face when you

2450
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:47,220
talk about is great it's it's fun it's I

2451
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:48,899
mean it's very could very well could be

2452
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:52,890
the death of webelo

2453
01:59:48,899 --> 01:59:55,259
like yeah yeah really can't handle the

2454
01:59:52,890 --> 01:59:57,750
loss this would be to our community we

2455
01:59:55,260 --> 02:00:01,860
were on the edge for a while parts of

2456
01:59:57,750 --> 02:00:03,720
town are still very very bad crime is a

2457
02:00:01,859 --> 02:00:06,839
huge problem infrastructure spending is

2458
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:08,970
a huge problem if we lose 60% of our

2459
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:11,760
construction industry 1300 marijuana

2460
02:00:08,970 --> 02:00:13,500
jobs all of the expansion that industry

2461
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:16,619
is supposed to go through over the next

2462
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:19,920
several years all of that real estate

2463
02:00:16,619 --> 02:00:22,439
floods back on the market like that's a

2464
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:25,800
death blow all those people that moved

2465
02:00:22,439 --> 02:00:27,779
here because somebody like myself had a

2466
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:28,980
job and was like I need a helper and I

2467
02:00:27,779 --> 02:00:30,599
got somebody that I know in another

2468
02:00:28,979 --> 02:00:32,429
state that I trust brought them out here

2469
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:34,829
those people and myself would be [ __ ]

2470
02:00:32,430 --> 02:00:36,990
you'd be [ __ ] well there's a huge note

2471
02:00:34,829 --> 02:00:39,809
where people were five people that move

2472
02:00:36,989 --> 02:00:41,699
here within the last year yeah how many

2473
02:00:39,810 --> 02:00:44,550
people are employed by the spot like

2474
02:00:41,699 --> 02:00:50,099
3035 yeah that's one dispensary how many

2475
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:52,579
of them are there in Pueblo West hundred

2476
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:56,070
licenses it's 1,300 people

2477
02:00:52,579 --> 02:00:57,840
it's literally if this vote passes 13

2478
02:00:56,069 --> 02:01:01,079
other people are out of work it's a full

2479
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:02,760
1% of our population down here you add

2480
02:01:01,079 --> 02:01:05,399
that immediately to the unemployment

2481
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:07,470
rolls and then you compound that with

2482
02:01:05,399 --> 02:01:10,079
all of it's not like I got fired for

2483
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:11,670
stealing its thirteen hundred people got

2484
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:14,460
put out of a work as an industry closed

2485
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:17,850
we no one gets to apply for the job I

2486
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:19,350
just lost all of us are now applying for

2487
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:21,210
whatever jobs we're currently available

2488
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:23,070
in our industry shut down what

2489
02:01:21,210 --> 02:01:24,960
percentage of those people go home and

2490
02:01:23,069 --> 02:01:26,369
buy a bunch of [ __ ] lights with their

2491
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:27,840
first unemployment check and build a

2492
02:01:26,369 --> 02:01:30,059
black market girl and start flipping a

2493
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:32,670
black market weed well that's I mean I

2494
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:34,440
figure half of what we do about twenty

2495
02:01:32,670 --> 02:01:36,720
million in annual sales down here I

2496
02:01:34,439 --> 02:01:38,699
figure half of that immediately goes

2497
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:40,350
back into the black market and the other

2498
02:01:38,699 --> 02:01:41,819
half goes either up the highway to

2499
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:45,390
Colorado Springs or down the highway to

2500
02:01:41,819 --> 02:01:47,880
Trinidad the tourist money goes to

2501
02:01:45,390 --> 02:01:49,829
Trinidad and mana to the medical money

2502
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:51,900
goes to Colorado Springs everybody

2503
02:01:49,829 --> 02:01:54,090
doesn't feel like that's effort worth

2504
02:01:51,899 --> 02:01:55,949
putting in for a bag of weed just goes

2505
02:01:54,090 --> 02:01:58,140
back to black market yeah just put some

2506
02:01:55,949 --> 02:02:00,599
seeds in the dirt in the basement some

2507
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:01,400
whites on that [ __ ] we lose out on five

2508
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:03,920
million attacks

2509
02:02:01,399 --> 02:02:05,329
next year like that's paying for all

2510
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:06,890
kinds of cool [ __ ] that wasn't getting

2511
02:02:05,329 --> 02:02:08,300
paid for before because we didn't have

2512
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:10,039
the money the city starting to look

2513
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:11,510
decent it's clean it's getting cleaned

2514
02:02:10,039 --> 02:02:13,460
up the potholes are going away

2515
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:15,860
it's nothing little by little just

2516
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:17,420
getting more man I noticed that the last

2517
02:02:15,859 --> 02:02:21,349
Street I drive on on my way to your

2518
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:24,949
place is really just got repay ya in

2519
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:27,140
Jackson's I've known about Pueblo yep

2520
02:02:24,949 --> 02:02:29,779
that whole Boulevard has been marked pot

2521
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:32,510
for potholes it's working it really does

2522
02:02:29,779 --> 02:02:34,399
work it's just little by little it takes

2523
02:02:32,510 --> 02:02:36,500
a minute people are like why has it why

2524
02:02:34,399 --> 02:02:38,509
are our schools perfect we've had legal

2525
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:40,189
weed for two years why aren't all our

2526
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:41,810
streets perfect to spend two years it

2527
02:02:40,189 --> 02:02:44,059
just makes a minute do you have any info

2528
02:02:41,810 --> 02:02:46,130
on the scholarship that was awarded to

2529
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:50,000
the child to use the potty doubled it

2530
02:02:46,130 --> 02:02:51,920
boom like if I was king of the world the

2531
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:55,699
scholarship would be bigger and

2532
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:57,409
spendable in more places but it's still

2533
02:02:55,699 --> 02:02:59,239
really awesome dude we're sending 25

2534
02:02:57,409 --> 02:03:00,979
kids to college that probably wouldn't

2535
02:02:59,239 --> 02:03:02,359
been able to go without that two grand

2536
02:03:00,979 --> 02:03:04,519
explain a little bit how that happened

2537
02:03:02,359 --> 02:03:07,639
to people that have up at all these

2538
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:10,010
county commissioners we passed the

2539
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:11,690
voters passed the local excise tax so

2540
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:13,369
all of the production when you grow

2541
02:03:11,689 --> 02:03:17,029
marijuana and then sell it to a retail

2542
02:03:13,369 --> 02:03:18,710
store it gets taxed at that point and

2543
02:03:17,029 --> 02:03:21,259
that money goes into kind of a slush

2544
02:03:18,710 --> 02:03:26,390
fund for dream projects we couldn't pay

2545
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:28,610
for it before the flowers a green and

2546
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:31,340
healthy wellness I have to they have to

2547
02:03:28,609 --> 02:03:33,500
be packaged and then transferred to the

2548
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:35,600
store yep and that's where the tax

2549
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:37,039
happens yep okay if it was in Pueblo

2550
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:39,710
County that's what the tax would happen

2551
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:42,649
okay Aram when Colorado Springs passes

2552
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:45,050
an excise tax on medical event it'll

2553
02:03:42,649 --> 02:03:47,960
happen there okay but we already did

2554
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:50,119
that down here for wreck and so that's

2555
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:52,819
gonna be this is the first year that tax

2556
02:03:50,119 --> 02:03:54,559
has been in effect so money's just

2557
02:03:52,819 --> 02:03:56,179
starting to trickle in but we expect

2558
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:58,700
three and a half million dollars from

2559
02:03:56,180 --> 02:04:01,130
that excise tax this year and that's the

2560
02:03:58,699 --> 02:04:03,710
bulk of the marijuana taxes that Pueblo

2561
02:04:01,130 --> 02:04:06,829
County is gonna make next year we get

2562
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:08,539
3.5 from the excise tax ish it's an

2563
02:04:06,829 --> 02:04:11,029
estimate so far we'll see what how it

2564
02:04:08,539 --> 02:04:14,149
actually plans out and then we're

2565
02:04:11,029 --> 02:04:18,649
definitely gonna get 1.7 1.8 and

2566
02:04:14,149 --> 02:04:21,198
in fees and sales tax yeah if the

2567
02:04:18,649 --> 02:04:22,789
industry exists if the we'll know that's

2568
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:25,039
that's through the end of this year so

2569
02:04:22,789 --> 02:04:27,109
even if the election goes against this

2570
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:31,460
in November we still get to operate

2571
02:04:27,109 --> 02:04:34,819
until next November it was sort of your

2572
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:39,969
licenses can expire as it comes comes up

2573
02:04:34,819 --> 02:04:43,579
for expiration until November 2017 so

2574
02:04:39,969 --> 02:04:48,408
the shop that gets their license in like

2575
02:04:43,579 --> 02:04:50,689
November the first yeah this year is in

2576
02:04:48,408 --> 02:04:52,219
is in the best shape to operate as long

2577
02:04:50,689 --> 02:04:56,329
as possible regardless of the election

2578
02:04:52,219 --> 02:05:00,198
outcome hopefully that made sense yeah

2579
02:04:56,329 --> 02:05:02,899
yeah uh it's just a deathblow to us do

2580
02:05:00,198 --> 02:05:05,960
this we're doing so much with it's not a

2581
02:05:02,899 --> 02:05:09,109
lot compared to our whole county budget

2582
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:11,569
but the problem with our County budget

2583
02:05:09,109 --> 02:05:14,599
is that it passed its breaking point a

2584
02:05:11,569 --> 02:05:16,579
couple million dollars ago and we just

2585
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:18,020
have to look at middle school kids

2586
02:05:16,579 --> 02:05:19,760
walking in the middle of the street with

2587
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:20,690
the buses in the car traffic can go

2588
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:22,699
sorry

2589
02:05:20,689 --> 02:05:27,019
no money for sidewalks or crossing

2590
02:05:22,698 --> 02:05:28,399
guards or crossing guards yeah like all

2591
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:30,140
kinds of stuff there's we took a

2592
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:32,448
specialist out of a couple of schools

2593
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:34,219
and I read that the newspaper and I was

2594
02:05:32,448 --> 02:05:38,349
like asbestos in schools it's [ __ ]

2595
02:05:34,219 --> 02:05:38,350
2016 oh it's hurting my face ow

2596
02:05:38,590 --> 02:05:43,329
no that was way down in San Juan County

2597
02:05:41,810 --> 02:05:46,520
because that's how we're spending that

2598
02:05:43,329 --> 02:05:48,710
the state also collects an excise tax in

2599
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:50,929
the first 40 million from that fund goes

2600
02:05:48,710 --> 02:05:53,750
to school construction through our

2601
02:05:50,929 --> 02:05:55,969
state's best program and the best

2602
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:58,039
program literally when you apply for you

2603
02:05:55,969 --> 02:06:00,140
explain how your school districts broke

2604
02:05:58,039 --> 02:06:02,689
how they've never had money since the

2605
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:04,280
40s and how you badly need to do stuff

2606
02:06:02,689 --> 02:06:05,839
that should have been done thirty years

2607
02:06:04,279 --> 02:06:08,988
ago but you've never found a way to pay

2608
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:11,119
for and so they're doing stuff like I'm

2609
02:06:08,988 --> 02:06:15,169
taking the lad out of the pipes taking

2610
02:06:11,119 --> 02:06:15,829
the asbestos out of the gym pads in the

2611
02:06:15,170 --> 02:06:17,658
playground

2612
02:06:15,829 --> 02:06:22,130
yeah like or building a playground

2613
02:06:17,658 --> 02:06:24,138
period um paving the road to it all

2614
02:06:22,130 --> 02:06:26,420
kinds of crazy stuff that we really

2615
02:06:24,139 --> 02:06:28,460
should have done decades ago

2616
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:30,949
just never had the money in we were

2617
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:32,449
never gonna have it in the now we can

2618
02:06:30,949 --> 02:06:35,329
fund it with weed money because it's

2619
02:06:32,449 --> 02:06:36,889
just enough more than what we need to do

2620
02:06:35,329 --> 02:06:37,539
everything else that wasn't getting

2621
02:06:36,890 --> 02:06:40,100
funded

2622
02:06:37,539 --> 02:06:42,319
Lupe's background of the scholarships so

2623
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:44,510
sorry the scholarships they gave each

2624
02:06:42,319 --> 02:06:48,409
kid that wanted up to 400 kids a

2625
02:06:44,510 --> 02:06:51,500
thousand bucks 400 kids got a thousand

2626
02:06:48,409 --> 02:06:54,109
bucks well that was the offer only 25

2627
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:56,029
ended up applying okay part of the

2628
02:06:54,109 --> 02:06:57,710
reason for that is you have to be a

2629
02:06:56,029 --> 02:07:00,619
Pueblo high school graduate and we had

2630
02:06:57,710 --> 02:07:04,970
way more than 25 of those fix and

2631
02:07:00,619 --> 02:07:08,479
thinking that but you had to go to

2632
02:07:04,970 --> 02:07:09,890
college in Pueblo County so yeah if I

2633
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:12,229
was king the world it'd be at least

2634
02:07:09,890 --> 02:07:13,970
anywhere in Colorado right cuz nebraska

2635
02:07:12,229 --> 02:07:14,359
need my [ __ ] keep the money in the

2636
02:07:13,970 --> 02:07:15,710
cal

2637
02:07:14,359 --> 02:07:17,569
yeah they just wanted to keep it in the

2638
02:07:15,710 --> 02:07:19,850
county they wanted to promote the local

2639
02:07:17,569 --> 02:07:21,170
university and there's a lot of cool

2640
02:07:19,850 --> 02:07:23,260
things happening down here at our local

2641
02:07:21,170 --> 02:07:26,690
university so when i keep it all the

2642
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:28,699
good music program a good program but i

2643
02:07:26,689 --> 02:07:31,039
don't know about governor like the

2644
02:07:28,699 --> 02:07:33,500
program so much he he used state

2645
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:36,289
marijuana taxes to double it to 2 grand

2646
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:36,739
and i mean honestly that's books for a

2647
02:07:36,289 --> 02:07:39,590
whole year

2648
02:07:36,739 --> 02:07:44,599
that's meals for for most of a whole

2649
02:07:39,590 --> 02:07:45,860
year for happier as you well know i was

2650
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:48,260
a college student so some of these

2651
02:07:45,859 --> 02:07:51,769
numbers not real unrealistic that might

2652
02:07:48,260 --> 02:07:53,449
just be a decade old sorry but uh i mean

2653
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:55,040
two thousand dollars down here in pueblo

2654
02:07:53,449 --> 02:07:57,199
that's fully the difference between i'm

2655
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:59,119
able to go and i'm not able to go yeah

2656
02:07:57,199 --> 02:08:00,380
and honestly if two thousand dollars is

2657
02:07:59,119 --> 02:08:04,130
gonna really make or break that

2658
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:05,630
difference like college in New York or

2659
02:08:04,130 --> 02:08:07,909
wherever else I'd be happy to send you

2660
02:08:05,630 --> 02:08:09,949
with that two grand probably wasn't a

2661
02:08:07,909 --> 02:08:11,569
make or break anyway right like it

2662
02:08:09,949 --> 02:08:14,679
requires a lot more to live out of state

2663
02:08:11,569 --> 02:08:17,630
than it does in your hometown yeah you

2664
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:19,369
stay with the fam oh for sure like that

2665
02:08:17,630 --> 02:08:23,900
takes a huge amount of a huge huge

2666
02:08:19,369 --> 02:08:25,909
amount yeah but it's a fantastic program

2667
02:08:23,899 --> 02:08:28,489
and the anti popular all over it they

2668
02:08:25,909 --> 02:08:30,409
like this is just propaganda it's real

2669
02:08:28,489 --> 02:08:32,449
sure that more kids get to go to college

2670
02:08:30,409 --> 02:08:34,819
it's a propaganda when that kid goes to

2671
02:08:32,449 --> 02:08:36,500
college how was that propaganda like

2672
02:08:34,819 --> 02:08:38,479
some real [ __ ] one of the things people

2673
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:41,029
want refuse to accept is that marijuana

2674
02:08:38,479 --> 02:08:42,949
was always here in a way that's so much

2675
02:08:41,029 --> 02:08:46,779
larger than anyone really wants to admit

2676
02:08:42,949 --> 02:08:51,859
and it's 60 billion coast-to-coast

2677
02:08:46,779 --> 02:08:53,689
6 0 billion I mean that's a huge amount

2678
02:08:51,859 --> 02:08:56,689
of money I don't think anybody can

2679
02:08:53,689 --> 02:08:59,179
fathom that much cash it's I mean yeah

2680
02:08:56,689 --> 02:09:03,229
in 20 hour bills it's a couple of high

2681
02:08:59,180 --> 02:09:08,000
schools probably but it's an insane

2682
02:09:03,229 --> 02:09:10,309
amount it's all just under the surface

2683
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,989
it's your neighbor's house it's the park

2684
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:14,240
your kids play at it's the school your

2685
02:09:11,989 --> 02:09:16,250
kids go to it's even the [ __ ] prisons

2686
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:18,349
like prohibition doesn't work at all

2687
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:19,989
it's right under our noses it's always

2688
02:09:18,350 --> 02:09:23,900
has been it always will be

2689
02:09:19,989 --> 02:09:25,489
it's just mostly invisible the only

2690
02:09:23,899 --> 02:09:27,460
people who are able to be visible with

2691
02:09:25,489 --> 02:09:31,069
it are the people with nothing to lose

2692
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:32,869
and no one's willing to admit that in

2693
02:09:31,069 --> 02:09:36,679
Colorado anymore everything it's new

2694
02:09:32,869 --> 02:09:38,809
especially the anti pop people and all

2695
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:40,159
we did was shift where people buy it and

2696
02:09:38,810 --> 02:09:44,270
we're able to do so many cool things

2697
02:09:40,159 --> 02:09:46,699
with that money we can make Terps

2698
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:47,870
because now we got science be afraid to

2699
02:09:46,699 --> 02:09:50,149
go if you get caught buying the

2700
02:09:47,869 --> 02:09:51,649
equipment it takes to make these Terps

2701
02:09:50,149 --> 02:09:53,599
at the store they turn you in for making

2702
02:09:51,649 --> 02:09:54,469
a [ __ ] meth lab back in the day and I

2703
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:55,730
can be like no we're with this

2704
02:09:54,470 --> 02:09:58,159
dispensary and we need all this

2705
02:09:55,729 --> 02:10:01,039
equipment to make hash and now you can

2706
02:09:58,159 --> 02:10:03,319
do that we can more effectively treat

2707
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:04,670
patients everyone forgets about the

2708
02:10:03,319 --> 02:10:06,799
patients we're all about the turkey out

2709
02:10:04,670 --> 02:10:10,399
now I used to spend the first 20 minutes

2710
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:13,610
with a new big fat bag of weed looking

2711
02:10:10,399 --> 02:10:18,229
for mole looking for mildew looking for

2712
02:10:13,609 --> 02:10:22,489
washers my rigs all kinds of nasty funks

2713
02:10:18,229 --> 02:10:24,679
yeah sit there breaking up bud and half

2714
02:10:22,489 --> 02:10:28,939
the bug crawl out of the noggin up your

2715
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:31,659
arm like it was [ __ ] we used to put up

2716
02:10:28,939 --> 02:10:34,639
with and the fact that it's all gone now

2717
02:10:31,659 --> 02:10:37,760
I'm like there did this the benefit

2718
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:39,500
stream just it's endless it's so far

2719
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:42,170
past the money but for a place like

2720
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:44,060
Pueblo the money's vital does south us

2721
02:10:42,170 --> 02:10:46,460
in town even smaller the sheriff was in

2722
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:48,099
the paper like it wasn't sure what to

2723
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:50,529
think at first now I love it

2724
02:10:48,099 --> 02:10:52,300
to the downtown area yeah yeah they

2725
02:10:50,529 --> 02:10:54,668
built a Riverwalk down there because of

2726
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:58,239
cannabis money yep there Trinidad's not

2727
02:10:54,668 --> 02:11:00,038
gonna die now yeah we had steel here and

2728
02:10:58,238 --> 02:11:01,598
steel isn't as big as it used to be

2729
02:11:00,038 --> 02:11:02,768
people want to go lightweight now so

2730
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:04,469
it's titanium and we don't have a

2731
02:11:02,769 --> 02:11:07,958
titanium mill we have a steel mill and

2732
02:11:04,469 --> 02:11:09,458
so people were leaving and people don't

2733
02:11:07,958 --> 02:11:11,260
want to work at a steel mill forever now

2734
02:11:09,458 --> 02:11:12,698
it's kind of the technology era people

2735
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:14,199
are getting the [ __ ] out of here that

2736
02:11:12,698 --> 02:11:16,868
was going bad I've lived here for a long

2737
02:11:14,198 --> 02:11:18,339
time Mike and I have been here we were

2738
02:11:16,868 --> 02:11:20,259
here before all the cannabis [ __ ]

2739
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:21,998
happened and I have seen this town it

2740
02:11:20,260 --> 02:11:24,519
was kind of a little little cow town

2741
02:11:21,998 --> 02:11:26,139
when I moved here it was flourishing

2742
02:11:24,519 --> 02:11:28,929
like it's actually going somewhere now

2743
02:11:26,139 --> 02:11:30,550
I'm kind of proud we're finally crawling

2744
02:11:28,929 --> 02:11:30,878
out of the funk we were in for like 40

2745
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:37,389
years

2746
02:11:30,878 --> 02:11:38,918
oh the flood [ __ ] us up I mean

2747
02:11:37,389 --> 02:11:42,989
honestly it was when the steel mill

2748
02:11:38,918 --> 02:11:45,128
started to slow down a whole huge

2749
02:11:42,988 --> 02:11:46,839
generation of people didn't have an easy

2750
02:11:45,128 --> 02:11:50,019
way to feed their families down here it

2751
02:11:46,840 --> 02:11:51,550
wasn't easy to find work anymore um you

2752
02:11:50,019 --> 02:11:53,619
really had to work at it when I moved

2753
02:11:51,550 --> 02:11:56,590
here you had to know somebody that was

2754
02:11:53,618 --> 02:11:58,238
hiring yeah period that's how this town

2755
02:11:56,590 --> 02:11:59,529
is this is one of those towns where you

2756
02:11:58,238 --> 02:12:01,208
could fill out a thousand applications

2757
02:11:59,529 --> 02:12:03,969
and unless you know somebody here you're

2758
02:12:01,208 --> 02:12:05,498
not gonna get a job most of the job and

2759
02:12:03,969 --> 02:12:08,229
housing listings never make it online

2760
02:12:05,498 --> 02:12:09,849
here it's you drive up and down the

2761
02:12:08,229 --> 02:12:12,249
streets you want to live on and look for

2762
02:12:09,849 --> 02:12:13,840
someone putting out a for rent sign and

2763
02:12:12,248 --> 02:12:14,849
walk up and talk to that person before

2764
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:17,649
it's it's out there too long

2765
02:12:14,849 --> 02:12:19,599
it's the same thing with jobs you heard

2766
02:12:17,649 --> 02:12:20,949
a friend of yours got fired wandering

2767
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:23,708
where ever they used to work and talk to

2768
02:12:20,948 --> 02:12:25,958
the manager stat um cuz otherwise there

2769
02:12:23,708 --> 02:12:27,819
ain't no job for you in the city um and

2770
02:12:25,958 --> 02:12:29,889
that's slowly changing now we have

2771
02:12:27,819 --> 02:12:31,958
hiring a terse staffing agencies now

2772
02:12:29,889 --> 02:12:34,628
that that help people get a foothold in

2773
02:12:31,958 --> 02:12:36,760
the marijuana industry we have an

2774
02:12:34,628 --> 02:12:39,128
industry down here that's gonna need a

2775
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:43,659
hundred more trimmers next year shadow

2776
02:12:39,128 --> 02:12:45,248
to lioness um the real downside is that

2777
02:12:43,658 --> 02:12:47,188
we're not publicizing in all 50 states

2778
02:12:45,248 --> 02:12:49,868
what it takes to work in this industry

2779
02:12:47,189 --> 02:12:52,780
but people think that they can show up

2780
02:12:49,868 --> 02:12:54,578
late and take a [ __ ] be twenty minutes

2781
02:12:52,779 --> 02:12:56,800
late and hang out I talk to people every

2782
02:12:54,578 --> 02:12:58,688
day that are shocked to learn it's like

2783
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:00,699
a real business yeah they think you

2784
02:12:58,689 --> 02:13:02,380
could just hang out smoke joints all day

2785
02:13:00,699 --> 02:13:05,380
[ __ ] off and they thought their high

2786
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:07,029
school weed dealer had a store now where

2787
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:09,819
he just kind of like hung out and played

2788
02:13:07,029 --> 02:13:11,289
Xbox in this totally data stable and

2789
02:13:09,819 --> 02:13:13,569
then you gave him money and it was weird

2790
02:13:11,289 --> 02:13:15,399
and then they'd leave they walk in and

2791
02:13:13,569 --> 02:13:18,219
they see what looks basically like an

2792
02:13:15,399 --> 02:13:20,289
Apple Store or a purse or shoe store in

2793
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:21,670

sale well that was in the very first

2824
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:37,869
days like even the doctors were at the

2825
02:14:34,359 --> 02:14:39,670
fringe of society because the DEA was

2826
02:14:37,869 --> 02:14:42,039
still threatening that if a doctor wrote

2827
02:14:39,670 --> 02:14:43,989
a recommendation for marijuana in

2828
02:14:42,039 --> 02:14:45,850
Colorado that they could lose their DEA

2829
02:14:43,989 --> 02:14:50,050
license to write prescriptions for

2830
02:14:45,850 --> 02:14:52,030
anything any other drug and so the

2831
02:14:50,050 --> 02:14:54,130
doctors that were like the first five

2832
02:14:52,029 --> 02:14:56,889
doctors in Colorado to sign paperwork

2833
02:14:54,130 --> 02:14:58,659
period were the kind of doctors were

2834
02:14:56,890 --> 02:15:00,520
like if you were there because you fell

2835
02:14:58,659 --> 02:15:03,369
on some and it went through like your

2836
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:05,050
forearm or your leg you start talking to

2837
02:15:03,369 --> 02:15:06,250
him and after 15 or some minutes or so

2838
02:15:05,050 --> 02:15:09,850

something that's not gonna kill me

2843
02:15:14,519 --> 02:15:19,590
immediately yeah but that changed six

2844
02:15:18,149 --> 02:15:21,808
months later when they stopped counting

2845
02:15:19,590 --> 02:15:24,929

2846

where I don't know how we made it for

2877
02:16:27,328 --> 02:16:35,638
clothes there were sometimes the numbers

2878
02:16:29,819 --> 02:16:37,109
were a little bit off so I'm pretty sure

2879
02:16:35,638 --> 02:16:38,459
there were some eat gram quarters going

2880
02:16:37,109 --> 02:16:40,649
out the door sometimes like there was a

2881
02:16:38,459 --> 02:16:42,898
window that we had to stay with in

2882
02:16:40,648 --> 02:16:44,670
between and we just kind of kept it from

2883
02:16:42,898 --> 02:16:46,899
going too far outside of that little box

2884
02:16:44,670 --> 02:16:48,710
add it to Karen and her homemade edibles

02:16:58,049 --> 02:17:01,349
like ladies

2888
02:16:59,159 --> 02:17:03,119
I remember walk three flights of stairs

2889
02:17:01,349 --> 02:17:05,159
and ridiculous heat because it got

2890
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:06,840
really hot in that building and I did

2891
02:17:05,159 --> 02:17:08,279
get to the third floor knowing that that

2892
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:11,429
was where I needed to go and have no

2893
02:17:08,279 --> 02:17:13,409
idea why was I get half way back

2894
02:17:11,429 --> 02:17:15,329
downstairs before I remembered whatever

2895
02:17:13,409 --> 02:17:18,148
it was I went up for that place was fun

2896
02:17:15,329 --> 02:17:21,029
speaking of edibles I'm pretty sure I

2897
02:17:18,148 --> 02:17:22,579
mentioned eating a 1000 milligram gosh

2898
02:17:21,029 --> 02:17:25,340
excuse me for that a 1000

2899
02:17:22,579 --> 02:17:26,870
folks guys I don't recommend it don't

2900
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:28,340
eat a thousand milligram animal unless

2901
02:17:26,870 --> 02:17:29,960
you want to be [ __ ] up for a day and a

2902
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:32,389
half if you're not me probably three

2903
02:17:29,959 --> 02:17:48,289
days I feel like a civilian if you gave

2904
02:17:32,388 --> 02:17:50,569
that novice gobble that sucker up six

2905
02:17:48,290 --> 02:17:52,820
eight hours is what people report it's

2906
02:17:50,569 --> 02:17:56,959
just you ate the hundred milligram just

2907
02:17:52,819 --> 02:17:58,729
talking about a 1000 honest I haven't

2908
02:17:56,959 --> 02:18:00,348
been a big gun Scheiber I haven't eaten

2909
02:17:58,729 --> 02:18:02,599
inedible since then I've been a little

2910
02:18:00,349 --> 02:18:04,489
bit happy I did it to myself the other

2911
02:18:02,599 --> 02:18:07,280
day it wasn't even with a really big

2912
02:18:04,489 --> 02:18:08,809
dose I just I popped a couple I thought

2913
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:10,960
I'd be comfortable with it we got to the

2914
02:18:08,809 --> 02:18:13,579
movie theater I looked up it was just

2915
02:18:10,959 --> 02:18:15,559
there were so many food choices and

2916
02:18:13,579 --> 02:18:18,829
before I could figure out what I wanted

2917
02:18:15,559 --> 02:18:20,299
I heard my wife giggling next to me but

2918
02:18:18,829 --> 02:18:23,659
she knows when I look up but I'm just

2919
02:18:20,299 --> 02:18:25,279
too big to pick from the menu and I

2920
02:18:23,659 --> 02:18:31,610
didn't mean to do it it was an accident

2921
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:34,280
so what happens to the pros to ya on my

2922

system it [ __ ] me up my whole body

2923
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:38,030
felt weird for a day and a half people

2924
02:18:36,110 --> 02:18:40,730
assumed that that's like the comfortable

2925
02:18:38,030 --> 02:18:42,560
intro to some marijuana consumption and

2926
02:18:40,729 --> 02:18:45,439
it's not like smokings the the

2927
02:18:42,559 --> 02:18:47,359
time-tested flowers through a pipe so

2928
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:49,909
explorers through a bong or a joint get

2929
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:51,710
used to that take a DAB one day you know

2930
02:18:49,909 --> 02:18:53,899
like three dads in one day and then

2931
02:18:51,709 --> 02:18:56,289
start taking big dabs and then dab every

2932
02:18:53,899 --> 02:19:02,959
day and then eat some edibles

his podcast you guys so uh Jesse is kind

3054
02:28:23,309 --> 02:28:26,129
of an outdoor grill expert he's been on

3055
02:28:24,779 --> 02:28:28,890
the show several times he people listen

3056
02:28:26,129 --> 02:28:31,259
she knows a lot about outdoor growing I

3057
02:28:28,889 --> 02:28:34,079
know a lot about indoor growing so we

3058
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:36,000
had some outdoor questions Jesse wants

3059
02:28:34,079 --> 02:28:38,879
to talk a little bit about the

3060
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:41,309
differences in small like basement

3061
02:28:38,879 --> 02:28:44,129
cultivation compared to large commercial

3062
02:28:41,309 --> 02:28:46,889
growth so we'll get into that also but

3063
02:28:44,129 --> 02:28:48,599
let's talk about an email I got an email

3064
02:28:46,889 --> 02:28:49,829
from a listener I don't have the email

3065
02:28:48,600 --> 02:28:51,390
on my phone right now I just set the

3066
02:28:49,829 --> 02:28:53,430
phone aside today but shout out to the

3067
02:28:51,389 --> 02:28:55,619
guy that sent me an email he asked when

3068
02:28:53,430 --> 02:28:58,380
he's growing outdoors how big of a hole

3069
02:28:55,620 --> 02:29:01,020
does he want to dig to put his plant I

3070
02:28:58,379 --> 02:29:02,398
told him through an email I told him to

3071
02:29:01,020 --> 02:29:04,140
listen to show and I'd have Jesse on

3072
02:29:02,398 --> 02:29:06,109
more info but I told them basically make

3073
02:29:04,139 --> 02:29:08,359
the hole as big as you can

3074
02:29:06,110 --> 02:29:12,370
what else can you tell us about that yes

3075
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:16,521
I personally over the years I've noticed

3076
02:29:12,370 --> 02:29:17,900
offense somewhat limited especially when

3077
02:29:16,521 --> 02:29:20,290
it's in the ground by the size of this

3078
02:29:17,899 --> 02:29:20,289
container

3079
02:29:21,898 --> 02:29:27,898
the grounds each container put your hole

3080
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:29,939
has a treated soil in it the shoulders

3081
02:29:27,898 --> 02:29:33,778
of the plants are chemical too far past

3082
02:29:29,939 --> 02:29:36,270
to edge it at home I started off with

3083
02:29:33,779 --> 02:29:40,459
two by two poles and worked up to three

3084
02:29:36,270 --> 02:29:43,020
by three poles and now you for my coils

3085
02:29:40,459 --> 02:29:44,579
probably keep going someday five by five

3086
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:47,130
foot when you're doing these four by

3087
02:29:44,578 --> 02:29:50,068
four mold is it a four by four square

3088
02:29:47,129 --> 02:29:54,028
right won't be wide four feet long just

3089
02:29:50,068 --> 02:29:56,309
how deep you go 18 inches I used to go

3090
02:29:54,029 --> 02:29:59,279
deeper I've learned a little bit more

3091
02:29:56,309 --> 02:30:00,988
about music since - we canvassed am i

3092
02:29:59,279 --> 02:30:03,418
right in thinking that cannabis wants to

3093
02:30:00,988 --> 02:30:05,609
root outward instead of downward for the

3094
02:30:03,418 --> 02:30:10,248
most part okay I mean it does like to go

3095
02:30:05,609 --> 02:30:13,248
down especially for go go go go go hard

3096
02:30:10,248 --> 02:30:13,248
extraordinary

3097
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:17,930
but for the most part close

3098
02:30:15,489 --> 02:30:22,728
[Music]

3099
02:30:17,930 --> 02:30:25,729
reach out to the sides and stick a note

3100
02:30:22,728 --> 02:30:27,318
on that' free by stream by 18 inch of

3101
02:30:25,728 --> 02:30:30,319
both three foot by three foot hole

3102
02:30:27,318 --> 02:30:32,750
that's 18 inches deep

3103
02:30:30,319 --> 02:30:36,469
that is a lot of fans dirt you know I

3104
02:30:32,750 --> 02:30:38,299
mean cubic feet that is well we'd have

3105
02:30:36,469 --> 02:30:41,229
to do the math on the size of the whole

3106
02:30:38,299 --> 02:30:41,229
dish you just said right

3107
02:30:43,398 --> 02:30:48,828
the boy's neck is one of those Fox horn

3108
02:30:45,709 --> 02:30:49,850
bags is 1.75 cubic feet company those

3109
02:30:48,828 --> 02:30:56,308
bags you think we the take

3110
02:30:49,850 --> 02:30:56,309
[Music]

3111
02:30:56,549 --> 02:31:06,629
this is how growers think in math you

3112
02:30:58,709 --> 02:31:08,938
guys alright that's a lot of root space

3113
02:31:06,629 --> 02:31:10,559
yeah how big are these plants that in

3114
02:31:08,939 --> 02:31:13,889
your example how big are your plants at

3115
02:31:10,559 --> 02:31:16,590
the end of the season four or five foot

3116
02:31:13,889 --> 02:31:21,119
around I mean all the way around you

3117
02:31:16,590 --> 02:31:27,079
know not just through one spot so you

3118
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:29,430
can't hug your plants around yeah they I

3119
02:31:27,079 --> 02:31:30,659
kind of limit my plants they can only

3120
02:31:29,430 --> 02:31:34,109
get about six foot tall

3121
02:31:30,659 --> 02:31:37,170
if that if I was able to let him get

3122
02:31:34,109 --> 02:31:37,739
bigger they'd probably end up eight nine

3123
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:40,710
foot

3124
02:31:37,739 --> 02:31:43,799
okay so eliminated by privacy yes that's

3125
02:31:40,709 --> 02:31:46,409
a [ __ ] yes you do such a great outdoor

3126
02:31:43,799 --> 02:31:47,909
girl let me you as a [ __ ] I used to

3127
02:31:46,409 --> 02:31:51,200
fight it real hard to keep them down I

3128
02:31:47,909 --> 02:31:51,200
have learned a new trick

3129
02:31:57,799 --> 02:32:05,849
lazy tech win what are we are we in the

3130
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:11,100
flowering phase officially yet or do we

3131
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:13,200
still have a few days to go okay so

3132
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:15,030
about a week here in Colorado and we

3133
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:17,130
were doing research before the show from

3134
02:32:15,030 --> 02:32:20,550
coast to coast there's only about a half

3135
02:32:17,129 --> 02:32:21,839
hour in sunlight photo period in natural

3136
02:32:20,549 --> 02:32:24,978
photo period right now we're talking

3137
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:28,290
about it jesse was doing the research in

3138
02:32:24,978 --> 02:32:30,299
difference between what I was finding it

3139
02:32:28,290 --> 02:32:33,689
was like New York the Sun was coming up

3140
02:32:30,299 --> 02:32:35,938
at 5:30 9:00 in the morning and in Los

3141
02:32:33,689 --> 02:32:42,210
Angeles it was coming up at like six oh

3142
02:32:35,939 --> 02:32:47,280
eight or some [ __ ] so that's odd but

3143
02:32:42,209 --> 02:32:50,909
yeah so but of photoperiod you know it's

3144
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:53,670
it's gonna start really shrinking from

3145
02:32:50,909 --> 02:32:54,840
here on out and you know the first

3146
02:32:53,670 --> 02:32:56,939
you're gonna get your indica varieties

3147
02:32:54,840 --> 02:33:00,389
into flower and then you're more sativa

3148
02:32:56,939 --> 02:33:02,189
varieties yeah your flow and blueberry

3149
02:33:00,389 --> 02:33:05,639
those are really gonna start taking off

3150
02:33:02,189 --> 02:33:07,229
right when in Colorado the gross blow

3151
02:33:05,639 --> 02:33:08,459
that [ __ ] is gonna go into flower real

3152
02:33:07,228 --> 02:33:10,559
hard here in about a week

3153
02:33:08,459 --> 02:33:12,299
in days she'll be spitting out calyxes

3154
02:33:10,559 --> 02:33:14,539
real soon for you you'll love it you'll

3155
02:33:12,299 --> 02:33:15,929
see pistols in like 20 days I bet yeah

3156
02:33:14,540 --> 02:33:17,700
all right

3157
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:21,420
plant later is such a ridiculous

3158
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:25,260
solution for you yeah all right that's

3159
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:29,489
been my Michael lately it's just KSS

3160
02:33:25,260 --> 02:33:30,540
keep it simple stoner yeah your plant

3161
02:33:29,489 --> 02:33:31,829
sorry I keep putting the throat guys

3162
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:33,720
we're taking some dads let's talk about

3163
02:33:31,829 --> 02:33:36,360
these dabs for a brief second I was

3164
02:33:33,719 --> 02:33:40,739
dunking my dabber into ninety percent

3165
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:43,229
THC this is 91% THC it's distillate from

3166
02:33:40,739 --> 02:33:45,209
our friends at Evo lab and then I take

3167
02:33:43,228 --> 02:33:48,599
the 90% distillate that's on my dabber

3168
02:33:45,209 --> 02:33:51,329
and I duck that into pure terpenoids of

3169
02:33:48,600 --> 02:33:54,059
ghost train haze also made by our

3170
02:33:51,329 --> 02:33:55,379
friends at Evo labs this is amazing you

3171
02:33:54,059 --> 02:33:57,180
guys is one of the best highs you can

3172
02:33:55,379 --> 02:34:00,839
get the first couple of times I smoked

3173
02:33:57,180 --> 02:34:02,850
this I got stupid high I was just goofy

3174
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:04,260
I tried to go back to work and I pretty

3175
02:34:02,850 --> 02:34:13,559
much just ended up doing stuff on there

3176
02:34:04,260 --> 02:34:15,180
for the next hour a little bit clogged I

3177
02:34:13,559 --> 02:34:20,069
do apologize for being so congested

3178
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:22,050
today yeah yeah that's delicious isn't

3179
02:34:20,069 --> 02:34:24,270
it I've got a g-ghost train our ghost

3180
02:34:22,049 --> 02:34:26,670
train Hayes Terps and OG Kush chirps and

3181
02:34:24,270 --> 02:34:30,060
then a couple nights ago I took some of

3182
02:34:26,670 --> 02:34:32,520
this 120 micron blue sure fresh frozen

3183
02:34:30,059 --> 02:34:34,609
saw melis hash and I rolled out a little

3184
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:38,010
piece into a taco shell and I put some

3185
02:34:34,610 --> 02:34:40,020
what did I have it was cactus cooler

3186
02:34:38,010 --> 02:34:41,460
Alive resin on top of that I smeared

3187
02:34:40,020 --> 02:34:43,290
that on like taco sauce and then I took

3188
02:34:41,459 --> 02:34:44,609
a piece of Durban hoisin put Durban

3189
02:34:43,290 --> 02:34:45,930
poison shatter and rolled it into a

3190
02:34:44,610 --> 02:34:48,600
little snake and put that in the middle

3191
02:34:45,930 --> 02:34:50,489
like some taco meat and then I put I

3192
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:53,520
ducked to the dabber into the ninety

3193
02:34:50,489 --> 02:34:55,440
percent THC distillate and had that on

3194
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:57,270
the dabber and then I picked up the taco

3195
02:34:55,440 --> 02:34:59,780
with the dabber and dunked that into the

3196
02:34:57,270 --> 02:35:05,670
ghost train haze turps

3197
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:13,350
I was blast-off I was rocket yeah my to

3198
02:35:05,670 --> 02:35:14,780
put a little making funny faces and

3199
02:35:13,350 --> 02:35:19,181
funny noises I was really

3200
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:23,739
for a little while my first turk dab my

3201
02:35:19,181 --> 02:35:26,000
arms and legs with very pleasantly numb

3202
02:35:23,739 --> 02:35:28,879
almost immediately yeah there's

3203
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:31,459
something about smoking just raw yeah

3204
02:35:28,879 --> 02:35:34,220
I immediately I was like damn there's

3205
02:35:31,459 --> 02:35:36,020
this is medicine there for someone

3206
02:35:34,220 --> 02:35:38,119
someone heated for me it's great

3207
02:35:36,021 --> 02:35:41,450
recreation but for someone somewhere

3208
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:42,829
that that's something I like to take

3209
02:35:41,450 --> 02:35:44,540
just the normal shatter I've got I've

3210
02:35:42,829 --> 02:35:45,920
got this Durbin poison mob-boss shatter

3211
02:35:44,540 --> 02:35:54,110
and I just take little chunks of that

3212
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:55,549
and dunk that into the this is gone I

3213
02:35:54,110 --> 02:35:57,261
don't know if I'm gonna be able to

3214
02:35:55,549 --> 02:35:59,119
properly get high anymore because if

3215
02:35:57,261 --> 02:36:01,819
it's smoking distillate and these Terps

3216
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:03,471
leave it my tolerance game is upped

3217
02:36:01,819 --> 02:36:05,060
itself when I go smoke with other people

3218
02:36:03,470 --> 02:36:06,319
they're just like dude what the [ __ ] is

3219
02:36:05,060 --> 02:36:11,899
wrong with you and don't you want more

3220
02:36:06,319 --> 02:36:15,739
dabs and they're in the corner one more

3221
02:36:11,899 --> 02:36:17,840
quick question that come on pink the

3222
02:36:15,739 --> 02:36:20,390
Terps I mean I think I already know the

3223
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:23,630
answer to this but I'll just ask do the

3224
02:36:20,390 --> 02:36:25,250
Terps complete if you dip it in just

3225
02:36:23,629 --> 02:36:27,799
like a normal shatter do the Terps

3226
02:36:25,250 --> 02:36:30,110
complete something there or make it more

3227
02:36:27,799 --> 02:36:31,729
powerful meet opinion it pushes it yeah

3228
02:36:30,110 --> 02:36:33,920
it pushes the high a little bit higher

3229
02:36:31,729 --> 02:36:37,129
it certainly pushes the high up

3230
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:39,710
I think the my theory is probably not

3231
02:36:37,129 --> 02:36:41,930
such a theory but terpenoids

3232
02:36:39,709 --> 02:36:47,439
work along with the cannabinoids just

3233
02:36:41,931 --> 02:36:47,440
like the the entourage effect absolutely

3234
02:36:47,530 --> 02:36:53,210
terpenoids that we're using guys that

3235
02:36:49,761 --> 02:36:55,729
looks just like it looks like pee it's

3236
02:36:53,209 --> 02:36:57,979
just little here drops a gold in a vial

3237
02:36:55,729 --> 02:37:02,149
it's got the consistency of like a

3238
02:36:57,979 --> 02:37:05,000
really high grade like a machine oil or

3239
02:37:02,149 --> 02:37:06,560
something okay really runny olive oil a

3240
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:08,810
little little runny er than olive oil

3241
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:09,890
maybe and you just dunk the dab right

3242
02:37:08,810 --> 02:37:11,420
into it is what I've been doing -

3243
02:37:09,890 --> 02:37:13,970
putting been putting a dab on the dabber

3244
02:37:11,420 --> 02:37:16,220
and just dunk it and I did I don't get

3245
02:37:13,970 --> 02:37:17,600
too hard one time I just don't do dinner

3246
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:19,640
and gave it a little swizzle and when it

3247
02:37:17,601 --> 02:37:24,110
hit the veil I heard that the Terps

3248
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:26,239
could like sizzle and I had turf face

3249
02:37:24,110 --> 02:37:27,471
like my house just tasted like ghost

3250
02:37:26,239 --> 02:37:29,271
rain haze forever

3251
02:37:27,470 --> 02:37:31,459
it was almost unpleasant it was like IO

3252
02:37:29,271 --> 02:37:34,040
deed my face on turps but then I was

3253
02:37:31,459 --> 02:37:36,920
rocket high that's something I'll say it

3254
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:39,591
kind of you can almost wash away the

3255
02:37:36,921 --> 02:37:41,360
flavor with with to it like it's so

3256
02:37:39,591 --> 02:37:43,489
overwhelming you don't even get it you

3257
02:37:41,360 --> 02:37:44,690
just burn yeah you maximum overload your

3258
02:37:43,489 --> 02:37:46,789
mouth and it's like I can't taste

3259
02:37:44,690 --> 02:37:48,530
anything cuz you just ruined my palate

3260
02:37:46,790 --> 02:37:50,271
yeah it's like we need something too

3261
02:37:48,530 --> 02:37:51,159
spicy for the next hour everything just

3262
02:37:50,271 --> 02:37:53,360
tastes spicy

3263
02:37:51,159 --> 02:37:56,030
alright so to our friend that send us an

3264
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:57,500

put some amendments in there um let's

3271
02:38:05,601 --> 02:38:09,710

alright pretty much there we go you guys

3278
02:38:23,780 --> 02:38:27,351
I hope you wrote that down if not hit

3279
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:28,279
that little 15-second back button twice

3280
02:38:27,351 --> 02:38:30,079
and hit it again

3281
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:31,730
write it down put that stuff in that big

3282
02:38:30,079 --> 02:38:44,511
hole with your soil they put some

3283
02:38:31,729 --> 02:38:45,680
perlite in there yeah some sort of

3284
02:38:44,511 --> 02:38:46,851
drainage want to get some oxygen in

3285
02:38:45,681 --> 02:38:49,390
there but you don't want to take up too

3286
02:38:46,851 --> 02:38:52,671
much root space with a bunch of rock

3287
02:38:49,390 --> 02:38:55,279
perlite so figure out your mix outdoor

3288
02:38:52,671 --> 02:38:58,899
soil doesn't need to be as area's indoor

3289
02:38:55,280 --> 02:39:04,159
soil especially in the ground so you can

3290
02:38:58,899 --> 02:39:05,569
do yourself a great disservice by

3291
02:39:04,159 --> 02:39:07,729
putting too much more light in there

3292
02:39:05,569 --> 02:39:10,130
it's just it's gonna increase the

3293
02:39:07,729 --> 02:39:11,810
frequency of a flute of water okay let's

3294
02:39:10,130 --> 02:39:14,750
see that's why you're the outdoor prone

3295
02:39:11,810 --> 02:39:16,159

02:39:23,959 --> 02:39:29,300
huge huge difference at the end of the

3302
02:39:26,479 --> 02:39:31,130
season laughs it's totally totally worth

3303

3305
02:39:32,421 --> 02:39:36,620

tape at it next time I also love picking

3313
02:39:50,261 --> 02:39:54,521
on you look you're doing well so Fred

3314
02:39:52,331 --> 02:39:57,310
sent us a message while back he was

3315
02:39:54,521 --> 02:39:59,141
making seeded plants he had Paul and he

3316
02:39:57,310 --> 02:40:00,610
put pollen on female plants those plants

3317
02:39:59,140 --> 02:40:03,841
have now been pollinated they're forming

3318
02:40:00,611 --> 02:40:06,070
seeds he put them outdoors

3319
02:40:03,841 --> 02:40:07,931
he had many questions about putting

3320
02:40:06,070 --> 02:40:10,479
putting them outdoors about acclimating

3321
02:40:07,931 --> 02:40:13,781
them to the outdoor area and how to get

3322
02:40:10,479 --> 02:40:15,421
this timer right once I message Jessie

3323
02:40:13,781 --> 02:40:17,740
about this Jessie had a great idea

3324
02:40:15,421 --> 02:40:19,751
Jessie said that once you once those

3325
02:40:17,740 --> 02:40:22,031
plants are pollinated if you go put them

3326
02:40:19,751 --> 02:40:24,341
outside and the light cycles a little

3327
02:40:22,031 --> 02:40:25,661
bit off they're not going to her because

3328
02:40:24,341 --> 02:40:29,140
they're already pollinated they've

3329
02:40:25,661 --> 02:40:30,640
pretty much passed there I guess if they

3330
02:40:29,140 --> 02:40:32,350
were humans now they would be in

3331
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:33,911
menopause if they were females and now

3332
02:40:32,351 --> 02:40:35,980
they can't there pass to that cycle

3333
02:40:33,911 --> 02:40:37,210
their whole sexual reproductive thing is

3334
02:40:35,979 --> 02:40:39,671
done they've already decided they're

3335
02:40:37,210 --> 02:40:44,290
making seeds they have a manifest

3336
02:40:39,671 --> 02:40:46,181
destiny girls pregnant you can't already

3337
02:40:44,290 --> 02:40:48,340
get her pregnant you can't really like

3338
02:40:46,181 --> 02:40:49,570
so that that's those plants that we told

3339
02:40:48,341 --> 02:40:51,371
Fred to put outside should be a hundred

outdoor outdoors they're knocking a

3368
02:42:05,969 --> 02:42:10,920
hermaphrodite on him he's gonna have

3369
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:12,840
viable seeds if he waits long enough yep

3370
02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:14,460
yep I think he was he actually pulled

3371
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:16,350
some of those seeds I think I think he's

3372
02:42:14,459 --> 02:42:19,259
got some of those a lot of them were

3373
02:42:16,350 --> 02:42:21,030
white but plenty of them were viable and

3374
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:22,590
tiger stripes so it's good work bro do

3375
02:42:21,030 --> 02:42:24,630
you know what the cross was I can't I

3376
02:42:22,590 --> 02:42:26,520
really don't remember I don't remember

3377
02:42:24,629 --> 02:42:28,409
honestly I read so many emails and read

3378
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:31,319
so many crosses that a lot of that share

3379
02:42:28,409 --> 02:42:32,549
a lot of the crosses in the green and

3380
02:42:31,319 --> 02:42:34,039
healthy wellness garden I can't remember

3381
02:42:32,549 --> 02:42:40,340
what they are off the top of my head

3382
02:42:34,040 --> 02:42:44,189
yeah I learned a few I remember that all

3383
02:42:40,340 --> 02:42:46,409
right so he's they've got seeds in him

3384
02:42:44,189 --> 02:42:49,590
and since then as [ __ ] got attacked by

3385
02:42:46,409 --> 02:42:50,549
spider mites and he asked is I don't

3386
02:42:49,590 --> 02:42:51,989
have his email in front of me but

3387
02:42:50,549 --> 02:42:53,429
basically he said none of this plant

3388
02:42:51,989 --> 02:42:55,409
material is going to be consumed or

3389
02:42:53,430 --> 02:42:58,860
smoked by people since it's all just

3390
02:42:55,409 --> 02:43:04,889
seeded how nuclear can I go to spray the

3391
02:42:58,860 --> 02:43:06,829
[ __ ] out of it for these spider mites my

3392
02:43:04,889 --> 02:43:10,670
opinion would be as nuclear is

3393
02:43:06,829 --> 02:43:13,590
comfortable that's what I told him I

3394
02:43:10,670 --> 02:43:15,059
told him keep in mind his health while

3395
02:43:13,590 --> 02:43:16,350
he's applying pesticides and keep in

3396
02:43:15,059 --> 02:43:17,699
mind the health of the rest of his

3397
02:43:16,350 --> 02:43:19,229
garden because I know he's got other

3398
02:43:17,700 --> 02:43:22,920
cannabis plants out there and the

3399
02:43:19,228 --> 02:43:25,819
insects in that garden absolutely of

3400
02:43:22,920 --> 02:43:28,439
that area yeah be be aware of that bees

3401
02:43:25,819 --> 02:43:30,119
don't kill the bees that's super

3402
02:43:28,439 --> 02:43:31,409
important if the bees go away everything

3403
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:33,510
goes away we don't have food if we don't

3404
02:43:31,409 --> 02:43:35,189
have bees I saw my dad's neighbor spray

3405
02:43:33,510 --> 02:43:37,020
and roundup in his yard the other day

3406
02:43:35,189 --> 02:43:39,420
how can chase that [ __ ] down I was

3407
02:43:37,020 --> 02:43:40,690
like no I was like see those three light

3408
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:43,569
boxes over there

3409
02:43:40,690 --> 02:43:44,409
and instantly he was like oh man I'm so

3410
02:43:43,569 --> 02:43:46,840
sorry

3411
02:43:44,409 --> 02:43:49,360
we got him set up with some Epsom salt

3412
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:50,890
and vinegar there you go go organic yeah

3413
02:43:49,360 --> 02:43:53,021
yeah that'll get rid of almost any

3414
02:43:50,890 --> 02:43:55,659
insect it's you don't want around yeah

3415
02:43:53,021 --> 02:43:57,430
several several tablespoons of Epsom

3416
02:43:55,659 --> 02:44:00,640
salt per gallon can I ask you about how

3417
02:43:57,430 --> 02:44:03,220
to get rid of [ __ ] grasshoppers right

3418
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:05,859
now in a ganja garden outdoors yeah that

3419
02:44:03,219 --> 02:44:07,209
is a very popular question lately yeah

3420
02:44:05,860 --> 02:44:13,319
they're super heavy everywhere this year

3421
02:44:07,209 --> 02:44:16,329
I my wife Bernadette my life my life my

3422
02:44:13,319 --> 02:44:17,140
beautiful life she has a list of

3423
02:44:16,329 --> 02:44:20,640
pesticides

3424
02:44:17,140 --> 02:44:23,979
I cannot require or recall any of them

3425
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:26,049
and none of them knowing the way they

3426
02:44:23,979 --> 02:44:29,109
work and how grasshoppers work I felt

3427
02:44:26,049 --> 02:44:31,149
really weren't necessary I didn't I

3428
02:44:29,110 --> 02:44:32,680
didn't feel like he may kill one or two

3429
02:44:31,149 --> 02:44:36,159
grasshoppers with it or you may

3430
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:39,460
discourage one or two but it's so my big

3431
02:44:36,159 --> 02:44:41,351
thing mow the weeds around your area

3432
02:44:39,459 --> 02:44:44,439
that's one of the biggest ones that take

3433
02:44:41,351 --> 02:44:48,400
away their food supply okay but lastest

3434
02:44:44,440 --> 02:44:49,870
traps which is a mason jar that is a

3435
02:44:48,399 --> 02:44:52,049
quarter of the way filled with water a

3436
02:44:49,870 --> 02:44:56,141
quarter of the way filled with molasses

3437
02:44:52,049 --> 02:44:59,140
buried to the rim around the plants I

3438
02:44:56,140 --> 02:45:01,090
know it's kind of arcade you know really

3439
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:02,829
simple here it's a built in the moat but

3440
02:45:01,090 --> 02:45:04,479
yeah that's they fall in it and they

3441
02:45:02,829 --> 02:45:05,500
can't get up alright so that makes total

3442
02:45:04,479 --> 02:45:08,260
sense

3443
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:11,560
try to attract Blue Jays and Robin's to

3444
02:45:08,260 --> 02:45:13,690
your girl Robins I don't know how to

3445
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:17,560
attract Blue Jays I know really like

3446
02:45:13,690 --> 02:45:20,710
peanuts there you go gonna show up if we

3447
02:45:17,560 --> 02:45:24,640
throw our peanuts that gonna bring

3448
02:45:20,709 --> 02:45:26,259
rabbits I suppose so possibly can see my

3449
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:29,260
first idea I told my friend to put a

3450
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:32,620
chicken in his yard is that gonna bring

3451
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:34,930
me more problems in the beginning stages

3452
02:45:32,620 --> 02:45:37,660
chickens love grasshoppers they also

3453
02:45:34,930 --> 02:45:39,670
have juvenile marijuana plants okay once

3454
02:45:37,659 --> 02:45:42,940
you've got a four or five foot tall Bush

3455
02:45:39,670 --> 02:45:45,190
the chick is gonna use it a shade and

3456
02:45:42,940 --> 02:45:46,840
really is it gonna notice it too much it

3457
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:47,230
might pick it the understory a little

3458
02:45:46,840 --> 02:46:17,969
bit

3459
02:45:47,229 --> 02:46:17,969
okay let's yeah for Cox Tree Service

3460
02:46:21,601 --> 02:46:27,790
blame it on the Terps hashtag blame it

3461
02:46:24,430 --> 02:46:30,420
on the Terps there we go yeah shout out

3462
02:46:27,790 --> 02:46:33,130
to the Terps one other comment on

3463
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:36,310
grasshoppers I'm hippie dippie when it

3464
02:46:33,129 --> 02:46:38,949
comes to growing outdoors as soon as I

3465
02:46:36,310 --> 02:46:41,069
hear about a grasshopper problem I feel

3466
02:46:38,950 --> 02:46:43,870
like something's out of balance so

3467
02:46:41,069 --> 02:46:45,629
instead of killing the grasshopper you

3468
02:46:43,870 --> 02:46:48,070
might want to look at the bigger picture

3469
02:46:45,629 --> 02:46:50,229
it's always seeing something's missing

3470
02:46:48,069 --> 02:46:52,750
there that's you're doing something

3471
02:46:50,229 --> 02:46:55,600
wrong so I'm gonna say that's like 75%

3472
02:46:52,750 --> 02:46:56,950
of the time that is a catcher it really

3473
02:46:55,601 --> 02:46:59,141
I feel like this applies to smaller

3474
02:46:56,950 --> 02:47:00,760
girls like those guys out on Salem Road

3475
02:46:59,140 --> 02:47:04,690
where they've got four acres planted in

3476
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:06,280
the ground I mean that's a completely

3477
02:47:04,690 --> 02:47:08,649
different scenario they're gonna have

3478
02:47:06,280 --> 02:47:10,690
those issues regardless that's a lot of

3479
02:47:08,649 --> 02:47:12,600
damn cannabis yeah went out and drove

3480
02:47:10,690 --> 02:47:15,610
and looked at it today they did it's

3481
02:47:12,601 --> 02:47:18,159
[ __ ] huge Siloam Road I like near

3482
02:47:15,610 --> 02:47:19,840
Beulah yeah okay take a drive out there

3483
02:47:18,159 --> 02:47:22,629
it's called the Green Mile for reason

3484
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:24,969
yes do huge things everyone talks [ __ ]

3485
02:47:22,629 --> 02:47:26,949
about Pueblo Colorado but everywhere

3486
02:47:24,969 --> 02:47:29,140
around this is green houses and outdoor

3487
02:47:26,950 --> 02:47:31,271
grows and just acres and acres of hemp

3488
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:33,010
and acres and acres of cannabis it's

3489
02:47:31,271 --> 02:47:40,239
everywhere it's so rad right now drive

3490
02:47:33,010 --> 02:47:41,351
out there 50 we need more more I don't

3491
02:47:40,239 --> 02:47:43,930
know that there's a technical term for

3492
02:47:41,351 --> 02:47:46,120
these restaurants fast casual I think

3493
02:47:43,930 --> 02:47:47,800
more fast casual restaurants because

3494
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:49,120
that's what the grow industry and people

3495
02:47:47,799 --> 02:47:51,550
like us that's what we crave we don't

3496
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:53,440
want the Taco Bell the dr. pepper I hate

3497
02:47:51,550 --> 02:47:56,350
what you got there's that Sonic yeah

3498
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:58,271
yeah kind of stuff it's it's DS I don't

3499
02:47:56,351 --> 02:47:59,530
there's nothing at Sonic for me yeah

3500
02:47:58,271 --> 02:48:01,329
honestly there's nothing there

3501
02:47:59,530 --> 02:48:04,261
McDonald's offers nothing for probably

3502
02:48:01,329 --> 02:48:06,671
don't eat it mini fast food places

3503
02:48:04,261 --> 02:48:09,190
sometimes Jimmy John's if that's even

3504
02:48:06,671 --> 02:48:10,931
though you know Qdoba and Chipotle

3505
02:48:09,190 --> 02:48:12,640
because he can get a veggie burrito

3506
02:48:10,931 --> 02:48:16,051
there that's pretty much the options the

3507
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:16,050
beans at both those places taste like

3508
02:48:16,739 --> 02:48:21,521
even vegetarians course vegetarians know

3509
02:48:19,931 --> 02:48:23,530
what's up with a good batch of beans oh

3510
02:48:21,521 --> 02:48:25,931

smell a good if you can tell good Beach

3514
02:48:31,511 --> 02:48:57,341

3515
02:48:49,950 --> 02:48:59,820
Tokyo Joe's yeah all kinds of free

3516
02:48:57,341 --> 02:49:06,700
advertising for a bunch of shitty rescue

3517
02:48:59,819 --> 02:49:08,440
tomato juice can I eat there it sounds

3518
02:49:06,700 --> 02:49:12,190
like a place I could eat they do have a

3519
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:14,409
veggie I'm sure sandwich for sure it's

3520
02:49:12,190 --> 02:49:21,690
just uh your mic is totally getting away

3521
02:49:14,409 --> 02:49:24,190
from you Rockstar yeah yeah we don't

3522
02:49:21,690 --> 02:49:25,870
limp on you yeah they got a couple of

3523
02:49:24,190 --> 02:49:28,511
veggie sandwiches just a little

3524
02:49:25,870 --> 02:49:31,900
mom-and-pop hole in the wall it's right

3525
02:49:28,511 --> 02:49:33,700
by the library the best alright let's

3526
02:49:31,899 --> 02:49:35,319
put this trainwreck back on on a bond

3527
02:49:33,700 --> 02:49:36,700
some rails here let's talk about

3528
02:49:35,319 --> 02:49:40,050
cannabis growing this is not the

3529
02:49:36,700 --> 02:49:42,671
Colorado podcast we did not bring 44

3530
02:49:40,050 --> 02:49:47,369
sandwiches Sam who couldn't read 44 he's

3531
02:49:42,671 --> 02:49:52,091
not allowed to go anywhere this is that

3532
02:49:47,370 --> 02:49:54,700
no poor dude we can't wait to play again

3533
02:49:52,091 --> 02:49:56,140
so Jesse wanted to talk about something

3534
02:49:54,700 --> 02:49:57,641
that I find to be really important that

3535
02:49:56,140 --> 02:49:59,109
people don't realize people want to jump

3536
02:49:57,640 --> 02:50:01,449
into the cannabis industry people move

3537
02:49:59,110 --> 02:50:04,251
from all over the country to Colorado to

3538
02:50:01,450 --> 02:50:05,661
Washington to California to Oregon to

3539
02:50:04,251 --> 02:50:07,521
and all these places that were cannabis

3540
02:50:05,661 --> 02:50:09,560
growing is legal and they show up here

3541
02:50:07,521 --> 02:50:10,940
and they've either grown in their

3542
02:50:09,560 --> 02:50:11,989
basement in an illegal state for a

3543
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:13,940
couple of years and had two or three

3544
02:50:11,989 --> 02:50:15,591
lights or they set up a small grow here

3545
02:50:13,940 --> 02:50:17,810
their garage or their basement they run

3546
02:50:15,591 --> 02:50:20,239
four or six lights and then they think

3547
02:50:17,810 --> 02:50:21,770
I'm gonna open a big-ass grow and

3548
02:50:20,239 --> 02:50:23,601
they're either gonna do it legally or

3549
02:50:21,771 --> 02:50:25,341
illegally they're gonna get permits or

3550
02:50:23,601 --> 02:50:26,569
not or maybe they're just gonna do this

3551
02:50:25,341 --> 02:50:27,979
in an illegal place they've been grown

3552
02:50:26,569 --> 02:50:29,511
in their basement for a while they're

3553
02:50:27,979 --> 02:50:31,279
out there in the sticks in Nebraska and

3554
02:50:29,511 --> 02:50:36,560
I [ __ ] we're gonna buy that old meat

3555
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:39,021
plant we're gonna hang us a mistake that

3556
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:40,431
a lot of these people [ __ ] up is they

3557
02:50:39,021 --> 02:50:42,921
don't realize that going from the

3558
02:50:40,431 --> 02:50:44,989
basement to a large grow facility it's

3559
02:50:42,921 --> 02:50:46,431
not just taking this much air

3560
02:50:44,989 --> 02:50:48,261
conditioning and multiplying it times

3561
02:50:46,431 --> 02:50:50,301
however more many lights you're gonna

3562
02:50:48,261 --> 02:50:52,701
work it doesn't work that way you run

3563
02:50:50,300 --> 02:50:54,020
into a whole new [ __ ] Stewart problems

3564
02:50:52,700 --> 02:50:57,080
when you start going to big scale

3565
02:50:54,021 --> 02:50:59,271
growing a humidity is ridiculously hard

3566
02:50:57,081 --> 02:51:04,701
to control in a large room retardedly

3567
02:50:59,271 --> 02:51:11,841
yeah you can you can see that it bugs me

3568
02:51:04,700 --> 02:51:13,460
a little bit it's hard as [ __ ] to remove

3569
02:51:11,841 --> 02:51:15,351
a lot of humidity in a very large room

3570
02:51:13,460 --> 02:51:17,001
it's also hard to regulate the

3571
02:51:15,351 --> 02:51:21,171
temperature and the airflow and the co2

3572
02:51:17,001 --> 02:51:22,671
so there's a lot of tricks to it what's

3573
02:51:21,171 --> 02:51:24,890
the biggest mistake you see people make

3574
02:51:22,671 --> 02:51:26,601
when they go from what a dude goes and

3575
02:51:24,890 --> 02:51:29,001
just builds his first big when new

3576
02:51:26,601 --> 02:51:30,440
people get their OPC license and they

3577
02:51:29,001 --> 02:51:34,341
can build a grow where do they [ __ ] up

3578
02:51:30,440 --> 02:51:36,501
air conditioning always humidity never

3579
02:51:34,341 --> 02:51:38,690
even gets considered cuz yeah they think

3580
02:51:36,501 --> 02:51:40,280
this is the desert I mean it is the

3581
02:51:38,690 --> 02:51:41,569
desert but they think it's not gonna be

3582
02:51:40,280 --> 02:51:42,980
an issue because it's so dry you're

3583
02:51:41,569 --> 02:51:44,630
right that's a bunch of BS

3584
02:51:42,979 --> 02:51:46,609
you're gonna go pumping water into those

3585
02:51:44,630 --> 02:51:48,501
plants every single day and they

3586
02:51:46,610 --> 02:51:50,271
transpire and there are a thousand watt

3587
02:51:48,501 --> 02:51:52,341
lights a bunch of them right above those

3588
02:51:50,271 --> 02:51:54,171
plants and the water wants to come out

3589
02:51:52,341 --> 02:51:55,761
and go up toward those lights and then

3590
02:51:54,171 --> 02:51:58,041
it things out by the ceiling and then it

3591
02:51:55,761 --> 02:51:59,720
falls back down and then it hangs out

3592
02:51:58,040 --> 02:52:01,460
and it gets between two leaves and it

3593
02:51:59,720 --> 02:52:03,620
festers for a couple of days and then

3594
02:52:01,460 --> 02:52:06,290
you know what it does it turns into

3595
02:52:03,620 --> 02:52:09,050
[ __ ] powdery mildew yep so that's

3596
02:52:06,290 --> 02:52:10,760
spores are there yep there's just

3597
02:52:09,050 --> 02:52:12,921
waiting for you to give it a pride

3598
02:52:10,761 --> 02:52:14,381
tradition yeah that whole grow room is

3599
02:52:12,921 --> 02:52:18,370
the perfect condition for

3600
02:52:14,380 --> 02:52:20,050
bugs and [ __ ] funguses and problems

3601
02:52:18,370 --> 02:52:21,971
so you bear conditioning in the humidity

3602
02:52:20,050 --> 02:52:24,790
are always definitely the first thing

3603
02:52:21,970 --> 02:52:27,369
that I think of yeah it's a big-girl

3604
02:52:24,790 --> 02:52:29,619
room is a it's a living organism that is

3605
02:52:27,370 --> 02:52:31,061
full of lots of other smaller like

3606
02:52:29,620 --> 02:52:34,181
living organisms

3607
02:52:31,060 --> 02:52:37,449
it was explaining it to a buddy this way

3608
02:52:34,181 --> 02:52:40,211
earlier today and it itself has special

3609
02:52:37,450 --> 02:52:43,659
care that needs done to it not just the

3610
02:52:40,210 --> 02:52:44,279
plants inside of it it's there's a lot

3611
02:52:43,659 --> 02:52:47,501
to it

3612
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:49,751
we've got 85 lights in the flower room

3613
02:52:47,501 --> 02:52:53,921
and green and healthy down and we run if

3614
02:52:49,751 --> 02:52:57,041
D it's 50 tons we've got a 30 in the

3615
02:52:53,921 --> 02:52:58,720
middle and two tins on opposite sides 50

3616
02:52:57,040 --> 02:53:00,880
tons of air conditioning to cool that

3617
02:52:58,720 --> 02:53:02,649
yep three years see that's smart three

3618
02:53:00,880 --> 02:53:04,680
air conditioners right yeah one goes

3619
02:53:02,649 --> 02:53:04,681
down

3620
02:53:07,771 --> 02:53:12,400
we're running kavita's with the kavita

3621
02:53:09,970 --> 02:53:14,020
master controller see it's above eighty

3622
02:53:12,399 --> 02:53:19,600
six in here I want you to dim the lights

3623
02:53:14,021 --> 02:53:21,851
until it gets bad a master controller is

3624
02:53:19,601 --> 02:53:24,101
awesome we run two of them because we

3625
02:53:21,851 --> 02:53:25,931
have so many lights yeah they're so easy

3626
02:53:24,101 --> 02:53:27,730
to program it doesn't even matter there

3627
02:53:25,931 --> 02:53:31,721
are 50 lights each other I think they'd

3628
02:53:27,729 --> 02:53:36,210
only do 40 they have to do 50 because we

3629
02:53:31,720 --> 02:53:39,970
run 85 lights yeah so yeah the nanos do

3630
02:53:36,210 --> 02:53:41,560
199 each nice that's but see what sucks

3631
02:53:39,970 --> 02:53:43,720
about that is you still might have to

3632
02:53:41,560 --> 02:53:46,060
buy multiple units if they're in

3633
02:53:43,720 --> 02:53:49,421
different rooms break them into zones

3634
02:53:46,060 --> 02:53:52,479
right right luckily our room is 185

3635
02:53:49,421 --> 02:53:55,841
light big giant open room with like six

3636
02:53:52,479 --> 02:53:58,569
rows right now big shot it's my friends

3637
02:53:55,841 --> 02:54:00,761
at veg bloom if you are growing on a

3638
02:53:58,569 --> 02:54:02,409
small scale a medium scale or a large

3639
02:54:00,761 --> 02:54:04,479
scale and you want nutrients to push

3640
02:54:02,409 --> 02:54:08,771
your garden you want to see what you can

3641
02:54:04,479 --> 02:54:10,239
really do [ __ ] veg bloom is something

3642
02:54:08,771 --> 02:54:14,141
I would recommend it's affordable it's

3643
02:54:10,239 --> 02:54:16,119
easy to use and so far I'm six seven

3644
02:54:14,140 --> 02:54:17,560
weeks in and this is the best girl I've

3645
02:54:16,120 --> 02:54:20,081
done at the green and healthy walnuts

3646
02:54:17,560 --> 02:54:23,770
garden and there's a run right next to

3647
02:54:20,081 --> 02:54:26,470
it there was not veg bloom and I've

3648
02:54:23,771 --> 02:54:27,081
already I've already passed the size of

3649
02:54:26,470 --> 02:54:29,331
those by

3650
02:54:27,081 --> 02:54:30,921
they're being harvested at week 9 and

3651
02:54:29,331 --> 02:54:32,149
these other buds are a week seven and

3652
02:54:30,921 --> 02:54:37,399
they're already bigger than the week

3653
02:54:32,149 --> 02:54:41,569
nine buds so I support vegetable oh that

3654
02:54:37,399 --> 02:54:43,399
would be awesome only place you could go

3655
02:54:41,569 --> 02:54:44,870
from your last performance right yeah

3656
02:54:43,399 --> 02:54:45,591
last time we crushed it we did pretty

3657
02:54:44,870 --> 02:54:47,390
damn well

3658
02:54:45,591 --> 02:54:49,399
shut up to the boys at Green &amp; Healthy

3659
02:54:47,390 --> 02:54:55,490
Wellness and the whole turf jungle for

3660
02:54:49,399 --> 02:54:57,190
helping me I appreciate it nobody

3661
02:54:55,490 --> 02:54:59,960
considers getting rid of the humidity

3662
02:54:57,190 --> 02:55:01,461
there needs to be an exit for all of the

3663
02:54:59,960 --> 02:55:03,200
moisture that comes into the room you

3664
02:55:01,460 --> 02:55:05,001
might be filling the room with co2 cool

3665
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:06,649
but where is all of that old stagnant

3666
02:55:05,001 --> 02:55:08,511
air going that's in there you need to

3667
02:55:06,649 --> 02:55:09,710
get rid of that [ __ ] you don't want to

3668
02:55:08,511 --> 02:55:12,771
be in there if you walk into the grow

3669
02:55:09,710 --> 02:55:14,060
room and it feels funky to you it feels

3670
02:55:12,771 --> 02:55:16,521
funky to the plants you should be able

3671
02:55:14,060 --> 02:55:19,220
to close your eyes and breathe and not

3672
02:55:16,521 --> 02:55:20,751
notice that you've walked into a grow it

3673
02:55:19,220 --> 02:55:33,430
should just feel like normal like this

3674
02:55:20,751 --> 02:55:35,300
living room knows things I've noticed

3675
02:55:33,431 --> 02:55:38,569
humans like we were talking earlier

3676
02:55:35,300 --> 02:55:40,819
fullier spraying you know how even just

3677
02:55:38,569 --> 02:55:43,790
watering brewing a damn tea you know

3678
02:55:40,819 --> 02:55:47,390
brewing 200 gallons of tea can spike the

3679
02:55:43,790 --> 02:55:49,069
humidity and oh yeah 200 gallons of -

3680
02:55:47,390 --> 02:55:50,720
you too close to the whites and it just

3681
02:55:49,069 --> 02:55:52,761
starts evaporating the oats up the t's

3682
02:55:50,720 --> 02:55:54,290
little that all that moisture in the

3683
02:55:52,761 --> 02:55:56,601
room carries heat heats up the room as

3684
02:55:54,290 --> 02:55:58,670
well you go through the hot and cold

3685
02:55:56,601 --> 02:56:00,951
cycles naturally through the day at the

3686
02:55:58,671 --> 02:56:03,560
building getting heated up and I mean

3687
02:56:00,950 --> 02:56:06,770
most of these grows are in fairly thin

3688
02:56:03,560 --> 02:56:09,800
shield commercial warehouses that aren't

3689
02:56:06,771 --> 02:56:12,591
insulated as well as it could be and you

3690
02:56:09,800 --> 02:56:14,720
know so you get the heating and cooling

3691
02:56:12,591 --> 02:56:17,541
effect from you know just the natural

3692
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:19,819
outside temperature we had to build a

3693
02:56:17,540 --> 02:56:21,560
concrete wall on the outside we defer it

3694
02:56:19,819 --> 02:56:23,780
is I think the the construction turn we

3695
02:56:21,560 --> 02:56:26,030
had the furrow wall out six inches with

3696
02:56:23,781 --> 02:56:27,621
concrete to kind of insulate ourselves a

3697
02:56:26,031 --> 02:56:29,421
little bit well I'm glad to hear that

3698
02:56:27,620 --> 02:56:31,670
you're not the only heard I'm not the

3699
02:56:29,421 --> 02:56:36,921
only person that might have to do this

3700
02:56:31,671 --> 02:56:37,970
are the east wall of our facility right

3701
02:56:36,921 --> 02:56:40,431
about

3702
02:56:37,970 --> 02:56:44,569
the west wall I got the west wall of the

3703
02:56:40,431 --> 02:56:46,250
facility did the way it all sits as the

3704
02:56:44,569 --> 02:56:48,409
Sun starts going down it just makes it

3705
02:56:46,250 --> 02:56:51,950
yeah and the wall goes you know from

3706
02:56:48,409 --> 02:56:54,470
being in the 70s all the way up into

3707
02:56:51,950 --> 02:56:56,061
it's radiating heat I can feel you can

3708
02:56:54,470 --> 02:56:58,459
see those waves coming off and you go

3709
02:56:56,060 --> 02:57:00,949
outside yeah ours was the exact opposite

3710
02:56:58,459 --> 02:57:03,170
when the winter came it got so cold on

3711
02:57:00,950 --> 02:57:13,159
that wall that we could see moisture on

3712
02:57:03,171 --> 02:57:15,380
the inside because you're introducing

3713
02:57:13,159 --> 02:57:22,310
moisture right temperature fluctuation

3714
02:57:15,380 --> 02:57:24,859
near that wall should have seen the guys

3715
02:57:22,310 --> 02:57:27,500
that did the concrete over the front of

3716
02:57:24,860 --> 02:57:29,540
the building there were three dudes that

3717
02:57:27,500 --> 02:57:31,101
didn't speak much English and they

3718
02:57:29,540 --> 02:57:33,051
showed up in a truck with a truck a

3719
02:57:31,101 --> 02:57:36,471
wheelbarrow a whole bunch of cement and

3720
02:57:33,050 --> 02:57:37,760
some janky scaffolding oh yeah two dudes

3721
02:57:36,470 --> 02:57:39,470
carry the scaffolding to where they

3722
02:57:37,761 --> 02:57:43,489
needed to be and they just pointed and

3723
02:57:39,470 --> 02:57:45,261
grunted a couple times they set up the

3724
02:57:43,489 --> 02:57:47,060
first level and then one dude climbed

3725
02:57:45,261 --> 02:57:48,470
that and they threw parts to him while

3726
02:57:47,060 --> 02:57:49,909
he was standing on the scaffolding and

3727
02:57:48,470 --> 02:57:52,640
he stuck him in place and then climbed

3728
02:57:49,909 --> 02:58:00,649
up that and hung and grabbed other [ __ ]

3729
02:57:52,640 --> 02:58:02,209
and built like a for self so they start

3730
02:58:00,649 --> 02:58:04,341
the cement from the top and let it run

3731
02:58:02,209 --> 02:58:06,890
down kinda and he's up on the top of the

3732
02:58:04,341 --> 02:58:08,181
scaffolding and heels oh no and the guy

3733
02:58:06,890 --> 02:58:09,500
on the bottoms mixing cement in a

3734
02:58:08,181 --> 02:58:11,540
wheelbarrow with those little trowel

3735
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:13,851
things in his hand and he puts a pile on

3736
02:58:11,540 --> 02:58:16,250
the thing and he doesn't throw the tool

3737
02:58:13,851 --> 02:58:17,810
but he throws the concrete just Chuck's

3738
02:58:16,250 --> 02:58:19,940
it up into the air between the

3739
02:58:17,810 --> 02:58:28,159
scaffolding and the dude up top puts his

3740
02:58:19,940 --> 02:58:29,721
trial down doesn't even look and the guy

3741
02:58:28,159 --> 02:58:31,431
throws two of them up he puts both of

3742
02:58:29,720 --> 02:58:33,050
his little tools down it catches both of

3743
02:58:31,431 --> 02:58:34,341
them and smears it on the wall and he's

3744
02:58:33,050 --> 02:58:36,770
running left and right and just yelling

3745
02:58:34,341 --> 02:58:38,271
uno dos as he gets to the middle and the

3746
02:58:36,771 --> 02:58:40,579
guy throws how many he needs and he just

3747
02:58:38,271 --> 02:58:42,530
[ __ ] smooth and as it's coming down

3748
02:58:40,579 --> 02:58:44,149
he goes to the top and pushes it down

3749
02:58:42,530 --> 02:58:46,040
and then jumps to the next level and

3750
02:58:44,149 --> 02:58:47,390
repeats and then they got her all done I

3751
02:58:46,040 --> 02:58:49,610
went back and smooth it out it took

3752
02:58:47,390 --> 02:58:51,000
these three dudes seriously two hours to

3753
02:58:49,610 --> 02:58:53,760
do the entire front

3754
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:57,569
[ __ ] building amazing I would hire

3755
02:58:53,760 --> 02:59:01,260
those guys for [ __ ] anything that's

3756
02:58:57,569 --> 02:59:03,029
or so [ __ ] you Trump yeah a hard work

3757
02:59:01,260 --> 02:59:04,530
and [ __ ] I mean do you know my

3758
02:59:03,030 --> 02:59:08,070
background I worked in the construction

3759
02:59:04,530 --> 02:59:10,470
industry for over a decade there's a

3760
02:59:08,069 --> 02:59:11,639
reason why there's not that many white

3761
02:59:10,469 --> 02:59:13,260
guys employed in the construction

3762
02:59:11,639 --> 02:59:16,019
industry anymore

3763
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:19,620
yeah so yeah take that Trump yeah [ __ ]

3764
02:59:16,020 --> 02:59:21,270
you Trump hire illegals can do some

3765
02:59:19,620 --> 02:59:22,710
construction work they do this [ __ ] that

3766
02:59:21,270 --> 02:59:24,270
white people think they're too good to

3767
02:59:22,709 --> 02:59:25,739
do that's the truth [ __ ] yeah you

3768
02:59:24,270 --> 02:59:26,819
couldn't pay me enough to do some of the

3769
02:59:25,739 --> 02:59:28,139
[ __ ] that some of those guys would do

3770
02:59:26,819 --> 02:59:29,699
just to make enough money to send home

3771
02:59:28,139 --> 02:59:30,959
to their family yeah and that's why I

3772
02:59:29,700 --> 02:59:33,180
have no problem with that do you that

3773
02:59:30,959 --> 02:59:37,109
fault black tar roofing I do draw the

3774
02:59:33,180 --> 02:59:41,639
line there without a doubt yeah [ __ ]

3775
02:59:37,110 --> 02:59:44,280
white is this paper you don't honestly

3776
02:59:41,639 --> 02:59:47,010
any kind of roofing I draw the line

3777
02:59:44,280 --> 02:59:49,140
to be honest all right so you gotta get

3778
02:59:47,010 --> 02:59:50,520
air conditioning and humidity you gotta

3779
02:59:49,139 --> 02:59:52,649
have an exit you gotta have a vent

3780
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:53,819
drying stale air out of the building and

3781
02:59:52,649 --> 02:59:55,229
getting it out of the ceiling

3782
02:59:53,819 --> 02:59:57,840
that's something super important when

3783
02:59:55,229 --> 03:00:00,359
you're going from a basement grow to a

3784
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:08,670
larger commercial grow do you guys have

3785
03:00:00,360 --> 03:00:10,829
to run we should be but we're loud were

3786
03:00:08,670 --> 03:00:17,309
loud one more complaint before we get in

3787
03:00:10,829 --> 03:00:24,059
trouble the fine is cheaper than the

3788
03:00:17,309 --> 03:00:25,769
filters that we need we we had to hear

3789
03:00:24,059 --> 03:00:27,269
it well oh that was they immediately

3790
03:00:25,770 --> 03:00:30,450
there was like one of their big concerns

3791
03:00:27,270 --> 03:00:32,760
was carbon filters and we've got six of

3792
03:00:30,450 --> 03:00:34,260
those big [ __ ] all of ours we've even

3793
03:00:32,760 --> 03:00:34,710
got the inline ones on our air crew

3794
03:00:34,260 --> 03:00:37,350
flights

3795
03:00:34,709 --> 03:00:39,479
we're disgustingly lucky because across

3796
03:00:37,350 --> 03:00:42,059
the street from us is homeward bound dog

3797
03:00:39,479 --> 03:00:45,119
crematorium nice and so every day around

3798
03:00:42,059 --> 03:00:53,939
noon you smell garlic bread and then you

3799
03:00:45,120 --> 03:00:55,920
realize and I smelled it the other day I

3800
03:00:53,940 --> 03:00:57,270
was like I can't even let him do that I

3801
03:00:55,920 --> 03:00:59,250
walked into the other room where he was

3802
03:00:57,270 --> 03:01:00,569
a brace all that garlic bread news yeah

3803
03:00:59,250 --> 03:01:02,370
who's cooking I go that's the dog

3804
03:01:00,569 --> 03:01:04,469
crematorium next door don't enjoy it

3805
03:01:02,370 --> 03:01:10,710
much that's Rover and he just looked at

3806
03:01:04,469 --> 03:01:12,779
me like that's that's fluffy because the

3807
03:01:10,709 --> 03:01:14,879
first few days I worked there I smelled

3808
03:01:12,780 --> 03:01:16,079
something and there were two girls that

3809
03:01:14,879 --> 03:01:17,489
used to work there that are no longer

3810
03:01:16,079 --> 03:01:20,101
affiliated with us but they used to work

3811
03:01:17,489 --> 03:01:39,659
there every day like noon or two o'clock

3812
03:01:20,101 --> 03:01:42,210
I smell garlic bread the reason I

3813
03:01:39,659 --> 03:01:45,000
brought it up is just carbon filter

3814
03:01:42,209 --> 03:01:47,189
systems in a home grow versus a

3815
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:50,280
commercial grower drastically different

3816
03:01:47,190 --> 03:01:52,290
hugely different yeah yeah that's why I

3817
03:01:50,280 --> 03:01:55,620
said what we need is way expensive like

3818
03:01:52,290 --> 03:01:59,550
HEPA filter great [ __ ] UV lighting

3819
03:01:55,620 --> 03:02:02,610
possibly we've got a small UV light that

3820
03:01:59,549 --> 03:02:04,259
I use on small plantings I run it over I

3821
03:02:02,610 --> 03:02:06,300
just walk through the grow room and just

3822
03:02:04,260 --> 03:02:07,920
hover that white about four to six

3823
03:02:06,299 --> 03:02:10,379
inches over every little plant and it

3824
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:14,120
keeps them nice and bug free is the bugs

3825
03:02:10,379 --> 03:02:14,119
want nothing to do with that and the PM

3826
03:02:14,840 --> 03:02:18,899
yeah that thing is helpful I was using

3827
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:21,510
that on another guy's garden they had

3828
03:02:18,899 --> 03:02:26,359
bad PM and I think it took eight days to

3829
03:02:21,510 --> 03:02:29,040
just deteriorate all the PM that has

3830
03:02:26,360 --> 03:02:30,470
[ __ ] filtration it refuses to blow

3831
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:33,090
the air out of his house cuz he's afraid

3832
03:02:30,469 --> 03:02:34,409
keeps getting PM they keep learning new

3833
03:02:33,090 --> 03:02:36,030
tricks on how to get rid of it for him

3834
03:02:34,409 --> 03:02:37,739
yeah keeps us on our toes

3835
03:02:36,030 --> 03:02:39,630
alright so filtration is something they

3836
03:02:37,739 --> 03:02:42,629
choose super definitely need give that

3837
03:02:39,629 --> 03:02:43,859
stale funkier out you're gonna need UV

3838
03:02:42,629 --> 03:02:46,350
lighting you're gonna need a HIPAA

3839
03:02:43,860 --> 03:02:48,090
filtration your air conditioners have

3840
03:02:46,351 --> 03:02:50,159
exchanges and they're gonna pull the air

3841
03:02:48,090 --> 03:02:51,719
from the grow room and that's gonna blow

3842
03:02:50,159 --> 03:02:53,399
back into your grow but also a large

3843
03:02:51,719 --> 03:02:54,719
portion of that is going to escape into

3844
03:02:53,399 --> 03:02:57,389
the outside atmosphere so you're gonna

3845
03:02:54,719 --> 03:03:10,619
be stinking it up that way also you need

3846
03:02:57,389 --> 03:03:22,049
carbon scrubbers inside the grow how do

3847
03:03:10,620 --> 03:03:23,610
you know it's us there are some

3848
03:03:22,049 --> 03:03:24,869
dispensary owners that don't get along

3849
03:03:23,610 --> 03:03:30,420
with those people because they're shifty

3850
03:03:24,870 --> 03:03:32,040
dicks and they're keeping it real and

3851
03:03:30,420 --> 03:03:34,379
we're trying to be on the legit side

3852
03:03:32,040 --> 03:03:38,400
we're cool and they come over hey what's

3853
03:03:34,379 --> 03:03:40,020
up I'm actually I'm looking forward to

3854
03:03:38,399 --> 03:03:41,369
your first visit because the place that

3855
03:03:40,021 --> 03:03:44,340
we're at now is completely different

3856
03:03:41,370 --> 03:03:45,630
than some of the other places it's nice

3857
03:03:44,340 --> 03:03:47,549
when you can look forward to a media

3858
03:03:45,629 --> 03:03:48,929
business John I know they'll have some

3859
03:03:47,549 --> 03:03:50,609
issues I'm sure they will they're all

3860
03:03:48,930 --> 03:03:52,979
they're always going to that's their job

3861
03:03:50,610 --> 03:03:55,560
but I'm not scared of anything

3862
03:03:52,979 --> 03:03:58,350
you know that's anything that we have

3863
03:03:55,560 --> 03:03:59,579
messed up on it's either cuz we didn't

3864
03:03:58,351 --> 03:04:02,130
understand it properly or

3865
03:03:59,579 --> 03:04:04,170
right invite the Department of

3866

Agriculture in for a walk through like

3867
03:04:04,170 --> 03:04:07,979
invite them and then if you invite them

3868
03:04:06,209 --> 03:04:09,750
they won't give you any violations for

3869
03:04:07,979 --> 03:04:11,310
whatever they find they'll tell you to

3870
03:04:09,750 --> 03:04:12,750
correct it since you invited them and

3871
03:04:11,310 --> 03:04:14,430
they'll be like you've got 90 days to

3872
03:04:12,750 --> 03:04:17,040
get it corrected when we come back

3873
03:04:14,430 --> 03:04:19,620
that's when we'll actually be able to

3874
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:21,840
put you on like a warning notice yes

3875

3885
03:04:41,969 --> 03:04:45,239
treat you like a stupid grower like some

3886

3890
03:04:53,489 --> 03:04:57,649

3891
03:04:56,340 --> 03:04:59,989
just had to walk out of the office

3892

you're [ __ ] sorry

3893
03:04:59,989 --> 03:05:03,569

contractors can [ __ ] up your whole day I

3924
03:06:17,030 --> 03:06:21,739
worked in another facility that the

3925
03:06:19,069 --> 03:06:23,210
blueprint was drawn by one guy the HVAC

3926
03:06:21,739 --> 03:06:24,290
system was designed by another in the

3927
03:06:23,210 --> 03:06:25,850
electrical which we're gonna talk about

3928
03:06:24,290 --> 03:06:27,979
in a minute was designed by another guy

3929
03:06:25,851 --> 03:06:32,060
and they were all it was like we took a

3930
03:06:27,979 --> 03:06:34,850
Ferrari engine maybe a Porsche Turbo kit

3931
03:06:32,060 --> 03:06:36,649
and then maybe like a Lamborghini body

3932
03:06:34,851 --> 03:06:38,271
and then the suspension system for a

3933
03:06:36,649 --> 03:06:40,399
Corvette and they're like you got all

3934
03:06:38,271 --> 03:06:45,620
these dope-ass parts make it go fast

3935
03:06:40,399 --> 03:06:54,440
Ricky Bobby doesn't work when you turn

3936
03:06:45,620 --> 03:06:57,079
on all the lights [ __ ] engineer that's

3937
03:06:54,440 --> 03:07:00,381
very key as an engineer that understands

3938
03:06:57,079 --> 03:07:02,271
ya cuz you're not always gonna find a

3939
03:07:00,380 --> 03:07:05,989
contractor that understands indoor

3940
03:07:02,271 --> 03:07:08,751
cultivation actually rarely will find a

3941
03:07:05,989 --> 03:07:10,880
contractor that understands it but you

3942
03:07:08,751 --> 03:07:13,069
can't find engineers that know what

3943
03:07:10,880 --> 03:07:15,680
they're doing and engineers are smart

3944
03:07:13,069 --> 03:07:18,860
people you can explain [ __ ] to him so

3945
03:07:15,681 --> 03:07:20,390
yeah that was real key in the uncle bun

3946
03:07:18,860 --> 03:07:21,950
company development we had a really good

3947
03:07:20,390 --> 03:07:23,181
engineer let's talk about that in a

3948
03:07:21,950 --> 03:07:24,711
minute also all that you give them a

3949
03:07:23,181 --> 03:07:28,310
nice plug I'm gonna write it down so

3950
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:30,439
that I remember I was able to relate

3951
03:07:28,310 --> 03:07:32,659
concerns I had to to him and I'm like

3952
03:07:30,440 --> 03:07:34,341
you know we got to make sure this

3953
03:07:32,659 --> 03:07:35,569
doesn't happen like electricity I was

3954
03:07:34,341 --> 03:07:36,390
like great we just have to have plenty

3955
03:07:35,569 --> 03:07:40,940
electricity

3956
03:07:36,389 --> 03:07:40,939
three-phase power all day long yeah well

3957
03:07:41,930 --> 03:07:50,250
how many apps we allowed to pull we're

3997
03:10:12,560 --> 03:10:19,069
a completely different story I've got an

random thing that's fallen out of a

4003
03:10:26,120 --> 03:10:29,931
plant all the pearlite that's on a table

4004
03:10:27,890 --> 03:10:32,949
or any whatever if there's a person's

lying around go clean all that [ __ ]

4006
03:10:32,950 --> 03:10:36,980
exactly start from the top in the flour

4007
03:10:35,209 --> 03:10:38,419
room go all the way down if there's old

4008
03:10:36,979 --> 03:10:41,420
trellis or old pots in there from

4009
03:10:38,420 --> 03:10:44,420
harvested that's got to go sweep every

4010
03:10:41,420 --> 03:10:45,710
goddamn corner get out the shop vac suck

4011
03:10:44,420 --> 03:10:47,960
up underneath all the weird random

4012
03:10:45,709 --> 03:10:50,510
little nooks and crannies that we got in

4013
03:10:47,959 --> 03:10:52,339
there anything that's not gonna be used

4014
03:10:50,511 --> 03:10:54,739
doesn't need to be in the flower room I

4015
03:10:52,340 --> 03:10:56,870
don't think like scissors and boxes of

4016
03:10:54,739 --> 03:11:06,560
material that [ __ ] should go in the

4017
03:10:56,870 --> 03:11:08,240
storage room store that put the broom

4018
03:11:06,560 --> 03:11:10,579
and dustpan and trash can outside the

4019
03:11:08,239 --> 03:11:12,440
flower room you put that [ __ ] outside

4020
03:11:10,579 --> 03:11:14,870
just don't have that in the flower in

4021
03:11:12,440 --> 03:11:17,181
room or the bedroom simple little tasks

4022
03:11:14,870 --> 03:11:19,670
that you don't even think about doing in

4023
03:11:17,181 --> 03:11:22,940
a small girl can literally take days in

4024
03:11:19,670 --> 03:11:25,940
a big defoliating oh my god shaving legs

4025
03:11:22,940 --> 03:11:28,159
shaving legs defoliant aching I know you

4026
03:11:25,940 --> 03:11:30,170
guys are all netting but yeah I'm doing

4027
03:11:28,159 --> 03:11:32,479
a big Seeger on so that wasn't really a

4028
03:11:30,170 --> 03:11:35,360
right an option likes double and triple

4029
03:11:32,479 --> 03:11:45,829
layer trellising I get crazy on it I

4030
03:11:35,360 --> 03:11:47,540
can't wait I've got a guy a former

4031
03:11:45,829 --> 03:11:50,709
employee that would defoliate the entire

4032
03:11:47,540 --> 03:11:53,750
room for an entire shift and he would do

4033
03:11:50,709 --> 03:11:56,029
10 five-gallon buckets full of leaves

4034
03:11:53,750 --> 03:11:56,510
and he would push him down like you just

4035
03:11:56,030 --> 03:11:58,550
chocolate

4036
03:11:56,510 --> 03:11:59,689
all day and then go back and scoop up

4037
03:11:58,549 --> 03:12:00,829
the leaves out of the trays into

4038
03:11:59,689 --> 03:12:02,779
five-gallon buckets and he'd probably

4039
03:12:00,829 --> 03:12:05,000
fill ten five gallon buckets he'd fill

4040
03:12:02,779 --> 03:12:06,710
one of those big like thirty gallon

4041
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:09,228
trash cans halfway full it just leaves

4042
03:12:06,709 --> 03:12:10,728
just from the first run of defoliating

4043
03:12:09,228 --> 03:12:12,409
things you don't have to do in the

4044
03:12:10,728 --> 03:12:13,399
basement we have to weigh all that and

4045
03:12:12,409 --> 03:12:15,189
we have to track it

4046
03:12:13,399 --> 03:12:18,109
[Music]

4047
03:12:15,189 --> 03:12:26,960
yeah document what all that [ __ ] weighed

4048
03:12:18,109 --> 03:12:28,460
yeah off so we've got a you know you're

4049
03:12:26,959 --> 03:12:29,929
supposed to like mix it with soil or

4050
03:12:28,459 --> 03:12:31,789
vinegar oil or something like that

4051
03:12:29,930 --> 03:12:33,050
before you can throw it away okay yeah

4052
03:12:31,790 --> 03:12:35,689
let's so let's catch the listeners up

4053
03:12:33,049 --> 03:12:39,019
though and a commercial grow when you if

4054
03:12:35,689 --> 03:12:41,239
you have see maybe a but isn't desirable

4055
03:12:39,020 --> 03:12:43,130
or they're the bottom part of the plan I

4056
03:12:41,239 --> 03:12:44,359
throw that [ __ ] away when that's in the

4057
03:12:43,129 --> 03:12:46,429
trash can you have to cut it up into

4058
03:12:44,359 --> 03:12:49,309
little tiny pieces and then you have to

4059
03:12:46,430 --> 03:12:52,148
mix it like Jesse said with soil or a

4060
03:12:49,309 --> 03:13:01,728
kitty litter is what they recommend for

4061
03:12:52,148 --> 03:13:03,619
gravel or vinegar or like you got a good

4062
03:13:01,728 --> 03:13:06,920
idea yeah we've got three worm firms

4063
03:13:03,620 --> 03:13:08,540
there you go feed it to the worms yeah

4064
03:13:06,920 --> 03:13:11,450
and they're loving it too I'm sure they

4065
03:13:08,540 --> 03:13:14,060
love their chamomile and the best we use

4066
03:13:11,450 --> 03:13:17,390
a [ __ ] ton of worm castings too so it

4067
03:13:14,059 --> 03:13:22,649
helps cut down cost there you go pre

4068
03:13:17,389 --> 03:13:35,949
cycling that's a good way to do it yeah

4069
03:13:22,649 --> 03:13:39,109
[Music]

4070
03:13:35,950 --> 03:13:40,760
that's pretty read we we grind it up

4071
03:13:39,109 --> 03:13:42,520
pretty small we chop it chop it up with

4072
03:13:40,760 --> 03:13:50,329
uh like Thea the shears

4073
03:13:42,520 --> 03:13:52,399
go ham on it with the shears and shake

4074
03:13:50,329 --> 03:13:53,659
that soil into the trash we let them dry

4075
03:13:52,398 --> 03:13:54,228
they've all sat around it dried for a

4076
03:13:53,659 --> 03:13:56,029
couple days

4077
03:13:54,228 --> 03:13:57,199
dump all that soil into the trash can

4078
03:13:56,029 --> 03:13:57,590
they're all bunch of the waste into

4079
03:13:57,200 --> 03:13:59,689
there

4080
03:13:57,590 --> 03:14:02,029
dump a couple more pots more soil couple

4081
03:13:59,689 --> 03:14:03,859
more far more a waste yeah just keep it

4082
03:14:02,029 --> 03:14:05,659
like that so that's a way to get rid of

4083
03:14:03,859 --> 03:14:08,989
all of our old soil at the same time and

4084
03:14:05,659 --> 03:14:09,739
you have a use for it wasting all that

4085
03:14:08,989 --> 03:14:12,069
good dirt

4086
03:14:09,739 --> 03:14:16,699
I know it's recyclable I totally know

4087
03:14:12,069 --> 03:14:18,260
and we use so much cocoa we buy 14 big

4088
03:14:16,700 --> 03:14:31,490
bags of cocoa at a time when we go

4089
03:14:18,260 --> 03:14:33,409
because that's what fits in hunts car to

4090
03:14:31,489 --> 03:14:34,369
shot it's a way to grow I hope nobody's

4091
03:14:33,409 --> 03:14:36,799
heard me burp into that microphone

4092
03:14:34,370 --> 03:14:38,420
excuse me it's a good way to grow I was

4093
03:14:36,799 --> 03:14:40,459
buying cocoa grow the other day I really

4094
03:14:38,420 --> 03:14:43,460
like the botanic air cocoa grow I don't

4095
03:14:40,459 --> 03:14:44,839
prefer the aeration bag just get the

4096
03:14:43,459 --> 03:14:46,250
cocoa it's just fun you don't need that

4097
03:14:44,840 --> 03:14:48,890
aeration in there I don't like that [ __ ]

4098
03:14:46,250 --> 03:14:51,799
but way to grow is nice enough to throw

4099
03:14:48,890 --> 03:14:53,779
in a bunch of bags of Fox farms ocean

4100
03:14:51,799 --> 03:14:57,189
forest soil for free they carried that

4101
03:14:53,780 --> 03:14:57,190
[ __ ] to my car like you buy a lot of

4102
03:14:59,890 --> 03:15:03,049
shits my friends a way to grow they know

4103
03:15:01,909 --> 03:15:04,851
who they are I don't know if they listen

4104
03:15:03,049 --> 03:15:06,379
to the podcast if you do listen to the

4105

4107
03:15:23,229 --> 03:15:28,430
[Music]

4108
03:15:25,840 --> 03:15:29,931
it's really funny all right so you need

4109
03:15:28,431 --> 03:15:31,370
a good [ __ ] electrician you need way

4110
03:15:29,931 --> 03:15:33,710
to get rid of humidity you need a way to

4111
03:15:31,370 --> 03:15:34,400
get rid of heat plenty of air

4112
03:15:33,709 --> 03:15:35,899
conditioning

4113
03:15:34,399 --> 03:15:37,520
you're gonna seal up all the cracks all

4114
03:15:35,899 --> 03:15:39,619
the nooks and crannies you gotta be able

4115
03:15:37,521 --> 03:15:41,420
to clean the [ __ ] out of this place it's

4116
03:15:39,620 --> 03:15:42,891
gotta be a semi clean facility you don't

4117
03:15:41,420 --> 03:15:45,101
want some old car garage where the floor

4118
03:15:42,890 --> 03:15:49,431
is all greasy no you need a floor drain

4119
03:15:45,101 --> 03:15:52,460
for drains are crucial absolutely yeah

4120
03:15:49,431 --> 03:15:54,050
and water you need access to water a lot

4121
03:15:52,459 --> 03:15:55,699
of warehouses out in Pueblo by the

4122
03:15:54,049 --> 03:15:57,170
airport they don't have water ran to

4123
03:15:55,700 --> 03:16:02,061
them because they didn't need water for

4124
03:15:57,170 --> 03:16:05,750
anything if you get one of those

4125
03:16:02,060 --> 03:16:07,699
warehouses out there make sure that was

4126
03:16:05,750 --> 03:16:10,010
on track here yeah those warehouse is

4127
03:16:07,700 --> 03:16:11,061
out there you you might not have water

4128
03:16:10,010 --> 03:16:12,440
you're gonna have to be getting trucks

4129
03:16:11,060 --> 03:16:14,060
of water you have to pay to get water

4130
03:16:12,440 --> 03:16:18,409
out there something people aren't aware

4131
03:16:14,060 --> 03:16:21,260
of if you get a large grow on private

4132
03:16:18,409 --> 03:16:23,270
land out say in Pueblo County somewhere

4133
03:16:21,260 --> 03:16:25,759
you have to get water right

4134
03:16:23,270 --> 03:16:27,560
you just because you have land doesn't

4135
03:16:25,759 --> 03:16:29,509
mean you're granted water rights even if

4136
03:16:27,559 --> 03:16:31,908
there's a well there you have to

4137
03:16:29,509 --> 03:16:35,180
purchase water to offset what you're

4138
03:16:31,908 --> 03:16:38,088
taking out exactly yep if there are

4139
03:16:35,180 --> 03:16:39,889
enough grows around that area that that

4140
03:16:38,088 --> 03:16:41,658
jurisdiction deems the water is

4141
03:16:39,889 --> 03:16:43,728
compromised by you coming they can

4142
03:16:41,658 --> 03:16:47,238

podcast heard about the head injury it's

4191
03:18:52,238 --> 03:19:01,359
not been a year and a half and I still

4192
03:18:54,789 --> 03:19:02,979
have effects still have like I've got

4193
03:19:01,359 --> 03:19:05,738
post concussion syndrome and I've got a

4194
03:19:02,978 --> 03:19:08,559
traumatic brain injury still I played

4195
03:19:05,738 --> 03:19:11,618
high school football very competitively

4196
03:19:08,559 --> 03:19:13,180
I have major concussions in high school

4197
03:19:11,619 --> 03:19:16,359
and I know I didn't let them heal up

4198
03:19:13,180 --> 03:19:18,879
correctly right and I wonder sometimes

4199
03:19:16,359 --> 03:19:21,959
how that affects me givers you for doing

4200
03:19:18,879 --> 03:19:26,939
[ __ ] and you go oh that's from that time

4201
03:19:21,959 --> 03:19:26,939
I have those moments where I wonder

4202
03:19:35,590 --> 03:19:44,969
[Music]

4203
03:19:49,199 --> 03:19:55,149
water OH

4204
03:19:51,088 --> 03:19:57,068
water tanks water filtration your

4205
03:19:55,148 --> 03:20:00,788
average on the shelf go store water

4206
03:19:57,068 --> 03:20:03,009
filter can't handle them you need a lot

4207
03:20:00,789 --> 03:20:07,029
of water I use a thousand gallons of

4208
03:20:03,009 --> 03:20:12,459
water every 48 hours grow and that's 105

4209
03:20:07,029 --> 03:20:14,859
lights total I'm doing 155 to 165 right

4210
03:20:12,459 --> 03:20:15,549
now oh gosh see we're still not even at

4211
03:20:14,859 --> 03:20:19,418
full capacity

4212
03:20:15,549 --> 03:20:21,219
yes full flower five feet tall with big

4213
03:20:19,418 --> 03:20:23,020
[ __ ] donkey dick buds on them and

4214
03:20:21,218 --> 03:20:27,548
either way that's still a lot more than

4215
03:20:23,020 --> 03:20:29,588
your oh so much more yeah if you're

4216
03:20:27,549 --> 03:20:31,509
using I figure use about indoors you

4217
03:20:29,588 --> 03:20:38,918
probably use five gallons of water per

4218
03:20:31,509 --> 03:20:39,699
light every 48 to 72 hours yeah so if

4219
03:20:38,918 --> 03:20:40,959
you guys are trying to figure out how

4220
03:20:39,699 --> 03:20:43,658
much water you should be using in your

4221
03:20:40,959 --> 03:20:45,430
indoor every 1000 watt or 600 watt light

4222
03:20:43,658 --> 03:20:47,228
600 thousand watt light you should be

4223
03:20:45,430 --> 03:20:48,879
running about five gallons every 24 to

4224
03:20:47,228 --> 03:20:49,159
48 hours if your temperatures and your

4225
03:20:48,879 --> 03:20:50,420
human

4226
03:20:49,159 --> 03:20:52,640
and everything are dialed in and your

4227
03:20:50,420 --> 03:20:53,840
plants are at their optimum growth your

4228
03:20:52,640 --> 03:20:58,430
plants are growing a little slow you're

4229
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:59,899
probably over watering them yeah that's

4230
03:20:58,430 --> 03:21:03,460
usually the first sign of over watering

4231
03:20:59,899 --> 03:21:06,319
some plants outdoors it's gonna be

4232
03:21:03,459 --> 03:21:11,719
average I'd say five gallons plant per

4233
03:21:06,319 --> 03:21:13,279
plant per day per day is it okay to just

4234
03:21:11,719 --> 03:21:17,079
turn on the hose and just let the hose

4235
03:21:13,280 --> 03:21:17,079
just [ __ ] follow those outdoor plants

4236
03:21:17,771 --> 03:21:23,780
yes for the most part I try to

4237
03:21:22,250 --> 03:21:25,430
concentrate it more just around the

4238
03:21:23,780 --> 03:21:28,760
clamp because I feel like it's wasting

4239
03:21:25,430 --> 03:21:31,870
okay yeah okay yeah no you could totally

4240
03:21:28,760 --> 03:21:35,210
do like a field flood irrigation

4241
03:21:31,870 --> 03:21:37,391
actually know of a also a place here in

4242
03:21:35,209 --> 03:21:40,149
public County that floods their field

4243
03:21:37,390 --> 03:21:43,129
just like they do with cantaloupe or

4244
03:21:40,149 --> 03:21:45,229
watermelon or wow yeah yeah just blow

4245
03:21:43,129 --> 03:21:46,969
the whole field out let it dry and

4246
03:21:45,229 --> 03:21:50,420
reflet it they're just doing a flood and

4247
03:21:46,969 --> 03:21:51,890
drain outdoor basically that's okay I

4248
03:21:50,420 --> 03:21:54,860
think they do it like two or three times

4249
03:21:51,890 --> 03:21:57,440
I need to go explore and visit more of

4250
03:21:54,860 --> 03:21:58,610
these outdoor cannabis and I want to see

4251
03:21:57,440 --> 03:22:04,149
how you guys are doing a lot of this

4252
03:21:58,610 --> 03:22:04,150
[ __ ] I can implement into my indoor tech

4253
03:22:04,271 --> 03:22:11,750
stuff the sudden pretty I think is

4254
03:22:08,659 --> 03:22:14,810
pretty cool the overwhelming majority of

4255
03:22:11,750 --> 03:22:19,101
these places are know to raise bed Oh

4256
03:22:14,810 --> 03:22:21,289
neat yeah so no tell you guys the they

4257
03:22:19,101 --> 03:22:23,900
make an amended soil with a lot of

4258
03:22:21,290 --> 03:22:25,400
special amendments and then very

4259
03:22:23,899 --> 03:22:26,629
specific amendments that I make my rent

4260
03:22:25,399 --> 03:22:28,690
too honestly I don't know what goes into

4261
03:22:26,629 --> 03:22:28,689
that

4262
03:22:33,950 --> 03:22:40,430
live worms live worms okay so it's

4263
03:22:37,760 --> 03:22:42,590
living soil you guys yeah and the plants

4264
03:22:40,430 --> 03:22:43,790
are harvested and do you pull out the

4265
03:22:42,590 --> 03:22:47,210
big root ball or you just leave that in

4266
03:22:43,790 --> 03:22:49,280
there pull out the stem around it okay

4267
03:22:47,209 --> 03:22:50,569
try do you actually want to leave as

4268
03:22:49,280 --> 03:22:52,220
much of the root ball in there as you

4269
03:22:50,569 --> 03:22:54,920
can cuz the worms are gonna eat it to

4270
03:22:52,219 --> 03:22:56,359
add into nutrients for the planting wife

4271
03:22:54,920 --> 03:22:58,399
so I'm going in circles

4272
03:22:56,360 --> 03:22:59,120
you pull the plan out and you put a new

4273
03:22:58,399 --> 03:23:03,500
one in

4274
03:22:59,120 --> 03:23:05,601
you send her off again they use a lot of

4275
03:23:03,500 --> 03:23:07,579
cover crops stuff like that oh okay so

4276
03:23:05,601 --> 03:23:10,370
you stacking stuff into the pot and then

4277
03:23:07,579 --> 03:23:11,959
the worms will eat all of that mostly

4278
03:23:10,370 --> 03:23:14,300
that stuff will decompose and become

4279
03:23:11,959 --> 03:23:17,589
plant and so you're gonna start losing a

4280
03:23:14,299 --> 03:23:17,590
little bit of depth every time right

4281
03:23:17,771 --> 03:23:22,280
just refill it with your fresh that's

4282
03:23:20,209 --> 03:23:25,129
how you got charge no tells you it's

4283
03:23:22,280 --> 03:23:26,780
awesome go back in top dress in all your

4284
03:23:25,129 --> 03:23:28,759
researched amendments that's pretty

4285
03:23:26,780 --> 03:23:32,900
awesome I never saw that of a crow it's

4286
03:23:28,760 --> 03:23:34,399
uh babe it's extremely economical that's

4287
03:23:32,899 --> 03:23:36,079
why most of these places are running it

4288
03:23:34,399 --> 03:23:38,029
hell there's such a large scale that

4289
03:23:36,079 --> 03:23:41,510
it's just if the plant stays good

4290
03:23:38,030 --> 03:23:43,340
because grower who uses mainly bottled

4291
03:23:41,510 --> 03:23:52,610
nutrients for most of my growing always

4292
03:23:43,340 --> 03:23:53,899
been taught to flush my plants since

4293
03:23:52,610 --> 03:23:55,400
they're not feeding a whole bunch of

4294
03:23:53,899 --> 03:23:57,319
bottled nutrients a bunch of she lated

4295
03:23:55,399 --> 03:23:58,609
salts their plants aren't backed up with

4296
03:23:57,319 --> 03:24:02,119
stuff their plants are probably more

4297
03:23:58,610 --> 03:24:05,450
able to I don't even remember the word

4298
03:24:02,120 --> 03:24:06,590
right Emily all of the nutrients that

4299
03:24:05,450 --> 03:24:07,909
are going through they can use it a

4300
03:24:06,590 --> 03:24:09,079
little bit better it comes up and goes

4301
03:24:07,909 --> 03:24:10,851
down they get rid of it a little more

4302
03:24:09,079 --> 03:24:14,629
okay i debuff a star they get to pick

4303
03:24:10,851 --> 03:24:16,101
and choose yeah yeah that's crazy the

4304
03:24:14,629 --> 03:24:18,709
plants actually finish themselves off

4305
03:24:16,101 --> 03:24:20,540
they start fading just like you they

4306
03:24:18,709 --> 03:24:27,350
would if they're flooded I mean flushed

4307
03:24:20,540 --> 03:24:30,351
no do you see a difference in specific

4308
03:24:27,351 --> 03:24:31,790
strains does strain a versus strain B do

4309
03:24:30,351 --> 03:24:34,640
they finish differently in the no-till

4310
03:24:31,790 --> 03:24:36,351
outdoor I haven't done enough of it to

4311
03:24:34,639 --> 03:24:38,359
say that just curious if that was

4312
03:24:36,351 --> 03:24:40,370
nutrients running out or if that was

4313
03:24:38,360 --> 03:24:44,210
actually the plant realizing hey done

4314
03:24:40,370 --> 03:24:47,210
I'm flushing myself I I know in my

4315
03:24:44,209 --> 03:24:49,459
experience the way I grow in the ground

4316
03:24:47,209 --> 03:24:51,739
is kind of no-till pretty much yeah I

4317
03:24:49,459 --> 03:24:52,909
know Girl Scout cookies and flow will

4318
03:24:51,739 --> 03:24:55,159
finish themselves off

4319
03:24:52,909 --> 03:24:57,351
what half doubt they'll deform cut girls

4320
03:24:55,159 --> 03:24:59,500
cookies flow will finish herself off you

4321
03:24:57,351 --> 03:24:59,500

03:25:42,139 --> 03:25:47,840
with it a few more times and ya know me

4329
03:25:46,639 --> 03:25:49,549

one I don't like the full room once okay

4332
03:25:51,950 --> 03:26:06,380
inevitably that light switch always gets

4333
03:25:53,989 --> 03:26:16,909
left on right yeah it's actually focused

4334
03:26:06,379 --> 03:26:19,129
where I am we've talked a lot about

4335
03:26:16,909 --> 03:26:20,539
building getting your large commercial

4336
03:26:19,129 --> 03:26:21,799
grow going you have any things that you

4337
03:26:20,540 --> 03:26:23,060
want to add before we start wrapping

4338
03:26:21,799 --> 03:26:25,429
this up so that I don't cut off any of

4339
03:26:23,059 --> 03:26:29,299
your useful data for our listeners find

4340
03:26:25,430 --> 03:26:31,729
a person that can be vouched for by many

4341
03:26:29,299 --> 03:26:34,459
people throughout the community to work

4342
03:26:31,728 --> 03:26:37,818
with your engineer to help design your

4343
03:26:34,459 --> 03:26:40,789
building and pay him what his worth like

4344
03:26:37,818 --> 03:26:43,459
you know if it'll be a gonna like me or

4345
03:26:40,790 --> 03:26:47,930
Jeff and even if he's not gonna grow for

4346
03:26:43,459 --> 03:26:50,839
you pay him what it's worth and your end

4347
03:26:47,930 --> 03:26:53,800
product will drastically improve and

4348
03:26:50,840 --> 03:26:56,210
work better by doing it in my first week

4349
03:26:53,799 --> 03:26:59,889
in green and healthy wellness I made

4350
03:26:56,209 --> 03:27:03,559
minor improvements it improved the

4351
03:26:59,889 --> 03:27:05,029
financial it just made sense fixed their

4352
03:27:03,559 --> 03:27:06,439
books a little bit just by [ __ ] doing

4353
03:27:05,030 --> 03:27:08,270
a couple of adjustments like making the

4354
03:27:06,439 --> 03:27:10,430
garden more more profitable just by

4355
03:27:08,270 --> 03:27:12,590
eliminating this and adding this it just

4356
03:27:10,430 --> 03:27:13,069
took me a week to make a whole bunch of

4357
03:27:12,590 --> 03:27:14,720
small

4358
03:27:13,069 --> 03:27:16,640
it's just cuz the person who set it up

4359
03:27:14,720 --> 03:27:20,629
and was running it was not an

4360
03:27:16,640 --> 03:27:22,190
experienced grower was not I don't want

4361
03:27:20,629 --> 03:27:23,600
it I don't want to bash this person but

4362
03:27:22,190 --> 03:27:25,610
they weren't a forward thinker they were

4363
03:27:23,601 --> 03:27:26,721
it didn't they didn't look far enough

4364
03:27:25,610 --> 03:27:28,370
into the future they didn't have

4365
03:27:26,720 --> 03:27:29,539
foresight to realize that if I don't put

4366
03:27:28,370 --> 03:27:32,660
glue here the shit's gonna come apart

4367
03:27:29,540 --> 03:27:34,730
eventually don't you like that yeah so I

4368
03:27:32,659 --> 03:27:36,261
fixed a lot of just small details they

4369
03:27:34,729 --> 03:27:37,369
didn't have any heaters in the so his

4370
03:27:36,261 --> 03:27:38,630
winter when I started there were no

4371
03:27:37,370 --> 03:27:41,090
heaters and the reservoirs and they're

4372
03:27:38,629 --> 03:27:42,500
feeding the plants 54 degree water and

4373
03:27:41,090 --> 03:28:02,560
they couldn't get the pH of the [ __ ]

4374
03:27:42,500 --> 03:28:06,140
water to come up it's 30 degrees outside

4375
03:28:02,560 --> 03:28:07,729
thermometer was 54 degrees that's why

4376
03:28:06,140 --> 03:28:09,170
the pH won't move that's why the plants

4377
03:28:07,729 --> 03:28:11,649
have the claw they all had the [ __ ]

4378
03:28:09,170 --> 03:28:16,299
downward claw but the plants were purple

4379
03:28:11,649 --> 03:28:16,298
[Music]

4380
03:28:18,280 --> 03:28:25,090
they have put two in each one sentiments

4381
03:28:20,750 --> 03:28:25,090
74 degrees what a run to get the glass

4382
03:28:25,360 --> 03:28:37,069
beautifully there for heaters those

4383
03:28:35,540 --> 03:28:38,330
would have been more economical but I

4384
03:28:37,069 --> 03:28:40,101
didn't think of that because I'm not a

4385
03:28:38,329 --> 03:28:42,920
farm boy I just never thought of that

4386
03:28:40,101 --> 03:28:45,141
for sure I ordered a couple at the store

4387
03:28:42,920 --> 03:28:47,329
last winter nice we've been selling the

4388
03:28:45,140 --> 03:28:53,149
glass ones and I found the stainless

4389
03:28:47,329 --> 03:28:57,709
steel ones very quickly that glass ones

4390
03:28:53,149 --> 03:28:59,810
gonna break in there on accident fifty

4391
03:28:57,709 --> 03:29:02,600
gallons of water you know someday it

4392
03:28:59,810 --> 03:29:04,340
will but yeah that's a failsafe so

4393
03:29:02,601 --> 03:29:10,579
you're not gonna get shot right yeah

4394
03:29:04,340 --> 03:29:11,630
they're not in there right now yeah you

4395
03:29:10,579 --> 03:29:13,280
guys a lot of the [ __ ] you're gonna go

4396
03:29:11,629 --> 03:29:14,839
spend money on it the hydro store go

4397
03:29:13,280 --> 03:29:17,320
check out the aquarium store before you

4398
03:29:14,840 --> 03:29:20,690
do that because it's cheaper or even

4399
03:29:17,319 --> 03:29:22,789
Granger to be totally honest oh yeah to

4400

supply center has a lot of [ __ ] Home

4405

Depot and Lowe's and Target have a lot

4406
03:29:31,790 --> 03:29:37,069

4408
03:29:37,069 --> 03:29:40,520
consumed by you or your plant don't

4409

lighting that's cursed or specific still

4413

that's her baby nice she does a good job

4424
03:30:23,989 --> 03:30:27,800
I understand Springs they finally if I

4425
03:30:26,060 --> 03:30:29,210
were there I'd shot there but I'm right

4426
03:30:27,800 --> 03:30:32,091
up the street from the store in spring

4427
03:30:29,210 --> 03:30:41,120
statement as if I needed 14 bags of soil

4428
03:30:32,091 --> 03:30:42,470
I don't know that you'd have it that's

4429
03:30:41,120 --> 03:30:45,140
something we should mention commercial

4430
03:30:42,470 --> 03:30:46,370
orderings yeah good luck the first time

4431
03:30:45,140 --> 03:30:48,440
you want to figure out how much [ __ ]

4432
03:30:46,370 --> 03:30:49,939
soil you need to fill all those pots cuz

4433
03:30:48,440 --> 03:30:53,331
it's that's a math challenge you heard

4434
03:30:49,940 --> 03:30:55,069
Jesse and I say you're gonna have to go

4435
03:30:53,331 --> 03:30:58,460
back to the store a couple times don't

4436
03:30:55,069 --> 03:31:01,069
expect all stores you're gonna be able

4437
03:30:58,460 --> 03:31:03,020
to get commercial quantities of things

4438
03:31:01,069 --> 03:31:04,550
when you need them you need to think

4439
03:31:03,021 --> 03:31:07,431
ahead about stuff yeah you might have to

4440
03:31:04,550 --> 03:31:09,529
start letting we let the store near us

4441
03:31:07,431 --> 03:31:10,940
know that this is these are products

4442
03:31:09,530 --> 03:31:13,101
that we use on the regular if you keep

4443
03:31:10,940 --> 03:31:14,421
these stock we'll buy them if we come

4444
03:31:13,101 --> 03:31:16,341
here and you don't have it we will drive

4445
03:31:14,421 --> 03:31:18,890
directly to another store and get it

4446
03:31:16,341 --> 03:31:20,569
history no [ __ ] yeah and so it took

4447
03:31:18,890 --> 03:31:21,949
them a couple of rhythms you know it

4448
03:31:20,569 --> 03:31:23,239
took them a couple hey you don't have it

4449
03:31:21,950 --> 03:31:25,909

come Wednesday I don't care so we kind

4451
03:31:25,909 --> 03:31:29,841
of a job we compromise with that we

4452
03:31:28,489 --> 03:31:31,729
can't [ __ ] with the day the trucks run

4453
03:31:29,841 --> 03:31:33,649
like that's some [ __ ] we can't ask for

commercial account going for you like

4486
03:32:59,569 --> 03:33:02,840
Jesse said he said to hire somebody that

4487
03:33:01,459 --> 03:33:04,609
knows what the [ __ ] they're talking

4488
03:33:02,840 --> 03:33:06,380
about when it comes to working with your

4489
03:33:04,610 --> 03:33:08,120
engineer to build to grow something

4490
03:33:06,379 --> 03:33:09,920
super important that just sounds

4491
03:33:08,120 --> 03:33:11,931
egotistical coming from myself and Jesse

4492
03:33:09,920 --> 03:33:15,560
but also hire a master grower that is a

4493
03:33:11,931 --> 03:33:17,000
master grower interview people look at

4494
03:33:15,560 --> 03:33:21,020
pictures of plants they've grown I

4495
03:33:17,000 --> 03:33:23,000
brought people to my home grow to show

4496
03:33:21,021 --> 03:33:24,950
them that I can grow on a commercial

4497
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:26,569
scale as I here is what I can do if you

4498
03:33:24,950 --> 03:33:27,829
put me in a big grow I can do it and

4499
03:33:26,569 --> 03:33:29,270
they trusted me and they gave me the

4500
03:33:27,829 --> 03:33:31,870
opportunity by seeing the cleanliness

4501
03:33:29,271 --> 03:33:34,970
and the organization of my home grow

4502
03:33:31,870 --> 03:33:37,130
yeah you can go look at their grow

4503
03:33:34,969 --> 03:33:38,329
before you hire a master grower do it

4504
03:33:37,129 --> 03:33:39,529
and if you're the business guy and you

4505
03:33:38,329 --> 03:33:41,209
think you're gonna grow it yourself and

4506
03:33:39,530 --> 03:33:42,829
be professional you're gonna [ __ ] it up

4507
03:33:41,209 --> 03:33:44,209
I've got faith in your skills I've got

4508
03:33:42,829 --> 03:33:46,010
faith in your mind but cannabis is

4509
03:33:44,209 --> 03:33:47,390
something that takes a lot of practice

4510
03:33:46,010 --> 03:33:49,851
to learn it's like playing an instrument

4511
03:33:47,390 --> 03:33:51,681
you might have natural skill but you're

4512
03:33:49,851 --> 03:33:52,069
not gonna be Bon Jovi the first time you

4513
03:33:51,681 --> 03:33:53,810
grow

4514
03:33:52,069 --> 03:33:55,190
[ __ ] practice you're gonna have to

4515
03:33:53,809 --> 03:33:58,520
tour a few times you're gonna have to do

4516
03:33:55,190 --> 03:34:02,210
it ten cycles under your belt before you

4517
03:33:58,521 --> 03:34:04,730
even think about going big full cycles

4518
03:34:02,209 --> 03:34:06,139
from this clone all the way to drying

4519
03:34:04,729 --> 03:34:09,649
and curing all the way to move in the

4520
03:34:06,139 --> 03:34:12,949
packs there's a lot to figure out my

4521
03:34:09,649 --> 03:34:17,090
boss gets my head owner he gets down and

4522
03:34:12,950 --> 03:34:20,540
dirty in the Guru it's it's and he is

4523
03:34:17,090 --> 03:34:23,600
this like child like excitement about it

4524
03:34:20,540 --> 03:34:26,030
so [ __ ] awesome I've never I well I

4525
03:34:23,600 --> 03:34:29,090
know hunt he gets down in the room to

4526
03:34:26,030 --> 03:34:31,250
max for me all show comes in at 6:00 in

4527
03:34:29,090 --> 03:34:32,360
the morning on a certain Don Tuesday's

4528
03:34:31,250 --> 03:34:34,340
he'll be there at 6:00 in the morning

4529
03:34:32,360 --> 03:34:36,200
and I'll come in a couple few hours

4530
03:34:34,340 --> 03:34:57,260
later and he'll have a hundred pots

4531
03:34:36,200 --> 03:34:58,550
filled with sweeps I'm not too good to

4532
03:34:57,260 --> 03:34:59,809
clean the shooters and take out trash

4533
03:34:58,549 --> 03:35:00,500
but you're right I should be hands-on

4534
03:34:59,809 --> 03:35:03,079
with a plan

4535
03:35:00,500 --> 03:35:06,049
it feels good though to have to work for

4536
03:35:03,079 --> 03:35:08,760
people that realize you don't want to do

4537
03:35:06,049 --> 03:35:10,119
that stuff that you would do it but you

4538
03:35:08,760 --> 03:35:15,920
[Music]

4540
03:35:15,920 --> 03:35:19,360
giant facility all to myself

much about the industry or don't live in

4544
03:35:43,190 --> 03:35:48,710
Colorado is not common at all to find

4545
03:35:46,790 --> 03:35:50,930
owners that are actually involved in the

4546
03:35:48,709 --> 03:35:52,849
grill that's I think being Jeff are both

4547
03:35:50,930 --> 03:35:54,920
fortunate to work unfortunately it's

4548
03:35:52,850 --> 03:35:56,420
equally as common to find rich dudes

4549
03:35:54,920 --> 03:35:57,950
that own Porsche dealerships and want to

4550

[Music]

4555
03:36:05,489 --> 03:36:10,360
guys they just want to double up because

4556
03:36:07,601 --> 03:36:12,431

real master grower loops around a lot of

4559
03:36:14,860 --> 03:36:17,829
people want to hire their cousin because

4560
03:36:16,329 --> 03:36:19,060
they want to give their cousin a job or

their nephew or their [ __ ]

4562
03:36:19,060 --> 03:36:24,251
brother-in-law because he grew weed in

4567
03:36:31,390 --> 03:36:36,431
thousand bird to get started and then

4568
03:36:34,329 --> 03:36:38,800
you need like another four hundred for

4569
03:36:36,431 --> 03:36:40,091
some payroll and whatever pops up and

4570
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:43,989
you're gonna need a lawyer and an

4571

accountant it's a million bucks just for

4572

03:36:54,399 --> 03:36:57,600
the line

4578
03:36:55,569 --> 03:37:00,130
some of us growers are weird people oh

4579
03:36:57,601 --> 03:37:01,450
we've been taught to hide this for so

4580
03:37:00,130 --> 03:37:03,010
many years the guys that are good at it

4581
03:37:01,450 --> 03:37:05,131
did it like when we were hiding it and

4582
03:37:03,011 --> 03:37:07,479
we're kind of sketchy about it so

4583
03:37:05,130 --> 03:37:09,960
sometimes some of our background history

4584
03:37:07,479 --> 03:37:12,279
on the application is a little vague

4585
03:37:09,960 --> 03:37:13,560
sometimes we've got a big furry ass

4586
03:37:12,280 --> 03:37:15,881
beard they could have squirrels I

4587
03:37:13,560 --> 03:37:17,140
sometimes you got dreadlocks down to

4588
03:37:15,880 --> 03:37:19,751
your ass they could have the whole damn

4589
03:37:17,140 --> 03:37:21,850
Zoo hidin in it they don't we don't like

4590
03:37:19,751 --> 03:37:28,690
sharing secrets we don't like to share

4591
03:37:21,851 --> 03:37:30,700
too many secrets owners by street people

4592
03:37:28,690 --> 03:37:32,140
by friends by family things have gone

4593
03:37:30,700 --> 03:37:35,221
wrong so we're a little we're a little

4594
03:37:32,140 --> 03:37:38,619
protective of ourselves of our knowledge

4595
03:37:35,220 --> 03:37:41,890
it's one thing I had my phosphate the

4596
03:37:38,620 --> 03:37:43,150
other day growers are some of the only

4597
03:37:41,890 --> 03:37:45,159
people in the industry that don't

4598
03:37:43,149 --> 03:37:50,859
actually need a job right they could go

4599
03:37:45,159 --> 03:37:53,079
make their own money didn't there's more

4600
03:37:50,860 --> 03:37:55,601
money being a black market grower than I

4601
03:37:53,079 --> 03:37:56,739
ever have in the legal industry but I

4602
03:37:55,601 --> 03:37:59,051
don't have to look over my shoulder

4603
03:37:56,739 --> 03:38:01,060
anymore I don't have to when I hear

4604
03:37:59,050 --> 03:38:02,591
rustling outside the front door too

4605
03:38:01,060 --> 03:38:04,300
early I don't think the door is about to

4606
03:38:02,591 --> 03:38:05,950
get kicked the [ __ ] because I spent

4607
03:38:04,300 --> 03:38:07,989
20 years of my life just wondering is

4608
03:38:05,950 --> 03:38:10,240
today the day they kicked this [ __ ] in

4609
03:38:07,989 --> 03:38:13,569
you can get a loan for card

4610
03:38:10,239 --> 03:38:15,310
it's hard work but I've got he can get

4611
03:38:13,569 --> 03:38:16,510
done brand-new car in the driveway that

4612
03:38:15,310 --> 03:38:18,129
I couldn't have done when I was a street

4613
03:38:16,510 --> 03:38:21,220
hustle or because now I've got paychecks

4614
03:38:18,129 --> 03:38:22,539
and taxes yeah I pay child support

4615
03:38:21,220 --> 03:38:24,159
because I've got a child that lives with

4616
03:38:22,540 --> 03:38:25,271
their mom and just because we don't live

4617

4630
03:38:49,479 --> 03:38:54,189
worth the difference

4631
03:38:50,681 --> 03:38:55,750
it's the distress reduction although

4632
03:38:54,190 --> 03:38:57,810
there's other stress that comes from it

4633
03:38:55,750 --> 03:39:02,709
right the different kind of stress just

4634
03:38:57,810 --> 03:39:04,899

owe my company are from George in Texas

4742
03:43:59,079 --> 03:44:03,511
[Music]

4743
03:44:00,470 --> 03:44:06,149
it's really good how many how many

4744
03:44:03,511 --> 03:44:07,920
milligrams of THC per serving um that's

4745
03:44:06,149 --> 03:44:10,859
part of the thing we're figuring out

4746
03:44:07,920 --> 03:44:13,710
right okay the bottles good it's gotta

4747
03:44:10,860 --> 03:44:16,230
be limited at 100 100 a smaller bottle

4748
03:44:13,709 --> 03:44:19,739
okay but it's but I think it'll be like

4749
03:44:16,229 --> 03:44:20,909
two servings so 50 milligrams so gonna

4750
03:44:19,739 --> 03:44:23,130
make some red you could just squirt the

4751
03:44:20,909 --> 03:44:24,329
whole bottle across the ribs as the heat

4752
03:44:23,130 --> 03:44:25,859
when you're cooking the ribs gonna [ __ ]

4753
03:44:24,329 --> 03:44:27,569
up my medicine that's one of the things

4754
03:44:25,860 --> 03:44:31,159
we've got to figure out all right

4755
03:44:27,569 --> 03:44:33,209
[Music]

4756
03:44:31,159 --> 03:44:34,979
hypothetically talking about BBQ ribs

4757
03:44:33,209 --> 03:44:37,859
over here I had no idea the proofing

4758
03:44:34,979 --> 03:44:40,140
process the state requires for for a new

4759
03:44:37,860 --> 03:44:43,681
new style and it's rigorous then we're

4760
03:44:40,140 --> 03:44:46,680
doing popcorn balls to oh I had some

4761
03:44:43,681 --> 03:44:51,159
popcorn balls that were coated and clear

4762
03:44:46,680 --> 03:44:52,899
hi that's a part of the a lot of art

4763
03:44:51,159 --> 03:44:54,219
demand we've been getting for clay right

4764
03:44:52,899 --> 03:44:56,289
now it's coming from edibles

4765
03:44:54,219 --> 03:44:58,029
manufacturers nice they don't want any

4766
03:44:56,290 --> 03:45:00,070
smell right it makes it so much easier

4767
03:44:58,030 --> 03:45:02,200
and it's more viscous it's easier to

4768
03:45:00,069 --> 03:45:03,940
work with it's not chunky like pho it's

4769
03:45:02,200 --> 03:45:09,970
a higher percentage so it's easier to

4770
03:45:03,940 --> 03:45:13,510
work with my friends at titi extractions

4771
03:45:09,969 --> 03:45:16,209
they gave me a 1000 milligram chokolate

4772
03:45:13,510 --> 03:45:17,021
bar it was kind of like biting into

4773
03:45:16,209 --> 03:45:18,189
taste

4774
03:45:17,021 --> 03:45:19,659
they told me if there's a gram and a

4775
03:45:18,190 --> 03:45:22,569
half of shatter melted into that

a half of shatter into a chocolate bar

4778
