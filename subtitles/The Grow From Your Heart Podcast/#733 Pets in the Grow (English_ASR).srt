00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,599
let's talk about the main topic of

68
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,598
today's podcast uh let me let you know

69
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,238
how i got to this point of the podcast i

70
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,000
have been um maybe co-parenting maybe

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,519
pup sitting some dogs i've got two

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,039
wonderful dogs hanging out i can see

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,560
them just behind the cameras they're

74
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,079
chewing on some bones keep themselves

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,000
entertained for a while

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,480
but it brought me up a bunch of great

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,719
stuff to talk about for the podcast here

78
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,199
my first question is do you take your

79
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,759
dogs into the grow space that's my big

80
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,238
question i prefer not to have the dogs

81
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,759
in the grow i operate i was operating in

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,280
a lot of commercial environments a lot

83
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,759
of large growers

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,158
grow is a large part of my livelihood so

85
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,518
taking a dog in there uh i don't have

86
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:10,959
any fear that these dogs are going to

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,480
damage the plants and the equipment

88
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,080
they're not going to get into anything

89
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,399
they're pretty good dogs

90
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
but what about all of the pests the

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
things that are in all of their fur i'm

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,598
not saying those dogs are dirty but we

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,039
went for a walk today and i watched one

94
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,439
dog run through the lawn the other one

95
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,120
rubbed up up against a couple of bushes

96
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,239
we go on hikes we go out in the woods we

97
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
go out in the desert we go out in the

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,239
trees we go everywhere these dogs are

99
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,840
gathering all sorts of things so do we

100
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,480
bring our dogs in the grow rooms because

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,239
if we do i fear we are spreading those

102
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,598
whatever they gathered into the grow

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,759
room but also then i think about it um

104
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,518
am i bringing that in just on my pants

105
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,039
on my shoes and my dreadlocks i know

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
it's disgusting right i could have

107
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,318
whatever the dogs walked across they

108
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,518
snuggled up against me it's on my pants

109
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,119
it's on my clothes it's on your clothes

110
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,519
and your pants do i just happen to have

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
dreadlocks down to my ankles uh maybe

112
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,120
calves maybe i'm exaggerating they do

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400
hit the calves i got dreads at least

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,640
past the knee so i've got a lot of

115
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,319
opportunity to gather things uh so am i

116
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,759
any worse than the dogs or the dogs any

117
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,919
worse than me that was something i was

118
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,000
thinking about today on a very stoned

119
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,399
dog walk which we will talk about a

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,959
little bit later but anything that ends

121
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,798
up on that dog is gonna end up on your

122
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,199
shoes your clothes your pants your

123
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,519

126
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,720

127
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,400
dogs and i said hike i apologize if you

128
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,840

135
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,639

136
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,079

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,280
the car it's going to get in the car

138
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,159
seat it's going to get in your clothes

139
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,519
it's going to come to the house it's

140
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,040
going to get on the couch are you

141
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,719
changing clothes immediately when you

142
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,560
get home are you vacuuming out the car

143
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,880
all the time so i'm curious about the

144
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,120
dogs in the grow space grow environment

145
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,439
i personally choose not to let the dogs

146
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,959
in the grow but i walked the dogs and

147
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,240
then i came in the house and i went and

148
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,680
i had to do some things so i had to

149
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
quickly change clothes and then go to

150
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,199
the grow space and i'm wondering are

151
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,879
there any things that i just introduced

152
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,439
to that girl i love the dogs to death so

153
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,279
it's a kind of a a barrier to figure out

154
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,199
there so another thing you have to think

155
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,918
about when you have dogs around is all

156
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,520
the dog hair and photos i used to have a

157
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,959
dog that lived here with me uh for

158
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,719
several years she passed away rest in

159
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,000
peace gin dog if you guys remember the

160
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,000
old shows back in the day sometimes

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
you'd hear uh her footsteps tap across

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,680
the floor here when we were recording

163
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,320
big up to jin dog miss yaboo

164
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,000
but that dog would get dog fur in the

165
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,240
photos just the dog fur would end up on

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,240
me i'd go take a great cannabis photo

167
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,000
nine out of ten times the best photos i

168
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
ever took would have a little piece of

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,079
dog for and there so ginger would be in

170
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,160
the photos all the time um we used to

171
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,758
say that you could tell a bag of wheat

172
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
is really good weed and it was grown

173
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,960
with love if there are a couple of dog

174
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,560
hairs in your ounce that's how you know

175
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,918
it's really good weed so big up to all

176
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,439
the growers out there with a dog i'm

177
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,758
just curious do you take your dog into

178
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,600
the grove do you feel like your dog is

179
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,120
compromising your integrated pest

180
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,199
management strategy is that something

181
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,360
that we need to improve or work on if we

182
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,360
do have our dogs around in the outdoor

183
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
grow bring the dog around the dog works

184
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,038
as security the dog loves the plants a

185
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,719
dog's good companionship in the indoor

186
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,800
environment i may choose not to bring

187
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,319
the dog in there but like i rambled on

188
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,319
about am i just carrying the things i

189
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,400

190
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,160
scratch on the dog make silly dog voices

191
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,839
then i walk into the house change

192
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
clothes walk into the grow room where

193
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,198
the dogs are where the plants are i

194
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,879
probably didn't clean up well enough

195
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,400
definitely something in the dreadlocks

196
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,159
carried some [ __ ] in there all right

197
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,279

198
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,199

not comfortable blowing any smoke in

203
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,239
their direction yet uh when i'm given

204
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,639

206
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,519
then maybe they may get stoned but so

207
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,720
far at this point those dogs have not

208
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,799
been stoned i did have pets in the past

209
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880
that some of those pets love to smoke

210
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,478
and some of those pets hated to smoke i

211
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,759
mentioned gin dog a minute ago shout out

212
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,800

214
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,319
around the smoke she didn't like edibles

215
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,240
she did not want anything to do with

216
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,240
weed if it got too smoky in the car too

217
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,519
smokey in the room uh she would try to

218
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,680
find a way out you'd have to open a

219
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,918
window give ginger some air however i

220
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,598
had some cats back in the day

221
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,359
that yeah i'm not really a cat guy but i

222
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,120
lived in an apartment it was kind of a

223
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,000
multiple people environment one of the

224
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,759
people's there had cats uh i would smoke

225
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
weed regularly in that house through a

226
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,680
big bong i had a really cool big bong

227
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,839
every time i would get out that bong and

228
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,478
start breaking up my weed those cats

229
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,598
would just come surround me they'd start

230
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,038
circling me and just meow meow meow and

231
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,560
i'd take a big fat bong rip and i

232
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,079
wouldn't blow it directly at the cats

233
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,680
i'd blow it kind of at the floor and

234
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,800
they would just go bask in that smoke

235
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,240
and they would get stoned and after a

236
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,639
couple of bong rips the cats would leave

237
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560
me alone so i really think the cats

238
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,079
loved to smoke weed with me they loved

239
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,079
to get blazed anytime i would roll a

240
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,839
joint bust out the bong those cats would

241
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,918
be like oh yeah and they just come

242
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,119
cruise around and do they rub up against

243
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,159
you and they purr and i'd blow them a

244
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,680
couple bong hits and they'd leave me

245
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,120
alone they'd be content they just go do

246
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,478
cat [ __ ] around the house and be dicks

247
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,560
like cats do

248
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,839
however ginger dog if you blew a bong

249
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,038
rip at her she'd growl at you and put

250
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,399
her head down and try to hold her breath

251
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,000
and be like dude why did you just do

252
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,239
that to me you're ruining my life gin

253
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,160
dog hated bong rips these dogs um when i

254
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,240
turn on the dab torch they come wherever

255
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,360
they are if i fire up the dab torch if

256
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,639
they're in the living room if they're

257
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,919
trying to go out to the backyard right

258
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,519
now they're chewing up bones if i fired

259
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,598
up the dab torch they'd come hang out i

260
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,918
think they enjoy either uh hanging out

261
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,519
with me while i dab or they want to get

262
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,958
high i'm not sure yet gotta ask their

263
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,639
mommy for permission and she will tell

264
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,038
me no so they'll never find out if they

265
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,360
like smoking uh where am i on the notes

266
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,360
uh with that being said i'll never force

267
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
smoking upon an animal i'll never give

268
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,879
an animal um edibles or anything that

269
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,320
they if they don't enjoy it if they

270
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,958
haven't showed any interest in it i will

271
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,640
not do that to a dog gin dog ate edibles

272
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,838
one time that were they weren't meant

273
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,120
for her to eat she stole them off a

274
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,399
table i never thought she'd do that she

275
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,320
was a better dog than that at that time

276
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,958
but she stole some edibles and got

277
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,480
high she was too high and she did not

278
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,239
enjoy that she was [ __ ] up for a long

279
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,399
time so after that i never gave her

280
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
edibles again she never wanted to smoke

281
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,399
but i would never force it on an animal

282
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,720
you guys do not force medicate your

283
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,320
animals unless maybe if you're giving

284
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,440
them like cbd for a medical condition

285
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,800
but if you're just getting them high to

286
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,080
be a dick don't do that if you're giving

287
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,000
if you're treating them for a medical

288
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,759
condition and they're uh every animal is

289
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,600
resistant to taking medication they'd

290
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,799
know they'll take they'll eat everything

291
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,080
they're not supposed to eat until you

292
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,439
try to give them some medicine i'm like

293
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,360
oh that's good for me i shouldn't eat

294
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,040
that that's not rabbit poop i'm not

295
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,200
gonna eat that yeah animals are trippy

296
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,639
like that but let's not force our dogs

297
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,680
to get high that's not cool unless they

298
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:40,319
really enjoy it um something i was going

299
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,759
to talk about ginger dog gin dog dude

300
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,720
there's nothing i mentioned earlier

301
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,559
those stoned as [ __ ] dog walks there is

302
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,639
nothing like getting

303
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,399
ultra blazed i may allegedly have done

304
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,240
this this morning i may have taken

305
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
excessive dabs this morning and got

306
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,799
these dogs all laced up on their leashes

307
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,879
and went for a really nice dog dog walk

308
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,199
nothing like getting lit up

309
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,439
and going for a long blaze dog walk in

310

you got someone to talk to the people

312
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,040

313
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,639
to those dogs like they're [ __ ]

maybe 11 o'clock at night in the spring

321
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,680
and the summertime maybe early fall when

322

325
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:32,399
in the ass but in the nice weather time

326
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,399
if my dog saw me grab the grinder and

327
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,320
some papers and a bag of weed she'd

328
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,000
watch me she's like oh [ __ ] he's rolling

329
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
a joint it's like 10 o'clock he's

330
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
rolling a joint she'd watch me roll up a

331
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,278
joint roll up a couple of joints and set

332
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,040
him on the side of the desk if she saw

333
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,879
me go get my shoes and shoes and socks

334
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,799
she'd be like oh [ __ ]

335
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,240
it might be time it might be time but

336
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,879
you start wiggling it's here get all

337
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,720
excited if i grab that leash that dog

338
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,399
would know oh my god we're going for a

339
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,480
10 o'clock joint walk it's going to be

340
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,600
one of those nights and we just go walk

341
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,519
around the neighborhood and smoke a

342
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,440
couple of joints and just walk the dog

343
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,240
something about that was just so

344
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,760
satisfying so pleasing so relaxing just

345
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
cruising the neighborhood with my dog i

346
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,519
feel like ah i'm just a weird looking

347
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,519
dude i guess i'm a [ __ ] tall white

348
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,879
guy with dreadlocks down to my ass

349
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,480
in kind of a nicer neighborhood so

350
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,320
walking around late at night here for no

351
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,079
reason may look a little bit sketchy but

352
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,760
if i got the dog you got a really good

353
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,199
excuse to be out i'm just a guy a hippie

354
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,439
guy walking the hippie dog that looks

355
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,879
really natural and who wouldn't expect

356
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,480
me to be smoking a joint if you saw my

357
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,000
hippie ass walking with my dog and i

358
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,440
wasn't smoking a joint then you'd think

359
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,120
i'm up to something so smoking a joint

360
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
lets you know what i'm up to i'm out

361
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,560
walking my dog smoking a joint here

362
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,679
comes the dog to say hi hi boy please

363
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,199
don't interrupt the recording don't

364
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,399
knock anything over he's going to come

365
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,160
sit by me because you heard me talking

366
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,519
about him but going and walking and

367
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,879
smoking a couple of joints is great

368
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,480
nobody cares that i'm out there smoking

369
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,919
a couple of joints and by the time if

370
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,039
anybody does say anything by the time

371
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,479
i'm done

372
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,679
walking past them they forgot about it

373
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,039
and then by the time anybody would show

374
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,120
up to harass me the joint would be out

375
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:58,319
i'm just walking dogs no problem so

376
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,480
nothing like a nice 10 30 11 pm dog walk

377
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,920
my dog would get so excited jimmy see me

378
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,360
roll those joints grab my shoes and

379
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,559
she'd just be watching is he going to

380
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
get the leash is he going to get the

381
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,958
leash and as soon as i would i have the

382
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
leash in one spot i would keep it up on

383
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,919
top of the fridge just out of the way if

384
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,680
you saw me reach up there she'd be like

385
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,519
oh god here we go and she started

386
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,120
spinning in circles she knew that was

387
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,959
the coolest [ __ ] ever you guys have been

388
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,799
rambling on long enough about walking

389
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,799
our dogs and pets let me make sure i

390
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,399
covered all these notes here uh they're

391
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,399
carriers of bugs but we love them so

392
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,839
much so they're worth their [ __ ]

393
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,360
um those things end up in your clothes

394
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,800
in your shoes so do you change your

395
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,159
clothes and your shoes before you go

396
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
into your grow space especially after

397
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,159
playing with your animals that may be

398
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,600
helping you out um is there dog hair in

399
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,439
your photos that's how we know you got

400
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,278
pets if there's dog hair in the weed

401
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,519
that's how we know you're growing really

402
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,120
good we don't force your pets to consume

403
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,278
cannabis unless you're giving them some

404
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,039
sort of medication some sort of medicine

405
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,078
uh getting them high especially blowing

406
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,240

that keeping an eye on this dog because

424
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,879
he's fired up he's feisty let's jump

425
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,240
into some emails before i've got to wrap

426
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,838
up this podcast this one came from our

427
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,320
friend they want their name said it

428
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,320
doesn't even have their name on it um it

429
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,680
goes a lot like this it says when you

430
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,079
think a mother plant needs to be

431
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,759
replaced do you grow them or just ditch

432
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,359
them that's a very good question this is

433
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,078
kind of controversial between mike and

434
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,800
myself it says i've had bad luck growing

435
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,879
them out mostly just really low yields

436
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,639
one strain just died two times i tried

437
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,879
it also i was listening to your latest

438
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,039
episode talk of your love of comedy and

439
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,799
podcast you should try the ice cream

440
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,879
social then he sent me a link to the ice

441
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,319
cream social i will do my best to

442
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,399
remember to check that out i've got a

443
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,879
link so that makes it easy thank you big

444
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,480
up for being a podcast and a comedy fan

445
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,799
let's talk a little bit about mother

446
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,639
plants and if we should flip them or

447
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,838
just toss them and replace them that's

448
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,680
really

449
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,079
all about your strategy your needs your

450
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,838
wants and your goals i replace my mother

451
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,359
plants about two maybe three times a

452
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,600
year depending on

453
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,159
uh the lights the plants the health of

454
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,800
the plants just timing the way [ __ ] goes

455
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,039
every three maybe every six months ish

456
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,958
they do need a replacement so i do take

457
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,480
a bunch of clones as soon as i get them

458
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,719
potted and rooted then i cut down the

459
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,399
big plants and throw them away or

460
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
sometimes they get moved into a

461
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,759
flowering room or sometimes they will

462
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,560
get taken outdoors and bloom outdoors so

463
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,078
the determining factors are i'd like to

464
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,000
know what i'm going to do with those

465
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,838
plants before i start taking clones i

466
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,839
already know that i need them from

467
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,639
others for genetic preservation to

468
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,399
provide clones and just to keep that uh

469
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,959
that genetic alive that cultivar needs

470
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,600
to exist via the mother plant so a lot

471
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,439
of times i will know my goal

472
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,278
for that plant the ultimate goal is it

473
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,639
going to be is it going to go outdoors

474
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,159
is it going to get tossed is it going to

475
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,159
be a big clone donor is it going to go

476
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,240
indoors to get flowered i already have

477
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,799
that goal in mind when i start taking

478
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,480
cuts the very first time so let's say i

479
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,838
just got a new plant i'm going to make

480
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,680
it a mother plant here it is this

481
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,199
microphone is my new mother plant i'm

482
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,519
going to grow it

483
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,359
i'm going to i'm going to grow it out

484
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,120
the first time i take cuts off of it

485
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,800
i've got a strategy is this going to end

486
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,320
up outdoors is it going to end up in the

487
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,838
flower room indoors is it going to make

488
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,759
a bunch of clones or is it just going to

489
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,240
end up dead on the floor after i've got

490
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,720
the cuts i need i will start that plan

491
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,720
from the time i get it from the time i

492
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,320
cut this clone and grow it into a plant

493
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,920
that i can work with now i've got an

494
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,839
idea of what it's going to be

495
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,198
90 of the time i always take that main

496
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
top right out of the middle just to make

497
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,799
the bottoms grow up and catch up so

498
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,560
that's going to be my first clone and

499
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,078
then i usually go to the bottom and take

500
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,399
three or four clones off the bottom just

501
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,159
to clean it up and lollipop it ah make

502
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,759
it give it a little bit of health then i

503
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,439
can start making it spread out the way

504
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,278
that i need to from there if it's going

505
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,120
to go outside i want a lot of tops i

506
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,720
want to make it a big bush if it's going

507
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,480
to go indoors i have to keep it short

508
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,720
and squat so i take lots of clones off

509
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,399
the top all the time if it's going to be

510
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,000
somebody that it's just going to donate

511
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,480
a lot of clones

512
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,759
i will top it low early i apologize if

513
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,278
you hear the dog drinking water in the

514
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,480
background things are different here we

515
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,838
will make adjustments and get this

516
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,600
corrected but you may hear the dogs

517
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,000
drinking right now um if i'm going to

518
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,079
make a lot of clones i'll top it early

519
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,440
that way it will spread out real far and

520
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,519
then i'll just keep topping it to give

521
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,360
me a lot of heads and a lot of tops and

522
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,639
every intersection where i get a node

523
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
coming up and there's a branch coming

524
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,240
off one way and a branch going one way

525
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,078
i'll cut it right between those cut the

526
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,360
peace sign out of it that way i get two

527
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,439
tops and then i'll do that again and

528
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
repeat that that way i can make a bunch

529
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,759
and a bunch of clones that plant will

530
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,120
probably end up getting cloned to death

531
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,480
and then as soon as i get roots off of

532
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,720
my clones that one gets chopped down and

533
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,800
thrown away so it's all about what i'm

534
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,040
going to do with that plant the ultimate

535
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,039
goal if i want to put it outside it'll

536
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,480
get [ __ ] topped and spread out real

537
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,078
far if i'm going to put it indoors it's

538
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,920
got to stay squat and low because my

539
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,678
indoor environment is kind of low if

540
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,678
it's going to be a clone donor it gets

541
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,240
topped early spread out a lot pulled

542
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,400
down so i can make a lot a lot of clone

543
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,959
material from that plant so it's all

544
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,400
about the original or the ultimate goal

545
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
when i get that clone i already know

546
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,679
that idea before i start mothering that

547
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,038
plant out i have an idea of where it's

548
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,038
going to go

549
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,558
they do need to be replaced about every

550
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,318
three to six months maybe more

551
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,078
frequently depending on the health of

552
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:29,599
your plant and your grow environment the

553
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,839
rate of growth the lights you've got the

554
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,319
genetics my congo plant i've got that

555
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,000
robert street roberts creek congo that

556
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,519
[ __ ] grows three times taller and

557
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,079
faster than everybody else so i gotta

558
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,639
top her replace her every so often the

559
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:45,199
chem daily chem grows super fast however

560
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,360
that uh the unicorn poop doesn't grow at

561
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
all so i don't need to replace that one

562
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,959
very often it just makes a few shoots

563
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,319
super easy to manage super easy to

564
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,240
handle so it's all about the genetics

565
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,399
all about the plants do i grow them or

566
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,240
just ditch them uh it depends sometimes

567
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,840
they go outside and get pollinated

568
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,319
sometimes they go outside and make big

569
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,399
buds sometimes i cut a bunch of cuts off

570
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,000
of them and give the cuts to my friends

571
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,000
i just kind of depends on the ultimate

572
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,880
goal then it says you've had bad luck

573
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,119
growing them out mostly low yields

574
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,320
that's because probably i'm not there i

575
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,359
don't see what's going on i don't have

576
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,279
any evidence but probably just uh poor

577
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,199
preparation you're more focused on them

578
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,359
being mother plants uh you're more

579
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,919
focused on them providing cuts so you're

580
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,719
not preparing them to be floured plants

581
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,320
you're not giving them uh the proper uh

582
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,079
the proper preparation that was hard for

583
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,000
my brain to even put together but they

584
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,759
weren't prepared properly to be floured

585
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,400
plants you're only focusing on them as

586
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,319
mothers and oftentimes

587
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
we don't focus enough on the veg or the

588
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,159
mothers we think we just need them alive

589
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,839
we need them in there when they get into

590
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,240
flower we'll really spoil them really

591
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,159
take care of them and that is not really

592
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,240
a uh a good way that's not a best

593
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,558
practice you need a good solid

594
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,919
foundation and the foundation starts at

595
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,759
the mother plant because you want a

596
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,440
healthy mother plant to provide a

597
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,679
healthy clone the strong clone turns

598
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,558
into a strong veg plant turns into a bad

599
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,559
ass flowering plant you can't start off

600
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,319
with a crappy weak mother plant or an

601
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,038
unhealthy mother plant or an unhealthy

602
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,439
clone we gotta have the veg the moms the

603
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,759
clones everything all the way up to dry

604
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,759
and cure harvest all has to be a hundred

605
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,839
percent top-notch if you want it to be

606
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,599
top-notch so i'm not accusing you i'm

607
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,319
not pointing fingers but a possibility

608
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,759
an option is that maybe your veg room

609
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,599
your mother plants aren't getting the

610
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,640
care the love that they need so they're

611
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,480
not as uh healthy and optimal as you can

612
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,160
have them when it is time to flower them

613
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,079
and make buds out of them that is one

614
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,440
thing that could be occurring again i

615
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,639
don't know the situation but i'm just

616
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,160
going with what i've got please don't

617
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,720
feel like i'm accusing you blaming

618
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,720
anything on you although it's your grow

619
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,279
so uh maybe they're just not prepared

620
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,798
and then it says one just died are they

621
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,240
root bound are they getting too root

622
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,839
bound are they going

623
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,200
are they in larger pots before you

624
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,119
flower them are they going their whole

625
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,798
lives in a three a five a seven gallon

626
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,239
pot and then you're flowering them out

627
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,319
they're getting root bound are you over

628
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,960
watering them is it just the stress and

629
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,879
the shock from going uh from being a mom

630
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,279
plant being in veg constantly into a

631
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,039
flower room are you putting them outside

632
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,038
there are a lot of variables here but i

633
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,558
would think maybe uh they're getting

634
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,158
root bound or something if they're just

635
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,440
dying or maybe that light stress is

636
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,080
killing them or maybe you're over

637
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,480
watering i really think it is an overall

638
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,000
plant health issue you're not treating

639
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,679
them other plants from the very

640
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
beginning as plants that are going to be

641
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,600
flowered you're using them just simply

642
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,120
as genetic preservation uh they're not

643
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,959
getting the love the care the attention

644
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,798
they're not robust enough they don't

645
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,200
have the strength the vigor to follow

646
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,279
through and continue as powerful

647
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,880
flowering plants that is my guess my

648
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,279
estimate again i don't have a lot of

649
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,080
information here so i'm just going with

650
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,279
what i can guess with um dude thank you

651
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,359

652

direction thank you for the great

658
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,120
question let's get your mother plant

659
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,279
styled in so that we can keep you on a

660
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,279
perpetual cycle some people will

661
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,079
actually take their mother plants cut a

662
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,440
few clones from it um then flower the

663
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,798
mother plant so that they don't ever

664
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,798
actually have a mother plant it's a

665
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,720
perpetual cycle where we're using a

666
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,200
mother plant a veg plant as a mother

667
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,079
plant so you veg it grow it cut clones

668
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,319
from it

669
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,480
then put that one into flour then grow

670
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,558
some of those clones out veg those put

671
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,558
those into flour it's a perpetual cycle

672
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:27,440
without a mother plant so if we can keep

673
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:28,879
you

674
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,038
in healthy plants we can create a

675
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,520
perpetual cycle that way without any

676
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,839
struggles and without plants dying early

677
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,440
in the flowering phase all right i do

678
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,599

show i went from harvesting shitty

724
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,519
genetics in a substandard plant

725
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,840
environment to growing some dank

726
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,798
genetics and even making my own silver

727
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:15,279
thiosulfate solution femme seeds and

728
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,879
growing out dank that i have bred myself

729

00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,279
sounds like you were kind of struggling

732
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,678
and trying to figure it out to breeding

733
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,918
your own seeds and harvesting them and

734
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,960
growing some dank from those seeds that

735
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,640
is a full

736
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,240

741
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,799
popped a pack of saka souffle i'm

742
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,480
looking for that bubble gum cough syrup

743
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,240
terp i hope you find that one bro that's

744
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,400

745
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,880

thank you for uh the encouragement thank

747
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,720
you for the compliments and

748
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,520
congratulations on your uh improvements

749
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,919
and your success now it does say on to

750
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:03,038
the question i just recently picked up a

751
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,120
pack of seeds which were labeled gmo

752
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,480
bx3f2

753
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,239
i already see where this is going that

754
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,558
could get confusing

755
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,319
then there is a description it says the

756
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:16,399
larry og clone was crossed into sfvog to

757
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,319
provide the original male pollen on the

758
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,720
first back cross the breeder selected

759
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:24,720
plants from the bx3 to make his f2c

760
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,960
now it does go on it says how much

761
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,120
variation would one expect to find in a

762
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,519
second filial generation of something

763
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,119
that has been back crossed three times

764
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,639
thanks from

765
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,399
dinger all right there's one part here

766
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,200
where it says the larry og clone was

767
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,880
crossed to sfv og to provide the pollen

768
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,080
all right to make the first original

769
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,200
back cross

770
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,639
so then

771
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,120
that's not a back cross that's an

772
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,720
outcross right unless larry og and

773
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,079
that's not so anyway we're gonna skip

774
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,600
that part because parts of that right

775
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,119
there do make it sound a little bit

776
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,439
wonky i'm not sure what that part is

777
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:59,119
about let's talk about this labeling of

778
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,400
gmo bx3f2 and then we'll answer the rest

779
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,439
of the question because i want to cover

780
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,720
this so gmo

781
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,200
bx3 that sounds like just a bunch of

782
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,679
random stuff somebody has the gmo plan

783
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,440
i've talked about gmo before it does not

784
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,720
stand for garlic mushroom onions get

785
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,400
that out of your head that's [ __ ]

786
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,880
that's not what it stands for

787
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,720
gmo is called gmo because it smells like

788
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
crazy chemicals and it's got girl scout

789
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,558
the strained girl scout cookies in it

790
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,400
and when it got popular the girl scout

791
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,599
cookies were under scrutiny for it being

792
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,320
discovered that they were using

793
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,798
genetically modified organisms and their

794
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,879
fancy ass girl scout cookies so at the

795
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,519
time they called the girl scout cookies

796
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,760
cross that smelled like chemicals gmo

797
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,440
ask skunk mask to flex that's the

798
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,919
[ __ ] story quit making [ __ ] up you

799
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,360
guys let's get back to it gmo we've got

800
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,919
a gmo bx3 that means that somebody took

801
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,240
a gmo plant and they backcrossed it to

802
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,080
one of its parents in this story that i

803
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,440
read part of it is convoluted so we're

804
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,839
going to leave that part out but we're

805
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,960
going to say for the sake of uh real

806
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:01,119
talk here they took the gmo plant and bx

807
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,038
threed it that means they took the gmo

808
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,879
plant probably the female

809
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,599
so they took the gmo plant they've got

810
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,000
the female gmo then they take a male

811
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,519
plant there was a parent of the gmo

812
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,400
that's where the story confuses me here

813
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,759
because i don't know the exact

814
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,240
appearance of the gmo i don't think it

815
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,440
was larry og i don't think it was sfv so

816
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,880
we're gonna leave that part out but

817
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,200
we'll talk about this just for the sake

818
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,320
of what the real bx3 is they took the

819
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,000
gmo then they took a parent of the gmo

820
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,439
to make it a real back cross you take a

821
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,038
parent of it and pollinate that to the

822
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,960
new gmo so it's just a parent

823
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,640
pollinating a child which sounds crazy

824
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,840
but in plants that does work that's why

825
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,080
it's a bat cross we went back we took a

826
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:42,158
parent a child and we pollen it went

827
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,759
back and got pollen from a parent and

828
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,080
put that on the plant now we've made our

829
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,839
bx1 now we're going to grow those out

830
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,399
we're going to find a plant that looks

831
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,599
just like the gmo now they could have

832
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,519
done a couple of things i'm not sure

833
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,599
which way they did it but at this point

834
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,440
you take pollen from one plant and put

835
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,359
it on the female that way we're using

836
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,759
the parent plant and the offspring to

837
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,839
keep going original parent to further

838
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,240
generation offspring the idea here is to

839
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,558
lock in those traits of the gmo to make

840
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,480
it look just like gmo every time that's

841
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,079
why we back cross it and this would be

842
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,480
done because maybe we don't have an

843
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,879
original pollen donor maybe we've got a

844
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,480
female maybe we've only got a male

845
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,960
back crossing could be done for several

846
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,200
reasons and they do explain the pollen

847
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,798
they use but that that dilutes the story

848
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,399
of the back cross and that that makes it

849
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,278
confusing here i don't know enough about

850
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:32,719
that so we've got our back cross we took

851
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,398
a parent and we pollinated a female one

852
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,399
of the children then we found a child

853
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,000
out of that and then we pollinated that

854
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,599
child again with our original parent

855
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,038
then we did it again we did that three

856
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:46,558
times three back crosses now f2

857
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:48,240
we take a batch of the uh bx3 the back

858
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,879
cross third generation we got a handful

859
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,599
of those seeds now we grow those and we

860
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,200
find a boy and we find a girl i may have

861
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,119
to go referee a dog fight but we'll edit

862
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,200
that out we find a boy and a girl and we

863
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,879
breed those together what comes from

864
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,600
those is now the f2 generation of that

865
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,840
bat cross we made the bx1 uh the parent

866
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,240
to the child and then we found a c then

867
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,918
we took a parent to that child and then

868
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,880
we found that seed we took a parent to

869
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,559
that child that is a bx3 now we take a

870
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,640
batch of those seeds and find a boy and

871
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:22,398
a girl and breed that is a filial ge an

872
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,480
f1 it's a bx1 or a bx3 also that is the

873
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:25,918
f1 it's a first filial generation every

874
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,640
time you make something it's technically

875
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,720
an f1 uh so the fur that's an f1 of that

876
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,520
so we'll find a boy and a girl from that

877
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,399
f1 and breed them we have now made the

878
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,639
f2 filial generation of that bat cross

879
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:40,558
that is a bx3f2

880
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,399
that is a lot to get to to explain that

881
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,879
but that does make sense if you followed

882
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,199
along now the question is how much

883
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,278
variation would one expect to find in a

884
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,000
second filial generation of something

885
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:52,880
that has been back crossed three times

886
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,398
um

887
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,440
i don't have a definite definitive solid

888
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:02,079
answer because it is all about selection

889
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,919
if the proper selections were made ah it

890
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,678
could be very uniform if the proper

891
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,000
selections were not made it could be

892
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,080
[ __ ] wild we've got a couple of

893
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,398
things working for us and working

894
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,960
against us the bx3

895
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,839
if done properly should be narrowed down

896
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,840
to where approximately 85 of the

897
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,079
phenotypes will represent the original

898
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:25,759
parent they were trying to replicate if

899
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:28,079
done properly 85 to 92 percent ish of

900
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,319
those seeds should come out looking like

901
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,960
the original parent we had intended to

902
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,359
replicate in this back cross if this was

903
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,038
done correctly um

904
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,959
there's no correct or incorrect it's all

905
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:43,278
about selection and intuition and alien

906
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,880
charts and then honestly seeing if

907
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,640
nature worked the way we hoped it would

908
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,640
when we did the cross sometimes you nail

909
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,720
it sometimes you [ __ ] miss it this is

910
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,399
the time when we do the cross see if it

911
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,319
works if it doesn't you got to go

912
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,158
backwards another generation and just

913
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,079
start over with different plants so if

914
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,159
we did the selections properly by the

915
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,960
time you get to that bx3 you have got

916
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,679
really uh stable really locked in

917
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,319
expressions of phenotypes now it gets

918
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,960
crazy when we make f2s f2 is kind of the

919
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:14,000
pandora's box of genetics when you make

920
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,399
the f2 that's where we see uh plants

921
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,480
that look a lot like mommy plants that

922
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,879
look a lot like the daddy but then we

923
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,558
also see grandparents of both plants and

924
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,840
grandparents of those grandparents of

925
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,879
both plants

926
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,519
we can sometimes find f2s can sometimes

927
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,080
find the most amazing plants you've ever

928
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,558
seen and also the worst plants you've

929
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:37,278
ever grown in the same batch that is the

930
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,440
potential of an f2 so you may find

931
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,038
amazing fire in there you may find

932
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,360
complete garbage in there because we're

933
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,519
opening up a pandora's box of genetics

934
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,519
everything that is available is in there

935
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,119
you're going to see treats like i said a

936
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,158
moment ago traits from the mom traits

937
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:54,239
from the dad then traits from mom's mom

938
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,480
and dad and trades from dad's mom and

939
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,399
dad and then you may if you understand

940
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,319
and know the expressions and the parents

941
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:03,038
of those plants you may see further down

942
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,798
the line on both sides so the f2 is

943
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,480
where you're gonna see weird [ __ ] so

944
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,158
honestly i can't answer your question

945
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,960
directly because we've got a couple of

946
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,120
variables we've got the bx3 which if

947
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,480
done correctly is really locked in then

948
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:19,359
the f2 uh is going to open pandora's box

949
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,558
but i'm not sure how much of pandora's

950
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,798
box was washed out by the bx crosses if

951
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,798
we selected properly we pushed out a lot

952
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,798
of that [ __ ] that we didn't want so

953
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,639
it may or may not appear in the f2

954
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:33,119
generation i

955
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,440
haven't done this so i don't know and

956
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:38,239
then it talks about the lario g clone

957
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,919
crossed into sfv to provide pollen in

958
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,159
the first back cross which means now

959
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,840
we've got gmo

960
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,679
and lario g and sfv so we could see

961
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,599
traits of the larry we could see traits

962
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,000
of the sfv we could see traits of the

963
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,240
original gmo we could see traits of the

964
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,159
chem we could see traits of the kush we

965
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,599
could see traits of girl scout cookies

966
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,240
we could see a lot of different traits

967
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,480
in here a lot of different variables so

968
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,079
i'm not exactly sure how to answer that

969
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,079
because i've never done a bx3 then f2 it

970
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,480
um the bx3 would get me where i needed

971
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:13,119
to be i feel like the f2 may cause

972
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,798
problems may unlock pandora's box may i

973
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,639
just lead you to f3 it so you could

974
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:20,000
re-lock in the traits that you lost from

975
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,159
f1 i may just stick at the f1 uh the bx3

976
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,319
is probably i would have gone bx4 is

977
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,519
what i would have done um but um shout

978
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,960
out to the breeder that did this that

979
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,399
did this work that's a lot of breeding

980
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,079
that's a long way to go

981
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,639
i wish i was more clear i understand

982
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,480
they use the larry og to sfv to make the

983
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,559
pollen you had to use something to make

984
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,839
a back cross that does make sense so you

985
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,759
open it up and then put it back to

986
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,759
itself got to start that

987
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,359
project somewhere i do not have a direct

988
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,720
answer for you my dude i apologize for

989
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,038
that but i think i rambled on long

990
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,278
enough to give you ideas uh you may see

991
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,200
larry traits you may see sfv traits you

992
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,519
may see chemtraits you may see cookies

993
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,360
traits it depends on how the selections

994
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,399
were done they could be completely

995
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,240
uniform they may be completely wild find

996
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,398
the phenotype that works best for you

997
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,679
clone that bad [ __ ] and grow it forever

998
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:07,678
if you've got seeds maybe make that f3

999
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,679
filial generation if that's something

1000
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,720
