34
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,000
getting great submissions my two most

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,840
recent favorite submissions have came in

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
things that we missed one of them was a

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,000
pressure washer that's right a pressure

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,519
washer why not use a pressure washer to

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,319
clean your reservoirs your trays uh just

40
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,399
about anything you can get wet all that

41
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,959
plastic stuff that you buy clean it with

42
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,879
a pressure washer that'll get it nice

43
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,679
and clean uh there you go a pressure

44
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,319
washer is a great suggestion also be

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,719
very careful with that pressure washer

46
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,519
do not uh do not mistake that thing it

47
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:05,879
will it will really pressure wash the

48
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,879
[ __ ] out of you as well uh that's some

49
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,478
powerful [ __ ] if it's cleaning that

50
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,799
grime off imagine what it will do to

51
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,959
your ankle your toe it will get you so

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,920
be careful respect it put some respect

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,319
on its name another device that we could

54
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,878
use in the grow uh that we overlooked

55
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,399
that I actually often use is a scrubber

56
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,120
that attaches to a drill that's right uh

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,080
just looks like a bathroom scrubber or a

58
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,360
toilet scrubber brush but it goes right

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,360
into my drill and I can clean trays I

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,879
can clean reservoirs mainly clean the

61
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,560
cloner there's an easy cloner sitting

62
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:36,959
right there that needs to be cleaned uh

63
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,680
that easy cloner will get cleaned with

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,039
that drill just just drill scrub it real

65
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,319
hard uh put some fen2 on that bch and

66
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,919
just scrub it down and then rinse it

67
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,119
real nice uh but that drill attachment

68
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,679
with the scrubby on it real nice device

69
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,120
will really speed up your cleaning

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,200
process so uh you guys keep sending in

question goes a little bit like this it

106
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,479
says what do you think of cold start

107
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:18,238
dabs um I am not a huge fan of cold

108
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,599
start dabs I take big gigantic dabs and

109
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,000
if I were to cold start them I would

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,080
just leave a big sticky puddly mess I

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,839
prefer a real hot real big dab that

112
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,478
makes you choke makes your eyes red

113
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,719
makes your voice and throat all gooey

114
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,959
makes you have to clear your throat ACH

115
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,440
bunch of times in a podcast uh almost

116
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,038
makes you want to go lay on the floor

117
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,120
for a few minutes I got a tile kitchen

118
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:38,519
floor here uh sometimes or maybe even

119
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,478
the bathroom you ever been lit up and

120
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,439
you just go lay in the bathtub uh cuz

121
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,120
it's nice and cool and it feels good I

122
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,000
like the dabs that make you think about

123
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,560
doing that you're like I need to go lay

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,478
in the bathtub with no water and just

125
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,918
feel the cool maybe you find yourself

126
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:52,478
just laying in the bathtub in there with

127
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,000
a big bag of chips just scrolling on

128
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,478
your phone it's been like 40 minutes you

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,439
don't know what happened those are the

130
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:59,478
kind of dabs I like to take I cannot

131
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,478
achieve that with a cold start dab it

132
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:03,639
just doesn't get me there uh I take a

133
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:06,360
pretty monstrous dab I like a a TP

134
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,560
slurper or a blender uh I like a nice

135
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,759
pretty decent rig uh a decent

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
temperature I usually go I'm not even

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,120
going to tell you my temperature don't

138
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,240
try this at home but no a cold start dab

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,000
is not for me uh but if you're doing

140
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,079
cold start dabs and it works for you man

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,680
do that a lot of my friends do cold

142
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,439
starts it's great to watch it's great to

143
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,840
see uh they enjoy it it is just not for

144
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,240
me and that's one of the beautiful

145
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,879
things about growing smoking and

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,879
consuming ganja uh you can do it however

147
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,038
you enjoy doing it and I can't judge you

148
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,959
for it if you want to hit a 12T bong if

149
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,279
you want to smoke out of a coconut uh if

150
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,839
you want to carve out an apple or if you

151
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,478
want to smoke out of a $3,000 dab rig do

152
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,399
your thing pimping I encourage all of

153
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,758
the above as long as you are enjoying it

154
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,279
to your fullest so I got no judgment on

155
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,520
your cold starts except they're not for

156
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,239
me uh they're great for other people do

157
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,198
that [ __ ] uh there is more to this I'm

158
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,680
rambly obviously I took some big fat

159
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,360
non-old start dabs there's more though

160
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,400

growel tab this one did not leave a fun

186
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,478
name they left their whole name I'm not

going to call you by your full name this

188
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,159
one came from my new friend Robert

189
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,840
Robert thank you for the great question

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,360
the question goes a little bit like this

191
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,159
it says I've listen Len to you for many

192
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,038
years well thank you bro it says what I

193
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
haven't heard and I would like to hear

194
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,360
is what breeding projects have failed to

195
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,479
make it to release and why it's a really

196
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,439
good really humbling question um and

197
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,079
then I realized like I treat my podcasts

198
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,639
like I treat my social media I only post

199
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,318
my victories on social media I don't

200
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,439
really post my fails nobody does we

201
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,720
don't go post our [ __ ] some people

202
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,759
do I see a lot of crying ass people but

203
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,639
most of us don't post our failures our

204
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,560
shortcomings on social media we post the

205
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,519
victories WE Post the the picture of the

206
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,079
new car the successful garden the new

207
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,359
shoes uh the wins we don't ever post the

208
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,439
losses on social media and I I guess I

209
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,960
kind of do that here as well so uh let

210
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,800
me be humbled let me give you some full

211
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,839
disclosure there have been breeding

212
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,639
projects that I have crossed and have

213
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,359
been complete trash most of the time

214
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,918
I'll take a a a male plant Andor a

215
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,879
reversal plant however you want to go

216
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,758
about the story and I'll pollinate

217
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,360
multiple females that way we've got more

218
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,240
opportunity to see what that pollen

219
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,280
donor is doing across the board it's we

220
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,478
get to see more opportunity uh for the

221
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,519
progeny to see what they're going to

222
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:06,800
show us just something I like to do as a

223
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,240
breeder so then it gives me more

224
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,598
opportunity to have success it also

225
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,759
gives me more opportunity to have a

226
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:17,079
failure um so only one time has this

227
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,479
happened I used a pollen donor it was a

228
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:24,680
female plant it was a Lemon Skunk Kush

229
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:27,120
plant that um when I smoked the flow

230
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,158
from a dispensary the flower was amazing

231
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,639
I'm not even going to give him a shout

232
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:31,680
out cuz the owner of that dispensary is

233
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,320
dick I hope you hear this um so I bought

234
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,879
this clone of a lemon skunk Kush and the

235
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,120
so I bought the flowers from the

236
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:40,639
dispensary and smoked them and I was

237
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,120
like that shit's fire and I went back to

238
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,399
get more and they're like we have a

239
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,200
clone of it so I bought the Clone I grew

240
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,919
the Clone I grew the Clone equally if

241
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,320
not better quality than what the

242
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,439
dispensary was selling me so I've got

243
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,080
the clone of this Lemon Skunk Kush

244
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,800
everybody in the crew loves it I was

245
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,920
allegedly uh black marketing uh flower

246
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,919
stall the crew here and everybody was

247
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,559
loving it they're like bro I like

248
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,278
smoking that I love smoking that and

249
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,879
I've been dipping my toes into breeding

250
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,720
projects I've done some pollinations at

251
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,078
this point I made some crosses that

252
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,120
we've smoked in the house and in the

253
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:13,078
crew and they were great people enjoyed

254
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,480
it so I've got this Lemon Skunk Kush and

255
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:16,759
I'm like man I want to breed with this

256
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,200
this thing's [ __ ] fire so I reversed

257
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,919
it and I made s1's with it and then I

258
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,959
pollinated I don't even remember at this

259
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:24,439
point there's a G13 in there there's a

260
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,319
bunch of older stuff that I used to have

261
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,040
way back in the day there's blueberry in

262
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,839
there a bunch of different [ __ ] I'd have

263
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:31,599
to look back and like scroll through

264
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,440
photos or something and find out exactly

265
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,560
what it was honestly don't remember but

266
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,240
I remember it was a Lemon Skunk Kush

267
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:40,559
pollen donor to like I usually do nine

268
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,639
females in a room so it's probably nine

269
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,559
different girls uh in a 5x5 I hit them

270
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,319
with pollen uh I flowered out all those

271
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,919
plants I made the seeds I collected the

272
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,160
seeds uh I grew out different batches of

273
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,319
those seeds like probably 10 of each uh

274
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,759
back in the day that's just how we used

275
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,240
to do it do bigger numbers back in the

276
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,399
day can't do it now uh but I ran out a

277
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,839
bunch of those and then I was excited

278
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,799
about it they smelled so good they

279
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,600
looked so beautiful I called all the

280
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:08,919
good homies over pops Kevin Mike uh

281
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,399
probably crazy Tony at the time uh who

282
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,240
else used to come over it doesn't matter

283
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,078
bro I digress is what my grandma would

284
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,399
say all the crew came over we gathered

285
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,838
in the basement uh put on that 70 show

286
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,200
or a Pink Floyd video or whatever the

287
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,279
boys used to want to watch we' just

288
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,800
watch cool [ __ ] all day uh probably a

289
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,639
subcool video at that point in time uh

290
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,319
and then we all [ __ ] rolled up joints

291
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:29,078
and packed up bowls and we all smoked

292
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,000
all this Lemon Skunk cush crosses

293
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,639
together

294
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
different variations different

295
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,000
outcrosses and after a little while I

296
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,320
noticed it I was looking around the room

297
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,679
I was like nobody acts looks or seems

298
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,680
high in any sort of way and I was like

299
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,838
guys what do you think about it and

300
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,919
everyone's like bro I didn't want to say

301
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,760
anything I'm not [ __ ] high at all and

302
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,559
I was like well this is weird like

303
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,639
nobody is high from any of this weed so

304
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,000
we kept smoking and like I was like no

305
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,519
really I don't feel high so we went and

306
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,799
smoked with other people and I smoked it

307
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,399
with other people and I gave it to other

308
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,879
people and I was like what' you think

309
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,799
and like that weed wasn't that good that

310
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:03,480
[ __ ] was kind of trash so yeah a full

311
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:07,479
batch of breeding a whole 5x5 tent worth

312
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,079
uh Lemon Skunk Kush 100% garbage all

313
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,399
those seeds got thrown away probably fed

314
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:15,000
to chickens I think Jesse's chickens got

315
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,839
to eat a lot of those [ __ ] seeds so

316
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,720
yeah that was one that failed and then

317
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,600
often times um when I do the nine plant

318
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,040
so let's just say hypothetically I stick

319
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,360
with the nine plant idea it's just a

320
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,519
good way to do things I put a male or a

321
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,440
pollen donor in another tent get that

322
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,278
one going I've got my females in a five

323
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,760
by five there's nine of them that keeps

324
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,679
me compliant with my numbers and then I

325
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:40,799
just pollinate that most of the time uh

326
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:42,759
seven out of those nine are uh quality

327
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,399
enough to put out there's always two of

328
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,720
them that I'm like eh I don't know uh

329
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,360
sometimes it's things that I didn't

330
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,759
realize you guys would really love

331
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,200
sometimes I hold back something CU I'm

332
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,759
like oh this plant takes [ __ ] 140

333
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,480
days to flower I'm not going to put that

334
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,759
out and then I show a couple people

335
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,159
pictures of it and they're like bro why

336
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,159
don't you sell me seeds of that I would

337
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,600
[ __ ] pay an arm in a leg EG so I put

338
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,958
them up on the website just to test the

339
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,720
waters and you guys buy the [ __ ] out of

340
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,638
them so sometimes it's stuff that I

341
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,440
don't think you're going to like but you

342
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,560
really do sometimes it's stuff that I

343
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,320
don't approve of um I should not have

344
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,319
put out Night Nurse full disclosure that

345
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,839
was [ __ ] 10 years ago those seeds are

346
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,480
done they're never going to be made

347
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,519
again Night Nurse did not live up to my

348
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,120
standards that's why it went out quickly

349
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,120
and disappeared quickly the few seeds

350
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,320
that did go out when I grew it it came

351
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,360
out good my test grow but my test

352
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,079
numbers were very limited back then I

353
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,278
didn't have a big test team like I do

354
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:35,479
now um so my testers looked really nice

355
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,039
I was happy with that uh my buddy Doug

356
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,440
was my patient at the time he's the one

357
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,639
that love the Night Nurse the most I

358
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,639
kind of bred it for him him and Mike and

359
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,440
they approved they loved it I put out a

360
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,519
bunch of seeds of it and I just didn't

361
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,079
from the photos and the samples I got to

362
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,639
smoke I didn't approve I wish I would

363
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,879
not have put my name my brand my logo my

364
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,079
seal on that so night nurse was kind of

365
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,559
a fail not up to my standards in my

366
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:59,198
opinion that was a grateful dog breeding

367
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,838
project that came from the Grateful Dog

368
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:03,519
Polland donor Grateful Dog D Tor Bora

369
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,680
almost everything else I did with the

370
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,519
Grateful Dog was [ __ ] awesome except

371
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,799
the night nurse that one they just

372
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,240
didn't however the jeans when you throw

373
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,000
all the jeans up in the air and let them

374
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,720
land into the petri dish to make that

375
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
[ __ ] strain those the [ __ ] didn't

376
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,360
work out well they didn't mix well uh

377
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,799
that was [ __ ] like pudding I'm trying

378
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,000
to think of two flavors that don't mix

379
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,039
well together and it's not working in my

380
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,120
brain it's like orange juice and

381
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,278
toothpaste they just [ __ ] didn't mix

382
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,360
up real well so uh yeah that's two

383
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,360
examples I can give you one full failed

384
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,720
breeding project every seed thousands of

385
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,600
seeds probably 5,000 seeds got turned

386
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,839
into chicken feed and then one so if

387
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,879
there were nine plants there was

388
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,600
probably Night Nurse there was probably

389
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,958
Capleton there was kangi there was

390
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,480
Bounty Killer uh what else was in that

391
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,319
room Grateful Dog

392
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,480
s1s um so that's five of them those were

393
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,278
all successful night nurse was made in

394
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,399
the same batch and that plant [ __ ]

395
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,399
sucked so yeah that one shouldn't have

396
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,679
been released all right I think I

397
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,919
rambled enough about that my dude Robert

398
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:59,399
uh make sure you check your inbox

399
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,360
because I am going to send you a coupon

400
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,519
code for a free pack of seeds at I

401
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,720
direct.com that was a fun question thank

402
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,919
you I like that one all right we're

403
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,079
going to keep the energy moving I

404
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,759
finally got the goober out of my throat

405
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:13,078
let's stay focused I got the energy

right this one came also from the growel

407
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:19,319
tab at idirect decom this one came from

408
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,719
our new friend ghost pirate AO matey um

409
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,079
the question goes a little bit like this

410
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,720

more than you know for your knowledge

413
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,399
bombs on breeding especially feminized

414
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,799
to breeding bro uh thank you that means

415
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,440
a lot to me uh thank you for thinking

416
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,319
that I'm dropping knowledge bombs I just

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,480
share what I think is helpful I want to

418

thank you for that I will stay focused

429
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,399
uh all the knowledge I drop about

430
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,440
breeding I just know what I know from

431
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,000
experience I don't have all the I might

432
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
not have all the book terms all the

433
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,679
organic chemistry knowledge I don't have

434
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,959
all the the schooling and stuff that a

435
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,159
lot of people do that we see on the

436
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,479
internet but I've done it uh and I I

437
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,799
think that counts for something and I'm

438
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,800
confident in what I'm doing and I can

439
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,278
see the results what does and I just

440
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,559
admitted some [ __ ] doesn't work so man

441
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,439
thank you I'm I'm humbled and I

442
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,958
appreciate this comment already it says

443
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,639
you've changed my game and I'm now able

444
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,000
to feel some confidence when that is

445
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,440
[ __ ] awesome dude I just said I'm

446
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,039
confident so now I'm glad you're as

447
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,639
confident confidence goes a long way uh

448
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,838
don't don't uh second guess yourself

449
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,039
don't double step uh keep moving forward

450
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,480
be confident now there is a question in

451
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,519
here uh it says I have a question I have

452
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,000
a partially partially pollinated plant

453
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,480
that's harder than it looks you say that

454
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,240
at home I have a partially pollinated

455
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,720
plant uh which means I've only

456
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,399
pollinated one branch now my question

457
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,120
pertains to this 18 and6 light cycle

458
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,919
after the pollination I know where this

459
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,720
is headed and I've got some strong

460
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,599
advice for you it said will this plant

461
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,879
still be able to handle the 18 and six

462
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,278
light cycle without throwing out interex

463
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:12,078
traits which that rings so many bells

464
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:14,879
that I want to talk about or should I

465
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,719
pollinate the whole plant um so with

466
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,078
this listener I think they're talking

467
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,199
about is I recommend when pollinating

468
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:24,159
plants when you're strictly using this

469
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:26,838
plant for pollen uh after pollination I

470
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:29,719
turn that timer to 18 hours on and 6

471
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:32,399
hours off right after pollination until

472
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Harvest Time that is my practice for a

473
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,440
seed crop now if I were to do this to a

474
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,399
centy crop a crop with no seeds I would

475
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,920
only initiate that 186 for the last 2

476
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,919
weeks of flower the reason is if we

477
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:48,360
leave these plants on 186 for too long

478
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,759
they will rev they will begin to go back

479
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,039
into a vegetative state we do not want

480
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,399
that to happen to the part of your plant

481
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,078
that you are not going to pollinate so I

482
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,318
would not recommend putting that whole

483
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:02,120
plant back into 186 if you just want

484
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:03,759
some seeds leave it on 1212 let it

485
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,519
finish up like normal those seeds will

486
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,199
be happy healthy and they'll be just

487
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,599
fine you just want some seeds for

488
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,679
yourself to play with it sounds like you

489
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:13,078
got one branch that's pollinated leave

490
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,000
it on 1212 at the end of that flowering

491
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,639
cycle uh whenever you would about 2

492
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,880
weeks before 10 days before you would

493
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,120
normally Harvest then put that light

494
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,839
back on 186 but not until then because

495
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,000
it will rev you the question you asked

496
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,440
is will it show will it show intersect

497
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,558
traits

498
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,000
that's a whole another problem that's a

499
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,079
whole another ball game whole another

500
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,359
issue whole more bag of [ __ ] to deal

501
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:39,319
with uh if that plant shows intersex

502
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,759
traits at that point I would almost

503
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:44,759
recommend not breeding with it not doing

504
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:46,679
the uh the cross at all because you've

505
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,519
got interex traits I would abandon ship

506
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,919
at that point no need to make more

507
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:52,240
interex traits I know there's going to

508
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,080
be some controversy uh that's okay I

509
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,759
accept and welcome that I come with

510
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,038
respect maybe I'll respond I can't

511
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,679
respond to every message but um so I

512
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:01,798
would ditch it if you see those intersex

513
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,200
traits what I would definitely almost

514
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:05,918
guarantee you're going to see though

515
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,759
more than intersex traits if you do this

516
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,880
early if you do the pollination and put

517
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,038
it back on 186 the ciny part that you

518
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,360
want to smoke will look like [ __ ] it

519
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:16,919
will rev it'll look terrible so don't do

520
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:20,319
that I recommend continuing with the 18

521
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:22,120
and six light cycle all right my dude

522
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,678
did I even say yeah ghost pirate I like

523
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:25,359

527
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,038
podcast but I feel like I burnt right

528
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,599
through those questions I finally got

529
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:37,679
some Rhythm got my voice fixed up I'm

530
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,439
going to reach over here I just took the

531
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,120
top question off the pile this question

532
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,720
has not been vetted screened I don't

533
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,439
know what's going to come up this could

534
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,400
be blade and advertising this could be

535
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,279
some weird [ __ ] Christmas list um but

536
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400

537
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:54,399
see what happens this one came from the

538
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
growel tab at I redirect.sh

539
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,480
did I say subscribe did I say that

540
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,558

541
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,798
of myself trying to produce record and

555
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,839
listener and customer I appreciate that

556
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,080
thank you says my question is if I'm

557
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,439
breeding a regular plant which means a

558
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,879
non- feminized plant I would assume with

559
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,840
a feminized plant will the seeds be

560
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,200
regular uh my quick answer is uh yes

561
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,720
those are regular seeds uh the easiest

562
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,038
way I can simplify that to where you're

563
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,679
going to remember it is what did you do

564
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,679
to feminize them feminized sounds like

565
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,080
and I heard Mr Soul say this the word

566
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,000
feminized sounds like we did something

567
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:02,960
to make them female we did I treated the

568
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,159
plant with silver so that those plants

569
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,640
that come out so that the pollen itself

570
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,320
is feminized I've made feminized pollen

571
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,559
so those seeds have been feminized I

572
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,720
know uh that's how you're going to

573
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,038
remember it now you're always going to

574
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,679
think oh I didn't do anything to

575
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,319
feminize them they had to be feminized

576
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,559
and I didn't do that so they're not

577
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:22,359
feminized seeds that's the best way to

578
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:24,119
get that into your brain in my teaching

579
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,359
opinion all right so that was a quick

580
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,158
answer there quick question I'm going to

581

this one also came from the growel tab

599
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:02,319
came from from somebody who wants to be

600
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,599
called toac Tokamak thank you for the

601

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,480
hey rosted Jeff hey tokom MAAC says um

605
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,798
you've described how to make fem to

606
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,798
preserve a prized female on your podcast

607
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:19,759
several times yes I've been explaining

608
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:21,759
fem seeds for quite a while trying to

609
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,599
clean up the misinformation that's out

610
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,480
there then it goes on it says what are

611
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,599
the ways to preserve or keep a mail

612
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,880
plant around for use in later projects I

613
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,119
appreciate the commitment to sharing bro

614
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,760
tokomak thank you for the great question

615
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,199
uh once again check your inbox now the

616
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:40,558
answer to this uh how do I keep a male

617
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,200
plant around uh for future projects uh

618
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,038
the same way we keep a mother plant

619
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,558
around I would call it a father plant I

620
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:47,440
guess but it would live right in the

621
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:50,639
mother room right amongst the other

622
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,840
ladies um basically I've got a light

623
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,360
dedicated to or have a whole section

624
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:57,439
dedicated to where I keep genetics

625
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,319
that's the mother area uh I give it a 19

626
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,440
and5 light cyle I know that's a

627
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:05,079
confusing light cycle uh 186 is not

628
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,200
enough I like the 195 because some of

629
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:08,960
the more sativa dominant is that even

630
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,759
the proper term anymore argue about that

631
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,440
in the comments uh some of the more

632
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,278
tropical narrow Leaf

633
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,278
varietals uh they will flower if they

634
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:19,240
get rootbound and don't get enough light

635
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,240
at the same time so I'm just buying

636
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,319
myself a little bit of time by going

637
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,120
with that 195 they won't flower um

638
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,558
sometimes the Congo the original Congo

639
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:31,119
plant it likes the 195 is a mother plant

640
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,599
and it Veges very well under 195

641
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,959
186 it grows a little bit too quickly

642
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,038
and it'll get rot down and then it will

643
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,480
begin to flower before I want it to

644
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,158
that's a pain in the ass so I keep the

645
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,640
mother plants the father plants on a 195

646
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,278
light cycle um I give them just a little

647
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,000
bit of fan a little bit of air

648
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:52,440
circulation and then uh I feed them just

649
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,159
a basic veg nutrients they get veg food

650
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,640
um so a lot of times if I feed my veg

651
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,200
area some of that leftover becomes the

652
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,840
base for my moms I'll just add that to

653
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,759
some water and maybe boost it up a

654
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,240
little bit but it's basically base

655
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,359
nutrients like whatever brand you're

656
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,519
using the base uh sometimes I'll throw a

657
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,119
little liquid karma in there uh and then

658
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,200
a lot of times I just dose everything

659
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,399
with recharge the whole [ __ ] all the

660
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,440
plants will get hit with recharge so uh

661
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,038
base nutrients liquid Karma recharge you

662
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,759
don't need a whole lot you could just

663
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,558
buy real cheap veg nutrients for your

664
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,158
mother plants you need some NPK just

665
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,158
basic nitrogen a little bit of

666
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,080
phosphorus basic potassium give them

667
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,159
some microbes uh make sure they're

668
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,678
healthy

669
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,400
um like Pest and Problem free don't get

670
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,679
any pathogens no powdery Milo no

671
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,159
funguses in there and don't get any bugs

672
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,960
prevent all the bugs people Overlook the

673
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,200
importance of how important the mom room

674
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,960
is that's where it all starts so before

675
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,880
you can have clones veg or flour you

676
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,360
have to have healthy mother plants keep

677
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,240
them as healthy as you can I apply uh

678
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,558
pesticide rotation in my mother room

679
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,960
once a week if I see any issues I hit it

680
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,119
Monday and Thursday if I think it's

681
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,360
legit I hit it Monday I've been going

682
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,798
kind of hard so I'm going to go just

683
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,479
every Monday for a little bit and make

684
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,000
sure there's no problems I'm about to

685
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,000
start a breeding project need it nice

686
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,038
and clean but um keep them under 195

687
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,599
light uh feed them a vegetative [ __ ]

688
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,919
nutrients uh where was I going from

689
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:17,079
there um I was talking about um going to

690
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,159
keep them pest free uh spray them apply

691
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:20,639
a pesticide [ __ ] frequently or

692
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,278
however you want to do it keep them pest

693
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,000
free but I recommend keep those moms

694
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:27,278
pest free then pot size is very

695
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,519
important um of course the bigger the

696
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,038
pot you keep the plant in the longer you

697
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,839
can keep that plant around but also the

698
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,000
larger the pot you keep it in the more

699
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,439
rapidly it will grow so you're kind of

700
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,640
cheating yourself I don't know it's it's

701
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,159
a race um I like to keep my mother

702
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,000
plants in a three or a five gallon pot

703
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,880
if I had more space I would do seven

704
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
gallons but I legit don't have more room

705
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,760
for that I'm working with what I've got

706
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,359
uh in a commercial facility they go in

707
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,000
in a commercial environment the moms are

708
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,639
in [ __ ] sevens [ __ ] 10 15 they go

709
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,519
in large pots cuz we need a lot of cuts

710
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,000
and they're bigger in a personal grow

711
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,079
which was probably what most of us are

712
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,798
doing here I use a three or a five

713
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,398
gallon pot um veg that [ __ ] out veg it

714
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,158
clean up the bottoms top it let it

715
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:09,798
Branch out a little bit it'll make like

716
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,559
a nice bushy shape and those will be

717
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:13,440
where all your Cuts come from that's how

718
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:14,839
I keep a mother plant uh don't let it

719
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,399
get rootbound because a lot of these

720
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,759
plants when they get rootbound they will

721
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:19,839
start to flower that's when you'll start

722
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:22,359
to see problems it'll look like it's

723
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,599
overwatered underwatered got a pH issue

724
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,879
it's really just rootbound wants a

725
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,558
bigger pot it's got nowhere to go so I

726
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,320
keep those plants around until they're

727
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:32,079
usually uh three 4ish feet tall they're

728
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,879
kind of bushy usually it's about three

729
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,720
or six months before I have to take more

730
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,919
clones and use one of those clones as my

731
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,720
replacement for my mom plant then I just

732
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,360
start fresh with all new moms grow them

733
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,960
out get the Clones as I need so I know

734
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,678
this is about keeping mail plant so this

735
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,558
is where I'll jump to the the male part

736
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:53,080
of this I do basically the same thing

737
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:55,240
except I'm more careful because if that

738
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,918
male plant does start to pre-flow or

739
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,880
autoflow on you because you didn't give

740
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,799
it enough light enough root space face

741
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,278
it's going to be a real [ __ ] to revert

742
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,398
that plant back to the veg phase male

743
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:07,720
plants once they just like you bro once

744
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:09,839
the launch sequence is initiated it

745
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,960
wants to [ __ ] go so if you see that

746
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:13,798
male plant starting to go in flour it's

747
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,519
going to go into flour so try to prevent

748
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,200
that with enough light don't get let it

749
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,000
get rootbound feed it properly you can

750
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,000
top the mail plants cut the tops out

751
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,720
make them Bush you can do all that just

752
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,240
like a mother plant I do everything the

753
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,399
same except I'm more careful to not

754
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,519
stress that plant don't overwater don't

755
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:33,678
underwater uh keep the light at 195 keep

756
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,440
it a good distance away uh keep that

757
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,000
plant healthy I defoliate it a little

758
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,720
bit just like everything else clean up

759
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,880
the bottoms uh but just don't stress it

760
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,519
because if it does go into flower it is

761
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,679
even harder uh to reverse those back to

762
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,240
veg than it is your basic female plants

763
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,880
so I guess after all that rambling the

764
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,079
short answer is just treat it just like

765
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,679
a veg plant just like a long-term veg

766
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:57,199
plant just like you would a mother plant

767
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,240
if you do keep mothers uh keep it in as

768
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,558
big of a pot as you can can uh give it

769
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,519
195 keep it Pest and Problem free feed

770
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,278
it um and give it the appropriate size

771
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,639
pot don't let that pot get too cold on

772
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,519
the ground also those cold pots will

773
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,799
piss off that plant and make it go into

774
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,839
flower it'll think it's the end of the

775
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,679
world so when cannabis plants think that

776
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:18,199
they're under stress uh they think it's

777
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,519
the end of the world that's when they

778
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,120
start to panic and they'll go into

779
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:22,960
flower or they will throw intersex

780
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,079
traits um or they will show their

781
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,720
intersect traits or they will uh have a

782
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,398
chemical reaction within them that will

783
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,440
cause them to express intersection CU I

784
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,678
say that right bro I know who's

785
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,038
listening to this who's going to give me

786
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,038
feedback here um but that's when it

787
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:38,919
happens is cannabis wants to survive

788
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:41,038
cannabis's whole goal uh is to procreate

789
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:42,679
and survive so that it can make seeds so

790
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,960
that it can grow the next season so that

791
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,759
it can repeat and repeat and repeat

792
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,640
that's why the male plants jump up above

793
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:50,398
everybody so they can pollinate get the

794
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,399
pollen down on those ladies the ladies

795
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,678
can receive the pollen uh that's why

796
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:55,239
seeds are shaped like with a little

797
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,320
point so they can land into the dirt and

798
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,319
dig themselves in it's all designed for

799
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,960
reproduction and if you don't let these

800
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:02,519
plants reproduce on their own if you

801
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,480
don't let that happen if you prevent

802
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,240
that that they want to find a way

803
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,319
they're just horny teenagers the boys

804
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,359
and the girls they're going to do

805
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,240
everything they can and just like uh

make a seed just to try to survive

816
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,759
nobody's pollinated me yet why don't I

start spitting out some seeds of my own
