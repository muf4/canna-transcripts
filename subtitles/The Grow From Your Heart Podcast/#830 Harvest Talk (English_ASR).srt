00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,719
today we're going to discuss one of my

54
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,318
grow room one of my grow Community Pet

55
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:20,039
Peeves when you buy a package of seeds

56
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:21,839
it says recommended flowering time uh

57
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,159
we're going to say 60 to 70 days that's

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,560
really common for some seeds that I

59
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,159
would sell so suggested flowering time

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,598
60 to 70 days I'm the breeder I'm the

61
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,239
one that bred those seeds I've probably

62
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:34,919
grown a bunch of those seeds I've had

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,640
testers grow those seeds got a lot a lot

64
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,359
of experience with the seeds that are in

65
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,079
that package I have a pretty good

66
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,319
general idea of what to expect from

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
those especially how long to let them

68
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,318
flower now let me get to the point here

69
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,839
my pet peeve is when I see people online

70
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:53,039
talking about day one of flowering time

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,959
and what is considered day one there are

72
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,239
a lot of people out there who try to say

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,158
that day one is the first day you see

74
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,360
pistols forming or the first day you see

75
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,679
Bud set happening or the first day your

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,200
plant shows you sex all of those are

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,560
nonsense day one of flowering is the day

78
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,000
you turn your timer to 1212 most of us

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,759
are running 18 hours on 6 hours off or

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,280
something similar maybe you're doing 24

81
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:21,079
and zero but that first day you turn

82
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,719
that timer to 12 hours on and 12 hours

83
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,680
off is day one of the flowering cycle

84
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,759
there's no negotiations no changes uh

85
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,400
and I get to choose that because I cre

86
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,759
created the seeds that you're working

87
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,959
with I put the label on there and I know

88
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,919
that day one starts for my count when I

89
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,319
change that light that's why I put 70

90
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,000
days on there it would have been a

91
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:44,798
different math equation I didn't put day

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,080
one is uh the day that you change the

93
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,159
lights plus the day that you see pistols

94
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,239
minus the angle of the Moon it doesn't

95
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:53,078
say any of that it says day one is the

96
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,158
day you change the light into flower and

97
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,439
then from 70 days from then your plants

98
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,438
should be ready so my growroom pet peeve

99
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,479
is people not understanding what day one

100
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,120
means means how hard is it why are you

101
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,639
making things so difficult chill out bro

102
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,719
now we're going to work into another pet

103
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,318
peeve that does drive me crazy I also

104
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:12,919
see this on social media way too often

105
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:16,039
people will post pictures of male plants

106
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,199
it's a boy plant the plant is 10 12 17

107
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,079
days into flower it's showing male parts

108
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,280
and people will say why did my plant

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,800
show hermaphrodite why is my plant a

110
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,879
Herm bro it's just a male why do you

111
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,639
want it to be a Herm so bad I know that

112
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,839
sounds like a very small complaint but

113
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,800
what sucks about that is if you run some

114
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,399
iy genetic seeds and you grow a good

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
male and you complain that you got a

116
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,599
hermaphrodite and you tell a bunch of

117
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,918
people that my seeds are in sex that

118
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,320
looks bad on me because you're

119
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:42,399
uneducated and you didn't know what a

120
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,599
male plant looked like so that's another

121
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,038
one of my big pet peeves people that

122
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,960
identify a male plant as an interex

123
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,918
plant the plant was clearly male you

124
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,439
don't get to pick that bro the plants do

125
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,879
not let you determine their gender they

126
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,000
will tell you on their own all right

127
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,120
that is my pet peeve section of today's

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,399
podcast now I did say earlier that I've

129
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,038
been over overwhelmed because I've been

130
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,399
trimming some plants there is a very

131
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,879
long episode about harvesting and drying

132
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,439
and curing your plants here on this

133
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,360
podcast I don't remember the number

134
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,120
today we are going to do the quick

135
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,520
version of drying and curing your

136
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,680
harvested cannabis now the first thing I

137
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,959
want to talk about when it comes to

138
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,160
harvesting our plants is preparation

139
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,879
I've done a full episode recently about

140
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,240
preparing for Harvest uh mainly get your

141
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,038
gloves get your scissors get your area

142
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,560
also where are these plants going to go

143
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:31,599
once you chop them down let's think

144
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,360
think about that before we even cut

145
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,680
these plants down so we know Harvest is

146
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,800
coming right it's coming up let's just

147
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,959
say it's in a few days now is the time

148
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,639
to order two or three pair of scissors

149
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,038
if you can get some good Fisker scissors

150
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,960
or whatever you prefer get some good

151
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,478
quality scissors I got some free

152
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,839
scissors in the mail that came with

153
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,038
another product they just happened to

154
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,839
send me scissors I used those to trim a

155
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,000
plant the other night they lasted one

156
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,758
and a half plants before they were so

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,560
dull that they were just mushing the

158
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,879
plant I couldn't even trim with them uh

159
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,280
tried to clean them up tried to get them

160
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,038
back in action they're so dull they're

161
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,519
useless need to give them to a friend

but get yourself some good quality

165
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,959
scissors cuz these things did not last

166
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:12,879
one and a half plants they were free

167
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,198
it's what you expect but I just grabbed

168
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,879
that pair I thought brand new I'll give

169
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,240
them a try they felt good in the hand

170
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,439
but they didn't trim with the [ __ ] after

171
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,439
a couple of hours they were toasted so

172
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,000
now is the time to order some good

173
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,959
scissors we know we're going to need

174
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,839
good trim scissors if you've already got

175
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,000
some clean them up get them prepared

176
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,839
also you're going to need or I suggest

177
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,360
rubber gloves if you're going to have

178
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:36,038
helpers get gloves in their sizes as

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,840
well uh be cordial also one thing I

180
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:38,918
would recommend is some snacks you're

181
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,159
going to want some snacks when you're

182
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:43,598
trimming not while but between trimming

183
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,919
uh I'm a snack monster it's a nice

184
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:47,560
reward to say when I finish this plant I

185
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,639
get to eat those snacks it's always just

186
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,720
a good mind game so if you're trimming

187
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,918
if you've got helpers oh excuse me for

188
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,120
the burping you guys not even going to

189
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,279
edit that out if you're trimming if

190
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,120
you've got helpers try to provide snacks

191
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,559
for yourself and since I'm burping it up

192
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,319
try to find some good drinks that your

193
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,399
trimmers enjoy do they drink kombuchas

194
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,120
do they drink have some water for sure

195
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,198
but do they want something tasty do they

196
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,680
want a lime horitos uh do they want one

197
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,560
of those weird tasting Tamarind hitos

198
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,199
get something tasty for your trim crw so

199
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,000
there's something good for folks to

200
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,280
snack on and drink on keep them

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,879
comfortable also uh this always does

202
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,638
help in my opinion if you're working in

203
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,759
a an environment where this is allowed

204
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,478
if you're in a commercial environment

205
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,080
you're screwed but if you come over here

206
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:26,959
and you trim with me you're going to get

207
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,800
stoned all day bro I put some weed on

208
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,918
the table some dabs on the table and

209
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,720
that shit's R game you can smoke all of

210
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,519
that [ __ ] as long as you can still trim

211
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,479
you will get paid don't worry about it

212
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,519
so have some snacks some drinks and some

213
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,639
smokables

214
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,318
available uh and some good entertainment

215
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,360
maybe pick out a couple of good podcasts

216
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,879
if you're by yourself uh maybe listen to

217
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,319
a couple of comedy specials but be ready

218
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,319
uh and a good chair I'm going to mention

219
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,800
a good chair is crucial I've got a

220
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,000
really nice chair in my office I can

221
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,918
move around I moved that to my trim area

222
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,800
it's nice and cozy it's got nice lumbar

223
00:07:54,918 --> 00:08:00,519
support uh that chair extends my trim

224
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,520
period also good good lighting many

225
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,918
people Overlook the good lighting until

226
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,719
they cut down the plant they bring it to

227
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,639
the area and they go damn I can't see

228
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,199
this [ __ ] of course I've got studio

229
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,120
lights I've got lighting for days in

230
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,080
here but consider some lighting in your

231
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,598
trimming area that is going to be very

232
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,318
crucial it will uh trimming sucks you

233
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:19,719
may be at trimming at the trim table for

234
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,759
several hours you don't want to be stuck

235
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,319
there uncomfortable uh with your neck in

236
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,038
a position you don't want and your arms

237
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,919
in a weird way really try to get

238
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,279
yourself in a comfortable relaxed

239
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,719
position where you can get as much done

240
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,079
and extend your time trimming if your

241
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,599
arms are up here your arms are going to

242
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,479
get numb if your neck's crooked like

243
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,039
this your neck is going to get sore try

244
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,320
to get yourself set up in a comfortable

245
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,439
way where you can trim with your arms in

246
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,039
front of your face over a tray also

247
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,640
think about some sort of trim tray what

248
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:45,759
are you going to trim over do you have a

249
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,319
strategy all right there's a lot of

250
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,399
things to think about before trimming

251
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,560
even happens let's get some supplies

252
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,399
let's get some friends let's get a

253
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,679
schedule when is it going to happen

254
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,159
don't keep putting it off uh don't uh

255
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,039
just tell your Bros whenever at this

256
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,439
time have a time Friday at noon I'm

257
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,439
cutting these plants down you be here at

258
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,399
1 we'll start cooking like that's the

259
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,040
way it should go have a plan how about

260
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,480
some space do you know do you have room

261
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,519
if I cut down one of my big plants it

262
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,800
would barely fit on this table uh so I'd

263
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,480
have to break it down into smaller

264
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,799
pieces hang that up and then process

265
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,320
that small pieces at a time do you have

266
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,559
room for that how is the temperature the

267
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,160
environment in that room is it suitable

268
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,719
for yourself is it suitable for your

269
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,879
trim crew is it suitable for the plants

270
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,839
then after the trim area what about

271
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:31,200
where is that bud going to hang however

272
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,640
you're going to do it are you going to

273
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,920
run lines are you going to hang it from

274
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,600
hooks are you going to hang it from coat

275
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,599
hangers how are you going excuse me how

276
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,040
are you going to hang this plant one

277
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,320
thing I like to do I like to start by

278
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,078
hanging so we'll talk about this in a

279
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,000
moment but have some space how are you

280
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,120
going to hang the plant then how are you

281
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,600
going to control the environment in the

282
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,919
room in which your plants are hanging uh

283
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,639
ideally we would have and this is Up For

284
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,078
Debate people are going to argue this

285
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,159
and I'm going to give parameters because

286
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:00,199
it's much easier and um it is slightly

287
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,879
critical to hit these parameters but

288
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,680
certain exact temps aren't as critical

289
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,200
in my mind I've been growing weed uh

290
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,479
very good weed before we had all these

291
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,320
super crazy monitors and all this Tech

292
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,839
you can get by but what I'm trying to

293
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,320
say is we need a room where we can

294
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,640
control the temperature and the humidity

295
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,440
uh somewhere between 50 and 60% humidity

296
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,278
and also somewhere between 50 and 60°

297
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,640
fahren in that room uh for as long as

298
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,480
possible where you're drying and curing

299
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,480
is ideal I understand we don't all have

300
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,879
that try not to get too hot try not to

301
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,278
get too cold try not to get too dry try

302
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,519
not to get too moist it will work but if

303
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:40,559
you want really good the best weed 50 to

304
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,159
60% on both of those is ideal for you so

305
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,000
what about the area where the weed is

306
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,600
going to go so the way I normally do it

307
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,679
is I'm going to cut the weed down it'll

308
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,839
hang for a few days in that 50/50 room

309
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,638
that 50/50 environment that dark room

310
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,079
also it's 50° 50% humidity and it's dark

311
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,278
uh eventually it'll be time to cut it

312
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:57,799
we'll talk more about that in just a

313
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:59,480
minute I'm not going to skip steps

314
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,000
trying to stay focused but I am high as

315
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,200
[ __ ] if you can't tell today um then

316
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,078
eventually that weed's going to get

317
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,759
ready to trim once we trim it where is

318
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:08,719
it going to go do you have jars do you

319
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,159
have containers do you have buckets do

320
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,560
you have something available that is

321
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,759
airtight preferably opaque and food

322
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,039
grade would be ideal for these buds so

323
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,000
there's a lot of things to think about a

324
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,000
lot of steps let's get prepared now so

325
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,360
we don't destroy this Harvest we've

326
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,278
already gone however many days in veg 30

327
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,120
40 days in veg 9 10 weeks in flour let's

328
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,519
not ruin this stuff right here at the

329
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,440
very end so think about your environment

330
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,360
what about your equipment do you have a

331
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,040
humidifier a dehumidifier a small fan do

332
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,560
you have those types of things available

333
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:41,078
to you to put in your dry and cure area

334
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,518
uh what else do we talk about I said

335
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,519
time and space uh once you've got all of

336
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,679
your equipment I wrote down uh

337
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,759
humidifier dehumidifier FL fans scissors

338
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,559
gloves jars bins snacks music now what

339
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,078
about time and space you've got to

340
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,278
organize this I talked about that

341
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:58,759
briefly the thing that uh you may need

342
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,879
to be concerned about is once you cut

343
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,200
those plants down they are beginning to

344
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,799
dry at some point they will be dry

345
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,560
enough to where they need to be either

346
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,759
put into a container or ready to be

347
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,518
trimmed uh the reason I got overwhelmed

348
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,919
this week is cuz I cut down several

349
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,799
plants all at one time and then they

350
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,120
were all dry all at once it was a race

351
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,479
for me to get them into a container into

352
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,919
the jars before they got too dry so I

353
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,680
just once I started trimming it was

354
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:26,000
[ __ ] go time I had to keep on keeping

355
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,239
on so give yourself time and space to do

356
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,839
this uh also think about that hang area

357
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,360
I wrote temperature and humidity in the

358
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,959
Hang area make sure that is dialed in

359
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,079
now let's talk about my actual process

360
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,638
of how uh I did this Harvest I felt like

361
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,159
I did this Harvest pretty efficiently it

362
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,879
was just me I took down my legal number

363
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,879
of plants here in Colorado I feel like I

364
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,838
had a pretty good successful Harvest by

365
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,600
the way most of this uh is going to be

366
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,279
taken to the dude grow cup so we can

367
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,959
consume this at the dude grow cup it's

368
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,958
going to be rolled up into a bunch of

369
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,799
fatties are just available in jars uh

370
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,838
it's just going to be smoke ready at the

371
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,120
cup that's why I grew it uh this is just

372
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,519
party time bud there was a bunch of

373
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,198
lemon Jeffrey uh a little bit of orange

374
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,240
gasm a very small amount small small

375
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:09,599
amount of Grateful Dog there was a

376
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,159
double dragon in there and then

377
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,759
allegedly um there might be a Golden

378
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,679
Goat plant but we're just talking at

379
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:19,198
this point let's talk about the actual

380
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,638
Harvest so um you've done your grow it's

381
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,198
time to cut we're not going to talk too

382
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,879
much about uh what you feed it if you do

383
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:27,240
or do not flush by the way there's an

384
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,240
episode all about flushing is Flushing

385
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,519
real is Flushing a myth is Flushing bro

386
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,799
science uh go check the flushing episode

387
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,799
see how you feel about that uh do that

388
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:38,919
or don't uh then um I would say the day

389
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,879
before Harvest here is where my Harvest

390
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,479
procedure actually Begins the actual

391
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,838
Harvest because days before that I hit

392
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,959
up Amazon and got all the [ __ ] that I

393
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,240
need now here we go um I'm going to go

394
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,479
in and defoliate the plants as much as I

395
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,600
possibly can the day before Harvest as

396
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,759
many leaves as I can pull off big and

397
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,440
small if I can just get in there and

398
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,199
yank them off with my fingers the entire

399
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,320
room just going to strip it naked we

400
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,559
don't need any leaves at this point uh

401
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,360
it can be completely completely naked at

402
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,078
this time then uh when I'm done there's

403
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,278
a good chance I'll just unplug that

404
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,758
light unplug the room uh not the entire

405
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:14,159
room just the lights uh the room is done

406
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,039
I'm going to cut it down tomorrow a lot

407
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,000
of people like to leave that room in

408
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,198
extended Darkness um I'm just doing it

409
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,320
because the plants are basically

410
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:22,719
finished I'm just going to let them

411
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,920
sleep for an extra amount of time

412
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,320
because I'm not spinning that

413
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,319
electricity uh and they're done and then

414
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,839
if that extra extended Darkness does do

415
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,639
anything I also happen to add that I

416
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,480
just know I'm cutting them down tomorrow

417
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,799
they're done I just defoliated them just

418
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,959
need to let them finish for that extra

419
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,120
day tomorrow is Cho day that's the only

420
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,559
real method for the extended darknesses

421
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,198
just unplug the light there's no need

422
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,958
for it at this point just let them Rock

423
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,719
have a real long night then you wake

424
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,078
them up and kill them so uh the first

425
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,879
thing I do defoliate heavily every leaf

426
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:52,000
get it off of there get rid of it uh

427
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,278
most of the leaves you're pulling now

428
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,039
are not the sugary leaves uh this is all

429
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,198
trash get rid of that so then the next

430
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,799
day when it's time I will go in and I

431
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,599
chopped the plants um some of these

432
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,799
plants got lollip popped fairly high

433
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,079
they had real long legs I didn't chop at

434
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:10,439
the base I chopped up real high just

435
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,239
before where the first nodes came out so

436
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,120
I just chopped just below that then I

437
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,560
flipped the plant upside down these

438
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,839
plants honestly went onto a coat hanger

439
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,439
The Hanger that my t-shirt was on my

440
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,040
jacket my hoodie uh just like that uh so

441
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,600
I take one of the branch so your plant

442
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,519
goes up it looks like a p sign right the

443
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,319
main branch and the two coming off flip

444
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,440
it upside down use one side of the PE

445
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:32,240
sign hang it right on that coat hanger

446
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,920
that went into my dry and cure area that

447
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,919
was as close to 50/50 as I could get it

448
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:40,039
uh 50 degrees 50% humidity and 100%

449
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,278
darkness in that room that plant went

450
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:46,278
right into there repeat until everything

451
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:48,278
is harvested uh then closely monitor

452
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,799
those plants uh pay attention to your

453
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,039
equipment in that room pay attention to

454
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,519
the humidifier the dehumidifier make

455
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,159
sure you're dumping those or filling

456
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,198
those as needed because if one of those

457
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:59,519
goes to [ __ ] uh so here's something

458
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,318
crazy that I do I didn't mention this in

459
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,759
the dry and cure room I will have a

460
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:07,599
humidifier and a dehumidifier both set

461
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,399
at 50% uh or both set at 55% that way

462
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,639
you get honestly these devices have a

463
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,039
little leeway so you get somewhere

464
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,198
between 50 and 60% humidity and

465
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,879
temperature that way they're both

466
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:17,240
fighting the reason you got to make sure

467
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,159
they're both up to date is because if

468
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,039
one goes wrong you really [ __ ] up the

469
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:23,600
room because now you're just uh

470
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,078
dehumidifying the room extremely instead

471
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
of adding the humidity they don't they

472
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:29,159
don't it doesn't work that way so make

473
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,879
sure equipment's working hang everything

474
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:32,719
upside down let it hang go in there and

475
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,559
check on it so here's where the art and

476
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,560
the skill comes into drawing and curing

477
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,719
the plants while the plants are hanging

478
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,000
grab a branch and just give it a bend

479
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,360
the plant's either going to bend like

480
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,039
it's wet and rubbery and supple or it's

481
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,120
going to pop a little bit or it's going

482
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,679
to explode those are three different

483
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,720
points of the dry and cure phase if it

484
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,879
bends a little bit and is rubbery way

485
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,519
too early if it goes crack you're just

486
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,480
at the right point I would start

487
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,720
trimming up those buds and get those

488
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,278
buds into an airtight container or at

489
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,079
least Buck the buds off of the sticks

490
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,279
and into an airtight container I did

491
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,198
half and half this time um I bucked the

492
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,399
buds into a bin I trimmed up a bunch of

493
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,558
them those went into a jar so I can dry

494
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,120
and cure them at some point I ran I

495
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,119
realized I was running out of time I was

496
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,119
getting exhausted I had to go to bed I

497
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,038
just started bucking the buds off of the

498
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,239
sticks and I put those untrimmed buds

499
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,279
into a jar they will get dried and cured

500
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,279
with leaves on them we can trim those

501
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,599
whenever the time comes not a big deal

502
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:28,240
so uh when they start snapping when they

503
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,719
start popping a little bit that's when

504
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,599
it's time to start getting those those

505
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,160
buds those flowers even the whole plant

506
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,759
if you need to into some sort of a

507
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,600
container to now start slowing down that

508
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:41,640
drying process for some people this line

509
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,000
is hard to determine when to put them in

510
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,240
that jar is really hard to determine for

511
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,599
some people you don't want to go when

512
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,160
it's too wet uh cuz then you can cause

513
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,918
problems if it's already exploding and

514
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,720
real dry then you've already caused

515
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,200
yourself problems so you want to go

516
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,159
right when those not the thin thin wispy

517
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,798
sticks not the big stick in the middle

518
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,440
but those side sticks when those start

519
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,839
popping good that's when you want to get

520
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,679
those buds off of there and get them

521
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,839
into a container so now we've taken the

522
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,559
the B so what I did was I like I said I

523
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,639
cut all the buds off the sticks into

524
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,480
containers so I knew that this plant was

525
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,799
B A this plant was b b then I trimmed a

526
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,880
bunch of those buds and put them into

527
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,038
the jars those are basically trimmed and

528
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,760
in the trimmed cure process uh we'll

529
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,839
talk more about the curing in a second

530
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,679
that's all set aside like I said before

531
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,279
I ran out of freaking time I got tired

532
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,720
bro I did more than I thought I was

533
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,319
going to do and so those are still hairy

534
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,240
but they got put into the jar they're

535
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,720
trimmed off the stick they're fuzzy but

536
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,480
they're in the jar uh they're just

537
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,038
drying and curing like normal we can cut

538
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,759
those leaves off later like I mentioned

539
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,679
before so that's where we are at this

540
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,480
point in the dry and cure phase if we

541
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,919
get those buds into those jars before

542
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,200
they're too dry we are in good shape we

543
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,640
are on the right path here's where we

544
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,480
have to be very careful we are sealing

545
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,640
wet spongy squishy fluffy buds into an

546
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,640
airtight container now inside of that

547
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,759
container is all of the great [ __ ] to

548
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,240
cause the curing reaction but also

549
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,000
what's in that container is all of the

550
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,960
wrong [ __ ] to cause a moldy reaction so

551
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,200
we've got to find a balance here what

552
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,440
we've got to do is pop these jars open

553
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,640
and let out all that stale air so what's

554
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,880
happening is quick version uh check me

555
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,120
if I'm wrong we are sealing that jar up

556
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,919
the moisture inside of that jar is

557
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,000
working with the oxygen inside of that

558
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,038
jar to start breaking down the

559
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,200
chlorophyll inside of that jar so the

560
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:27,480
moisture is necessary to break down the

561
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,558
chlorophyll it will break down that

562
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,200
chlorophyll into to a gas at some point

563
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:36,319
we must open the jar and let that gas

564
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,360
out and let fresh oxygen into that jar

565
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,720
the trick is we cannot let out all of

566
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:42,759
the moisture rapidly as we do this

567
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,000
because the only way to remove the

568
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:47,558
chlorophyll from these buds is with a

569
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,640
little bit of moisture in them still so

570
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:52,000
we want to slowly remove that

571
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,400
chlorophyll by uh sealing that product

572
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,558
in the jar letting that curing uh

573
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,159
there's a word for it that my brain

574
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:58,798
won't say right now I know the word

575
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,360
we've got to let that curing action

576
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,639
happen uh we've got to let that

577
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:03,959
chlorophyll that oxygen that water

578
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,200
battle it out we got to let that

579
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,200
chlorophyll become a gas then we open it

580
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,919
we let that gas back out then we seal it

581
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,159
back up we've got to let that happen

582
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,520
multiple times slowly so basically what

583
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,880
I would like to do ideally and this is

584
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,038
going to be hard for some people but

585
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,760
I've got access to my crop most of the

586
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:22,038
time if you're a commercial grower you

587
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,839
may need a special employee or a team to

588
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:25,240
do this this was Mike's job back in the

589
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,158
day shout out to Mike but here's what

590
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,440
I'm going to do I'm going to seal all of

591
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,159
my jars up or maybe you're using much

592
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,320
larger containers seal those then set a

593
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,760
timer I generally set my first timer for

594
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,000
two hours in two hours I'm going to go

595
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,400
open up those jars now is the time to

596
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,558
make a huge assessment now we will know

597
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,480
if we put those buds into those jars way

598
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:47,759
too early way too late or right on time

599
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,400
a lot of things are going to happen in

600
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,798
that first two hours moisture is going

601
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,919
to move around uh if some of the buds

602
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:56,079
were damp and some of the buds were dry

603
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,759
now they will be even if the buds were

604
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,678
real wet but the sticks had a lot of

605
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,079
moisture in them all that moisture is

606
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,240
going to move around and kind of even

607
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:04,960
itself out if the buds were dry and the

608
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,000
sticks had moisture that moisture is

609
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,440
going to move around now we will see how

610
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
wet those buds truly are at this point

611
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,278
we need to make a decision do we want to

612
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,519
leave those jars open for a few minutes

613
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:16,679
and like I said we just don't want to

614
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:18,519
let them dry out too dry to where we

615
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,240
can't get the Anor robic action is that

616
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,319
the word I was looking for earlier so

617
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,960
that we can't get the antiobese uh the

618
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,759
breakdown to eat up that chlorophyll in

619
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,240
there so you want to leave it open just

620
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,919
to get some air out of there let some

621
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,440
moisture out then at the amount of time

622
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,159
which you desire I would say somewhere

623
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,558
between three and maybe 15 to 30 minutes

624
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,919
if they're real wet if they're real

625
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:39,678
soppy dump them out of the jar and leave

626
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,559
that out on the table for a few minutes

627
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,440
but if it's just sticky and wet leave

628
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:46,038
the jar open 15 to 30 minutes or 3

629
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,558
minutes it's up to you you got to learn

630
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,000
this this is a skill and an art to

631
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:52,558
develop based on the amount of moisture

632
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,880
in that jar so leave it open for a few

633
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,639
minutes uh seal it back up set another

634
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,960
timer for 4 hours at this time and 4

635
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,320
hours repeat the process pop it open

636
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,159
look at it see what you think how wet is

637
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,359
that weed if you don't think it's going

638
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,120
to cause any mold in there seal it up

639
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,158
seal it up for another 4 hours and then

640
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:12,399
go check on it if you think it's too

641
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,360
moist too damp too sticky too gooey at

642
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,919
this point leave it open a little bit

643
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,000
longer we don't want the buds in there

644
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,679
to be spongy and gross but we want them

645
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,960
damp and sticky so that we can slowly

646
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,038
dry them the object here is slow dry

647
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,120
it's to stretch out this dry process so

648
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,400
you want to put them in the jar and

649
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:29,719
leave them in that jar until that gas is

650
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,519
eating up the chlorophyll but then we've

651
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,960
got to let that chlorophyll out and

652
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,079
replace it with fresh fresh oxygen to

653
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,919
keep repeating that process so I

654
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,798
continue with the timer process I'm a

655
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,000
little bit OCD I'll go 2 hours then I'll

656
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,200
go 4 hours a couple of times and then 6

657
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,440
hours and then 8 hours and then

658
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,120
eventually 12 hours and then eventually

659
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,440
you only have to open them every day

660
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,399
once at once a time and for a couple of

661
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,278
minutes by then I've seen a lot of guys

662
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,919
put hygrometers in their jar once you

663
00:22:55,278 --> 00:22:59,400
get to a certain point of moisture which

664
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,799
you desire once you you get to that 63%

665
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,320
you can leave those jars sealed if

666
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,839
you're comfortable with that and that

667
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,798
herb should smoke fairly well uh here in

668
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,639
Colorado it's a real struggle to get the

669
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,038
herb perfect because we've got that dry

670
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
climate everyone talks about that

671
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:13,278
Colorado crunch I'm sure if you're down

672
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,159
in the South it's going to take a little

673
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,200
more time to get your stuff dry because

674
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,120
you've got all that humidity uh some

675
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,679
folks have to set their weed out on the

676
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,798
table for a minute before they can even

677
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,519
smoke it if you set it out too long here

678
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,558
it turns to dust if you set it out too

679
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:28,639
long in Mississippi it gets too wet to

680
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,319
smoke so keep in mind everything I'm

681
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,038
talking about you've got to adapt and

682
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,599
adjust this to your environment not

683
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,640
everybody's got that perfect climate

684
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:38,599
controlled room not everybody's got that

685
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,919
perfect uh state of in their house and

686
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:42,278
their their commercial facility I

687
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,200
understand that so you're going to have

688
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:47,240
to adjust everything and the the plants

689
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,038
are the boss still so pay attention to

690
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,120
the moisture level when you're popping

691
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,119
those sticks if they're gooey wait a

692
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,158
little bit longer if it's a commercial

693
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,079
facility and you're going to have to

694
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,080
leave overnight you may need to stay

695
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,960
late tonight and put those plants in new

696
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,839
container as late as possible I've done

697
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,600
that plenty of times but try to wait

698
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,079
till the perfect moment until they're

699
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,199
not exploding you don't want it to

700
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,240
explode then you went way too long uh

701
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
you don't want it to be gummy and

702
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,159
rubbery that's too early you want it to

703
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,759
just crack just right that's the perfect

704
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,080
time to put those buds into a jar I'm

705
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,480
checking my notes um one thing I did

706
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:22,278
write down if your buds in your jars do

707
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,919
get a little bit too dry here is a way

708
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:26,839
to reconstitute and remoisten them I

709
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,799
don't recommend letting them get too dry

710
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:32,599
but this is a backup plan grab one fresh

711
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:35,200
Leaf off of a plant and put one fresh

712
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:37,759
Leaf inside of your jar and seal it up

713
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,480
for about two hours just two hours will

714
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,200
be enough for a mason jar then take that

715
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,798
leaf out of there and check the moisture

716
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,278
that bud you may need to leave that jar

717
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:48,119
open for a little bit um close it up let

718
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,720
that moisture constitute move around

719
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,439
what's it called equalize then check on

720
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,000
your product out after about an hour

721
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,080
again and see what you need to do with

722
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,278
it from there but that one leaf will

723
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,759
moisturize your plants way way more than

724
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:02,038
you're anticipating so I said two hours

725
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,960
maybe I should have just said one

726
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:06,519
because a lot of people on the internet

727
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,840
really uh have a hard time with details

728
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:10,398
and instructions so let's say 1 hour

729
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,000
after 1 hour with that leaf in there go

730
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:13,239
check on it because then people will

731
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,480
[ __ ] up and extend their time and

732
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,079
they'll still be okay all right so real

733
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,519
quickly um here is my rundown I know I

734
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,119
know I went really quickly but it

735
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,278
doesn't have to be as difficult as a lot

736
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:26,199
of people want to make it prepare

737
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:30,200
yourself get your room prepared uh 50%

738
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:32,759
humidity to 60% humidity 50 to 60° fah

739
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,759
in the room is ideal it can be a little

740
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,480
bit off those are parameters we

741
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,398
understand that not every grower has got

742
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,038
the perfect environment but understand

743
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:41,798
that way too warm is going to dry that

744
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,839
weed way too fast it will get harsh it

745
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:45,918
will taste funky and that will also be

746
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,879
detrimental to your turps so get your

747
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,799
environment get your gear uh defoliate

748
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,640
everything um then chop the plants hang

749
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:55,798
them up in your dark room then

750
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,278
eventually they will snap then you Buck

751
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:00,480
all the buds off then jar them you can

752
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:02,480
trim them before or after the jar The

753
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,079
Cure process is now started open and

754
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,960
close those jars on a schedule something

755
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:09,079
I should mention a lot of people talk

756
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,960
about how stanky wheed is around week

757
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:14,720
seven 8 n as soon as you put scissors to

758
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,399
it it's going to be exponentially stanky

759
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,079
yes I did say stanky um the neighborhood

760
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:20,839
might know the neighbors are going to

761
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,720
smell it if the mailman comes up to the

762
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:25,199
porch he might smell your weed if you

763
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,798
order food they're going to smell it be

764
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,200
prepared for all of that I don't want

765
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:29,879
you to get this far and then get in

766
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,519
trouble because the Harvest was too

767
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,000
stinky if you've got a carbon filter I

768
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,200
would set that up right by where you're

769
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,440
trimming if necessary uh something that

770
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,679
I like to do I go to the grow store and

771
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,200
they sell something um what's a product

772
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,679
called it's um should I know the name of

773
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,919
it and I just can't say the name of the

774
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,240
product it is a smell it's an ozone

775
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,440
product I may have to press pause and

776
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,200
research the name of this [ __ ]

777
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,360
product real quick if you go to the grow

778
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,519
store and you ask them for smell

779
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,319
products to eliminate smell what is it

780
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,480
called dude it just won't come to me

781
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,519
it's a jar and a lot of people tear the

782
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,120
lid off and open the jar and tear that

783
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,720
paper lid off and leave it sitting open

784
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,879
that's not how you're supposed to do it

785
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,679
uh open it up and poke holes in that

786
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,240
paper uh that's on top of there and then

787
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,640
just poke a few holes in the plastic lid

788
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,679
and screw the plastic lid on top of

789
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,919
there it will last a lot longer boys and

790
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,080
girls I'm going to pause and research

791
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,799
the name of this product because it is

792
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,199
driving me crazy I didn't even have to

793
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:19,558
pause and research it because it came to

794
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,558
my head as soon as I started typing

795
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:24,879
smell product in the internet it is

796
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,398
called Ona gel OA Ona gels so what I

797
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,840
would do I would get that jar of Ona gel

798
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,239
and poke hole straight through the top

799
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,839
of it just a few holes you don't need a

800
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,880
lot and it will last much longer and set

801
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,639
that by the doorway like I've got a

802
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,360
little table by my doorway for my keys

803
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,759
and all that good [ __ ] to set it right

804
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,839
there so that when the door opens If

805
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,879
somebody walks in the very first thing

806
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:46,079
they smell is Ona gel the Ona is

807
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,640
designed to suck up bad Aromas and odors

808
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,918
it takes all the molecules I don't

809
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,440
understand the [ __ ] science I'm lying

810
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,120
to you it's designed to kill the odors

811
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,480
but also it makes off its own uh like

812
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,558
Hospital uh it smells like a urinal cake

813
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,919
hospital kind of a smell so the Ona gel

814
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,000
would be beneficial put those at your

815
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,600
front door your back door um if you've

816
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,640
got any sort of air conditioning blowing

817
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,158
air out set the Ona gel next to that

818
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,000
it'll shoot that Ona smell right out

819
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:11,039
through your air conditioner that is my

820
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,839
advice because if you grew good weed I

821
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,200
ordered a pizza and the pizza guy looked

822
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:16,798
at me like holy [ __ ] bro as soon as I

823
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,519
opened the door he knew I was trimming

824
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,079
luckily I went to high school with that

825
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:22,640
pizza dude so I've known that dude for a

826
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,558
long time was not an issue shout out
