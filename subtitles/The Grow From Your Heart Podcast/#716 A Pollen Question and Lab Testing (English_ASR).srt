don't be shy the first message in

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,959
today's episode came from our friend

55
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,119
jamie and it says in the subject line i

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,520
heard you say thc percentage doesn't

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,280
mean anything i would like to learn why

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,760
can you point me to an episode there is

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,719
not an episode yet but now there will be

60
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,399
an episode to teach you why i feel odd i

61
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,159
don't mean the thc percentage doesn't

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,920
mean anything but there's more to this

63
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,520
message let's just read it says i do

64
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,759
believe you and i'm not challenging you

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,200
in any way i just want to understand why

66
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,560
you said that then he does talk about

67
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,919
some more stuff

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,519
which we don't need to discuss here on

69
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,919
the podcast just talking about branding

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,319
and other things uh but our friend jamie

71
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,559
asked the question um apparently

72
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,318
obviously somewhere either on instagram

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,039
live on social media or perhaps right

74
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:52,479
here on this show i did say that thc

75
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,239
percentage does not matter um it does

76
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,639
matter a little bit but it is not the

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,120
deciding factor it should not be the

78
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,839
deciding factor when it comes to buying

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,599
your medical or recreational cannabis

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,598
products whether it's your uh your

81
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,399
flowers your dabs uh whatever you're

82
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,238
buying the thc percentage should not be

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
the number one factor i do have a few

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,800
notes here and we'll talk about why

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,680
um the main reason why

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,360
um being immersed in the industry being

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,319
uh deeply involved in the industry

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,280
having experience i know that the tests

89
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,958
themselves are very easily manipulable

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,719
manipulative

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,158
you can manipulate those tests very

92
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,719
easily you guys can translate that

93
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,039
however it should have been done um

94
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,120
i know how to make a lab test come out

95
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,878
better it has nothing to do with the lab

96
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,158
many people say they just pay the lab no

97
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,719
they don't that everybody would just be

98
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,199
paying the lab everybody would have 45

99
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,039
thc that's what everybody would do

100
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,518
that's not a thing you cannot pay the

101
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,359
lab what you can do you can manipulate a

102
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,200
lab test i know how to do it i'm not

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
going to teach you how to do it here

104
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,798
it's very easy to increase the potency

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,719
of the samples which you were sending to

106
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,400
the labs you're supposed to do it in

107
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,158
colorado there's supposed to be a very

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,158
strict guideline

109
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,280
a standard operating procedure of how

110
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,959
the sample should be taken however

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,878
there's nothing forcing you to do it

112
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,239
that way you can if you're smart if

113
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,399
you're smooth

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,199
if you don't follow all of the rules you

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,720
can make the lab tests appear much

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,879
better than what they are so the first

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,440
reason why i don't trust a lab test is

118
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,439
uh they're very easily manipulated

119
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,879
easily manipulated and that doesn't that

120
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,879
doesn't work well for me if i know that

121
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,040
i can easily manipulate it and teach

122
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,800
employees how to get better lab tests

123
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,280
then anybody out there can do it we can

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
all figure it out um

125
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,319
it's all about prepping the sample if

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,478
you take the sample certain ways certain

127
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,639
spaces do certain things to it you can

128
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,839
definitely manipulate that test

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,400
then

130
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:49,359
also thc is not the only thing that

131
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,519
matters when you are smoking um

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,479
i've smoked what matters is the

133
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,039
combination of cannabinoids terpenes and

134
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,319
other compounds that all work together

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
to give you

136
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,319
the desired effect i can go right now to

137
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,319
many dispensaries ah there's a

138
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,759
dispensary 10 miles that way four miles

139
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,800
that way they're everywhere where i am

140
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,199
right now

141
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,478
i can go just a few miles and i can buy

142
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,759
99

143
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,918
98

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,319
thca diamonds that's just straight up

145
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,279
thc they're available

146
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,759
right next to them for half the price is

147
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,478
green dot batter uh green dot full

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,160
spectrum diamonds and sauce plenty of

149
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,839
other company stuff i prefer the green

150
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,919
dot batter because uh i prefer the other

151
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,439
stuff in the mix i don't just want the

152
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,439
thc the thc is a small part of it but

153
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,519
those other things in there really so

154
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,600
i've described it as this before when i

155
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,038
take i've i've hit the thca i've hit a

156
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,800
lot of it i bought a big old they used

157
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,719
to sell it in carrots when the stuff got

158
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
popular there was a dispensary just

159
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,080
selling big diamonds of it they thought

160
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,519
we thought we all thought it was awesome

161
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,038
i'm bored with it now because i've

162
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,599
realized

163
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,079
that when i take a dab of that no matter

164
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,240
how big it is i get super high my my

165
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,599
high goes up think of it this is how i'm

166
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,840
gonna describe it think of it as a

167
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,919
firework when you smoke thc or thc a

168
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,359
that's your liftoff from your fireworks

169
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,120
you're going to go up of course you're

170
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,520
going to go up that's what your thc is

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,000
going to make you do the more thca the

172
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,439
more thc probably the higher up you're

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
going to go but you're just going to go

174
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,519
up now the terpenes the esters the

175
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,600
paleontes the flavonoids all of those

176
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,758
other things that are in there are the

177
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,160
things that contribute to the color of

178
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
your fireworks another way i'm gonna put

179
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,600
that is

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,120
that's what gives you the munchies

181
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,720
that's what gives you the giggles that's

182
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,560
what gives you paranoia that's what

183
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,039
gives you pain relief that's what gives

184
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,120
you uh sometimes when i dab i gotta poop

185
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,560
sometimes it makes me hungry

186
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,000
lots of different things happen from

187
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,759
different strains sometimes the same

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,560
strain will have a lot of different

189
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,120
effects on me but i think a lot of that

190
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,918
is from the other compounds not just the

191
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,240
thc the thc is great in there that's

192
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,918
what's going to make me go up but i know

193
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,918
i can mess with the lab test to make it

194
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,598
look like there's a lot of thc in there

195
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,198
and i know that i need all those other

196
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,319
things we've called it the entourage

197
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,400
effect uh the synergistic effect uh the

198
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,879
full spectrum effect we need all those

199
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,918
other components to actually make the

200
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,800
buzz uh more enjoyable more medicative

201
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:19,758
more medical more for me it's just more

202
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,199
it's a recreational enjoyment i enjoy uh

203
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,800
so i could you could give me all the

204
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,038
diamonds and set them right here pure

205
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,439
thca crystals and you could give me a

206
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,360
bunch of green dot labs batter give me

207
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,759
some of that gmo batter maybe some of

208
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,280
that picasso or the dolly the dolly's

209
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,400
the one i really like give me the dolly

210
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,638
batter

211
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,079
or maybe some of their live rosin even

212
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
and i'm gonna smoke that over the

213
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,758
diamonds ninety percent of the time i

214
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,318
may take some of the diamonds over here

215
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,120
the thca crystals and maybe crunch them

216
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,960
up and sprinkle take a dab of the batter

217
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,360
and just coat it like put sprinkles on

218
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,839
the outside of it with the thca diamonds

219
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
the little crystals the shiny parts

220
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,318
that's going to make it taste better

221
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,079
that's going to give it a better buzz

222
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,400
and it's just going to increase the thc

223
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,478
a or the thc i'm not sure i keep saying

224
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,239
a or a thc i don't i don't i didn't

225
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,000
write it down but i feel like when i

226
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,519
smoke that i can only get so high i

227
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,279
start getting the sweats i start to get

228
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,198
a headache but if you put the other

229
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,799
stuff with it you give it some some

230
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,720
terps mainly you give it that flavor

231
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,160
that other stuff then you get a really

232
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,280
nice buzz you can really achieve

233
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,080
something

234
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,079
it's almost harsh and too much too much

235
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,918
thc by itself

236
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,560
the dabs they burn my throat they burn

237
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,079
my lungs it's not a desirable dab

238
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,439
you have to get it hotter than a normal

239
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,918
dab so that's also a little bit

240
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,440
uncomfortable then on top of that it

241
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,199
kind of burns your throat on the way in

242
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,959
burns the lungs and then it gives me a

243
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
headache when i uh i feel like when i

244
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,559
come down from it it gives me it's not

245
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,399
desirable it's like a headache it's the

246
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,918
best way i can describe it maybe not be

247
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,679
like the worst headache but i can feel a

248
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,199
lingering thing that it was like my

249
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,559
body's going yeah where's the other part

250
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,600
you need the other part to make this

251
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,479
work

252
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,560
so

253
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
that's my opinion on the thca diamonds i

254
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,119
think that that is what i meant when i

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,600
said the thc is not the only thing

256
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,959
it matters

257
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,360
but it shouldn't be

258
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,039
what happens is so i said the tests i

259
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,519
can manipulate the test what's going to

260
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,599
happen is i run a commercial grow i take

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,120
the samples or i manipulate the samples

262
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,440
we send them to the lab they come back

263
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,600
with impressive results we put that on

264
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,000
the jar or on the advertising at the

265
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,839
dispensary that draws a clientele the

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,839
clientele that just shops for thc

267
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,600
percentage since we know that's gonna

268
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,440
work we just mark that one up five more

269
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
dollars an eighth or whatever i don't i

270
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,000
don't work in that department but i know

271
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,319
that that's how it works i go to the

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,639
dispensaries and i see uh the flowers

273
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,360
and i see the [ __ ] that's marked like 18

274
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,080
percent thc and below is one price point

275
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,680
18 to 22 is another and then 22 and up

276
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,600
that's the top shelf stuff they charge

277
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,439
you more for that and

278
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,080
it's kind of just a who knows if that

279
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
number is even accurate they tested

280
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,360
so you're supposed to test a couple of

281
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,879
buds out of the batch but you might be

282
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,278
running a two pound batch you could be

283
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,559
running a 50 pound batch of the same

284
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,799
product and the tests are going to be

285
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,719
very inconsistent among that whole

286
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,399
spectrum of all that flour and that big

287
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,959
ass bin

288
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,399
i really do love lab testing

289
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,919
i love a lot of it

290
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,320
uh but also

291
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,799
the labs are allowed to have a plus or

292
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,839
minus ten percent threshold so when i

293
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:17,120
say that this flower is 30 thc

294
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,320
it could be 20 it could be 40. so

295
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
10

296
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,120
when especially when most of our samples

297
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,600
are coming around the 25 to 30 percent

298
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,440
how do i know they're not 15 to 35 to 40

299
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,120
percent that's something that we well i

300
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,160
should keep in mind so i'm gonna check

301
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,799
my notes uh we are all machines the

302
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,559
machines love thca they love that the

303
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,159
high liquid high pressure liquid

304
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,319
chromatography machine loves to show you

305
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,078
that it's got a lot of thc in the test

306
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,519
our bodies aren't machines we need all

307
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:48,078
of the other components to make that

308
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,120
more desirable in my opinion also um

309
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,359
this is

310
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
this is a joke i love to make

311
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,519
machines never buy another eighth i've

312
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,278
never had a machine come back and say

313
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,039
bro that hit really high numbers can i

314
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,480
get another quarter a machine has never

315
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,879
done that i've had a lot of people come

316
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,639
back and say dude i smoked that bag so

317
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,799
fast can i get another quarter that's

318
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,639
stuff that has happened so the machines

319
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,159
i like the machines i love the testing

320
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,919
it's great uh

321
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,399
they're great uh what are they called

322
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,319
markers uh yeah it's like a marker like

323
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,639
a like just a marker a data point is

324
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,560
maybe what it is but it's not that i'm a

325
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,799
body i'm a person we're all different

326
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,039
the machines don't care if you like

327
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,879
more thc more cbd

328
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,039
more limonene more immersing the

329
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,639
machines don't care they go lots of thc

330
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,838
and that we're not a machine you need

331
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,078
all the other stuff all right i think

332
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,160
i'm rambling let me check my notes uh

333
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,799
thc percentage is a good selling point

334
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,480
it's a good guideline it's a good idea

335
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,879
it's something to keep in mind when

336
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,360
shopping but it should not be the

337
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,600
definitive end-all be-all decision maker

338
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,159
when you are buying your medical or

339
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,519
recreational cannabis products i've done

340

345
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,360

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,440

348
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,959
when when you smell things ninety

349
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,320
percent of the time when you smell

350
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,399
something and your body goes oh that's

351
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,480
bad you shouldn't consume it when you

352
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,799
smell something and your body goes oh

353
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,959
yeah you should be consuming that

354
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,120
oranges smell good because they're good

355
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,479
for you poop smells bad because you

356
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,240
probably shouldn't eat that somebody

357
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,879
already ate it that's all their waste

358
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,120
that's nature did that on purpose for us

359
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,519
uh that's that's a blessing and a trait

360
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,959
and a skill that we were given uh when

361
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,159
you drive past the restaurant and

362
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,599
they're cooking whatever whatever your

363
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,199
favorite restaurant is and you smell it

00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,559
that's what i think i was getting at

433
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,159
be sure to smell the jars

434
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,559
look at all the buds look at the shapes

435
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,000
the smells are the shapes the colors the

436
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,359
textures of the buds something's gonna

437
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,198
get your attention just like when you're

438
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,199
looking at the menu at your favorite

439
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,479
restaurant or at a new restaurant you're

440
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,719
looking at it and you're going oh they

441
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,159
got this for me it's just a bunch of

442
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,240
random vegetarian [ __ ] you guys have

443
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,078
never heard of but vegetarian item one

444
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,480

00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,240
you'll decide the cannabis will do that

449
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,560
if you go and smell the jars follow your

450
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,320
nose because your nose knows what you're

00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,879
you quite quickly a lot of times when

you get a terpene report they're showing

480

483
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,600
myself they're not saying that the

484
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,000
overall

485
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,720
sample you gave them contained 25

486
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,360
percent limonene or mercine what they

487
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,839
are saying in that report is that there

488
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,959
were was a sample out of all of the

489

terps derived from that sample 25 of the

490
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,359
overall terps were this component i

491
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,039
don't remember the terps i named because

492
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,039
i'm ahead of myself again but

493
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,039
so don't get confused it's there when

494
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,039
they do the sample they'll say this much

495
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,240
of the overall product was terpenes it's

496
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,559
going to be low it's going to be like

497
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,159
one to four percent probably like that's

498
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,319
that's good terpenes about like that's

499
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,439
run do or that's impressive that's good

500
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,240
um but of those four percent

501
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,320
now you've got 100 of your terpenes

502
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,440
four percent of your to overall flower

503
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,560
was terps now you've got that now 25 of

504
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,160
that

505
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,638
is where your limonene is going to be

506
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,958
your 10 mercene so don't get confused

507
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,160
and say my sample was 25 percent

508
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,639
limonene and 35 thca because then what

509
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,839
else do you have you just got like 40

510
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,000
35

511
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,519
sludge to carry that in it's got to be

512
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,400
bud it's got to be chlorophyll and green

513
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:17,359
leafy matter at that point so uh read

514
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,199
those lab tests correctly now let me

515
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,719
move on i do have another great question

516
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,558
i got a big pile of questions in front

517
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,480
of me is this the one that i wanted to

518
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,639
read for this episode sure this one will

519
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,838
work very well

520
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,520
excuse me for all the throat clearing

521
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,599
probably not even going to edit that

522
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,599
this one came from our friend adam and

523
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,918

and informative thank you that is

527
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,839
absolutely the goal here uh also a

528
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,759
little bit of education says nothing

529
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,279
better than hearing you ramble dude this

530
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,038
is the episode for you i said i was

531
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,200
gonna try to not ramble

532
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,919
fail uh it says it's the best part of

533
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,679
the show so maybe i failed successfully

534
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,840
uh just a heads up i'm a big fan of

535
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,400
growing cannabis comedy and also fish

536
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,558
bro did we just become best friends we

537
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,759
should hang out it says just wondering

538
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,319
if you ever thought about naming your

539
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,879
strains after a fish song or fish

540
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,359
lyrics as a fan purchasing a fish strain

541
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,440
would be a must i have thought about it

542
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,199
there's a concentrate by green dot they

543
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,120
call it reba jam which is definitely

544
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,519
named after of course reba if you're a

545
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,038
fish fan it's a good reba jam which uh

546
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,918
bag it tag it sell it to the butcher at

547
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:26,240
the store can't go wrong with that uh it

548
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,400
also says also is it possible to buy or

549
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,400
create and store male pollen that's a

550
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
whole totally different question so let

551
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,160
me ramble on about the fish part i do

552
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,038
have a couple of fish strain names in my

553
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,400
head but nothing has been

554
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,839
um

555
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,759

614
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,640
let's talk briefly about male pollen yes

615
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,879
um you can buy male pollen i uh

616
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,720
man i'm not a fan of buying or selling

617
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,080
male pollen i feel like if you're going

618
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,200
to breed plants if you're going to breed

619
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,279
cannabis if you're going to make your

620
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,640
own seeds you've got to do some of the

621
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,319
work buying pollen is

622
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
i don't wanna it's it's jus that's just

623
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,240
the cheap lazy way nope you didn't do

624
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,919
any selection how do you know that that

625
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,759
male is gonna be fire we know that

626
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,038
solomon is fire because i've tested him

627
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,679
so if you bought that pollen which i

628
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,359
won't sell um if you bought that you'd

629
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,798
know you've got winning pollen but if

630
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,719
you're just buying pollen from somebody

631
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,879
on the internet or some dude you're

632
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,400
trusting their selection process and

633
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,080
that's like letting them that's like

634
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,159
letting them pick your [ __ ] wife or

635
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,839
your husband or your mate and i'm not

636
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,480
down to let somebody else pick that for

637
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,319
me i'm not i'm not in an arranged

638
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,400
breeding project i'm in a selective

639
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,879
breeding project that's why i like to

640
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,360
choose i choose my male plants my female

641
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,480
plants based on criteria what is your

642
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,719
goal you don't know what that other

643
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,159
grower or breeder or selector that's all

644

they were we don't even know about them

645
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,360
they're a selector at this point we

646
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,519
don't know what their goal was we don't

647
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,359
know their education their knowledge uh

648
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,200

649
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,439

650
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,640
their ma made it just been a [ __ ] the

651
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,840
one that could have been the one male

652
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,520
plant they had now they're just using

653
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,798
pollen which that's cool if that's what

654
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,960
you're doing but do you really want to

655
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,200
make seeds out of just some male plant

656
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,480
or do you want a selected uh sought

657
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,919
after plant with traits and alleles and

658
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,279
things that you're after or do you just

659
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,960
want do you want the one i picked or the

660
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,399
one that you picked when we go to the

661
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,759
restaurant you want me to order dinner

662
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,000
for you or do you want to [ __ ] with the

663
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,319
menu and order your dinner that's how i

664
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,159
see it so i don't like buying pollen i'd

665
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,839
rather hunt out my own meals it's not

666
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,520
really that much work you just do it

667
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,519
just like you would females just find a

668
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,038
male ah you and then you've got it once

669
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,679
you've got the meal you've got it there

670
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:36,480
is more to it uh storing pollen yes you

671
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,200
can run a male plant so

672
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,798
you should have uh you're gonna finish a

673
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,880
seedless crop right you should have a

674
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,319
male plant in the veg and then right

675
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,080
when you finish or right before you

676
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,158
finish that crop put him in there and

677
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,918
let him start flowering out

678
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,200
collect his pollen and it's only going

679
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,400
to take him

680
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,840
14 21 25-ish days to start making plenty

681
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,200
of pollen for you to start catching it

682
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,359
and playing with it by day 26 27-28 he's

683
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
really busting a lot of pollen you can

684
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,359
cut him down gather the pollen and clean

685
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,200
up then you can just clean up the room

686
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,719
and can continue back on your normal

687
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,360
cycle so you can put yourself behind a

688
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,360
couple of weeks to get a male or you

689
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,359
can't have a male in another location in

690
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,959
the same grow space if you are careful

691
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,959
and know what you're doing

692
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,120
i've got a grow space

693
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,798
where i keep my main breeding area

694
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,759
inside that breeding area there's a

695
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,519
three by three grow tent that ducks the

696
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,839
ducting goes out of the tent and

697
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,918
directly out of the house so there's no

698
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,319
possibility of that pollen being

699
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,960
reintroduced to the main grow space it

700
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,879
goes directly outside the rest of it is

701
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,200
ducted inside that room but that one

702
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
tent ducts all the ducting directly

703
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,720
outside so it will never make the pollen

704
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,400
back into the room when i start

705
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,240
pollinating the boy he goes in there

706
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,080
early i get him ahead everybody else

707
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,000
when it's time for him to bust a nut i

708
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,000
just open up that tent slowly drag him

709
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,839
out sprinkle them all over the plants so

710
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,159
if you're careful about it you can keep

711
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,678
a boy in there depending on how much

712
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,919
pollen you need how long you keep them

713
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,919
around you only need them in flour for

714
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,440
10 i don't know more than 10 excuse me

715
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,520
for about 14 to 25 maybe 26 27 days you

716
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,038
can get pollen from him depending on how

717
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,119
many seeds you want to make how hard you

718
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:15,278
want to go you can get pollen then you

719
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,599
can store it let's talk briefly about

720
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,038
storing pollen before you store it so

721
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,798
collect it somehow i'm not sure how

722
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,200
you're going to collect it i would say

723
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,480
get a pyrex dish cut down the the top

724
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,278
part of the male plant set it in the

725
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,120
pyrex dish let it dry uh give it a tap

726
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,038
all the pollen will start falling out

727
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,879
pull out anything that is not pollen if

728
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,879
you've got male flowers in there leaves

729
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,360
in there buds in there get all of that

730
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,200
[ __ ] out we just want pollen let it dry

731
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,519
put a desiccant pack in there so it will

732
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,519
dry you don't want a boveda you want the

733
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,759
pack that sucks up all the moisture dry

734
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,319
that [ __ ] out get it as dry i'm going to

735
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:51,599
say dry about 12 or 30 more times get it

736
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,439
as dry as dry can dry it needs to be dry

737
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,278
any moisture in your pollen will destroy

738
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,240
it it will not be active so get it

739
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,159
what's the word dry pollen get it dry

740
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,159
get that pollen dry seal it up put it in

741
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,720
either a glass container some of those

742
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,880
little glass vials a glass jar or you

743
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,480
can put it in a baggie label it with the

744
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,799
male plant and the date which you

745
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,720
collected it then keep it in a cool dry

746
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,119
dark place i put mine in a brown paper

747
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,000
bag in the crisper drawer in the fridge

748
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,839
that's simply how i store my pollen um

749
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,200
don't open it too often don't take it

750
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,558
out of the fridge too much think about

751
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
condensation

752
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,599
think about temperature changes just

753
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,519
leave it in there until you need it then

754
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,599
take it out scoop out what you need do

755
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,200
your pollination you're safe that way be

756
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,038
careful with pollination turn off all

757
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,480
the fans um

758
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,000
if you just want to pollinate one or two

759
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,679
plants in the room take them out of the

760
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,319
room leave the rest in there pollinate

761
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,919
them spray them down a couple hours

762
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,278
later then put them back in the room

763
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,000
spray the rest of the [ __ ] in there

764
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,679
too so no pollen gets contaminated uh

765
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,599
water deactivates pollen so that will

766
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,559
help you out a lot the water will

767
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:56,240
destroy the pollen i think i've answered

768
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,079
most of these questions here um

769
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,440
uh keeping a mail yeah that's that's a

770
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,879
challenge sometimes just make sure you

771
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,080
don't pollinate the house uh you'll

772
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,919
figure it out that's you'll figure it

773
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:04,960
out you'll [ __ ] it up once or twice then

774
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,278
you'll figure it out that's all it

775
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,200
really takes uh you can buy pollen i

776
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,960
don't recommend it why not just do the

777
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,558
work why not get a pack of seeds you're

778
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,558
growing seeds or growing plants anyway

779
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:15,839
get some seeds find a dude that really

780
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:17,599
impresses you and then you've got a male

781
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,199
that nobody else has why do you want the

782
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,719
the male plant everybody else has got

783
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
that's boring to me

784
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,880
um

785
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,798
yeah you can store paul and you can

786
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,720
collect it and you can use it later in

787
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,400
the future i think i've answered your

788
