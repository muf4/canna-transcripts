00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,340
podcast let's move our way into the fun

58
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,899
part of this episode I've been doing I'm

59
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,459
not sure if it's been an experiment on

60
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,840
myself or if I've been noticing

61
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,719
something about myself

62
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,959
but I noticed that last week I could

63
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,400
smoke everything and not get the buzz I

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,259
desired I could smoke all the

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480
concentrates I could smoke all the

66
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:32,459
flowers I ate some edibles and I was

67
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,039
just not achieving the level of

68
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,719
medication or the buzz level that I was

69
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,340
trying to achieve and I was getting

70
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,840
frustrated with it I was just smoking

71
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,239
more I thought maybe I need to take a

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,800
little bit of a break but then this week

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,200
I don't know what's going on but things

74
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,120
have balanced themselves out this week

75
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,039
all I have to do is take a little tiny

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,719
itty bitty little dab and I feel like

77
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,479
I'm just completely wrecked I'm getting

78
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,400
so lit off of my dabs I'm making up for

79
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,199
the excessive consumption last week and

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,019
I'm saving some this week just because

81
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,119
when I do smoke I'm getting extra lit so

82
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,400
my question to you is do you go through

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,379
phases where sometimes you can look at

84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,480
your dabs and catch a nice Buzz or other

85
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:11,639
times when you can smoke all of the dabs

86
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,679
and not even get a buzz at all is that

87
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,059
just me is that something seasonally is

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
that something with my diet something

89
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,598
with my mood something with blood sugar

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,879
brain chemistry who knows what's going

91
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,039
on but I want to know is it just me does

92
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,899
that sort of stuff happen to you also

93
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,179
send me a message grow from your heart

94
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,400
at hotmail.com or hit me on Twitter or

95
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,780
social media let me know am I the only

96
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,480
one going through this weird phenomena

97
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,580
of where sometimes I can buy a few grams

98
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,959
of concentrates and they'll last me a

99
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,280
week and then sometimes I could buy the

100
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,459
same amount of concentrates and it will

101
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,459
last me a day is it just me or do you do

102
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,680
that also let me know because man last

103
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,019
week I smoked double what I normally

104
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,280
smoke and this week I'm smoking half of

105
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,780
what I normally smoke and I really

106
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,419
notice a huge difference but I'm not

107
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,340
doing anything uh differently diet wise

108
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,500
or life or physically Wise It's just

109
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,180
seems to be the only difference is it's

110
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,439
colder now and that doesn't really I

111
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,840
don't think that makes a difference it

112
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,639
is super cold today hasn't been so cold

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,979
I don't know if that makes any sense all

114
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,658
right where do we go from there all

115
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,340
right let's segue into our next topic

116
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:13,859
I've got something I think will be fun

117
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,798
to talk about my question to you is are

118
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,439
you doing things in your garden that are

119
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,019
completely useless because they are a

120
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,639
ritual they are a habit uh maybe you

121
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,680
were doing it because one of your

122
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,879
uncle's friends did it in the 70s and he

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,978
told you you could do it and you tried

124
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,540
it and you just never stopped my idea

125
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,159
and my question is are you doing things

126
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,900
in your garden just because you've been

127
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,460
programmed to do it because you think it

128
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,560
might be doing something because you saw

129
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,180
somebody else doing it do you have a

130
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,280
rhyme and reason and a method for

131
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,319
everything that is happening in your

132
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,779
garden I've noticed some people are just

133
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,699
doing some things just because it's a

134
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,258
habit and they don't know why they're

135
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,540
actually doing the steps that they are

136
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,879
doing we spend a lot of time money

137
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,280
energy and effort on our garden we hope

138
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,139
to have a beautiful outcome if we can

139
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,819
streamline the amount of time we spend

140
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,960
in there the amount of money and the

141
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,699
amount of energy that we have to put

142
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,799
into that garden and still get a quality

143
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,439
outcome I think that helps us out one of

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,780
my job is a jobs as a consultant is to

145
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,699
go to your commercial facility walk

146
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,079
around for a day view your grow your

147
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,240
employees your plants and see what's

148
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,099
happening and then it is my job to make

149
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,800
that grow more proficient if it's better

150
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,439
production less cost I am there to

151
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,579
increase productivity and save money so

152
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,100
there are several ways you could

153
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,599
probably do that in your grow I'm not at

154
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,039
your growth so I don't know what's going

155
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,199
on but the next time you're in there

156
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,180
think about it are the moves and steps

157
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,680
that I'm making are they necessary think

158
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,720
about from the minute you open the door

159
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,060
to that grow to when you start mixing

160
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,620
your nutrients when you check your pH to

161
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,060
where you do everything in that grow

162
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,399
when you touch the plants when you

163
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,379
whatever you're doing is there a rhyme

164
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,179
and a reason for it think about why am I

165
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,699
doing the action I am doing right now

166
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,400
what does this do to my plants what does

167
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:56,160
it do to my plants right now later today

168
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,679
tomorrow in three days and seven days

169
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,840
and two weeks in the long run before

170
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,639
Harvest Time think about the full

171
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,138
outcome of everything you were doing to

172
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,060
those plants

173
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,160
keep in mind that the things you do to

174
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,100
your plants today may not show you

175
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,560
results or benefits very soon it may be

176
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,720
two three five seven days it could be

177
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,579
two weeks five weeks maybe nine weeks

178
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,680
down the line before you see the results

179
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:23,279
of what you did is that consequences or

180
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,259
rewards we may not know so go slow uh

181
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,359
think twice before you cut anything you

182
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,538
can't put [ __ ] back on but you can cut

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,300
[ __ ] off don't uh over feed you can feed

184
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:34,800
more but you can't take back food so

185
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,660
think about every move you are making

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,819
before you make it in that grow and

187
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,800
think about does this have a reason does

188
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,900
this have a purpose why am I doing this

189
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,939
in the grow maybe like I said earlier

190
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:46,978
maybe maybe I told you something years

191
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,379
ago you should do this and you've been

192
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,300
doing that in your grow maybe your style

193
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,159
has changed maybe your room has changed

194
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,020
maybe your equipment changed that thing

195
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,380
I told you might not even be necessary

196
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:00,839
anymore micro evolves and changes uh

197
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,159
probably uh more quickly than a lot of

198
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,599
people because I have a lot more input

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,939
and also more experience I'm not as

200
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,199
afraid to experiment and maybe kill a

201
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,300
couple of plants that's another thing I

202
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,100
should talk about don't get so trapped

203
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,680
into your routine that you're afraid to

204
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,180
try new things be able to maybe risk a

205
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,740
plant or two and that's how you learn

206
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,139
and how you expand and how you improve

207
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,840
if you don't take risks you will not get

208
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,699
better so what I'm saying is are you

209
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,959
doing things in your grow because it's a

210
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,400
habit because you learned it from

211
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,918
somebody a long time ago and you've just

212
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,978
been doing it or does every step of your

213
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:34,258
grow have a purpose a rhyme a reason and

214
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:35,699
a method why are you doing that if you

215
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,800
can eliminate that step and save

216
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,300
yourself some time don't do it if you

217
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,340
can eliminate a product or a step

218
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,199
that'll save you money that's beneficial

219
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:46,198
right away we all like saving more money

220
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,759
you can buy yourself more things but try

221
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,079
to have a reason for everything you were

222
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,580
doing in that grow if I were there

223
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:52,318
watching you and I said hey bro why did

224
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,359
you do that you should have a solid

225
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,460
reason if I did that because of this and

226
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,038
I just I do that every time I've been

227
00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:00,478
doing that for years okay why do you do

228
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,098
that every time why have you been doing

229
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,019
that for years what is your reason for

230
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:05,519
the actions you are taking Every Act

231
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,620
action has an equal and opposite

232
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,779
reaction are you getting a benefit are

233
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,340
you messing up your plants what are you

234
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,079
doing let's think about everything we're

235
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,899
doing in there now I want to give a big

236
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,698
shout out to my dogs because this part

237
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,038
of the show was inspired by my dogs let

238
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,538
me tell you a funny short story here

239
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,180
um I got into a relationship with the

240
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:25,378
lovely lady she had two puppies

241
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,879
um when you get out of the shower at

242
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,500
that house those two puppies they're not

243
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,660
puppies they're uh small Terrier dogs

244
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,158
they're adult small Terriers when you

245
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,740
get out of the shower those two Terriers

246
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,000
love to lick your feet when you are wet

247
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,820
they just want to lick your ankles and

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,559
your feet when you're wet recently we

249
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,140
got another dog probably close to a year

250
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,179
ago we got another dog that dog has

251
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,458
learned that he likes to lick feet also

252
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:48,719
the dog has no idea why he likes to lick

253
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,859
feet he doesn't know what it does he

254
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,180
doesn't know what he's doing but he

255
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,159
knows that every time I get out of the

256
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,259
shower he really wants to come into the

257
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,600
bathroom and lick my feet he learned it

258
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,639
from Tikka who guess what learned it

259
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,740
from the dog that was previous to that

260
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,480
one who has since passed away a dog

261
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,860
taught another dog something and now

262
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,420
that dog is talking another dog

263
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,919
something and that dog thinks it's a way

264
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:11,219
of life that if something is required

265
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,139
and it has absolutely no reason why that

266
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,300
is a requirement of its life I thought

267
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,278
it was silly to learn that one dog

268
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,139
taught another dog and that dog taught

269
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,458
another dog and that third dog has no

270
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,500
idea why he's doing it the first dog

271
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,879
probably doesn't either but I was like

272
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,259
that's like people in their Grow rooms

273
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,360
people are just doing [ __ ] because they

274
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:29,159
saw that dog do it and then that dog did

275
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,778
it and now guess what that dog's gonna

276
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,699
do it too and they don't even know why

277
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,679
so shout out to the dogs they definitely

278
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,600
inspired that portion of the podcast are

279
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,979
you being a silly dog or is there a

280
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,899
reason for you to be doing the crazy

281
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,339
[ __ ] that you're doing in your grow all

282
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,320
right let's do move forward because that

283
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,480
was a fun silly subject I really did

284
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,940
enjoy that one all right now let's jump

285
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,740
into my next topic I was recently at a

286
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,540
friend's grow and they were talking

287
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,820
about how they have switched to amended

288
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,919
soil and they're doing a living organic

289
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,260
amended soil so that they don't have to

290
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,819
feed bottled nutrients they went on to

291
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,980
talk about how their bottled nutrient

292
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,420
required them to do too much work so I

293
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,420
just kept listening and let them kind of

294
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:08,939
talk they revealed to me that they were

295
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:10,979
taking each bottle and filling a

296
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,140
container with water and adding the

297
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,240
recommended dosage of that nutrient to

298
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:17,879
the five gallon bucket mixing it up

299
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,259
pouring that into the plants then they

300
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,240
would take the next bottle that was

301
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,220
recommended and mix that into a five

302
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,680
gallon bucket and pour some of that into

303
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,259
each plant so this person was under the

304
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,199
impression that their base nutrient the

305
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,120
cow mag bottle the booster bottle the

306
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,519
enzyme bottle all had to be mixed

307
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,399
separately into containers of water then

308
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,980
fed to the plants if you were doing that

309
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,019
that is a lot of extra work I hope that

310
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,759
made sense the way I explained it there

311
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,139
are several bottles in your feed regimen

312
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,120
I don't know which company you chose

313
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,039
some people are under the impression

314
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,778
that each of those bottles needs to be

315
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,578
mixed into its own container of water

316
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:56,278
and fed to the plants that is not the

317
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:58,500
case let me teach you how I recommend

318
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,778
mixing your bottled nutrients if you do

319
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,120
choose to use bottled nutrients this

320
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:05,458
will work for reverse osmosis water this

321
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,159
will work for tap water this is just my

322
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:10,439
basic advice and uh method of how I

323
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,240
recommend you mix your bottled nutrients

324
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,399
I'm going to start with a five gallon

325
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,320
bucket here just a Lowe's bucket a Home

326
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,940
Depot bucket whatever five gallon bucket

327
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,278
you've got that's what I'm going to talk

328
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,740
about using for my starting container so

329
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:25,139
I've got my five gallon bucket I fill it

330
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,820
about 80 to 90 percent of the way with

331
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,379
water I need some mixing space I don't

332
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,180
want to Spill the [ __ ] everywhere I

333
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,679
leave uh maybe an inch inch and a half

334
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,259
at the top so that I've got some working

335
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,199
room so I fill my bucket with water now

336
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:39,480
I add my nutrients one nutrient at a

337
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,100
time by the recommended dosage what

338
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,539
you're going to feed it is up to you I

339
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,278
would start off with maybe fifty percent

340
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:46,799
of the recommended dosage on the bottle

341
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:48,120
maybe 70 you probably don't need a

342
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,620
hundred percent of what they recommend

343
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,659
you'll really be pushing your plants

344
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,120
that is another podcast we'll talk about

345
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:56,100
at another time but select your bottles

346
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,778
that you're going to feed understand how

347
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,399
much of each bottle you need to feed now

348
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:01,379
I'm just going to stay we're gonna we're

349
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,820
gonna start with one bottle measure out

350
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,399
how much you're going to use I'm going

351
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,899
to say 10 mils per 5 gallon container so

352
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,059
you put your 10 milliliters in your

353
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:11,278
measuring device and you pour that into

354
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,259
the five gallon container now you get

355
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,759
the next bottle and before you pour any

356
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,439
bottle always shake it that's something

357
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,600
that I should mention grab the bottle

358
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,519
shake it measure it Pour it into your

359
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,259
five gallon container now the next

360
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,759
bottle we're gonna you might want to

361
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:25,200
clean out your your measuring container

362
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,700
that's always a good idea wipe that out

363
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,920
give it a quick wipe with a paper towel

364
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,259
or a rag make that fresh and clean grab

365
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,278
your next bottle Shake It Up let's just

366
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:34,200
say we're going to do 10 more

367
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,360
milliliters of this product measure out

368
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,820
10 milliliters close your bottle back up

369
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,620
pour that 10 milliliters into the same

370
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,620
five gallon bucket we're going to put

371
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,179
all of our products into the same five

372
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,339
gallon bucket of water I don't know how

373
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,259
much water you need to water your entire

374
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,360
crop or your room or this run or this

375
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:52,980
light or whatever but mix up the

376
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,139
appropriate amount of water and we can

377
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,240
put all of the nutrients into that water

378
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,879
at one time we don't have to mix up

379
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,339
separate vessels for every product that

380
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,838
is highly unnecessary that is a lot of

381
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,120
extra work I realize now that a couple

382
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,459
of people we're mixing that way so they

383
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,139
were mixing if there was six bottles in

384
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:12,179
the products lineup they were mixing six

385
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:14,039
buckets of water and then trying to feed

386
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,019
a little bit of each bucket to each

387
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,819
plant that's a that's a struggle that's

388
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,639
a lot of extra thinking carrying and

389
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,220
mixing working that is a phing that's a

390
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,019
big pain in the ass so get your bucket

391
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,540
fill it with water get your first

392
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,519
nutrient I recommend and this is just a

393
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:32,338
suggestion or recommendation I recommend

394
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,440
you start with your silicates first get

395
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,060
your silicate bottle shake that [ __ ] up

396
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,100
measure out the amount that you need

397
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:40,859
pour it into your five gallon container

398
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,720
and stir it counterclockwise that's my

399
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,879
recommendation Stir It counterclockwise

400
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,278
get it a good spin make sure it's nice

401
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,980
and mixed in there then I would use my

402
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,600
base nutrient would be next clean out my

403
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,278
measuring container find my base

404
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,139
nutrient bottle give it a good solid

405
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,120
shake so nothing's at the bottom it's

406
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,740
all mixed up real well measure out the

407
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,799
amount that I need probably somewhere

408
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,299
between 25 and 50 milliliters possibly

409
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,399
100 milliliters if you're using a

410
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,319
Botanical product product pour that into

411
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,639
your five gallon container your

412
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,399
silicates are in there now your base

413
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,680
notes are in there once again give it a

414
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,000
stir give it a good solid stir so that

415
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,439
it's going to keep on stirring so that

416
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,879
when we add our next bottle which I

417
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,399
would recommend at this point will

418
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,958
probably be that bottle of cow mag find

419
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,700
the clean out your measuring container

420
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,439
find your bottle of Cal Mag measure out

421
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,420
the appropriate amount close your bottle

422
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,220
back up pour that into the five gallon

423
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:30,539
container it's still spinning from when

424
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,519
you stirred it up real hard a minute ago

425
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:34,860
still spinning so just rely on that spin

426
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,078
keep it going uh then I would add the

427
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,539
boosters then the enzymes and then I

428
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:42,659
would do the microbes last some people

429
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:44,278
will tell you to pH your water after you

430
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,439
add your microbes and some people will

431
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,620
say to pH your water before you add

432
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,019
microbes I've had Success With both

433
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,299
methods so get the water stirred up add

434
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:56,459
your potassium silicate or your silicate

435
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,679
nutrients then your base nutrients then

436
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:01,319
all of your add-ins your cow mag your

437
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,120
Bloom boosters your enzymes and then I

438
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,740
would recommend probably the microbes

439
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,600
last

440
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,100
um and you can adjust the pH before or

441
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,079
after those microbes let's talk about

442
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,339
that after you've mixed in all of your

443
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,138
nutrients everything you're going to put

444
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,060
in there give it a good mix make sure

445
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:17,039
everything is mixed in really well Stir

446
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,539
It counterclockwise then when you're

447
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,819
done give it just a couple of good

448
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:23,338
clockwise stirs to mix everything in

449
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,920
real nice there then we want to adjust

450
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,500
the pH if we need to this is where I

451
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,719
recommend a high quality pH pen I use a

452
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,220
blue lab pen and I calibrate it uh

453
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,079
probably every 10 days I should do it

454
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,399
once a week I hit it about every 10 days

455
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,278
two weeks to be honest with you

456
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,198
calibrate the pH pan then dunk that pH

457
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,240
pin right into your five gallon bucket

458
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,179
of water of your solution is what now

459
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,299
that is and measure the pH of that we

460
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:50,759
want that pH to be somewhere between 6.2

461
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,879
and 6.5 that is going to be the

462
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:56,039
acceptable range I like 6.4 myself I

463
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,958
really think 6.4 is a great spot for the

464
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,059
pH the way you're going to change that

465
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,799
if it's too high if you put your pH

466
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,039
meter in there and it says anything

467
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:07,139
above 6.5 you need a bottle of PH down

468
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,139
and put a couple of drops of pH Down

469
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:12,360
Stir It and measure that pH again go

470
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,459
slow with the ph up or down products

471
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,980
because it only takes a little tiny bit

472
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:20,458
to ruin the entire mix you can go too

473
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,740
high or too low very very quickly also

474
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:25,078
I recommend you wear gloves and eye

475
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,379
protection when you are using the ph up

476
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:30,479
and or pH Down products also don't mix

477
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:32,399
those if you put too much ph down in

478
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,560
there I wouldn't recommend putting ph up

479
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,419
in there to fix that only use one of

480
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,739
those products at a time that will cause

481
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:39,899
that could potentially cause you

482
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,879
problems depending on the nutrients that

483
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,740
you are using so we have filled our

484
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,778
bucket we have put our potassium

485
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,698
silicates in there we stir it put our

486
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:49,679
base notes give it a stir cow mad give

487
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:51,059
it a stir every other nutrient maybe

488
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,679
give it a stir between them unless you

489
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,119
can rely on that spin action that you've

490
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,859
created some there are some people

491
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,419
that'll put up a pump in that bucket

492
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,100
just to keep it moving that's a little

493
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,019
excessive if it's a five gallon anything

494
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,300
bigger put a mix bump in there get it

495
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,578
stirring add all your nutrients put your

496
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:07,740
microbes in there last then let's adjust

497
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:10,019
the pH get it somewhere between six two

498
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,759
and six five six four is The Sweet Spot

499
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:14,039
in my opinion I think nutrients really

500
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,379
absorb well at that point then adjust

501
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,659
your pH then something I really find

502
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,400
important write everything down what did

503
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,798
you put in there write down every

504
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,259
product that write down the date the

505
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,179
time every product that you put in how

506
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,400
much of it you put in then write down

507
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,040
the pH the next thing I would recommend

508
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,660
is measuring the EC or the ppms it

509
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,940
doesn't matter to me which one you use

510
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,340
as long as you pick one and stick with

511
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,500
it that's all that matters you can get a

512
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,779
pen that does EC and pH it'll change it

513
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,819
with the push of a button pick one go

514
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:46,079
with the EC or the PA or the ppms I mean

515
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:47,819
I apologize for saying the wrong letter

516
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,339
a moment ago lots of letters and

517
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:53,339
acronyms in my brain pick the EC or the

518
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:55,798
ppms write that down every time you mix

519
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,659
up a solution write down the ph and the

520
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,119
EC of that solution before you feed it

521
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,220
to your plants document it this may help

522
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,839
you in the future so we've mixed

523
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,419
everything up we have adjusted our pH

524
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,339
we've written down the EC now let's

525
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,340
water our plants

526
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:12,359
if you've got uh decent sized plants

527
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:14,519
that are healthy and they've got an

528
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,139
established root Zone within their pot I

529
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:19,139
recommend Watering your plants till

530
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,580
somewhere between 15 and 25 runoff you

531
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,559
want water coming out of the bottom of

532
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,538
your pots when you get that runoff

533
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,119
coming out of the pots I recommend

534
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:30,119
collecting some of it and testing the ph

535
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,519
and the EC of that runoff it's real easy

536
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,139
to stick the two pins in that container

537
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,139
and it will show you on the screen the

538
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,360
pH is this the EC is this at this time

539
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,120
don't stress worry or concern yourself

540
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,798
with those numbers until we see a

541
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,659
problem with the plants those numbers do

542
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,400
not matter once we see problems with the

543
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,440
plants we can start looking at the

544
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,419
numbers of what we put in versus the

545
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,279
numbers that came out if the numbers of

546
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,559
the EC is too high the plants aren't

547
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,359
eating if the pH is too low we can just

548
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,819
adjust and make Corrections based on

549
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,099
that but I do not make any changes to

550
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:04,558
the runoff until I see the plants are

551
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,298
angry if it ain't broke don't fix it

552
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,759
we're just going to use these numbers

553
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:11,279
for reference if we do have a problem

554
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,500
this is data this is Fail-Safe data for

555
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,200
if there is a problem don't rely too

556
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,940
much on this unless you see issues so

557
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,740
water till you get runoff then collect

558
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,720
some of that water and measure the EC

559
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,279
and the ph and Mark that down like I

560
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,038
said don't worry about the numbers now

561
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,899
but they're there if we need them in the

562
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:30,240
future so at this point you should have

563
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,160
everything written down every nutrient

564
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,038
that you fed it the amount of that

565
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,480
nutrient the EC and pH the date even

566
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:37,558
maybe write down the temperature if

567
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,839
that's something that one of your

568
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:42,000
devices will show you the more data the

569
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,678
better when things go wrong that way if

570
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,419
things go wrong we know where things

571
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,000
went wrong we can have an opportunity to

572
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,400
fix it but also if things go super good

573
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,859
now we can repeat those results next

574
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,900
time you've got a like a chart a map of

575
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,279
exactly what you fed just feed them that

576
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,740
next time and hopefully they'll come out

577
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,058
just as good if not better alright
