got answers to questions they were

128
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,158
embarrassed to ask so

129
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,280
people were taking dabs at places they

130
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,639
weren't sure how to handle some

131
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,919
equipment or maybe they were watching

132
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,958
their friends take dab somewhere and

133
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,719
they wanted to join

134
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
but they were intimidated or afraid by

135
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,759
gear afraid of

136
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,040
gear now they knew how to jump in

137
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,079
because they watched me do it i showed

138
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
them how to use the gear

139
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,040

140
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
right up to speed they're getting blazed

episode the first

174
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,439
message from patreon came from our

175
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,720
friend north north terps what up north

176

good to hear from you again

177
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,759
the message starts off a lot like this

178
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,639
it says

179
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,479
what's up my diggity dog [ __ ] uh

180
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,478
then he called me a bad [ __ ]

181
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,159

183
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,479
love joey but settle down

184
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,359
it goes on to say anyways for the pg

185
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,758
version

186
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,400
i love you dog what's up i just had a

187
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,360
grow hack

188
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,038
question what works for me is i have a

189
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,759
portable air conditioner with an

190
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,240
insulated ventilation going out of my

191
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,120
tent

192
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,120
with a fan and a dehumidifier and the

193
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,478
portable air conditioner working against

194
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,478
each other for humidity

195
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,079
i found that the balance works in there

196
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,240
and there's a lot of waste water that

197
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,478
comes from my dehumidifier

198
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,439
uh the waste water does not read on my

199
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,159
ec so can i recycle this water into my

200
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,038
system

201
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,919
that is my question all right so our

202
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,918
friend's got

203
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,120
a system that's got a dehumidifier and

204
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,318
an air conditioner in the room and

205
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,720
they're finding that the

206
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,879
dehumidifier is creating a lot of

207
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,400
condensation and it's gathering a lot of

208
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,199
water i've seen this happen a lot that's

209
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,120
very common

210
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,879
it's pulling the air from the air or the

211
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,759
water from the air gathering it into a

212
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,399
little container

213
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,520
you've got all this water this north

214
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
north terps is going to say this

215
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,318
listener but it's north north trips we

216
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,879
know who they are north

217
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,400
wants to know if they can use that water

218
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,839
if they can recycle it into their

219
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,519
watering system

220
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,000
and it's not measuring anything on the

221
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,719
ec meter you put an ec meter and a ppm

222
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,319
meter in there

223
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,000
it shows zero there's nothing in that

224
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
water for now

225
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,839
i would say that that water is safe but

226
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,639
what could happen

227
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,119
is gunk and [ __ ] i don't know exactly

228
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,280
what

229
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,560
but build up could build up in your

230
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,638
dehumidifier

231
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,720
build up could build up gunk build up

232
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,918
mildew calcium who knows i don't know

233
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,479
exactly what

234
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,240
but random [ __ ] could build up inside

235
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,598
the dehumidifier you could get things in

236
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720
the hoses you can get things in the

237
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,399
filters

238
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,160
i'm sure you've had a water filter i'm

239
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,038
sure i'm sure you've seen what

240
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,639
just basic water can do to filters and

241
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,639
pipes it makes things really grody and

242
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,478
really dirty so that stuff will build up

243
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,840
over time possibly

244
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,439
i don't know what's in the air i don't

245
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,918
know what's in that humidity that you

246
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,680
are getting

247
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,680
into those filters into those parts so

248
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,240
my advice would be you can use it

249
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,560
probably but continue to test it make

250
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,038
sure that it's always testing at zero

251
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,038
maybe don't use that water right away on

252
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,240
all of your plants maybe test it out on

253
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,959
a couple of plants

254
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,800
it is testing it zero now but like i

255
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,198
said maybe stuff will build up maybe

256
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,840
gunk

257
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,120
mold junk dust who knows what's going to

258
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,560
build up in the filters

259
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,639
and what will build up in that thing if

260
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,720
you don't keep it super clean that water

261
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,240
may have something in it in the future

262
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,160
so at this point while the machine is

263
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,680
new yeah you can probably get away with

264
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,039
it but i don't know that i would do that

265
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,720
in the future

266
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,719
uh make sure it's clean that's my best

267
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,120
advice that i can give you i've had

268
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
uh varying opinions from different

269
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,079
expert growers on this

270
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,000
a lot of us say go ahead and use it a

271
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,598
lot of us are also very paranoid that

272
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,720
there could be other [ __ ] in there

273
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,279
in the future so that's my uh my final

274
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,120
answer

275
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,878
you can use it but pay attention keep

276
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,160
testing it pay attention to the plants

277
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,240
maybe dilute it

278
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,000
maybe you do like 10 percent this water

279
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
and 90 the other water that way you're

280
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
kind of spreading it out but not wasting

281
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,759
it

282
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
maybe use this water for cleaning or

283
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,240
something like that maybe

284
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,360
um but i think you can use it as long as

285
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,879
it stays clean

286
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,639
and as long as over time your machine

287
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,719
doesn't get dirty and get

288
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,759
junk developing inside of there [ __ ]

289
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,920
crap dust

290
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,838
dirt grime goo whatever can build up in

291
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,719
there boogers it's air boogers dude it's

292
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,160
machine boogers

293
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,759
you don't want that part going to your

294
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,838
plants all right so i think i've

295
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,439
thoroughly disgusted everybody so far

296
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,080
let's keep moving with these patreon

320
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,838
what up easy good to see you bro

321

hope you're doing well out there the

322
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,480
message goes when you decide to keep a

323
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,519
mother plant

324
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,039
you ever top pop crack twist or just

325
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,639
grow it naturally

326
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,079
uh there are multiple parts to this

327
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,720
question so i'll stop and handle this

328
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,480
part

329
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
a mother plant when i'm growing a mother

330
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,879
plant it is mainly

331
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,639
for preservation i don't have room for a

332
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,720
lot of plants in production so i don't

333
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,360
need to produce a lot of clones

334
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
so i keep a very small mother plant and

335
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,800
i try to keep them growing very slow

336
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,320
just keep them alive i don't need them

337
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,319
doing too much i don't need them racing

338
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,360
i don't need them too excited

339
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,360
i do top them because i don't need that

340
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,039
one big top bud touching the light i top

341
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,278
them make a little canopy

342
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,639
and get a nice little bush going on so i

343
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,039
will top it

344
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,639
but then as it grows i'm taking but

345
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,399
branches from the top to keep that

346
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,600
branching going

347
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,759
oftentimes my mother plants become my

348
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,200
flower plants also they become a mother

349
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,559
plant i get a few clones i shape them

350
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
the way that i want them i keep them for

351
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,479
a while

352
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,079
then once they're big and they're shaped

353
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,959
the way that i want i take a couple

354
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,199
clones off of that

355
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,719
those new clones then become my future

356
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,839
mother plant and that big plant that's

357
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
been getting worked on

358
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,760
goes in the room and gets worked with it

359
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,680
either gets flowered out or pollinated

360
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,439
but i need small mother plants if i'm

361
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,278
just keeping a plant for preservation as

362
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,720
a mother plant i don't require a lot of

363
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,320
clones i don't require a lot of

364
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,320
production from my mom's

365
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,839
so i keep them small i keep them under

366
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,278
minimal light they're not even under a

367
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
whole bunch of light just enough to keep

368
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,078
them going keep them alive

369
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,799
keep them on a 19-5 cycle i do not

370
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,039
really

371
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,559
pop crack or twist my mother plants i

372
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,000
just let them grow naturally

373
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,679
take the top out so that they start

374
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,200
bushing out that's my first call that

375
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,439
first clone right off the top

376
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,120
that's my next production i run that

377
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
this one veggies for a while gives me a

378
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,600
couple clones then i flower that one

379
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,439
generally

380
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
so not too much work on the mother

381
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,880
plants unless they're being groomed and

382
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,000
trained and manipulated to be future

383
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,439
flower plants

384
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,039
so there's another part to the question

385
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,800
it says in your experience

386
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,879
how long does it take a plant like lemon

387
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,240
jeffrey to go from 20 to 30

388
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,919
perfect trichomes to over ripe um you

389
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,039
picked a very specific plant you said

390
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,479
lemon jeffrey

391
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,559
most plants i'm gonna say that's a

392
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,639
window of seven to ten maybe seven to

393
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,919
fourteen days when

394
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,360
so there's like a three to five day

395
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,719
period when they're perfect you're like

396
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,919
ooh tomorrow will be just the right day

397
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,440
and you look and they're perfect

398
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,519
then you got like three to five days of

399
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,839
perfection then about

400
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,039
i don't know seven 10 14 days then you

401
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,720
start going oops i probably should have

402
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,599
cut those down a couple days ago maybe a

403
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,040
week ago

404
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,759
so it's about a week of a week window of

405
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,759
prime

406
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,120
cut down time and then by day seven

407
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,799
you're going oh they're starting to get

408
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,560
a little more amber by day 10 you're

409
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,479
like that's a lot of amber by 14 you're

410
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,399
like oh i should have cut that [ __ ] down

411
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
so i'm gonna say it's a five day window

412
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,000
of good cutting a seven day window of

413
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,800
you better get it done and then by day

414
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,639
14

415
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,799
you've kind of missed your opportunity

416
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,039
then it says could i go into that 48 to

417
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,120
72 hour darkness right when i get to 20

418
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,958
to 30 percent and then harvest

419
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,879
thank you for everything you do and the

420
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,879

436
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,440

anything they ask i do my best to field

438
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
the question they're live in the chat

00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,679
and answer your grow

440
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,519
questions so if you've got a basic grow

441
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,599
question that is a good place

442
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,278
to catch me instagram live i hang out i

443
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,040
take dabs i get lit up i talk to my

444
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:15,600
friends it's much more informal than the

445
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,519
show

446
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,120
just to relax hang out so i'm glad you

447
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,959
were enjoying the instagram lives

448
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,399
i'm glad you're loving the new youtube

449
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,838
videos they take a little bit more work

450
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,958
a little bit of editing but i'm glad

451
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,880
you're checking those out

452
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,439
now let's address the question can i put

453
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,200
it into 24 to 72 hours darkness

454
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,680
right when i get to 20 to 30 and then

455
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,160
harvest yes that would work

456
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,879
the lemon jeffrey is not a big fan of

457
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,719
that long

458
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,320
dark period i've ran this plant a lot of

459
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,800
times more of the

460
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,399
uh wider leaf shorter squatty plants

461
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,399
prefer that dark period

462
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,078
the taller thinner leaf plants are not

463
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,839
as much of a fan of that type of

464
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,000
treatment but it will work

465
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,440
your plan your strategy will work you'll

466
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,639
see a lot of dead leaves when you take

467
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,920
it out of there they'll be all yellow

468
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,079
they'll fall off

469
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,679
but it will work for you that will not

470
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,759
be a bad strategy

471
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,879
uh get them to 20 to 30 that's about

472
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,198
where you want them anyway

473
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,799
throw them into that 48 to 72 hour and

474
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,838
then chop them down that should be

475
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,919
just about perfect for you uh maybe cut

476
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,600
down one plant on one day and do that

477
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,719
cut down the next one another day and do

478
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,079
that if you've been growing multiple

479
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,079
plants in the same area

480
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,359
just see how much they differ see how

481
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,719
much which one you like that's the way

482
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,240
you dial it in perfectly

483
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,000
for your setup but you're not going to

484
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,480
notice too much difference cutting down

485
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,399
two or three days apart and then that 48

486
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,039
to 72 hour darkness that should harden

487
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,320
them up it

488
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,240
may make them beef up a little bit at

489
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,160
the end but uh lemon jeffrey

490
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,360
is not a big fan of that sort of

491
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,519
treatment i think the uh

492
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,560
the sativa dominant cultivars are the

493
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,399
things that want to be

494
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,000
uh put in the or not put in the dark the

495
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
indica dominant sorry i messed that all

496
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,360
up but you know what i mean now i'll say

497
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,959
it correctly the indica dominant

498
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,399
cultivars are the plants that seem to

499
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,000
prefer that extended dark

500
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,440
the sativa plants they just go a little

501
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,039
bit crazy get kind of angry

502
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,959
all right now there is another part to

503
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,759
this question easy followed up a few

504
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,559
days later

505
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,000
it says when you are ramping down ppm

506
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,159
and you go into flush

507
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
do you maintain the same distance with

508
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,278
your lights

509
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,199
when i started to ramp down and go into

510
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,838
flush it seems like my plants act like

511
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,759
they are too

512
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,519
close to the light much love and

513
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,278
appreciation for everything you do i

514
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,839
wish i could attach pictures

515
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,838
as always my lemon jeffrey is killing it

516
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,360
bro i am excited to smell and smoke some

517
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,320
of that lemon jeffrey let's hang out one

518
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,399
of these days

519
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,600
and talk shop but let's address this

520
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,759
question here

521
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,759
when we are ramping down ppm's and going

522
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,159
into flush do i maintain the same

523
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,919
distance with my lights yes

524
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,519
because at this point my lights are

525
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,039
probably raised as high as they go

526
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,639
because the plants have grown all the

527
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,639
way into the light i don't waste any

528
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,360
space i get the plants as tall as they

529
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,399
can go

530
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,079
in my spaces in a lot of commercial

531
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,559
environments the lights stay at one

532
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,198
height

533
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,638
they're 12 or 16 or 18 feet high they

534
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,159
stay there they don't move

535
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,919
that's where they go i can't move them

536
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,639
they're on a trapeze with 100 lights in

537
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,399
one thing

538
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,399
they're not movable so the lights stay

539
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,839
there in a personal grow like i said the

540
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,679
plants have grown so tall that there's

541
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,920
nowhere to move the lights

542
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,359
you are saying that it looks like uh the

543
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,799
plants are starting to act as if they

544
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,919
are too close i followed up with a

545
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,240
backup question

546
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,838
i said what gives you the idea that it

547
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,039
looks like the plants are too close and

548
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,560
he said that the leaves start doing

549
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,360
funny things and the pistols start

550
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,518
curling

551
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,600
i think that is just the plant being

552
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,519
done there's no more nutrient left

553
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,040
the plants like hey you were feeding me

554
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,879
and now there's no more nutrient

555
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,719
i'm kind of hungry i'm gonna freak out a

556
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,320
little bit the leaves kind of curl up

557
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
it's sucking all the nutrients all the

558
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,079
sugars all the energy from those leaves

559
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,680
i think that it's just the end of the

560
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,198
plant's life i think it's done

561
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,719
and it knows it and it looks a little

562
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,639
bit upset about it but

563
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,720
the good thing is we're not growing to

564
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,000
smoke leave consume leaf if those leaves

565
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,560
look a little shitty at the end

566
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,399
that's okay we want big fat trichome

567
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,159
covered buds that taste delicious

568
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,839
if your leaves are kind of yellow and

569
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,799
crispy and fallen off that's a good sign

570
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,639
that you possibly

571
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,000
probably flushed and there's nothing

572
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,959
left in that plant it's going to burn

573
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,120
nice and smooth

574
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,719
it'll burn clean it'll taste real well

575
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
all your friends will be really proud

576
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,240
be really impressed you won't choke you

577
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,879
won't cough it should be

578
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,160
a grade product so um i don't think

579
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,759
you're too close to the light

580
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,360
if you feel like you're too close if the

581
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,919
plants are too close raise it up a

582
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,678
little bit

583
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,520
if that's not an option maybe you can

584
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,640
turn it down i'm not sure your situation

585
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,759
i don't know if you're in a tent

586
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,038
if you're in a room i don't know if

587
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,160
you're limited on height i don't know if

588
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,279
you can go any higher

589
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,439
i don't know if you can turn down the

590
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,599
ballast but the only way to find out is

591
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,199
to experiment and do it but honestly

592
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,359
i think that last little bit is when the

593
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
plants want the most white so i wouldn't

594
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,879
stress too much

595
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,960
i think they're going to be okay uh but

596
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,160
experiment like i said the only way

597
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,720
to learn is to experiment all right you

598
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,880
guys

599
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480

the advice is even better thank you

639
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,399
i'm sure you noticed i went back to the

640
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,759
big mic and the big headphones today

641
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,720
just trying to put out a super quality

642
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,519
show while i learned the other

643
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,759
microphone

644
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,359
i was more comfortable with this one i

645
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,079
goes on to say on one of your recent

646
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,599
episodes

647
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,038
you said everyone thinks you are a

648
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,639
psychic because you knew to answer the

649
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,240
air conditioning questions

650
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,320
but you've been dropping the exact

651
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,120
episodes i have needed at the perfect

652
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,599
times

653
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,599
i love hearing that i love knowing that

654
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,439

right when everybody's room got hot i

656
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,400
love knowing that i put out

657
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,840
an episode about whatever you were

658
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,120
thinking about right at the right time

659
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,678
you were thinking about it that is

660
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,599
awesome

661
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,038

is supposed to and i'm able to help

663
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,359
people right at the right time so

664
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,038
that feels good it goes on to say i've

665
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,759
recently purchased a couple of packs of

666
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,079
your seeds

667
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,200
i got a rise and double dragon great

668
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,199
selections bro

669
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,880
i plan to purchase many more build that

670
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,759
collection bro like pokemon you gotta

671
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
catch em all

672
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,119
then it goes on it says i decided to pop

673
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,279
the double dragon seeds first and was

674
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,599
very happy to get a 100

675
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,879
germination rate on them ah a minute

676
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,480
says that he's got some

677
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,160
less than satisfactory results with

678
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,679
other breeders uh then it says i was

679
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,000
even more excited to see that four out

680
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,759
of the five turned out to be female

681
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,759
that is awesome dude full germination

682
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,119
and a lot of girls that's always fun it

683
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,879
says the girls are growing beautifully

684
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,599
and are approaching week seven of flower

685
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,679
currently

686
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,959
i will email you with some pictures very

687
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,559
soon as i know

688
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,000
you would enjoy seeing them yes please

689
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,519
send me some emails on my kids

690
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
i'd love to see what they look like what

691
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,079
they're wearing what they're doing how

692
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,640
they're doing in school

693
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,720
send me pictures of those seedlings

694
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,640
those [ __ ] weak seven flowers now

695
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,839
can't wait to see them now let's get

696
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,600
back on track it says

697
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,359
so back to you being a psychic yes

698
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,519
psychic jeff here at your service

699
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,359
uh call me now for your free reading

700
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,200
says a couple of days after starting the

701
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,199
double dragon seeds i thought to myself

702
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,798
i wish rasta jeff had a strain review

703
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,880
episode on double dragon

704
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,720
so i went to check and it was like two

705
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,760
weeks earlier you had dropped that

706
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,919
episode

707
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,919
um so i was psychic and ahead of you i

708
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,919
put it out there for you all right

709
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,919
moving forward i decided i was probably

710
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,799
going to self a couple of these girls

711
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,038
and create some

712
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,918
s ones something i've done before with

713
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,359
success

714
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,520
and that was right about the time your

715
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,199
feminizing episode which offered me a

716
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,079
plethora of additional

717
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,038
knowledge on the subject so our friend

718
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,480
got some seeds

719
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,240
then i put an episode out about the

720
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,839
seeds then he wanted to self them i put

721
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,759
out an episode about selfing this is

722
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,240
working out pretty well for you bro

723
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,000
um then it says i am rambling as i'm

724
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,720
sure you understand so i will get to the

725
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,960
topic

726
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,919
at hand hey no worries about rambling if

727
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,319
anybody knows

728

rambling that is me welcome to the rambo

729
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,079
club hashtag they like it when we ramble

730
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,200
if you guys notice i do keep checking my

731
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,798
phone cause i'm hoping to get some

732
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,080
rambling in with white mike today

733
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,000
just waiting for him to text back and

734
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,000
make no promises now let's get

735
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,359
to the rest of i apologize for holding

736
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,480
this email right in front of my face

737
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,839
also if you guys are watching on the

738
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,720
video i just blocked the whole camera

739
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,199
with this paper

740
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,720
i apologize trying to be professional

741
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,840
here it goes on to say

742
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,480
my question now is how does female

743
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,720
pollen react with different genetics

744
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,839
if i throw some other girls of different

745
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,919
genetic background

746
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,519
in with the plant that i'm selfing what

747
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,440
traits and characteristics

748
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,720
should i expect the offspring to keep

749
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,519
from the plant producing

750
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,960
pollen and the plant-producing seeds if

751
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,119
they are not the same

752
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,480
genetics that's a very good question

753
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,879
says i assume they will

754
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,679
still mostly be female now if you were

755
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,480
making

756
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,080
if you used a reversed plant a reversed

757
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,400
female to make pollen they should

758
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,319
all be female if you did it correctly if

759
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,159
you selected properly if that plant is a

760
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,879
true female if it doesn't have intersex

761
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,600
traits

762
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,640
then you should have all 100 female

763
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,798
offspring so

764
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,880
i know they should all be female but how

765
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,079
does an f1 no it's not an f1 which you

766
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,039
were working with

767
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,240
is an r1 and an s1 when you take that

768
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,158
reversed pollen

769
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,599
and put it on a plant of the same

770
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,440
cultivar that is an

771
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,119
s you are selfing it i think i've

772
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,759
described this in another episode

773
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,558
the selfing the s1 that is when a plant

774
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,558
basically

775
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,079
[ __ ] itself that is a crass way to put

776
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,240
it but you'll never forget it

777
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,359
if you take pollen of golden goat put

778
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,919
pollen of

779
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,399
golden goat on golden goat it just self

780
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,799
itself

781
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,000
it [ __ ] itself it made s1 seeds it's

782
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,000
all golden goat

783
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,200
now let's talk about if we take that

784
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,359
pollen and put it on

785
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,038
other cultivars if we took the golden

786
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,798
goat pollen and put it on a

787
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,400
lemon skunk plant we have now created

788
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:56,000
lemon jeffrey that is an

789
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,360
r1 a reversal one we took we took i said

790
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,038
tooked i'm not even going to edit that i

791
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,918
want you guys to hear me say tooked

792
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,480
it happened all right we took reversed

793
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,799
pollen

794
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,599
and put that reversed pollen on a female

795
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,879
cultivar

796
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:12,000
and that made reversal seeds r1 so

797
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,120
s1 when it [ __ ] itself that's self r1

798
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,880
reversal pollination r1 reversed pollen

799
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,239
onto a different cultivar

800
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,919
so i'm sure you're never going to forget

801
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,159
that with those terms in your brain

802
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,600
so let's continue it says ah they'll all

803
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,400
be female but how does

804
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,759
r1 and s1 differ when using male and

805
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,480
female pollen

806
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,640
additionally if a plant is hemp and i

807
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,279
breed it to a plant that produces almost

808
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,159
all thc i assume i would find phenotypes

809
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,240
that express cbd dominance thc dominance

810
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,559
and some that are mixed ratios your

811
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,159
input would be very valuable on this

812
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,678
you don't need to read this on the next

813
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,880
episode uh i

814
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,559
wasn't the next one but i got you up

815
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,240
there pretty quickly bro and it says

816
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,158
thank you for keeping me entertained

817
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,319
thanks for super charging my girl with

818
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,960
excellent advice i love your style

819
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,319
and thank you for breeding fire genetics

820
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,159
bro this is a great question

821
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,240
gives me an opportunity to talk a little

822
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,600
bit about breeding and everybody knows i

823
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,440
love to talk about breeding and i don't

824
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,599
do it enough on the show so

825
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,960
um if you take the pollen from your

826
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,119
reversed female

827
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,000
you want to know what traits to expect

828
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,239
if you put that

829
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,159
on different plants if the plant

830
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,720
producing seeds and the plant-producing

831
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,559
pollen

832
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,079
are not the same plant and then you want

833
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,960
to know about thc

834
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,240
and cbd ratios from different uh ratio

835
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,720
plant parent plants

836
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,640
that's a very good question if you take

837
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,240
that reversed pollen and put it on

838
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,880
other cultivars depending on the

839
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,038
dominance of traits of those plants you

840
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,240
are most likely going to see

841
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:42,400
basically 50 50 crosses if you take

842
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,679
golden goat and lemon skunk and you

843
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,080
reverse that golden go

844
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,200
we've done this before put that reversed

845
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,599
golden goat pollen

846
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,319
onto the lemon skunk it makes lemon

847
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,079
jeffrey

848
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,439
if you look at those two plants if you

849
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,960
were able to grow those two plants i've

850
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
never released the lemon skunk that i've

851
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,679
got

852
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,798
it's kind of a very unique cut if you

853
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,480
look at that plant

854
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,079
and you grow it and you know it and then

855
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,640
you look at the golden goat you grow it

856
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,558
you know it

857
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,880
and then you see lemon jeffrey you can

858
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,359
see exactly which traits came from which

859
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,440
parent i can see it very clearly

860
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,359
so when you take that pollen and you put

861
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,640
it on other plants

862
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:19,278
most commonly you're going to get 50

863
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,159
plants that look like 50 the mommy and

864
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:21,440
the daddy

865
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,360
then you're gonna get i should say

866
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,798
closer to 30ish percent because there

867
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,879
are going to be some outliers but

868
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,319
in the main main scope of things we're

869
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,760
going to get 50

870
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,000
that look like 50 50 of the mommy and 50

871
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,240
of the daddy then we're going to get 25

872
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,640
percent that look like the original mom

873
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,558
plant

874
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,320
then we're going to get 25 that look

875
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,960
like the original paul and donor which

876
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,000
we'll call

877
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,200
the dad plan so those are the three main

878
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,359
phenotypes you're going to see now

879
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,000
depending on recessive traits of the

880
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,759
parent plants we use we may see signs of

881
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,278
the grandparents popping up whatever the

882
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,839
grandparents of each of those plants

883
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,400
were

884
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:56,879
you may see some of those phenotypes pop

885
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,640
up so

886
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,919
you're going to get the main three then

887
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,440
maybe a couple of others

888
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,320
so there's probably going to be three

889
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,400
dominant phenotypes one major phenotype

890
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,918
a couple of secondaries and then two

891
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,679
outliers that kind of come up is

892
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,440
generally what i think you're gonna see

893
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,759
in a feminized cross that you're putting

894
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,960
pollen on other plants it's very similar

895
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,640
to crossing uh non-feminized stuff

896
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,640
very similar you're gonna find very

897
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,880
similar uh punnett squares

898
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,720
charts results so now let's talk about

899
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,200
the second part of this

900
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,200
if a plant is hemp and you breed it to a

901
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,360
plant that produces thc

902
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,240
and by hemp we're just uh indicating

903
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,798
that that plant contains 0.3

904
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,120
thc or less that is a hemp plant so it's

905
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,599
got high in cbd

906
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,038
not very little to none thc in it now

907
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,519
we're going to breed that plant to

908
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,119
king solomon who is very high in thc

909
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,200
what's going to happen there

910
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,158
we're going to find plants that are rich

911
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,679
in cbd

912
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,080
we're going to plan find plants that are

913
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,440
rich in thc which one did i say first

914
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,639
we're going to find the other one i got

915
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,640
stone and forgot you're going to find

916
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,520
thc rich plants you're going to find cbd

917
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,200
rich plants

918
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,639
you're going to find plants with crazy

919
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,400
numbers either direction

920
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,559
now the beautiful thing that will happen

921
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,919
is hopefully we will find outliers

922
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,599
hopefully we find something that

923
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,360
surpasses both parents

924
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,359
maybe we find something with way more

925
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,879
cbd than the starting parents maybe we

926
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,199
find something with thc

927
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,799
that far surpasses the starting parents

928
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,640
that would be our goal here

929
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:21,839
that number will be in there the

930
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,000
cannabinoids

931
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,278
in my opinion in my experience the

932
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,599
cannabinoids don't

933
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,278
breed as solid as a lot of the other

934
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,480
traits if you want to focus on just

935
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,319
cannabinoid breeding

936
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,079
you kind of have to line breed for the

937
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:36,398
cannabinoids you can't look for

938
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,599
growth and vigor and flavor and

939
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:38,959
structure you got to go for the

940
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,759
cannabinoids that is my

941
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,600
experience that has not been my goal is

942
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,319
breeding for cannabinoids but watching

943
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,678
and seeing

944
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,519
that is what i think you got to do so

945
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,798
you read one line that you go straight

946
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,440
up that line breeding for

947
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,558
cannabinoids if it's cbd or thc then you

948
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,159
breed your bee line

949
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,678
and you breed that one for whatever

950
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,440
you're looking for flavor

951
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,880
structure whatever else you're missing

952
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,558
from the other one then

953
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,399
once you've got those both solid how you

954
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,079
want them you breed those together

955
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,839
and that's how you make a true f1 that's

956
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,079
exactly what you want

957
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,079
that's a long way to get to it but in my

958
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,000
experience from what i've read and seen

959
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,119
it's a little more difficult to breed uh

960
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,519
you got a line breed to get the

961
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,278
cannabinoids exactly how you want

962
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,798
but you're gonna see a lot of different

963
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,798
uh combinations you'll see

964
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,000
thc you'll see cbd you'll see them down

965
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,839
the middle but then you're gonna find

966
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,200
outliers on each direction and then

967
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,038
hopefully you find some

968
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,038
skyrockets uh what's that called

969
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,079
transgressive segregation that might be

970
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:30,798
what it's called when you find some

971
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,720
plants that are

972
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,960
way better than the parents that surpass

973
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,480
the performance of the parents

974
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,798
all right blue i hope i answered your

975
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,919
question um i feel like i went over that

976
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:41,599
one pretty well it was kind of quick but

977
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,200
i feel like i covered it quite well

978
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,599
