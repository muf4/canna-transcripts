00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,599
welcome back podcast world i'm your host

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,919
my friends call me rasta jeff and it is

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:10,080
time for episode 593

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,519
of the grow from your heart podcast you

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,280
know i like to start this show off by

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,599
talking about what i'm smoking

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,919
today i've been taking dabs of chem dog

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,600
d t 1000 live batter

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,439
this is a blend of chem dog d and t 1000

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,720
on the package the flavor is described

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,039
as gas

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,879
lavender and grapes you may know that

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,400
i'm not a big fan of lavender flavors

14
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,640
and aromas but luckily

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,558
it comes through with sort of a perfumey

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
floral sort of aroma and flavor

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,599
and the mix is dominated by that gassy

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,920
grape flavor

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,640
and i do enjoy that on the back of the

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,359
package it says it contains

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,320
69.81 thc and non-detectable amounts of

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,719

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,558

friends all right thank you guys for all

75
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,000
of the continued patreon support it does

76
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
mean a lot to me

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,520
i've said it before without all the

78
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,200
patreon support i wouldn't have all this

79
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
fancy lighting i wouldn't have the fancy

80
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,199
new camera

81
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,199
wouldn't even have the fancy new

82
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,479
computer and there is an even better

83
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,560
computer on the way

84
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,679
because when i bought a 4k camera this

85
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,519
computer said

86
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,360
that's cute i can barely handle that so

87
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,680
there's a new computer coming so thank

88
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080

89
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,599
to everybody for the patreon support it

90
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,959
does mean a lot to me and it does keep

91
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,959
the show coming to you

92
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,039
for free there are a lot of folks who

93
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,959
are not able to contribute to patreon

94
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,799
that is completely understandable the

95
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,598
folks who do contribute are keeping this

96
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,879
show coming to

97
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,639
everybody for free thank you all right

98
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,560
where are we going to go from there i

99
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,958
did a recent episode about tester

100
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,239
applications and tester expectations

101
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
that's right if you want to run test

102
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
seats for me

103
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,280
there is a process to submit an

104
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,840
application to become a tester

105
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,598
big thank you to everybody who submitted

106
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,719
a tester application

107
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,119
i got an overwhelming response an

108
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,239
overwhelming amount of applications were

109
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,480
submitted

110
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,680
i am trying to catch up on all of those

111
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,679
with that being said

112
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
do not stop sending them i am

113
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
overwhelmed i'm overloaded but i want

114
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,158
more

115
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,840
keep me working keep me busy keep me

116
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,318
digging through those applications

117
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,158
please continue to send in your tester

118
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,280
applications if you are interested in

119
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,878
testing

120
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,120
one of the main things in that episode

121
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,518
was being able to follow instructions

122
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,840
uh there were very specific instructions

123
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,080
on how to submit a testing application

124
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,920
if you did not follow those instructions

125
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,599
i probably did not notice your

126
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,798
application there was one way to submit

127
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,719
that application

128
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,799
make sure you do it that way all of the

129
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,560
other ways will be ignored

130
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,438
sorry to be rude about it that's just

131
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,280
you got to be able to follow

132
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,120
instructions and if i've got you in my

133
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
email then it's easier to find you i'm

134
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,319
not going to look across all of the

135
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,280
social media platforms to find tester

136
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,280
applications

137
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,400
send them to me in one spot or listen to

138
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,959
the episode again

139
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
you'll figure it out also that help tab

140
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,680
on my website

141
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,360
i've added a grow help tab on

142
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,599
iregenetics.com if you go to

143
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,280
iregenetics.com

144
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,199
there is a tab that simply says grow

145
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,720
help when you click on that grow help

146
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,639
tab it will ask you

147
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,759
about seven or eight key questions it

148
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,680
basically asks

149
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,199
uh what is the temperature and humidity

150
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
of your grow environment what was the

151
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
last

152
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,080
feed and ph and uh ec of your last

153
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,159
feeding

154
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,918
so i can get a few details about what's

155
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,439
happening in your grow before i even try

156
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:36,399
to answer your question so you go to the

157
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,240
grow help tab

158
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,439
you'll fill out a little questionnaire

159
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
tell me the temperature tell me the

160
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,040
humidity tell me what you fed tell me

161
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,399
the ph and ec of that feed

162
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,720
then tell me what's wrong with your

163
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,839
plants this will save us both a few

164
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,680
steps

165
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,359
a lot of people like to email me and

166
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,000
they say bro here's what's wrong with my

167
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,680
plants

168
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,439
and then i've got like seven or eight

169
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,240
follow-up questions just to go from what

170
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,079
they asked

171
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,519
instead of having to ask those questions

172
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,839
they're already there on the sheet

173
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,038
so you're going to tell me so many key

174
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,959
points you're going to give me so many

175
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,159
hints to help me diagnose your problem

176
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,359
i'm basically just giving you a little

177
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,960
checkup i'm like when you go to the

178
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,160
doctor checking your temperature

179
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,359
looking in your ears looking in your

180
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,400
nose checking out your throat looking

181
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
for obvious [ __ ]

182
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,399
maybe i can diagnose problems from those

183
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,240
small obvious details so i'm going to

184
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,839
ask you to fill out that questionnaire

185
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,879
then you send me then there's a little

186
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,239
part that says what's your problem

187
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,079
what's going on when you grow

188
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,759
fill that out send it to me it comes to

189
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,839

going to edit this but

284
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,280

be cool if it just said gfyhtv

286
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,119

you know exactly what i want if you do a

308
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,959
red yellow and green rasta colored logo

309
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,799
it is traditional that the red goes on

310
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,599
the bottom please let's just stay

311
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,319
respectful

312
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,000
to the rasta tradition all right i did

313
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,399
say that was it before we jumped into

314
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,159
the

315
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,399
grow question so let's work our way

316
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,679
right into a couple of questions

317
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,839
i have gotten this question from

318
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,679
multiple people from multiple formats

319
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,240
and i've seen this asked all over social

320
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,919
media

321
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,440
so it is time to address this one again

322
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,120
i talk about this often

323
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,120
probably once every three to six months

324
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,480
i've got to remind people of this

325
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,200
people ask quite a bit when i am growing

326
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,120
from seed

327
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,759
and the seed pack says that the seeds

328
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,839
are going to take 70 days in flower

329
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,519
is that or they're going to take 70 days

330
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,959
is that going to take 70 days from the

331
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,440
day i plant it or from

332
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,039
the day that i put it into flour unless

333
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,920
they're autoflower plants

334
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,679
the 70 days is the flowering time that's

335
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,759
how long you should expect them to be in

336
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,319
flour you can veg them as long as you

337
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,559
want

338
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,360
you can veg them for a day you can veg

339
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,679
them for

340
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,440
three weeks six weeks you can veg them

341
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,879
for nine months if you've got the space

342
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
and you know how to do that

343
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,879
what we're putting on there as the time

344
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,080
on the back of the package is the

345
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,480
flowering time

346
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,560
unless you are working with autoflowers

347
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,600
and that should be clearly indicated on

348
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,278
the package

349
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,720
if you're working with autoflowers that

350
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,958
time that's listed on there

351
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,320
is the anticipated predicted time from

352
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,479
start to finish but

353
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,278
if you were working with regular photo

354
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,039
period or feminized photo period seeds

355
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,439
that time that we list on the back the

356
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,679
flowering time is from the day

357
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
is the flowering time not the full grow

358
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,399
time now here's another thing i want to

359
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,679
clarify

360
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,559
that flowering time starts from the day

361
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,319
you turn the light cycle to 12-12

362
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,278
not from when you start seeing bud

363
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,720
development that's about day 12 day 14

364
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:44,000
day 17 the flowering cycle

365
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,720
officially begins the day you

366
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,720
or somebody else turns the light cycle

367
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,800
to 1212 and of course this is in an

368
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,480
indoor grow environment you flip that

369
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,319
light cycle to 12 12.

370
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
that's day one of flower you write that

371
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,839
down on the calendar as day one

372
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,879
if you're looking at a pack of seeds and

373
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,360
they say we finish in 63 to 70 days

374
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,879
day one starts right there expect that

375
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,360
pack of seeds to be done in 63 to

376
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:11,439
75-ish days as breeders we really try to

377
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,278
label the packages clearly and tell you

378
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,839
how long to expect we give you a time

379
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,679
frame these are plants there is nature

380
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,519
we are putting plants in different

381
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,120
environments i'm not exactly sure what's

382
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,639
going to happen in your environment i'm

383
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,720
not sure what you're going to do to them

384
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,720
to speed them up or slow them down

385
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,320
but from our testing from what we have

386
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,879
seen through research with most of these

387
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,879
plants

388
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,240
that is the time frame we have seen so

389
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,360
i'm going to get myself back on track

390
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,240
back to the point

391
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,759
when we say flowering time is 70 days we

392
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,519
mean that is from the day

393
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:44,159
you turn your timer from if it's 24 on

394
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,000
and 0 off or 18 6 or whatever your

395
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,799
vegetative cycle is

396
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,720
now when you put it on 12 12 that is day

397
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,399
one of flower that's when your 70 day

398
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,079
flowering time begins

399
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,759
not when you see the pistols not when

400
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,399
you see bud development

401
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,958
how that's a guess there's no that could

402
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,320
be

403
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,239
you might not have seen it right away

404
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,600
and then do you start flowering counting

405
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,120
flower when you write when you see the

406
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,159
pistols or when they're nubby or when

407
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,399
they're growing out

408
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,078
how do you [ __ ] do that why not just

409
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,958
do it we know when day one is it's

410
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,719
because we changed

411
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,879
the [ __ ] light cycle ourselves let's

412
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,480
not guess let's not put so much guessing

413
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,720
into it let's narrow down

414
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,079
um what are they called variables let's

415
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,680
narrow down the variables

416
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,439
and know that day one was the day that

417
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,359
we put that [ __ ] into flower

418
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,800
and then start counting from there keep

419
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,639
a mark of it know that

420
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,319
it was maybe you've got five or six

421
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,360
plants in there harvest won it if it

422
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,399
says day 70

423
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,560
cut one down at 68 one at 69 one at 70

424
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,320
one at 71 and one at 72 and see what the

425
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,278
difference is or go even more staggered

426
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,480
with your harvest

427
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,559
go 65 70 75 80.

428
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,800
see what happens that stuff is fun to do

429
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,119
but my main point is

430
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,719
the flowering time day one starts when

431
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,200
you flip the timer not when you start

432
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,360
seeing

433
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,120
those little fuzzies all right that was

434
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,120
a great question i see it often

435
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,879
trust me you will hear about that again

436
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,360
on the show because it gets asked

437
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,360
very very frequently all right let's

438
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,039
move into a more advanced question this

439
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,519
one is about foliar feeding

440
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,719
this one comes from uh let's see they

441
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,000
want their name said i'm not sure they

442
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,920
want their name said

443
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
we're going to not do that part it goes

444
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,599
like this it says hey ross to jeff

445
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,200
on the breeder panel yesterday you

446
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,920
sounded awesome and your mic

447
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,560
was booming so what they're referring to

448
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,879
is i was on a breeder panel on cannabuzz

449
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,078
we did a live breeder panel uh you were

450
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,200
able to chat with the

451
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,359
the breeders while they were on the

452
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,959
panel you could watch uh on cannabis

453
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,519
check out cannabis you guys i'm going to

454
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,559
be doing

455
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,078
another panel on cannabis

456
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,599
i think i don't know that i should

457
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,278
announce this yet it's not set in stone

458
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,519
but to the best of my knowledge i'm

459
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,240
going to make it happen on december 19th

460
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,600
here we go

461
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,360
this is my commitment this is how we

462
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,639
commit to [ __ ] jr i'm in dude i'm saying

463
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,039
it now on a show

464
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,000
can't back out now december 19th i will

465
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,278
be doing a

466
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,799
live panel a live show on cannabis

467
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,360
uh jr and q grows will be interviewing

468
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,439
me

469
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,600
there will be a question and answer

470
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,959
panel and i may even bring a couple of

471
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,680
my friends on

472
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,879
uh from cannabis to join me on zoom and

473
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,879
hang out we may

474
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,559
uh let them ask questions we may do some

475
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,000
chat and some bullshitting we may even

476
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,159
take some dabs together

477
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
so december 19th on cannabis it will be

478
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,278
in the afternoon time i don't think

479
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,800
we've set a solid time yet

480
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,480
it should be a one to two hour show

481
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,799
that's usually what we like to do

482
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
if you're not already on cannabis uh

483
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,198
you're [ __ ] up you're sleeping get on

484
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,039
cannabis it is a free application

485
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,799
it's available on whatever kind of phone

486
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,240
you've got it's available on your ipad

487
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,519
you can get it on the computer i think

488
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,399
it works best on the phone

489
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,399

499
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,519
great time i don't know what they've got

500

in store for me yet i'm going to be

501
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,120
prepared no matter what happens as a

502
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,879
breeder as a podcaster

503
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,159
i'm ready ask me questions let's get it

504
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,639
on i'm ready to be there and have a good

505
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,159
time

506
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,680
and i'm just going to relax because i am

507
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,399
not hosting the show so it should be

508
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,000
great

509
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,078
ask me questions let's hang out let's

510
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,879
take some dabs cannabis december

511
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,278
19th um and the mic is booming yes thank

512
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,600
you

513
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,519
um that was before i got this mic i

514
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,240
think so uh we are double booming at

515
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,919
this point

516
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,600
it goes on to say you can always tell

517
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,519
you put a lot of time effort and money

518
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,120
into your sound quality and it's noticed

519
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,480
and appreciated

520
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,399
ah dude thank you um there was a lot of

521
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,039
funding to get this microphone all this

522
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,480
equipment

523
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,919
there is so many there are so many

524
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
things in this chain to make all this

525
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,479
work

526
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,079
and i've said it before without patreon

527
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,920
i probably would not have happened

528
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,758
so thank you to everybody for the

529
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,639
patreon contributions i'm glad you guys

530
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,120
are noticing

531
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,959
the increase in audio quality video

532
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,039
quality production quality

533
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,119
i want you to see that i care you guys

534
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,000
definitely take good care of me on

535
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,919
patreon

536
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,519
you are you bought all this stuff and i

537
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,879
want you to see that i appreciate it i

538
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,600
didn't just take all of your patreon

539
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,679
funding and

540
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,199
uh buy a new truck you know i bought

541
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,638
podcasting stuff with that

542
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,639
and i'm also trying to put a lot more

543
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,600
time and energy into the podcast because

544
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,519
this is fun

545
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,720
now that i'm learning all this gear i

546
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,759
don't know it's like when you have new

547
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,120
toys when you get a new

548
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,320
video game or you get a new toy you want

549
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,440
to go play with your new toys and video

550
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
games if you've got a new rig you want

551
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,399
to take extra

552
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,839
dabs i just feel like i want to podcast

553
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,720
more because i've got all this cool

554
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,000
[ __ ] the only thing slowing me down is

555
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
this computer and i've got a new one

556
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,879
coming

557
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,838
thanks to patreon so i am high and

558
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,000
rambly shout out to the chem dog dt 1000

559
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,079
live batter it seems to be working

560
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,919
take some dabs at that where were we

561
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,559
we're in this episode in this email and

562
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,240
it says

563
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,000
uh thank you for all the information you

564
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,720
put out there my question

565
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,278
is what nutrients and supplements do you

566
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,680
find

567
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,600
more effective or effective as a foliar

568
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,000
spray instead of the standard

569
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,440
root drench that is a great question it

570
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
says i've read that kelp

571
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,160
humboldt honey and calmag can be more

572
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,920
effective as a foliar spray

573
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,519
uh yes that is accurate and we're going

574
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,360
to talk about why

575
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,919
and how some of those things are more

576
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,599
effective as a foliar spray before we do

577
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,918
that let's talk about foliar feeding

578
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,279
why would we fully feed our plants what

579
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,199
is foliar feeding

580
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,838
foliar feeding is exactly what it sounds

581
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,919
like you mix a light dose of nutrients

582
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,519
into a spray bottle or a sprayer however

583
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,520
you're applying your sprays

584
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,879
my spray applications are much larger in

585
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,838
a commercial grow than they are on a

586
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,600
private grow

587
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,678
in a commercial grill i mix up a five

588
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,678
gallon bucket or maybe even larger

589
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,960
of my foliar spray if it's a pesticide

590
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,720
if it's a booster spray

591
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
i mix up a five gallon bucket and i use

592
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,000
a [ __ ] paint sprayer

593
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
to just douse all of the plants with

594
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,480
that spray in my personal grow

595
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,079
i use a small just a little like a

596
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,798
little windex looking [ __ ] spray

597
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,359
bottle

598
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,879
it's a big difference so it's the same

599
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,359
effect it's the same idea no matter

600
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,000
where you

601
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,798
are you want to mix up a light nutrient

602
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,720
solution

603
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,558
you need a strategy if you're going to

604
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,079
feed the plants fully early

605
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,599
if you're going to foliar feed the

606
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,279
plants i don't know the wordage there

607
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,439
but if you're going to feed them by

608
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,038
full the foliar method you need to have

609
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,240
a strategy you can't just go mixing up

610
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,279
newts and spray them in there

611
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,480
because they're going to get on the

612
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,279
leaves this is way different than

613
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,440
feeding them

614
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,200
to the root zone there's no buffer

615
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,480
you're going straight on to the plant so

616
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,960
you need a strategy

617
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,120
but i basically mix up a light nutrient

618
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
solution and i spray it onto the plants

619
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,839
when i do this

620
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,519
the lights are off that is a very

621
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,159
important thing i find it very important

622
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,918
to always spray with the lights off

623
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,240
some products do say you can spray with

624
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,919
the lights on i still don't do it

625
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,679
i just like to turn the lights off when

626
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,600
i'm fully feeding

627
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,080
i feel like those little bubbles that

628
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,439
land on the plants on the leaves

629
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,720
think about when you were a little kid

630
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,400
and used to burn ants with the

631
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,240
magnifying glass or you could catch [ __ ]

632
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,720
on fire with the magnifying glass

633
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,160
it is the same exact method the sun or

634
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,679
the grow light comes down

635
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,000
it hits that bubble the bubble's got

636
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,600
that little arc that arc creates uh some

637
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,359
sort of refractory i'm not a light and

638
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,359
sun scientist but we'll get there

639
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,879
i create some sort of a thing that makes

640
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,159
it works like a magnifying glass just

641
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,080
when you used to hold the

642
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,519
[ __ ] the sun and the magnifying glass

643
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,319
just right it would create a hot spot on

644
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,918
whatever

645
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,519
that light will come down and do the

646
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,360
same thing to that bubble of foliar

647
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,400
spray and it'll put little burn spots on

648
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,558
your plants

649
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,000
those don't go away they look like other

650
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,519
problems they'll make you panic you'll

651
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,519
think you've got bugs or some sort of

652
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,079
deficiency when really all it was

653
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,798
was just a little water burn so foliar

654
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,038
feeding

655
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,720
is very important to be done in the dark

656
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,359
now why would we do it because we can

657
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,519
apply

658
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,879
specific nutrients to the plant at

659
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,639
specific times

660
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,480
and sometimes we've already watered the

661
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
plants and they may be wet

662
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,160
if you've got a seven gallon pot when

663
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,918
you water that plant it may be wet for

664
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,279
three to four maybe five days depending

665
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,080
on the size of the plant the environment

666
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,519
of the room

667
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,439
you may have a nutrient deficiency

668
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,038
you're chasing you can't water in more

669
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,038
nutrients but we can

670
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,480
foliar feed some nutrients into the

671
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,558
plant there are a lot of nutrients

672
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,240
that work very well being foliar fed

673
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,000
some are more effective than others

674
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,279
we will touch on that in just a moment i

675
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,640
want to make sure that i am keeping up

676
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,678
with my notes

677
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,080
so we can provide nutrients directly to

678
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,280
the leaves if we're chasing a deficiency

679
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,119
we can absolutely

680
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,399
provide most nutrients directly to the

681
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,719
leaves and not have to feed it through

682
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,919
the root zone it's more faster acting

683
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,600
you can watch it work it also you won't

684
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,799
lock out your roots if your plants are

685
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,480
already wet like i said

686
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:13,599
you don't have to keep watering [ __ ] in

687
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,400
and you're not going to lock out the

688
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,959
roots by over

689
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,519
feeding it's just another opportunity to

690
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,319
provide

691
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,679
nutrients to our plants now you did say

692
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,918
that you read that kelp

693
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,200
humboldt honey and calmag were effective

694
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,799
as foliar spray

695
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
i'm going to leave humboldt honey out of

696
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,798
this mix because that is a

697
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,720
product with a lot of things in it i

698
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,960
think that would be safer to

699
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,400
apply to the root zone it's got some

700
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,079
things in there that may clog up your

701
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,440
plants and it may be more problematic if

702
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,279
you're doing it and it works

703
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,558
keep doing it i just wouldn't do that as

704
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,599
a foliar feed

705
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,200
the kelp and the calmag absolutely do

706
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,678
and will work wonderfully

707
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,319
as a foliar fee let's talk about why i

708
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,919
believe

709
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:56,240
calmag is a great foliar fed nutrient

710
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,520
calmag is what is known as as an

711
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,440
immobile nutrient

712
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,279
it can't move itself around in the plant

713
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,640
normally if the plant sensed a

714
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,720
deficiency in a nutrient

715
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,000
up in one part of the plant older leaves

716
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,279
that are kind of dying off and that are

717
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,038
going to expire would say

718
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,798
hey we're going to die let's send some

719
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,679
of our mobile nutrients up to that other

720
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,279
part of the leaves

721
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,120
so that they can survive and be strong

722
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,519
and healthy since i'm going to go

723
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,239
we'll just pass the spoon right on up so

724
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,480
calmag

725
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,919
cannot do that calmag does not have that

726
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,400
ability calmag is very

727
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,840
a very heavy nutrient that is why it is

728
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,360
sold in a different bottle

729
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,038
than all of your other nutrients if you

730
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,199
put the calmag in the bottle

731
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,798
with the other nutrients basically it's

732
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,240
heavier it would fall to the bottom

733
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,158
in solution it wouldn't stay in the

734
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,200
solution it would always be that [ __ ] at

735
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,559
the bottom of the jar

736
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,400
you'd be stirring and shaking and it

737
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,319
would just be the the coffee grounds in

738
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,640
your nutrient solution all the time

739
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,319
so calmag is a non or an immobile

740
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,038
nutrient is what we call that

741
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,759
so we can foliar feed that directly to

742
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,919
the plants

743
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,839
and that will help you rapidly correct a

744
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,640
calmag deficiency

745
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,000
so that is one thing that is great for a

746
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,480
foliar feed calmac

747
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,679
calcium works as a great foliar feed

748
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,599
it's hard to find it is

749
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,280
harder to find a straight calcium

750
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,959
product but calmag works

751
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,639
as an effective foliar feed whichever

752
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,679
brand of calmag you are using

753
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,360
will probably work well uh kelp why does

754
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,320
kelp work well kelp has a lot of

755
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,479
hormones in it

756
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,798
kelp has a lot of phytonutrients and

757
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,599
they're all bioavailable to the plant

758
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,200
by foliar spray those nutrients are

759
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,918
mobile nutrients so you'll spray those

760
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,679
to the plant

761
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,880
and the plant if you don't overdo it

762
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,919
you'll spray that onto the plant and

763
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,600
it'll go oh

764
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,280
maybe this leaf over here doesn't have

765
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,158
enough nitrogen let's move that over

766
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,000
here and this new

767
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,520
leaf over here needs a little bit of

768
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,119
phosphorus let's move that over here

769
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,960
so the plants will move those mobile

770
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,038
nutrients around as

771
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,319
needed so that's basically kelp there

772
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:43,679
are a lot of things in kelp i'm not

773
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,200
going to dig too deeply into that could

774
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,080
be an episode on its own as well as

775
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,000
calmag

776
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,480
could be a full episode on its own i

777
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,079
want to make sure to stay on track here

778
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,839
where are we going from here um

779
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,759
nitrogen nitrogen works as a great

780
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,439
foliar feed you can mix up a small

781
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,798
amount of your base nutrient if your

782
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,159
plants are getting a little bit yellow

783
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,038
and you can't feed them enough

784
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,840
that's called chasing the nitrogen

785
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,038
golden goat

786
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:11,439
golden goat crosses a rise crosses ah

787
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,640
lemon jeffrey sometimes will become

788
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,038
nitrogen deficient

789
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,640
early in flower like week two or three

790
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:17,679
of flower you'll say why is that [ __ ]

791
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,080
going yellow on me

792
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,720
already a really good easy way to

793
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,000
correct that

794
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,120
is a foliar feed of nitrogen take your

795
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,720
vegetative base nutrient and mix up

796
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,918
i don't know what brand you're using so

797
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,960
i'm not even going to make a

798
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,480
recommendation

799
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,159
way less than what you would use when

800
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,480
you're feeding it to the root zone

801
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,440
maybe like a quarter maybe a fifth maybe

802
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,440
even less

803
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,038
mix up some of that base nutrient

804
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,919
because your base nutrient is high in

805
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,079
nitrogen

806
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,840
mix up your base nutrient into a bottle

807
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,599
give it a good shake so it's nice and uh

808
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,558
distributed in there emulsified might be

809
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,119
the word i want

810
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,240
and your feed that to your plant that

811
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,079
will get the nitrogen

812
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,278
into your leaves the leaves will say hey

813
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,558
this is a mobile nutrient

814
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,798
it'll move it all around to where it

815
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,359
needs to be that will help you chase and

816
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,079
correct

817
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,558
a nitrogen deficiency you can do the

818
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:07,199
same with phosphorus and potassium

819
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,200
keep in mind that as you increase

820
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,319
phosphorus you do run the risk of a

821
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,000
calmag deficiency they work together so

822
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,519
just keep that sort of stuff in mind all

823
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,519
right now let's talk about other things

824
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,759
that i do foliar feed the plants

825
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,519
kelp is great calmag works beautifully

826
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,640
to correct a deficiency

827
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:27,278
you can absolutely feed the npk

828
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,799
through the leaves you can watch it move

829
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,359
around i feel like if you spray it in

830
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,960
the dark

831
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,959
give it like two hours for everything to

832
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,319
dry when you go back you can see those

833
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,840
plants have greened up a little bit at

834
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,918
least i feel like i can i've got a

835
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,519
really good relationship with my plants

836
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,360
i can see their reactions it's like

837
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,319
watching the look on people's faces if

838
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,319
you walk in the room

839
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,918
and you just say a certain word if you

840
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,359
just say cheesecake if you walk in the

841
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,240
word and say cheesecake people make a

842
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,000
certain face

843
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,359
if you walk in the room and you say fart

844
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,919
they make a different face

845
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,599
i can see my plants respond in the same

846
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,759
way that's the kind of relationship

847
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,359
i have got with my plants so i feel like

848
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,038
after i fully feed them i can walk in

849
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,439
there and absolutely see

850
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,119
results within just a few hours now

851
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,080
let's talk about another product i

852
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,119
really like

853
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,759
a product called push push is a great

854
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,278
product

855
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,038
they do not pay me they don't give me

856
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,000
anything to talk about it i think it's a

857
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,000
great product it is from

858
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,079
the same folks that make veg bloom they

859
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
are called hydroponic research you can

860
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,399
find them online

861
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,960
uh hydroponic dash research it might be

862
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,480
dotnet

863
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,919
not com anyway push is a great product

864
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,519
product um it contains uh kelp

865
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,440
it's got uh silica in there and it's got

866
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,519
another acid that i cannot remember the

867
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,919
name of and i did not write it down

868
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,558
however it works wonderfully for the

869
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,799
plants

870
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,480
uh i think recharge makes the plants go

871
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,759
kaboom at the root zone level

872
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,360
and push is recharge for the top of the

873
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,960
plants that is push for the leaves or

874
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,839
that is recharge for the leaves

875
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,679
so i think push is a great product

876
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:59,599
something about foliar feeding

877
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,519
always use low doses you can definitely

878
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,599
burn your plants by foliar feeding you

879
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,359
can absolutely apply too much

880
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,639
and unlike when you overfeed the root

881
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,038
zone there's

882
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,038
it's harder much harder to recover i

883
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,000
said unlike when so unlike when you over

884
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:13,679
feed the root zone

885
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,359
you don't have a lot of opportunity for

886
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,278
recovery there's no chance to fix your

887
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,038
mistake if you over feed the root zone

888
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,558
they start showing you they go i'm gonna

889
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:20,960
kind of brown up over here i'm gonna get

890
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:22,879
kind of

891
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,000
my nails done and burn up at the tips

892
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,000
you've got time to react

893
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,440
you can flush that soil you can feed it

894
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,359
something different

895
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,120
when you sprayed it on there you just

896
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,158
spray painted problems onto your plants

897
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,639
if you overfed it

898
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,919
so be very careful start with low doses

899
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,840
you can work your way up

900
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,919
but you can't work your way down from a

901
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,278
burn maybe if you're new at full you're

902
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,360
feeding don't go in there and spray the

903
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:45,919
entire [ __ ] crop all at one time

904
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,199
maybe spray one plant see how it reacts

905
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,440
maybe spray two plants

906
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,240
see how they react learn on a couple

907
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,919
don't destroy

908
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,839
everything have a couple of test dummies

909
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,360
in there experiment before you go hard

910
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,119
on the entire room

911
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,959
i've said it before always spray in the

912
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,399
dark some companies will tell you that

913
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,600
their product is safe to spray when the

914
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,120
lights are on

915
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,158
i don't believe it please don't do that

916
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,319
i've seen terrible burns on plants

917
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,000
i don't think you should spray people

918
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,639
are going to argue with me

919
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,679
over this and that is just fine this is

920
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,559
my opinion

921
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,278
i would not spray microbe products in an

922
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,759
organic

923
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,278
grow if you're doing a tlo system if

924
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:22,158
you're running labs and other things

925
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:24,398
like that

926
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,840
do that stuff in your no-till and

927
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,319
organic environment

928
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,119
if you are running i run a very

929
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,480
commercial

930
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,000
style grow there's not a lot of uh tlo

931
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,200
love happening in my grow it's

932
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,679
cocoa and salts and pesticide sprays

933
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,440
and foliar sprays for boosts in my

934
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,120
environment i would not recommend

935
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,120
microbe sprays that does give you the

936
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,839
opportunity for more problems

937
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,558
in colorado we have to pet we have to

938
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,359
pass

939
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,158
microbe testing all of our buds not all

940
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,119
of our buds

941
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,320
a sample from every batch is sent to a

942
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,000
lab

943
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,240
those buds are tested for the presence

944
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,038
of yeast and mold if we are spraying

945
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,798
products

946
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,398
like uh i'm not even gonna say any

947
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,158
specific products if we're spraying

948
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,239
microbe products on our plants we're

949
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,120
increasing the opportunity to fail

950
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,679
those microbe testings so unless you are

951
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,439
running some sort of organic no-till

952
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,798
living soil you know what i'm talking

953
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,399
about you organic hippies if you're

954
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,960
running that sort of stuff

955
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,079
then i do encourage you do your your

956
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,519
crazy sprays

957
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,199
if you're not familiar with that and

958
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,119
you're not running that type of grow

959
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,720
i do not encourage it i would not do

960
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,000
that that will set yourself

961
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,120
up for problems where are we when you

962
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,119
follow your spray you're going to

963
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,439
increase the humidity of your room

964
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,599
um that may not be the best idea maybe

965
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,919
have your exhaust fans and dehumidifier

966
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,519
on

967
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,840
you're going to have to clean your

968
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,398
dehumidifier more often if you're foliar

969
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:46,240
feeding

970
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,079
because some of that funky [ __ ] will end

971
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,919
up in the air those nutrients will end

972
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,158
up in your dehumidifier filter

973
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,360
clean that uh where are we what am i

974
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,760
going for mix

975
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,879
well when you're mixing up your foliar

976
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,480
feed i've said it

977
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,080
shake the [ __ ] out of that spray or just

978
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,720
shake it make sure it's all mixed up in

979
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,038
there

980
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,798
you don't want to feed the the bottom

981
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,240
stuff is heavier the cow mag will be at

982
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,000
the bottom the nitrogen will be up at

983
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,278
the top you don't want to feed like that

984
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
mix it up really well also use some sort

985
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,000
of a wetting

986
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,759
agent when you are applying foliar feeds

987
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,519
and or pesticides

988
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,919
something like cocoa wet works really

989
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,200
well wet betty works just fine if you

990
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,038
want to use that brand

991
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,720
or a couple of drops of organic dish

992
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,480
soap would do the same thing

993
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,839
what this does is this makes it spread

994
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,880
and stick to your leaves a little bit

995
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,398
better

996
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,559
the longer the stuff spreads and sticks

997
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:34,079
to your leaves the more available it is

998
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,359
it will just run off and drip onto the

999
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,798
floor that way you didn't just follow

1000
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,439
your feed the floor and waste all your

1001
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:39,679
product

1002
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,278
it's stuck to the plants um i feel like

1003
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,080
i've got something else i wanted to say

1004
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,440
on that

1005
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,558
i don't know where it went um okay

1006
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,558
i'm just gonna act like i remembered

1007
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,119
what i was saying because i really don't

1008
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,918
um you're gonna make small bubbles so i

1009
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,639
recommend

1010
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,159
that you wear protective equipment

1011
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,038
always wear personal protective

1012
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,440
equipment

1013
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,720
always absolutely wear goggles if you're

1014
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,320
going to use a paint sprayer if you're

1015
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,278
going to use a sprayer put some sort of

1016
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,200
mask on

1017
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,960
i recommend some sort of a respirator

1018
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,679
especially with the paint sprayer

1019
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,558
you're creating micro bubbles of what

1020
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,798
are we spraying

1021
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,759
phosphorus potassium calmag do you want

1022
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,079
to breathe in

1023
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,839
little bubbles of calmag i don't know

1024
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,639
that that's really good for any part of

1025
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,119
your body

1026
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,000
so please wear personal protective

1027
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,599
equipment

1028
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,679
when spraying anything if you're

1029
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,599
spraying a pesticide if you're spraying

1030
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,960
a boost if you're just spraying water

1031
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,719
put on some personal protective

1032
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,919
equipment i know that sounds silly

1033
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,200
we don't want to breathe in these

1034
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,480
bubbles you guys you don't want to

1035
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,319
breathe that stuff in

1036
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,399
we smoke this cannabis we want to keep

1037
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,158
our lungs healthy we smoke the dabs

1038
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,079
your lungs are important dude let's do

1039
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,440
what we can to protect those

1040
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:48,158
um pesticides and

1041
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,798
foliar feeds there is nothing wrong with

1042
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,120
mixing

1043
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,278
a foliar feed in with the pesticide if

1044
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,719
you're applying a routine pesticide

1045
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,640
you can add push to that pesticide

1046
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,319
application it says on the bottle of

1047
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,399
push do not mix with any other products

1048
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,720
do not mix with pesticides guess what

1049
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,319
i've done it a lot of times i've done it

1050
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,919
countless times i've done it with a lot

1051
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,759
of different nutrients and i never see

1052
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,600
any adverse reactions

1053
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,119
i kind of feel like it's drinking it's

1054
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,599
kind of like drinking vodka and orange

1055
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:15,119
juice

1056
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:16,879
one of them is gonna [ __ ] ruin my

1057
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,000
body but at the other time i got so much

1058
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,840
vitamin c that i feel

1059
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,119
good about it i don't really drink vodka

1060
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,240
and orange juice but

1061
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,839
i feel like if you're going to spray a

1062
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,278
pesticide to the plant that's going to

1063
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,480
kind of beat up the plant a little bit

1064
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,480
stress that plant out

1065
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,919
why not add some push to it and you can

1066
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
kind of negate the damage give it a

1067
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,080
boost

1068
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,839
maybe we'll level out get rid of the

1069
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,879
bugs boost the plants all at the same

1070
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,240
time

1071
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,000
so you can apply both at the same time

1072
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,759
many people will tell you to ph or

1073
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,480
foliar feed research

1074
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,038
that one you don't want acid rain on our

1075
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,558
plants

1076
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,440
that doesn't sound like any fun for

1077
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,278
anybody always have a strategy

1078
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,720
always have a strategy i've written that

1079
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,159
down a couple of times

1080
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,679
why are you follow your feeding don't

1081
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,960
just go in there and willy-nilly start

1082
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,960
spraying [ __ ] around

1083
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,000
have a strategy what are you spraying

1084
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,600
for what is your goal

1085
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,960
are you trying to give them a boost are

1086
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:04,480
you trying to correct something are you

1087
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,759
trying to prevent something if it's a

1088
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,919
pesticide spray

1089
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,879
if it's a foliar feed always have a

1090
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,600
strategy

1091
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,399
then as soon as you are done spraying

1092
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,558
write down

1093
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,798
exactly what you sprayed what was in the

1094
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,960
mix how much of it was in the mix

1095
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,798
how many gallons were applied which

1096
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,720
plants were applied did you only spray

1097
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,480
the veg did you only spray the flour did

1098
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,919
you only spray the large veg the small

1099
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,319
veg the pre-flower

1100
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,759
write down everything you sprayed write

1101
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,678
down the time and date

1102
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,759
if you used a pesticide write down the

1103
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,880
re-entry time so you know when you can

1104
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,038
go back in there

1105
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,799
this should be standard for every grow

1106
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,599
this is required by

1107
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,000
law in a commercial grow environment by

1108
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,918
law

1109
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,119
by department of agriculture law by

1110
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,399
department of health law

1111
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,759
and i'm pretty sure there's some other

1112
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,959
people that would probably whip your ass

1113
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,278
and give you a ticket if you didn't do

1114
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,919
it

1115
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,759
you were required to keep documentation

1116
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,080
of everything that was sprayed on those

1117
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,640
plants every pesticide application

1118
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,158
is required to be documented by law and

1119
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,840
i think you have to keep it in a folder

1120
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,080
for two to three years

1121
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,439
so we use a department of agriculture

1122
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,798
approved spreadsheet

1123
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,880
we write down everything that was

1124
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,398
[ __ ] sprayed the date the time the

1125
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,200
amount the product

1126
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,639
there is a number a an epa number on the

1127
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,840
bottle that we have to include on that

1128
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,320
spreadsheet

1129
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,319
your initials your med badge number your

1130
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:20,879
department of agriculture certification

1131
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,398
number

1132
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,960
what time it was sprayed what time the

1133
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,879
spraying ended and the re-entry interval

1134
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,278
all of that is required to be written on

1135
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,840
a sheet every time we spray something

1136
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,359
in any grow a pesticide not a booster i

1137
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:34,879
could spray push and not have to write

1138
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,278
it down but if i put a pesticide in

1139
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,200
there

1140
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,720
i would have to write that down for the

1141
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,840
department of agriculture

1142
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,319
anything i spray i write down in my own

1143
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,158
personal grow log that way if something

1144
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,839
goes wrong or if something goes right

1145
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,200
i can look back and say what the [ __ ]

1146
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,359
happened in here

1147
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,880
if i spray something today and in like

1148
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,479
three or four days i walk in there and

1149
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,919
the plants look [ __ ] decrepid

1150
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,759
i can look back at my notes and i can

1151
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,000
say everything that i fed was normal

1152
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,599
oh it was the new feed i fed them i

1153
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,839
sprayed them this [ __ ] thing

1154
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,798
and they went ape [ __ ] or i can say why

1155
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,038
do my plants look

1156
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,480
happy those buds have never been beefier

1157
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,239
the plants have never prayed like that

1158
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,918
what did i do i can look back and say

1159
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,838
oh it's this new product i sprayed that

1160
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,799
every three days instead of every five

1161
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:16,878
days this time

1162
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,800
and the plants [ __ ] loved it so keep

1163
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,719
good notes on what you're doing

1164
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,720
you can always adjust and change your

1165
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,319
strategy based on your research that is

1166
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,759
a scientific method that's building a

1167
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,200
relationship with your plants

1168
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,679
that's understanding the products you're

1169
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,358
using that is becoming a solid grower so

1170
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,079
do that stuff

1171
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,960
don't spray big chunky buds if the buds

1172
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,679
are getting big

1173
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,079
you may want to stop spraying i usually

1174
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,480
quit spraying around day 21 i may hit

1175
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,440
them with one final pesticide spray

1176
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,719
one final booster spray at day 21 just

1177
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,159
to get them going

1178
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,480
then i avoid spraying if at all possible

1179
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,000
understand that it does rain outside

1180
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,679
you've got chunky buds outside if you're

1181
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,358
growing outdoors the water the rain the

1182
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,160
mist the fog are going to hit those

1183
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,000
plants

1184
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,838
yes there's a lot of airflow and air

1185
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,760
moving out there but the plants are

1186
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,480
resilient to moisture if you do run into

1187
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,400
problems

1188
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,320
if you do have issues there are products

1189
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,480
that you can apply

1190
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,960
early in flower as buds are developing

1191
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,000
but be very careful be very specific do

1192
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
your research

1193
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and understand what you are applying to

1194
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,519
these plants unless it is necessary

1195
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,199
please don't spray them

1196
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,559
keep in mind i said that they are

1197
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:24,319
resilient they are resistant the

1198
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,199
trichomes do work to keep the water off

1199
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,039
the plants

1200
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,639
but they also work like a sponge if

1201
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,119
you're going to spray them just mist

1202
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,679
them

1203
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,358
get the the booster or the pesticide or

1204
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,239
the mildew remover whatever you have to

1205
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:35,838
put on there

1206
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,199
get that on there but don't saturate

1207
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,239
those buds we don't want to wet up the

1208
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,239
spongy buds

1209
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:41,519
cause ourselves more problems that's

1210
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,959
when you've got to weigh your options do

1211
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,559
i want to spray them or do i just want

1212
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,280
to accept the problem i've got

1213
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,960
that's when you've got thinking to do so

1214
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,599
foliar feeding is a really good way to

1215
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,000
provide

1216
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,480
specific nutrients to our plants without

1217
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,239
over watering or causing a lockout it is

1218
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,159
a good way to chase a problem if you see

1219
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,319
a nitrogen deficiency you can absolutely

1220
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:02,719
mix up some of your vegetative nutrients

1221
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,880
give it a foliar feed maybe apply it

1222
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,399
two or three days apart do it two or

1223
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,079
three times you'll absolutely see

1224
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,800
results if you need to go harder

1225
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,000
go harder like i said earlier start your

1226
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,240
foliar feed light

1227
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,400
use less than you think you need and

1228
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,199
increase you can't unfeed it but you can

1229
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,440
feed it more

1230
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:21,039
it's already deficient so feed it more

1231
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,960
if you need to but don't burn it by

1232
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,480
trying to fix it all in one spray

1233
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,159
it's like painting a couple of light

1234
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,880
coats may work better than one thick

1235
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,480
coat

1236
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,000
and it works great because you don't

1237
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,440
have to keep watering in

1238
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,119
you've already watered the roots are

1239
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,679
doing their thing move the nutrients

1240
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,119
around

1241
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,879
now you got to just get that calmag

1242
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,720
where it needs to be by spraying it

1243
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,480
so i think that is my ah my foliar

1244
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,239
