as pine sour and lemons I will

completely agree with that flavor

description it smells like somebody

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,240
cleaned a skunk's ass with lemon pledge

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,799

show and has continued to support the

67
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:28,560
show on patreon I could not do it

68
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,359
without your support the computer that I

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,060
am using to record this show was

70
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,530
actually funded by patreon contributions

71
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,780
that was covered just a couple of years

72
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,640
ago recently I've noticed that my

73
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,219
MacBook is acting a little bit funny and

74
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,359
it is also warped on the bottom I don't

75
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,340
know how that happened I don't know what

76
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,260
does that but it is starting to bubble

77
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,689
so it is almost time to replace this

78
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:50,340
MacBook that will not be stressful that

79
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:52,859
will not be a problem there will be no

80
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,750
issue because my friends from patreon

81
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,760
have helped out so well that I'll just

82
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,590
be able to go to the computer place and

83
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,318
say I need a new computer and it will be

84
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,239
covered through my friends on patreon so

85
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:06,060
big thanks and big shout out for all of

86
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,620
the continued patreon support if you are

87
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,299
not supporting the show on patreon and

88
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,810
you would like to learn how to do so all

89
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:22,889
you need to do is visit

90
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:25,920
www.reimaverick.com page and actually

91
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,659
search for the podcast in the search bar

92
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,689
I think you actually have to type in

93
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,430
patreon.com forward slash grow from your

94
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:35,129
heart they don't allow us to come up in

95
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,620
their search bar because we are cannabis

96
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,449
content providers but they haven't

97
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,280
banned us from the service so I don't

98
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,189
complain you just have to type in the

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,919
full URL or I have made it easy for you

100

patreon I am trying to make it easy for

112
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:14,549
everybody to support the show because I

113
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:16,529

114
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:18,870

116
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,060

in the show notes or the video

118
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,728
description

119
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,600
alright the next order of business I

120
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,669
have gotten written down

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,260
is to apologize for my stuffy nose I

122
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,490
sound like I've got a stuffy nose I

123
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,110
sound like kind of sound like I'm

124
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,019
talking a little bit like this it is

125
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,210
worth it it is all for good cause this

126
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,370
evening I walked into the flower room

127
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:43,439
where I've got a male plant who was just

128
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,600
dumping pollen and I gave him a nice

129
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,550
little tap a nice little flick and I let

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,500
all that pollen go flying around all

131
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,720
over a bunch of lovely ladies so there

132
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,180
has been a successful phase 1

133
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,370
pollination that happened today I will

134
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,170
do another pollination in three to five

135
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,629
days depending on how the male and the

136
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,280
female plants look then once all that

137
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,199
pollen is shaken out I'll collect a

138
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,939
little bit of it I may store some of it

139
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,439
properly we'll talk about Paul and

140
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,089
storage in another episode that's not

141
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,129
what we're here for today but I may

142
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:13,379
store some of that pollen then cut down

143
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:16,860
that male then we will change the light

144
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:20,339
schedule and in approximately 50 to 70

145
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,660
days we will have more fresh seeds some

146
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,789
of the items that have been sold out

147
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,650
will be replenished and there may be

148
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,180
some new things that need to be tested

149
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:29,069
and tried out before they can go to

150
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,660
market but if I do sound a little bit

151
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,370
fuzzy in my voice today if I sound like

152
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,530
I'm on the verge of sneezing that is

153
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,720
absolutely accurate it is because I

154
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:38,789
played with a male plant and spread a

155
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,830
bunch of pollen throughout a room and it

156
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,750
is messing me up a little bit today I

157
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:45,060
can taste it and I can certainly feel it

158
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,220
in my face so I apologize if you can

159
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,290
hear it now speaking of pollen rooms I

160
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,540
do have another update for you a while

161
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,360
back I was talking about replenishing

162
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,100
and remaking the TMNT line many of you

163
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,930
know what I'm talking about when I say

164
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,210
the TMNT line many of you may be

165
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,189
confused there is a strain in that

166
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:03,659
lineup called Leonardo there's a strain

167
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:05,490
and they're called Raphael there's a

168
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,140
strain called Donatello there is a

169
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,750
strain called Michelangelo there's a

170
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,779
bebop in a Rocksteady and I may have

171
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:16,259
recently created a strain by the name of

172
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,759
shredder so I call that the TMNT line

173
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,769
we've got to be careful with some of the

174
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,539
words we use but I am excited to

175
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:23,969
announce that those plants have been

176
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,340
harvested and I am slowly getting those

177
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,400
packages put together many people have

178
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,079
been asking for TMNT packages and the

179
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,909
best update I have got for you is that

180
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,189
the plants have been harvested they have

181
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,500
been dried it have been crumbled up and

182
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:40,529
the seeds have been removed and a large

183
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,660
portion of them have begun the packaging

184
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:43,549
phase

185
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,939
is just me doing the packaging on these

186
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,550
beans so please be patient I do all of

187
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,740
the seed sorting and packaging by myself

188
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,620
so it does take me a while but as soon

189
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:58,430
as I am done these seeds will land at

190
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,959
seeds here now dot-com and I'll make

191
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,750
sure you know that they are there

192
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,370
through the podcast I know a lot of

193
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,810
people have been paying attention and

194
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,600
waiting for that update and for that

195
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,540
announcement so the best date I can give

196
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,590
you is I will have those seeds to the

197
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:18,590
vendors by March 1st so by March 1st the

198
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:20,569
TMNT line will be replenished but do not

199
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:22,459
miss it because they will go very

200
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:25,129
quickly make sure you're signed up to

201

great updates and deals through that

214
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:02,509
service all right that's enough garden

215
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,100
updates I told you that seeds will be

216
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,319
available soon I told you that I have

217
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,810
pollinated another round we are making

218
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,980
great success in the breeding programs

219
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,629
in 2020 thank you for following along

220
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,120
the next thing I should talk about is I

221
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:20,000
recently did an episode about my

222
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,069
nutrient mix I did a very introductory

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,259
episode that talked about how and why I

224
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:26,719
do many of the things I do then I

225
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:29,449
discussed my vegetative nutrient mix

226
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,340
then I followed that masterpiece up with

227
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:33,799
another episode which included my

228
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:36,019
flowering nutrient mix it was very

229
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,519
detailed it was very in-depth and I

230
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:41,240
think I covered most of the necessary

231
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:44,539
details I did get quite a few messages

232
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,480
emails and comments and questions after

233
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:50,299
I posted those episodes one of the most

234
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,789
common questions was why don't you list

235
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:56,579
your ppm and your pH in

236
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:59,069
week now I do mention the pH quite often

237
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,470
and I say that through flour I generally

238
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,690
recommend we keep our pH between six

239
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,340
point two and six point four that is a

240
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,670
great range for our plants you have to

241
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,889
adjust to each specific plant possibly

242
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:13,889
each specific phenotype but I do believe

243
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:15,929
that six two two six four will work for

244
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:18,179
most plants in most Gardens if you've

245
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:20,009
got a lot of plants you can find that

246
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,079
most of them will be happy within that

247
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:24,059
range so I did mention that a couple of

248
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,500
times I didn't feel like I needed to say

249
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:30,359
that on every week's mix details so if

250
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,759
you go back and listen you will hear

251
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,370
that I say a lot of times six point two

252
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,950
to six point four is the recommended pH

253
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,870
if you are running cocoa or soilless mix

254
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,570
and you were running the nutrient mix

255
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,159
which I suggested and again that mix

256
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,260
that I recommend is only going to work

257
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,269
in cocoa don't do that every day in a

258
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,279
soilless mix you'll burn your plants you

259
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,990
can do that just break it down you'll

260
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,120
need waterings without all that

261
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,159
nutrients in between now I'm rambling

262
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,289
let's stay focused the other thing

263
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,139
people wanted to know is why don't I

264
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:04,110
mention the EC or the PPM's of my

265
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,580
specific mix each week if you listen to

266
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,389
both episodes you'll remember that I

267
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:12,000
said I do not use reverse osmosis water

268
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:14,009
I don't find it necessary where I am

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,899
because we've got good water you may

270
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:17,490
need it where you are you may not that

271
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,860
is up to you I don't want to waste that

272
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,649
much water if it's not necessary water

273
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,659
is expensive water is limited we don't

274
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,250
have unlimited water one day we will run

275
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:28,169
out of water I don't want to see that

276
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,909
world but it will happen one day I don't

277
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,579
want to [ __ ] up and waste too much water

278
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:35,909
so I don't use the RO unnecessarily

279
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,240
which means that my starting PPM's and

280
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:41,879
my starting EC are quite possibly very

281
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,220
different than your starting numbers I

282
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,929
don't know what is in your municipal

283
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,700
water I don't know what's in your well

284
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:49,559
water I don't know what is in your tap

285
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,780
water I don't know what is in whatever

286
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:55,619
water you were using we have different

287
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:58,019
water sources so if we are 250 PPM's off

288
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,029
when we start our math is not going to

289
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,710
add up now I could have done a simple

290
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,179
calculation I could have filled up a

291
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,190
container of water and I could have

292
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:06,539
checked my PPM's there and see what I

293
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,350
start with and then I could have gone

294
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:09,539
back and done the

295
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,639
nutrient mix and measure the PM's and

296
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:14,370
tell you what I ended with but if I only

297
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,500
missed one detail in that episode I am

298
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,450
not mad at myself that that is the thing

299
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,000
I skip I feel like I did a pretty good

300
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:24,540
job on that episode so I apologize that

301
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,600
I did not include the EC or the ppm of

302
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:30,120
the nutrient solutions I have been

303
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,980
mixing these mixes for quite a while in

304
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,460
quite a few rooms and I've written down

305
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,680
the EC and the mix quite a few times and

306
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,080
I do remember off the top of my head

307
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,529
that we generally stay within the one

308
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:46,860
point seven to one point nine EC range

309
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:50,220
sometimes very rarely we will get up

310
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,370
near the two point one EC range and that

311
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,950
also is going to vary based on which

312
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,440
method you choose to use are you using

313
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,210
the monday big mix are you mixing

314
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,860
everything all at once are you adding

315
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,519
boosts that is going to make a

316
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,529
difference

317
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,250
everything you add in will absolutely

318
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:10,679
change your EC and your ppm s so that is

319
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,440
my update that is my disclaimer and that

320
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:17,219
is my apology for not including the EC

321
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,770
or the PPM's in my nutrient mix episode

322
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,710
all right podcast world let's segue into

323
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:24,449
the email portion of this show if you've

324
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,370
got a cannabis culture or a cannabis

325
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,350
cultivation question and you would like

326
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,200
to ask me I would love to hear from you

327
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:34,259

329
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:39,389
today's episode comes from my friend

330
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:43,949
giant Mike from cannabis and it goes a

331
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:46,199
lot like this yo Rusted Jeff I wrote to

332
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,300
you last year around 4:20 to talk about

333
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,050
what 4/20 means to me and it was about

334
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,659
my mother

335
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:53,879
then I recently met you at the Indo Expo

336
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:56,939
and I want to compliment you again on

337
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,009
your professionalism at the endo Expo I

338
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,260
remember exactly who you are and the

339
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:03,569
moment I read this email I remembered

340
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,399
this situation and it meant a lot to me

341
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,260
it was a great moment I'm glad somebody

342
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,110
else saw it let's keep reading it says

343
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,059
you probably don't remember me because

344
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,190
I'm sure it happened more than once but

345
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,779
I was directly behind what appeared to

346
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,640
be and then he describes a couple of

347
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,389
friends of mine we don't have to go into

348
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,259
a full description

349
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:22,049
I don't know if they want to be

350
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:23,669
described on the podcast uh he was

351
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:25,769
standing directly behind friends of mine

352
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,179
he gives a good description it says but

353
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:28,559
you were trying to handle business and

354
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,899
they kept thanking you for everything

355
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,969
you do and reached over the table at the

356
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,639
booth and tried to give you a big hug

357
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,200
yes I remember that exact moment

358
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,529
those are good friends of mine they are

359
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,910
very huge supporters of I read genetics

360
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,069
I'm pretty sure they listened to this

361
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:46,740
podcast and they make sure to come say

362
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,230
hi to me at every single cannabis

363
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,360
industry event in Colorado if there is

364
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,490
an event and I am there I can rely on my

365
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,620
friends to come give me a high five and

366
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,019
a hug I know exactly who you're talking

367
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,269
about great folks a little tiny short

368
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,460
couple good friends of mine super sweet

369
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:04,379
people I love that they are a couple

370
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,570
that they both interact with me a lot of

371
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,820
times when you go to a cannabis event or

372
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,200
a cannabis Industry sort of thing it's a

373
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,550
bunch of dudes and a bunch of bros

374
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,690
talking to each other and the

375
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:14,399
girlfriends look like they're getting

376
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,010
drugged along by their boyfriends I

377
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,049
always make sure to politely and in a

378
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:20,610
friendly way say hi to the girlfriends

379
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,479
to make sure they can be included in the

380
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,029
event as well

381
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,529
this couple always shows up as equals

382
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,419
they've both got a big smile on their

383
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:28,860
face they're both equally as excited to

384
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:30,839
be at the event they're both equally

385
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,399
excited to see me so I love it when a

386
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,889
couple comes to the booth like that

387
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,319
let's get my stoned ass back on track it

388
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:39,480
says I've been a car salesman for 15

389
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,070
years from time to time people will get

390
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,139
excited about their car and want to hug

391
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,510
their salesmen or sales women and even

392
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,490
try to kiss us I know that awkward

393
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,200
feeling and I get how to handle them by

394
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,509
sidestepping them and changing the flow

395
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,700
of conversation to move on and make them

396
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:56,009
forget about it but you surprised me

397
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,200
Rasta Jeff you actually came out of your

398
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:01,139
booth and walked around and gave them a

399
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,410
hug and took a picture with them I think

400
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,389
you are a class act for that hey I'm

401
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:08,339
really glad that you caught that moment

402
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,110
I'm really glad I got to take that photo

403
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,120
with my friends and that's what it's all

404
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,879
about I was at the Indo Expo with a

405
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,769
booth I was there in a business mode but

406
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,299
when I see my friends I want to make

407
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:20,309
sure to stop and give my friends a

408
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:22,709
high-five or a handshake or a hug I

409
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:24,479
really made sure to try to connect with

410
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,250
everybody they came to my booth that

411
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,889
weekend I stuck my hand out and said I'm

412
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,960
Jeff what is your name I try to treat

413
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:32,699
everybody like they're one of my best

414
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,170
friends and also

415
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,690
they are one of the most important

416
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,879
people on the planet because they are I

417
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,770
like to treat people how I expect to be

418
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,929
treated that's with kindness that's with

419
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:44,730
friendship that's with respect all that

420
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:46,679
stuff that we expect I try to give that

421
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,779
as well and I'm getting it in return the

422
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,639
world is giving that back to me so I do

423
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,299
try to shake people's hands and look

424
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,429
them in the eye

425
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,139
of course I had a long weekend and I was

426
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:56,549
heavily medicated so there's a little

427
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,870
bit of that you miss a little bit of

428
00:15:56,549 --> 00:16:00,689
that personal connection because of that

429
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,399
but I do my best to be present and say

430
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,380
hi to everybody because they're not

431
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,220
there just to purchase seeds they want

432
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,539
to meet me

433
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,040
they want to shake my hand they've

434
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,349
learned a lot from me and it means a lot

435
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,879
to them to return the energy they want

436
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,590
to give me a hug and thank me and it

437
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,480
means a lot so I appreciate that you

438
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,129
noticed that I'm that somebody actually

439
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,379
caught me coming out from behind my

440
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:20,939
booth and hugging my friends they're not

441
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,950
my customers those are my friends that's

442
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,210
my community and thank you I'm glad you

443
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,379
caught that but let's keep going with

444
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,540
this email because I'm getting all gushy

445
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:28,860
here it says I don't know I guess it's

446
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:30,990
the little things like that we really

447
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,690
don't think about but people notice and

448
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:36,720
something so small can make people start

449
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,610
drinking the IRA genetics kool-aid hey I

450
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,500
don't have any kool-aid to spill man I

451
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,720
hope that everybody just follows along

452
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,149
because I'm doing a good positive thing

453
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,740
I feel like we are a seed breeders and

454
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:48,509
the cannabis community we're kind of

455
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,279
like a band there are different breeders

456
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,569
that do different things that have

457
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,429
different styles and if you're into

458
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,140
their music you'll listen to them I try

459
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,509
to put out some positive music a

460
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,699
positive vibe a positive brand I try to

461
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:01,950
be reliable and honest and I think it's

462
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,259
working just being me is working the

463
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,539
best that it can it has taken a while to

464
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:08,579
get here but it is really starting to

465
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,500
show so let's continue with the message

466
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,599
it says I've been drinking the irie

467
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,180
kool-aid for a few years now but other

468
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,219
people noticed it too and many people

469
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,980
behind me were shocked that you came out

470
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,690
from behind the booth man again that's

471
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,849

473
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,359

00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:00,629
noticing there is so much more to this

490
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,150
message this person also says sorry I'm

491
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,190
kind of rambling but my point is keep up

492
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,500
the good work you represent you and your

493
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,019
company very well thank you I appreciate

494
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,420
that it is grape it somebody at an event

495
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:14,700
caught that it was just me being myself

496
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,860
so that is a huge compliment now here is

497
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,710
another part the last paragraph of this

498
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,779
email reads just a like of this it says

499
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,569
I'm sure you were getting flooded with

500
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:27,359
questions about that mix episode my

501
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:29,700
question is really sure it says i

502
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,189
noticed you did not mention mammoth pea

503
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,590
have you not gotten good results from

504
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,019
mammoth pea I am on the fence with it

505
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:39,149
only because of the cost I started using

506
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:41,609
it the week before I flip my plants I

507
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,740
have been long awaiting your mix episode

508
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:45,750
to hear if you use it and your take on

509
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,839
it I'm gonna jump in right there and say

510
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,400
I do love mammoth pea it is a great

511
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,589
product if you guys aren't familiar with

512
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,120
mammoth pea give it a quick google check

513
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:57,179
it out it is a great product

514
00:18:54,119 --> 00:19:00,299
however we agreed in the commercial

515
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,519
facilities that it is not cost-effective

516
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:04,109
I am NOT trying to bash mammoth pea I

517
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,660
don't have anything negative to say

518
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:09,119
about mammoth pea except when you were

519
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,310
trying to convince an investor and an

520
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,949
owner that you need to spend that type

521
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,679
of money on one bottle they do get

522
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,930
sticker shock and in a commercial

523
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,810
environment we need to order a lot of

524
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:23,220
mammoth pea so we opted to not use the

525
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:25,200
mammoth pea in the commercial

526
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,019
environments and honestly the plants

527
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,940
look extremely happy so we have opted to

528
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:32,809
not use it in the commercial environment

529
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,730
like you said mainly for the cost

530
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:38,220
another small reason why we don't use

531
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,069
mammoth pea is basically a logistics

532
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,380
issue we buy most of our products from

533
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:45,509
one warehouse everything comes on one

534
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,400
truck it's really easy just to go down

535
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:50,069
the sheet and order all of the things we

536
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,710
need and unfortunately that warehouse

537
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:54,839
does not carry mammoth P so with the

538
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,910
products already being a little bit not

539
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,099
cost-effective and then it's not carried

540
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,240
by my normal distributor I don't make an

541
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,799
extra order to add

542
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,150
that product to my lineup so those are

543
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,450
two solid reasons why I'm not using

544
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,429
Mammoth be in a commercial grow again

545
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,230
let me reiterate I don't want a bash

546
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:12,690
mammoth P there is nothing wrong with

547
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,630
mammoth P it is a wonderful product I

548
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,970
have seen explosive root growth when

549
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:20,910
mammoth pea is added in the early phases

550
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,890
and I have seen giant fat tasty buds

551
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:25,440
when mammoth pea is added in later

552
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:28,620
phases I do like to add mammoth pea and

553
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,259
my personal grows I absolutely like to

554
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:32,879
use mammoth P in my breeding projects

555
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:34,740
but those are my personal grows where I

556
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,140
am in charge of all the nutrients all

557
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,480
the budgeting everything is up to me so

558
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,450
in those situations I do apply mammoth

559
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,370
peat I am also funding a much smaller

560
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,039
personal garden I don't have to buy

561
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:49,678
several five-gallon bottles of mammoth

562
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,109
pee so in my personal grows I like the

563
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,970
mammoth P in my breeding program I

564
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:57,479
certainly add mammoth pee and I do

565
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:59,970
notice that my seeds look fatter fuller

566
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,759
and healthier when I use the mammoth P

567
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,410
in my personal breeding projects so

568
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,359
that's the first part of that question I

569
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:08,400
basically don't use mammoth pee and the

570
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,919
commercial grow because it is very

571
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,440
expensive and it is also not available

572
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,600
from my main distributor so I'd have to

573
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,370
pay another hundred to one hundred and

574
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,919
fifty dollars to have a truck deliver me

575
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:22,229
another pallet of another very expensive

576
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,210
product so we just decided to skip that

577
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,429
step and honestly the plants look

578
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,410
beautiful the plants are very happy so

579
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,210
they're not missing anything they don't

580
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,040
even know they're not getting it there

581
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,370
is a little bit more to this question it

582
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:38,099
goes on it says honestly everyone else I

583
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:41,069
know in Colorado uses mammoth pee or

584
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:44,428
recharge or both so I was shocked to not

585
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:47,639
here either on the mix episodes is plus

586
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:49,559
life really that good then they sign it

587
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,590
with thanks for your time giant Mike

588
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,420
from cannabis a giant Mike thank you for

589
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:58,500
the great message let's talk more about

590
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,929
+ life and recharge everybody knows I'm

591

597
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:17,000

gang Scottie real is my buddy Scottie

599
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,640
real makes recharge I should be using

600
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,470
recharge in my commercial environments

601
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,019
unfortunately my distributor does not

602
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,089
carry recharge at their big warehouse so

603
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:31,429
once again it's not available at my main

604
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:34,819
distributor recharge is a great product

605
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:38,298
recharge is cost-effective I will say

606
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:40,460
that it is cost-effective I like to use

607
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:42,589
recharge in my personal growth

608
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,750
Scottie makes sure that I never run out

609
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:46,428
of recharge once again Thank You Scottie

610
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,579
for always taking good care of me

611
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:52,220
I like recharge once a week at two point

612
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:55,009
five grams of recharge per gallon of

613
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,440
water once a week I feed every plant

614
00:22:55,009 --> 00:23:00,048
recharged it goes in whatever I'm mixing

615
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,360
in Monday every week recharged goes in

616
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:05,089
there for every plant recharged is a

617
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:08,058
great product again it's not sold

618
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:09,408
through my major supplier the

619
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:12,440
distributes for my commercial

620
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:15,350
environments so that is honestly the

621
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,808
main determining factor of why I do not

622
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:20,538
use recharge in my commercial grows and

623
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:21,798
why it was not included in my nutrient

624
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:25,579
mix episode

625
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:27,528
I love Scottie real I love recharge that

626
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:29,839
[ __ ] is awesome I did not include it

627
00:23:27,528 --> 00:23:32,058
because it is not available through my

628
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,369
vendor and through my distributor I

629
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:36,440
recommend it and my personal grow I use

630
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:38,599
it all the time I recommend it for your

631
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,419
personal grow or your commercial grow as

632
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:44,089
well big shout out to recharge great

633
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:46,399
product there is absolutely no reason to

634
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,949
not use it there are a million and one

635
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:51,528
reasons why you should use it now the

636
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:54,620
last part of this email is is plus life

637
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:56,690
really that good yes I do believe that

638
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:58,969
plus life is a quality product that is

639
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,370
cost effective and it is doing exactly

640
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,370
what I expect it to and it works as

641
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:06,859
advertised so yes I do think that plus

642
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:08,959
life is that good of a product and since

643
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:10,879
I'm already using the veg bloom base I'm

644
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,038
using the booster which is shine I'm

645
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,230
using the foliar feed which is push I

646
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,210
feel like it works very well just to go

647
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,000
ahead and round out the recipe with the

648
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:23,028
plus life so that is a quick rundown of

649
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,548
why I did not include mammoth pea or

650
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,250
recharge in my nutrient mix episodes

651
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,869
there is

652
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,880
nothing wrong with those products they

653
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:31,949
are great products that is just not what

654
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,990
I am doing in my commercial environment

655
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,970

656

657
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,930

658
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,690
using those products in my commercial

659
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:45,480
environment at this time I am using

660

recharge in my personal grow all the

661
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,150
time and I like to use mammoth pee in my

662
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:54,390
flowering plants that are seeded because

663
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,759
my seeds do show to be fatter they're

664
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:59,340
rounder they are harder and they finish

665
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,230
even sooner when I use the mammoth pee

666

726
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:24,668
make but to be a cutie cheese a'queen

728
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,489
honey when they ask what a [ __ ] ones

729
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:47,389
made of

730
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:49,720

731
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:49,719
kind

732
00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:08,759
[Music]

733
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,750

734
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:23,230
I know the kid 19 prone see I'm tired so

735
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:27,279
I never leave inside just leave with me

736
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:29,798
in the Twilight tightness if she says

737
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,678

738
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:35,589

739
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,470
that giant maligning that's why she has

740

no tires at this time okay

741
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:47,880
I know many men not trying but she needs

742
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:47,879
to be more than wined and dined the cars

743
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:13,720
so define the way she knew I'd be she
