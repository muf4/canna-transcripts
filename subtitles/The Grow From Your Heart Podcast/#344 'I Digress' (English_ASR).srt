32
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:16,679
letting you know what I am smoking on

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,228
today I'm taking dabs of the fatso

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,000
nectar from Green Dot labs we've talked

35
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:23,640
about the fatso nectar on the podcast

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,040
before it is a combination of GMO and

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,489
legend og it's described as dark roast

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,740
coffee garlic and fuel I think it's got

39
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,449
a maybe a dark beer sort of a flavor on

40
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,578
the inhale it's definitely got the dark

41
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,950
roast coffee then it's got the feel on

42
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,408
the exhale I leaves a little bit of a

43
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,659
creamy flavor a dark kind of a dark beer

44
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,280
sort of a thing and then that garlic

45
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,920
breath kicks and it's got garlic and

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,019
cookies at the end I really like it it's

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,850
got a great head high a face high it

48
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:52,890
goes to the highs I really feel it so

49
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,438
the fat so nectar is what I'm dabbing

50
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,780
today earlier I was taking dabs of some

51
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,029
cherry slider full spectrum extract also

52
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,909
from green dot it is a combo of cherry

53
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,769
pie Kush and joseph OG the flavor on the

54
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,979
label is described as cherry cola I

55
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:10,199
thought it tasted like a packet of

56
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,930
cherry kool-aid or maybe grape kool-aid

57
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,709
with no sugar it's a little lie it's a

58
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,330
little strong

59
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,800
powerful in the flavor it really hits

60
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,530
the tongue with that cherry candy kind

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,390
of flavor but there's no sweetness to it

62
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,310
but it didn't have the the medical

63
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:24,989
quality or the high I was looking for so

64
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,240
I followed that up with a fatso nectar

65
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,830
and it worked out to be a beautiful

66
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,120
combo so that's what I'm dabbing on

67
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,010
today I hope you guys are taking dabs of

68
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,420
something delicious up you're smoking a

69
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:34,799
blunt of something wonderful if that's

70
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,569
your thing I hope you're smoking a fat

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,430
joint maybe you've got the vaporizer

72
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,409
going wherever you are whatever you're

73
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,879
doing I hope you were getting heavily

74
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:44,310
medicated with me

75
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,780

a podcast I want to start the show off

77
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,550

78
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,840

79

105
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:51,719

scene while helping normalize cannabis

00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,509
Jeff and Mike hey thanks for

125
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:31,230
that mic comes on the show Mike's got

126
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,790
two kids now so it's hard to get him out

127
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,530
of the house sometimes when he comes

128
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,939
over he's not in the mood to record he

129
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:37,709
just wants to chill out take some dabs

130
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:39,449
and have a good time so shout out to

131
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,099
Mike for being on the show when he wants

132
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:43,079
to and for putting his energy into that

133
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,689
i--dude thanks for acknowledging our

134
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,789
deep dives into the topics cuz I kind of

135
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:49,949
do go deep I want to I usually focus one

136
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,420
episode on a whole topic and try to get

137
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,829
you educated on that and then we move

138
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,500
forward I try not to cover too much in

139
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:57,120
one show as for multiple topics try to

140
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,009
get that one topic thorough so I'm glad

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,689
you notice that thank you and then he

142
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,389
said guaranteed to educate and entertain

143
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:05,399
that's what I'm here for I was not a

144
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:06,930
good student in school because I was

145
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,329
bored if my teacher would have taken a

146
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,949
minute to make that class entertaining I

147
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:12,479
would have learned so much more so I

148
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,180
feel like I keep your entertain your

149
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,770
attention and keep educating you by

150
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,269
staying entertaining throwing a couple

151
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:19,349
of jokes here say some silly [ __ ]

152
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:20,849
occasionally and that's just my

153
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,120
personality anyway so it works out well

154
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:26,430
so I think my learning style is probably

155
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,709
similar to a lot of cannabis consumers

156
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,629
we have to have a joke here and there we

157
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:32,669
have to have some some light to the

158
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,990
heavy to make it enjoyable so I try to

159
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,400
throw that in there so thanks for

160
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,410
noticing that and do thanks for noticing

161
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,750
my authentic excitement and passion for

162
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,640
cannabis that is true that will never go

163
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,779
away thanks for noticing that so and

164
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,490
also we keep you up-to-date on the

165
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,779
cannabis scene and help you normalize

166
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,819
cannabis in your own life that's very

167
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,379
interesting I'm glad that we keep you up

168
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,420
to date I kind of think that a lot of my

169
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,219
listeners may live vicariously through

170
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,509
Mike and myself and the other folks that

171
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,190
come on the show so that's why I try to

172
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:57,810
give detailed descriptions about what

173
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,550
I'm smoking and some of the weird things

174
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,720
that I do so thanks for noticing that

175
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,090
man I appreciate that and once again

176
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,160
shout out to Mike and normalizing

177
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:06,779
cannabis in your own life that's uh

178
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,850
that's an interesting statement I'm not

179
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,199
sure how you mean that but that is

180
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,240
really interesting I'd like to know more

181
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,909
about that also he said they promote

182
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,860
family honesty and much more yes it's

183
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,050
all about telling the kids the truth

184
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,759
about cannabis and doing what needs to

185
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,920
be done correctly so dude thanks for the

186
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,289
great review and for the five stars I

187
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,120
really do appreciate that if I can get

188
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,760
the iPad to cooperate we will move into

189
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,280
the next iTunes customer review it goes

190
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,469
like this this one is left by somebody

191
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,469
whose name is I'm the dude what's up the

192
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,300

193
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,680

194
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,249
good friend known as Rob the dude this

195
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,959
is not from

196
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:46,109
rob the dude but either way shout out to

197
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,728
rob the dude the headline says ramble on

198
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:49,258
brother it sounds like you do listen to

199
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:51,928
the show because sometimes we get quite

200
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,968
rambley here anyway the customer review

201
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:55,738
goes like this Jeff my man I love the

202
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:57,209
podcast in all of the pictures I think

203
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:58,798
they're referring to my Instagram

204
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,259

205
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:03,538
Instagram its Irie underscore genetics I

206
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,889
post a lot of wonderful cannabis

207
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,868
photography I just posted a picture of

208
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:10,199
black cherry Kim that has gotten over

209
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:12,449
400 likes in about 7 hours so that's a

210
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,399
quality photo there on Instagram anyway

211
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,528

212
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,178
shots myself dude all you've got to do

213
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:19,918
is grow your plants take good care of

214
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:22,138
them get yourself a nice piece of

215
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,639
material from that's just I know I know

216
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,829
we had a listener say I shouldn't shop

217
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,278
at Hobby Lobby if you've got a fabric

218
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:28,379
store

219
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:29,668

220
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,769
fabric I don't know the who the lady

221
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:34,079

225
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,788
Nikon d3200 I've learned the settings on

226
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:43,618
it real well I've learned where to put

227
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:45,329
the lights put your plants in front of a

228
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:47,189
couple of really colorful tapestries or

229
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:48,989
backgrounds take some great shots and

230
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:51,389
practice man you'll get there it's just

231
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:53,248
practice it's learning the lighting the

232
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,079
angles and honestly the settings on your

233
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:56,999
camera once you get the camera figured

234
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,579

for the five star iTunes customer review

250
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:31,199
and again you guys I'm looking at the

251
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,598
tab right now if you go to the girl from

252
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,860
your heart podcast where it shows that

253
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,209
you're all caught up on listening to

254
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,589
episodes mine says I'm all caught up I

255
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,750
honestly don't listen I just delete them

256
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:41,069
but I've got to have the show in the the

257
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,538
queue so that I can see when the shows

258
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:44,639
pop up and I can get the links to tweet

259
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:45,568
them but if you go where it says that

260
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,759
you've listened to everything of any

261
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:49,620
scroll up you will see ratings and

262
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,389
reviews and you'll see that Todd is at

263
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,730
the top here he left a review four years

264
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:54,350
ago

265
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,879
and then right next to that it says

266
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,740
write a review you just clicked right on

267
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,448
there and it brings up the little screen

268
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,919
to write a review and at the top it

269
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:03,078
gives you the amount of stars so you can

270
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,370
right away click on five stars or

271
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:06,439
however many you feel like that deserve

272
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,419
type in a title for your review and then

273
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,279
go ahead and leave your customer review

274
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:12,469
right there then hit Send and it will

275
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:16,149
post and I will read it on a future

276
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:18,800
episode now that I'm caught up on iTunes

277
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,940
reviews let's work on some emails and I

278
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,208
want to knock out a bunch of emails

279
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,769
because I do have a large block of grow

280
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,419
lessons coming up I know I keep talking

281
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,879
about it I'm trying to get a few other

282
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:30,828
random topics covered get some emails

283
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,360
out of the way get a few loose ends tied

284
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:34,969
up and then we're going to really dive

285
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,009
into a long block of lessons but in the

286
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,600
meantime let's catch up on some emails

287
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:41,149
I've got a great message this one was

288
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,750
just at the top of my inbox and it goes

289
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:46,399
like this hey Rasta Jeff my name is Adam

290
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,870
you can say it on the show and I've been

291
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,328
listening to the show for a little while

292
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,159
now I just have to say you do an amazing

293
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:53,088
job yeah thanks for listening but I do

294
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,588
appreciate that

295
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:56,180
thanks for the compliment he goes on to

296
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,980
say I'm going through my first growth

297
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,659
cycle seems to be going well but I

298
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,159
listen to you talk about the humidity on

299
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:03,139
the podcast and I was just wondering

300
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:06,559
where you were testing your humidity

301
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:09,289
from is it floor level plant level light

302
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:12,078
level or above the lights I'm getting

303
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:14,719
low to mid 70s around the plants mid

304
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,088
60's above the lights it's a 5 by 5 room

305
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,819
with 7 Girl Scout cookies plants inside

306
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:21,920
and I'm using a 1000 watt LED light and

307
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:24,948
I have an oscillating fan in the corner

308
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:27,349
on low thanks for any help and we'll

309
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:30,019
definitely take a DAB and give my mom a

310
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,790
hug for you you're already on the right

311
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,759
path my friend so let's talk about the

312
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:36,139
humidity in your grow environment this

313
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,720
is a really good question because you've

314
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:40,220
probably got just a small hydrometer

315
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,778
it's got the temperature and the amount

316
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,459
of humidity it's probably there's

317
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:44,870
several different versions of this

318
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,028
device but it's usually about the size

319
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,440
of like a pack of playing cards like a

320
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:49,159
deck of playing cards maybe the size of

321
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,990
your iPhone

322
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,759
they probably hang somewhere in the room

323
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,440
it's got a little sensor on it that

324
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:56,539
measures the temperature and humidity in

325
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,060
there and it just hangs and it displays

326
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:00,500
and he probably only measures just a

327
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,719
small area and most people aren't

328
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,278
thinking about how many readings that

329
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,810
thing is taking and the amount of area

330
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:06,590
that is measuring in so it's a really

331
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:08,539
good idea that you

332
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,160
write that up I bet a lot of people are

333
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:11,149
thinking wow I've never thought of this

334
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,529
so they're gonna go move there a

335
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,939
hygrometer right now they're gonna go

336
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:16,220
change it to canopy level or they're

337
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,770
gonna go put it at another area anyway I

338
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,129
would recommend mostly paying attention

339
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:23,779
to about canopy level about the top of

340
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:25,909
the canopy down is where you really

341
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:27,589
mostly want to focus where the plants

342
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:29,480
are is where you want to focus on the

343
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,040
humidity level it's going to vary

344
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,009
throughout the room like you're saying

345
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,409
but it's most important about canopy

346
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:38,000
level down in through the canopy of the

347
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:40,459
plants that's about where you want to

348
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,649
focus on the proper humidity of course

349
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,629
it's gonna be a little more humid down

350
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:46,250
low because you're watering the pots and

351
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:48,830
that's where all the water is starting

352
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,210
it's gonna be drier up above the lights

353
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,920
because the water is going to rise

354
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,259
toward the light but it's not gonna go

355
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,059
past I'm talking about the evaporation

356
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:57,830
the condensation it's not gonna rise

357
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:59,359
past the light because there's no key

358
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,370
point up there you may get a little

359
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,019
pocket of stale humidity up there but

360
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,779
it's not gonna be as humid above the

361
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:09,169
light is it will be near the plants and

362
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:12,259
down low so I would focus more on the

363
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:14,269
humidity near the plants that's where it

364
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:17,720
matters most is right around the plants

365
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:20,480
so if probably from the top bud down to

366
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,100
about 18 to 24 inches down through the

367
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,659
whole section of the canopy you probably

368
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,960
got like a four by four a five by five

369
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:28,850
area in which your plants are taking up

370
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,850
square footage area that's where I would

371
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,639
mainly worry about it now I'm gonna kind

372
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:37,129
of shift gears I would check the vapor

373
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,259
pressure deficit of the entire room I

374
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:41,120
would move my equipment around and see

375
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:43,189
what it is throughout the room because

376
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,200
you may have a hot pocket in one room

377
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,280
you may have not that kind of hot pocket

378
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,900
you guys I know you're hungry and you're

379
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,279
stunned but not that kind of hot pocket

380
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,590
you may have a hot pocket in one part of

381
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,539
the room you may have a humid pocket in

382
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,070
one part of the room you may want to

383
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,809
move that hygrometer around that

384
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,190
thermometer around you want to remove it

385
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:01,009
around the room and see what's actually

386
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,750
going on in there you may be clueless

387
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:04,069
that you've got one corner it's not

388
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,480
getting any airflow and you've got a

389
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,160
bunch of humidity back there and it's

390
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,259
getting real hot back there but the rest

391
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,269
of the room seems just fine so this is a

392
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:13,100
great thing to bring up don't just leave

393
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,299
that hygrometer and thermometer in one

394
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,970
area move it around

395
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:19,079
and try to get the whole room ideal and

396
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,209
the way you're gonna get the whole room

397
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,800
ideal is by more airflow if you've got

398
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,419
it pretty good over here and it's just a

399
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,399
little bit off over here you can

400
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:27,809
probably balance it out by moving air

401
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,389
you may need to bring in more air or

402
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:33,239
evacuate more air but if you're doing

403
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:35,338
pretty close over here and you're just

404
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,139
tape a little bit if it's just stale on

405
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,360
this corner just put air flow in that

406
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,949
corner and get the air moving so you

407
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,810
quit building that humid pocket over

408
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,170
there you quit cooking hot pockets over

409
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,909
there whatever is happening so the

410
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:49,799
humidity and temperature are good things

411
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:52,079
to pay attention to in the room but also

412
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,729
that's going to add up to a vapor

413
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,440
pressure deficit that you're going to

414
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,269
have to pay attention to that's a math

415
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,459
equation that I covered on another

416
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,199
episode there are websites on vapor

417
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,659
pressure deficit if you're not familiar

418
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,850
with that that's something else to check

419
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:07,679
into now something else I want to think

420
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,810
about in this message is you're saying

421
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,659
that you're getting low to mid-70s

422
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:16,469
I present humidity around the plants and

423
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:18,750
mid-60s above the lights that makes

424
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,870
sense to me it's about 70% humidity

425
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,539
right around the plants and 60% humidity

426
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,700
up above the lights now I'm curious how

427
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,230
long had it been since you watered when

428
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,060
you took that measurement when you've

429
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,159
got that reading did you just water or

430
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,559
is it time to water because if you just

431
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,259
watered and you've got that 70 and 60

432
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,389
you might be okay but if it's time to

433
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,338
water and you're still that humid in

434
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:42,838
there you're gonna run into problems

435
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,190
you're going to have a little bit too

436
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,050
much humidity in there and you're gonna

437
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,390
want to bring that down before you get

438
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:51,269
into late flour or you run the risk of

439
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:53,220
powdery mildew of bud rot and also

440
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:55,528
you're just gonna slow down the overall

441
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,180
growth of your plants so it totally

442
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:59,429
makes sense to me that you're getting

443
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:00,569
two different measurements one by the

444
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:02,219
floor probably three or four

445
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,200
measurements one by the floor one by the

446
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,040
pot level one a canopy level and one up

447
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,959
by the lights you're gonna have

448
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,149
different humidity levels there you're

449
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,859
gonna have to use air flow techniques to

450
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:13,350
balance that out if you've got a grow

451
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,089
tent or a small room it shouldn't be too

452
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,370
hard a couple of small fans will make

453
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:19,079
that work for you

454
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,639
also you're gonna have to lower that

455
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,159
humidity you either need to evacuate

456
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,778
some of the stale air and get fresh air

457
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,028
in there you need to get a small

458
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,649
dehumidifier in there some way you need

459
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:30,899
to bring that humidity down

460
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:32,519
maybe minimize the amount of water you

461
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,139
were watering the plants I don't know if

462
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,149
that's an option it's just something you

463
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,679
can think about doing but you need to

464
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,379
get that humidity down before you run

465
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,459
into problems as I look further into

466
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:43,710
your email I'm just sitting here reading

467
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,290
it again as I'm talking do you have

468
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,780
anything on top of the grow room sucking

469
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:50,370
out stale air it says you've got five by

470
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,990
five rooms seven Girl Scout cookies

471
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,090
plants a thousand watt LED and an

472
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,039
oscillating fan in the corner on low

473
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,310
is there anything sucking that humidity

474
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,719
out you may need a can fan up top

475
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:03,059
evacuating cold air that's gonna be my

476
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,950
first recommendation now while your

477
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:05,489
humidity is that high pay attention to

478
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,740
your leaves

479
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,180
if those leaves start sweating if you

480
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,549
see moisture coming out of the leaves

481
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,529
heavily then you're getting too humid in

482
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:15,689
there if they're started getting dry and

483
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:17,429
looking leathery it's too humid in there

484
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,590
if you've got a spot where two leaves

485
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:21,000
are overlapping and they start sticking

486
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,670
together because it looks like they've

487
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,820
been pasted together Moisture came out

488
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:28,559
of the bottom of one leaf and stuck to

489
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,940
the top of the other leaf and now those

490
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,500
leaves have kind of pasted themselves

491
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,570
together that's cuz you've got two too

492
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,309
much humidity in there so it's going to

493
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,040
cause you problems and you need to get

494
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:40,049
that reduced as soon as possible because

495
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,299
if you get into flower that is going to

496
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:43,679
cause you problems and if you're growing

497
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,629
Girl Scout cookies man you're already

498
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,699
fighting an uphill battle because Girl

499
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,830
Scout cookies is not the easiest strain

500
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,200
to grow but the best part about cookies

501
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,389
is when you do it right it is phenomenal

502
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,670
it will sell it will move off the shelf

503
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,649
it will come right out of the bag into

504
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:01,979
people's pipes and you will do just fine

505
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:03,959
if you do it properly so I hope I

506
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,910
answered that question man ahh I want to

507
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,100
take readings from the entire room but

508
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,350
if you can't get the whole room dialed

509
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:13,559
in focus on the area where the plants

510
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:15,869
are in a small 5x5 area it shouldn't

511
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,609
take a lot of effort to get the room

512
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,259
dialed in just a couple of fans

513
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:21,119
honestly I keep talking about that

514
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,250
evacuation fan you need something to

515
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,109
pull old air out of there once you start

516
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,450
pulling that old air out you will see

517
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,490
much more performance from your plants

518
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:31,170
so good luck Adam let me know how that

519
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,630
goes and if you have any more questions

520
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,590
feel free to send me a backup email and

521
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,630
you guys if you'd like to send me an

522
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:39,689
email my email address is grow from your

523
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,950
heart at hotmail.com I would love to

524
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,820
hear from you so let's get right to the

525
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,920
next message

526
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,869
this one says what's up Rasta Jeff I

527
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,730
enjoy your podcast thoroughly

528
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:49,439
you definitely display a bunch of

529
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,940
knowledge and love to share it with the

530
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,320
public absolutely that's what I'm here

531
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,360
for man thanks for the great compliment

532
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,849
thanks for noticing he says highly

533
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,769
appreciated by many I'm sure because I

534
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:01,139
think that your inbox is insanely busy

535
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:03,539
I'll get to another question have you

536
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:07,110
ever thought to reverse a mail and then

537
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:08,190
have it pollinated by another mail yes

538
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:09,629
we've thought of that but I'm gonna keep

539
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,210
going with your email he says for what

540
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,190
reason maybe it will increase the

541
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,500
chances of finding crazy keeper mails

542
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,360
and perhaps maybe for some reason

543
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,180
increasing the potency of the females

544
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,009
due to genetic gender limitations I'm

545
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,810
sure you'll understand what I mean hit

546
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:27,000
me back if you don't I'm looking forward

547
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:29,279
to hearing more about the strains you've

548
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,329
bred and don't say my name on your show

549
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,369
bro Thanks

550
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:34,889
no dad's around here but I can give my

551
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:37,559
mom a hug for you the next time I see

552
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,210
her love peace and cannabis grease I'm

553
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,859
gonna scroll this right quick and make

554
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,910
sure that there's no opportunity for me

555
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:43,259
to have said your name I don't think you

556
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,540
included your name so I think we're

557
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:47,400
doing all right cool I did not say your

558
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:50,690
name now let's get into your message

559
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:54,180
here he asked if I have ever thought to

560
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:56,940
reverse a male plant and have it

561
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,060
pollinated by another male plant now

562
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,250
let's talk about what that means

563
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:05,220
reversing a plant is when I treat a

564
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,720
plant with a I'm using silver

565
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,789
thiosulfate is when I'm spraying my

566
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,000
plants with I use dried components to

567
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:12,990
make my own silver thiosulfate

568
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,599
concentrate and then I dilute it to the

569
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,269
proper ratio and then I apply that to a

570
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:22,019
plant and that will create a reaction in

571
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:25,049
the plant that will trigger a female

572
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:28,470
plant to produce pollen it will make

573
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:30,839
pollen sacks and pollen and that female

574
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:33,059
plant will produce pollen that does not

575
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,399
have any male chromosomes so we will use

576
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:37,649
that pollen to put on another female

577
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,230
plant and that is how we make feminized

578
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,750
seeds that's the short version the very

579
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,670
short version of it so this listener is

580
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,309
asking have I ever thought to take a

581
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:50,490
male plant and apply silver thiosulfate

582
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:52,889
to a male plant to turn it into a girl

583
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,410
so that I could do further experiments

584
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,810
with that female plant

585
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,120
now the answer is I have done the

586
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:03,269
reversal part I have actually flipped a

587
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,879
boy plant into a girl to give myself an

588
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:08,309
idea of what that plant would look like

589
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,740
as a breeding female to where if I made

590
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:13,079
and have to generation or if I use that

591
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,690
male to breed to some of my female stock

592
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,490
it kind of gave me an idea of what its

593
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,140
traits would be what its floral clusters

594
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,940
would look like what type of aroma it

595
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,470
would give what kind of trichomes it

596
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,840
would give it gives you a very good

597
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,579
representation of what the offspring is

598
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,599
going to look like and what its gonna

599
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,210
bring to the table

600
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,579
genetic wise in this new cross so I get

601
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:35,160
to see kind of an advanced look into the

602
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:37,710
genetics of the plant so I have done the

603
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,769
reversal to turn a male into a female

604
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,259
now once I got that far I did consider

605
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:45,329
experimenting but I decided to reach out

606
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:47,609
to a couple of peers and our friend

607
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:49,769
Colin Gordon at the ethos collective has

608
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:51,539
already done what you were talking about

609
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:53,220
doing and what I was considering doing

610
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,379
Colin is a little bit ahead of me in the

611
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,539
breeding game I don't mind saying that

612
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,400
Colin is more advanced than myself he's

613
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:02,069
done it more he's got more space and

614
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,870
he's got more testers he's just a little

615
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:05,939
bit surpassed me in the breeding game

616
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:07,439
I've got nothing but respect for the

617
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,549
dude in his company he's just been at it

618
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,350
a little longer than me

619
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:12,240
and I keep my stuff I do everything

620
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:13,769
myself and he's got kind of a team so

621
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,009
just a different approach to stuff

622
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:18,539
anyway Colin took a male and he reversed

623
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,759
it and then he played experiments with

624
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:22,680
it by pollinating it with a regular male

625
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:24,390
and by pollinating it with a reversed

626
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,000
male he played several experiments and

627
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,970
he said that most of the progeny came

628
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,460
out weak and undesirable so I'm not sure

629
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:35,279
if he was doing inbreeding or out

630
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,610
breeding or back crossing or what he was

631
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,440
trying to do with these wacky

632
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:42,869
male-female combinations and I don't

633
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,340
know if he was applying feminized pollen

634
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,139
I don't know if he was applying pollen

635
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:48,569
from the same male that had been

636
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,640
reversed from the same cultivar I'm not

637
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:53,700
sure his combinations but I trust

638
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,380
Colin's judgment most of the time well

639
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,960
when it comes to cannabis I trust

640
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,160
Colin's judgment like 99.9 percent of

641
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,690
the time there are some other times I've

642
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,300
questioned him but when it comes to

643
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,580
cannabis I I trust Colin's judgment so

644
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:07,619
he said that the offspring was

645
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:08,379
undesirable and I don't want to produce

646
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,909
more

647
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,800
desirable genetics and I don't want to

648
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,140
waste time in space so I am going to

649
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,759
believe Colin that it wasn't something

650
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,280
that would be worth my time and energy

651
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,829
again but I have done the first step and

652
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:22,480
the reason I reversed that mail was to

653
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:24,039
see what it looks like as a female I

654
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,200
wanted to see what traits it would bring

655
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:28,869
to a breeding project and that's a

656
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,100
really good way to get a preview so

657
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:31,959
that's a really good question and I

658
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,099
completely understand what you mean and

659
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,890
I hope I answered your question

660
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:37,179
appropriately the email goes on to say

661
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,580
I'm looking forward to hearing more

662
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,320
about the strains you've bred that's

663
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:43,359
good because I've got a lemon Jeffrey

664
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,559
planned to be coming up very soon

665
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,329
lemon Jeffrey seeds have been

666
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,309
re-released at the hella dank seed

667
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:51,220
company so I'm going to do a talk about

668
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:52,629
that strain very soon don't see my name

669
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,390
on the show do don't think you said your

670
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,950
name anywhere it's not even in the from

671
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,140
because it's just got your initials up

672
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,880
there so that's cool then you say thanks

673
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,520
no dabs around here but I can give my

674
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,380
mom a hug the next time I see er hey bro

675
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,359
it sounds like you have caught on to the

676
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,100
routine so thanks for the great email

677
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,569
thanks for the great question I'm sure

678
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:12,309
that's sparking a lot of people's minds

679
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:13,689
right now people that aren't super

680
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,829
familiar with cannabis and breeding

681
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,820
they're sitting in their cubicle or

682
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:17,500
they're driving in their car they're

683
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:18,759
going what the [ __ ] that's pretty

684
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,339
entertaining stuff to me that's the

685
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,900
stuff I like to experiment with

686
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:24,549
reversing plants advanced breeding

687
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,750
techniques that's the stuff I like to

688
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,419
get into that I don't talk about a lot

689
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,069
but if you've got questions on that send

690
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,779
me the questions I grow from your heart

691
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:33,369
at hotmail.com I'd love to hear from you

692
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:36,069
dude thanks again for the great email

693
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:37,209
and thanks for sparking my brain I do

694
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:39,839
appreciate it

695
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,279
you guys let's get into another message

696
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,849
this message comes from somebody who

697
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:47,410
calls themselves roasted and toasted

698
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:49,480
4:20 and it goes like this hey Rasta

699
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,550
Jeff get roasted and toasted 4:20 here

700
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,900
coming from deep in prohibition land

701
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:55,419
what's up out there a prohibition land

702
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,220
be safe and be careful please then he

703
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,410
says I've got a question for that pot

704
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,610
friendly cop so if you guys have been

705
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,110
listening to the show for a while you

706
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:04,539
probably remember that several episodes

707
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:05,769
back I got an email from a cop and I

708
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,230
read the email on the show and then he

709
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:10,059
replied and I emailed or I did email

710
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,410
from a cop part two as an episode and he

711
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:13,750
said he would be happy to answer

712
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,150
questions honestly I've had a lot of

713
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,640
podcast content so I haven't harassed

714
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,590
him about answering questions but one of

715
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,740
our listeners here has a question so I'm

716
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:23,089
going to read

717
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,009
I'll talk about it and give you my

718
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:26,898
opinion and then hopefully our cop

719
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:29,210
friend is listening or maybe another law

720
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:31,308
enforcement professional is listening or

721
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,379
a legal professional will hear us and

722
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:35,028
they can reply to grow from your heart

723
00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:37,428
at hotmail calm and they can give us

724
00:24:35,028 --> 00:24:39,950
some guidance on your question anyway

725
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:42,259
the question goes like this I've always

726
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,669
heard you can lock your glovebox and if

727
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:45,829
you get pulled over the cops can't

728
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:46,788
search the glovebox or trunk without a

729
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:48,710
search warrant

730
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:51,470
I've always been unclear because if they

731
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:54,590
have probable cause and such such as a

732
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:57,139
dog you know I'm not certain on that

733
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:59,480
rule I've never put my anything in the

734
00:24:57,138 --> 00:25:00,888
glovebox because that's where my license

735
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,360
registration and proof of insurance are

736
00:25:00,888 --> 00:25:03,769
I guess my license is in my pocket but

737
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:05,449
my registration and proof of insurance

738
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,220
are in the glovebox and I always figured

739
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,538
if I tried to stash something in there

740
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,308
I'm gonna get pulled over and that's the

741
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:12,679
first place I'm gonna reach so I've

742
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:15,259
never put stuff in there but I know a

743
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,028
lot of people who have this same mindset

744
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:20,720
that if it's locked they cannot go in

745
00:25:17,028 --> 00:25:23,148
there that sounds accurate from my

746
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,220
little trust me I am NOT a lawyer

747
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:27,109
I don't even claim to play one on TV I

748
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,000
don't know [ __ ] about the law other than

749
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:31,849
I've watched cops a lot and I've been

750
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,429
pulled over a lot and from what I know

751
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:38,269
if that's locked they technically cannot

752
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:40,730
go in there also they're cops if they've

753
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:44,359
got any probable cause they can now

754
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:46,579
search if they say well I smell weed now

755
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,408
they can invent the odor of marijuana

756
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:50,210
and they can go through your car and

757
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:51,350
then they can ask you to unlock that and

758
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,269
then I don't know what happens if you

759
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,589
refuse I really don't maybe they if

760
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:55,909
they've got probable cause they can

761
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:57,769
probably get a crowbar and break that

762
00:25:55,909 --> 00:26:00,528
[ __ ] open if they want to I really

763
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:02,599
don't know the rule the dog if the dog

764
00:26:00,528 --> 00:26:03,528
hits on your car they've got probable

765
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,219
cause and they can go through your

766
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:08,778
vehicle so the dog is definitely the

767
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,970
loophole there for law enforcement and

768
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:13,519
what I've noticed is if you've got like

769
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,870
a quarter a weed and they say hey bro

770
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,490
just give me your drugs before I call

771
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:18,888
the dog because if I call the dog I'm

772
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,690
gonna [ __ ] you every way I can if you

773
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:22,038
got like 1/4 or 1/8 maybe just give it

774
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,899
to him because once they call the dog

775
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,069
out you're wasting a lot of [ __ ] time

776
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:27,439
and they're pissed

777
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:29,388
so sometimes it's better just if you got

778
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,590
a couple of grams or maybe just throw it

779
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:33,148
out I don't know what state you're in I

780
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:36,689
don't know who you are I'm not sure

781
00:26:33,148 --> 00:26:38,398
your your demographic I'm not sure if

782
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,080
that'll work for you but it may be

783
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:41,248
better than getting the [ __ ] dog

784
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,019
called and going through all that

785
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:47,519
sometimes you just piss him off doing

786
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:50,098
that stuff anyway I don't know the

787
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,989
bottom line here if you lock like I had

788
00:26:50,098 --> 00:26:53,519
a van that had a drawer underneath the

789
00:26:51,989 --> 00:26:54,919
passenger seat that you could put Maps

790
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,479
and [ __ ] in that's where I kept all my

791
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,950
paraphernalia and my smoke because that

792
00:26:57,479 --> 00:27:01,588
little drawer under the seat could lock

793
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,149
I didn't know the technicalities on that

794
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:04,950
I don't know if I got pulled over if

795
00:27:03,148 --> 00:27:06,449
they could say open that they probably

796
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,739
could because they would just say well

797
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,028
you smell like marijuana we think

798
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:10,588
there's marijuana in there now that's

799
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:12,538
probable cause and that that's how it

800
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:14,788
would work I really don't know hopefully

801
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:17,338
somebody out there will chime in and

802
00:27:14,788 --> 00:27:18,778
make me not sound so ignorant so grow

803
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:20,579
from your heart at hotmail.com is where

804
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:22,739
you can chime in and update that if I've

805
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:25,378
got cannabis in my glovebox and I get

806
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:27,538
pulled over can law-enforcement require

807
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:29,009
me to open my glovebox what's the

808
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:30,719
situation there show me a couple of

809
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:32,848
examples let me know how that's gonna

810
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:35,038
work all right so there is more to this

811
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:36,298
email and it goes I also want to thank

812
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,878
you for reading my email on your

813
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:41,128
Thursday show as well as some advice I

814
00:27:38,878 --> 00:27:43,918
took from your vapor pressure deficit

815
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:46,168
podcast I've been keeping my rooms at 68

816
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,820
to 72 degrees and after I heard your

817
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:49,499
podcast wall at work I called my wife

818
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:51,989
and asked her to adjust the air

819
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:53,848
conditioner after she adjusted which was

820
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:55,950
a week ago I have seen my plants

821
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:58,378
completely turn around and now they are

822
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,979
looking super healthy at least the best

823
00:27:58,378 --> 00:28:01,019
they can

824
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:03,869
since this round I tried my hand at

825
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:06,450
monster cropping so this listener

826
00:28:03,868 --> 00:28:08,009
listened to the vapor pressure deficit

827
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,229
episode and decided to make some

828
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:13,440
adjustments based on my advice and his

829
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:14,580
plants have completely turned around so

830
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,169
that's great news

831
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:17,999
glad your plants are working out I'm

832
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:19,950
glad my advice worked for you and it

833
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:22,108
means a lot to me that people have

834
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,419
enough trusted me to go change their

835
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:26,249
entire grow based on some stuff that I

836
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:27,719
say but it always feels good to get a

837
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:29,879
message saying hey dude I did your stuff

838
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:31,379
and it worked so that feels good to me

839
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:32,759
I'm glad your plants are looking better

840
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:36,388
bro I'm glad I was able to help you out

841
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,249
and get you back on course then he goes

842
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:40,199
on to say during the two-month veg cycle

843
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:42,118
for the first week of flower the leaves

844
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,399
were mostly single leaf bud structure

845
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:45,490
type and now while budding they have put

846
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,409
on normal

847
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,579
growth that's great that means that the

848
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,600
hormones have all leveled out and

849
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:51,879
everything's going the way that it

850
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,139
should and you should have a decent crop

851
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,700
and the reason is plants were acting

852
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,410
funky you guys I don't know if he caught

853
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,259
that he said monster cropping that is

854
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:02,170
when you take a clone from plants that

855
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:03,730
are a little bit in the flower a little

856
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,529
more than a week maybe up to 14 days

857
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,120
I've seen him go a little later I don't

858
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:09,549
recommend it but a lot of people are

859
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,769
doing it and it seems to be working for

860
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:15,639

861

said my name is Justin I've been

890
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:16,450
listening to your podcast for a few

891
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,800
months now and I am just about caught up

892
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,509
hey man thanks for listening to all the

893
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,889
old episodes have you gone to YouTube

894
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:22,929
and listened to all the way from episode

895
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,400
1 that's quite embarrassing but there's

896
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:26,860
a lot of knowledge there so go check

897
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,179
that out they continue to say I want to

898
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:29,678
say thank you for the wealth of

899
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:31,420
knowledge that you continue to bring to

900
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,470
the table on a regular basis hey you're

901
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,529
very welcome thanks for acknowledging

902
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,630
that I am a New York MMJ patient for

903
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:40,149
about six months or so now unfortunately

904
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:42,610
we only have pills teachers and vape

905
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:45,100
pens but I'm hopeful we will be able to

906
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:46,479
grow and smoke our own flowers very soon

907
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:49,269
hey good luck with that man that's kind

908
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,849
of weird that the thing that works the

909
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:53,319
quickest and most directly you aren't

910
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:54,909
even allowed to use I guess it's great

911
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,589
that you've got medical marijuana but

912
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,509
it's kind of weird without flowers I

913
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:59,299
think that's just law enforcement being

914
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:00,740
afraid

915
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:02,359
anyway let's keep moving with the email

916
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,670
it says listening to you and white mic

917
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,679
on a regular basis has inspired me to

918
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:09,560
join my local normal chapter and that's

919
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,360
the N o RM L chapter the National

920
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:15,319
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana

921
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:18,079
Laws and try to push for reform anyways

922
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:21,259
I've been also moved to research as much

923
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,329
about this glorious plant as possible I

924
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:25,759
have aspirations of being a grower and

925
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:27,589
breeder when it becomes legal here after

926
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,690
I got home from Iraq I had trouble

927
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:31,639
sleeping so I turned to alcohol I've

928
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,289
heard that story too many times and also

929
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,750
thanks for your service man by the way I

930
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:37,220
became overly excessive causing me to

931
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,319
lose multiple jobs that's an

932
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,089
all-too-familiar story thanks to my

933
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,980
friends that introduced me to the plant

934
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:44,750
hey great friends that's who you need it

935
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,120
and finishing up my term of service as I

936
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,069
no longer needed to take pee tests I was

937
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,349
able to stop drinking completely along

938
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:53,929
with other substances I was abusing and

939
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:58,159
I also quit smoking cigarettes I truly

940
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:59,420
think cannabis has saved my life I would

941
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,009
agree with you that cannabis has saved

942
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,440
your life I have several friends who

943
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:04,490
have similar stories to this I'm not

944
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,190
sure if you've ever listened to the

945
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:09,700
episode with Steve de Fino Steve de Fino

946
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:12,440
is a veteran who's got a

947
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,600
grapefruit-sized hole in his back you

948
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,980
can you could put a grapefruit in there

949
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,539
and put a piece of duct tape over it and

950
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,640
you could smuggle a grapefruit and on

951
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:20,930
this man's body where he got blown up

952
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,910
and I'm not making fun of the guy not

953
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:24,620
being disrespectful he would agree with

954
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,240
you that you could smuggle a [ __ ]

955
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:28,819
grapefruit on this man's body he takes

956
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,140
it very well but he takes it well for

957
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:33,339
the same reason as you because he is

958
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:35,630
able to consume cannabis to ease his

959
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:38,509
PTSD symptoms which is what was keeping

960
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,550
you up at night the feelings the

961
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:41,779
thoughts the nightmares cannabis is

962
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:43,369
helping him with that it sounds like

963
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:44,539
it's helping you with that I'm sorry if

964
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:46,399
I'm bringing anything back while I speak

965
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:49,579
about this but those are the things that

966
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,650
cannabis will help you find relief from

967
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:54,439
and it doesn't have the punishing

968
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:56,840
effects on your body your social life

969
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,840
your family life and your wallet as

970
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:01,250
alcohol does alcohol has a lot of long

971
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,529
lasting problems and it says here that

972
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,420
you were abusing other substances so the

973
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:07,069
alcohol was kind of your gateway drug

974
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,289
into some other [ __ ] because once we

975
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:11,299
get drunk we let down our inhibitions or

976
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:12,619
limits we're like I'm already hammered

977
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:15,079
why not just do this other

978
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:16,789
level dumb [ __ ] like I already did level

979
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:19,419
two done [ __ ] let's level three it and

980
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:21,460
it just starts going so it sounds like

981
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,960
having good friends

982
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:26,000
what's that supported you and also

983
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,620
introduced you to cannabis really turned

984
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,420
your life around so man thanks for

985
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:30,439
joining the green team also thanks for

986
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,700
your service once again because it

987
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,019
sounds like you really put it in and it

988
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,940
kind of messed you up so thanks for that

989
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:36,319
thanks for coming out alright and then

990
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,279
thanks for being on Team green with us

991
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,679
we do appreciate that

992
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,119
then he says but I digress which hey

993
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,670
that's just fine for this show this is

994
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,799
the ramble stoner podcast we don't mind

995
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,029
a little digress he said I actually had

996
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:49,909
two questions for you regarding

997
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:53,000
information sources and your opinion on

998
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:54,950
them he said first I enrolled in a

999
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,859
horticulture program at the local

1000
00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:00,049
college but I wanted some more specific

1001
00:33:57,859 --> 00:34:01,639
a some more industry specific education

1002
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:04,308
so I've also enrolled in cannabis

1003
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,870
training University I was wondering if

1004
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:08,480
you've heard of it or if you can shed

1005
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:10,819
your opinion on their master of

1006
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,289
marijuana certificate alright I do have

1007
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,870
a couple things I can touch on there I

1008
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:17,599
feel like the horticulture program at

1009
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:20,029
your local college is going to be more

1010
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,699
useful than your cannabis training

1011
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:25,040
university education cannabis is turning

1012
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:27,319
into a commercially produced crop this

1013
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,239
is commercial horticulture it is a

1014
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,850
higher commodity a higher value

1015
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,398
commercial horticulture product but it

1016
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:36,889
is a horticultural product I think

1017
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,799
taking a horticultural program is going

1018
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:41,450
to be key I do find value in the

1019
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,120
cannabis training University because

1020
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:45,500
you're going to learn specific terms

1021
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,589
hopefully they're teaching you market

1022
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,179
stuff not just like not just grow things

1023
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,700
hopefully you're learning the dispensary

1024
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:54,500
side the terpenes the cannabinoids

1025
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:57,500
hopefully you're learning body

1026
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,849
interaction and stuff like that um then

1027
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,530
you said I was wondering if you've heard

1028
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,569
of it or if you can shed opinion on

1029
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,610
their Master of marijuana certificate

1030
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:07,670
I'm not that sounds a lot like a master

1031
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:11,090
grower certificate that looks really

1032
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:14,269
good on a resume but in social circles

1033
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:17,720
here in V so Colorado kind of has a

1034
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:21,199
group of stuck-up cannabis industry

1035
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:23,899
people the growers breeders industry

1036
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:28,429
folks there's a group of elitists

1037
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:31,970
and they slash we kind of laugh a little

1038
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:33,679
bit at the term master grower its Jen I

1039
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:35,689
know it's just a label it's what your

1040
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,149
paycheck says or it's what your job digs

1041
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,588
and designation says but the term master

1042
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,088
grower here is kind of laughed at that's

1043
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:42,710
kind of a douchey thing to say it's a

1044
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:44,690
bigoted ista cool thing I'm the master

1045
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:47,269
grower over at this facility it just

1046
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,190
sounds really funny to say don't say I'm

1047
00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:50,689
the master grower even if that's your

1048
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,849
title on your paycheck even if that's

1049
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,559
your title and the company in which you

1050
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:56,359
work don't just don't just say leader

1051
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,809
cultivator it sounds a lot better or

1052
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:02,058
grow manager anyway I digress at this

1053
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:04,400
point it looks really good on a resume

1054
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:06,200
and if you were learning and you can

1055
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,440
actually apply what you were learning it

1056
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:11,868
is great but in social situations it's a

1057
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,880
little bit awkward so put that on a

1058
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:16,249
resume that will be helpful that will

1059
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,289
help you out I don't know enough about

1060
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:19,639
their curriculum to know what they're

1061
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:20,960
teaching you I don't know if they're

1062
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:22,489
teaching you how to grow I don't know if

1063
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,108
they're teaching you how to clone I

1064
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:25,669
don't know if they're teaching you the

1065
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:26,900
evolution of the market I'm not sure

1066
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:29,119
what you're learning there hopefully

1067
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,160
it's a broad education and it's not just

1068
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,769
too focused if it's gross stuff you'll

1069
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:35,509
learn more through just getting in a

1070
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:38,209
grow in doing it and by taking that

1071
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:40,248
horticultural program at the college but

1072
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:42,710
it's gonna look really good on a resume

1073
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:44,659
if I were hiring that would say hey this

1074
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,670
guy took a little extra and probably

1075
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,690
already knows how to cut clone so I

1076
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,338
don't have to teach him how to cut

1077
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,409
clones he probably already knows what

1078
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:53,420
micro and macro nutrients are he

1079
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,429
hopefully has a little bit of pesticide

1080
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,970
training that comes with that I really

1081
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:57,348
don't know

1082
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:58,578
but I would assume that you have a

1083
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:00,829
little advanced training so it's gonna

1084
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:03,230
look good on our resume so that may come

1085
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:04,700
in handy but as for the curriculum and

1086
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,469
what you've learned I really don't know

1087
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:09,230
what they teach there so I don't really

1088
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:11,118
have an opinion but any education looks

1089
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,380
good on a resume when I'm hiring and I

1090
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,239
would ask you questions about it while

1091
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,890
we were in the interview room so the

1092
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,480
second question says I want to become

1093
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:19,548
more knowledgeable on as many different

1094
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,230
strains as possible and I was wondering

1095
00:37:19,548 --> 00:37:24,018
where you thought I should look for

1096
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:27,019
reliable info is Leafly a good source

1097
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:30,618
and if not any light you can shed would

1098
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:33,229
be great now Leafly is a decent source

1099
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:34,999
Leafly is not the best source but they

1100
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,099
have a lot of strains there and they do

1101
00:37:34,998 --> 00:37:37,849
their research pretty well they've

1102
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:39,500
actually got a cup

1103
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:42,769
of my strains up there and they pulled

1104
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,659
the descriptions from magazine articles

1105
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:46,219
and websites that featured my stuff and

1106
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:48,649
they got it accurate I think what they

1107
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:50,329
put is mostly accurate my Kabletown is

1108
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,180
up there and lemon Jeffrey is up there

1109
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:54,529
and soon a rise should be listed up on

1110
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:56,509
leaf Lee if you guys haven't gone and

1111
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,800
submitted a rise for a strain review on

1112
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,780
lethally please do that I've done a

1113
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,880
whole episode on the arize strain I'd

1114
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,040
appreciate the support there but leaf

1115
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,780
Lee is not a bad source of information I

1116
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:08,210
like what I do like about leaf Lee is

1117
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,630
that you can read customer reviews on

1118
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:13,429
how it treated people if somebody bought

1119
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,780
lemon Jeffrey you can see that people

1120
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:16,759
wrote this is the best cannabis I've

1121
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,130
ever smoked and this relieved my anxiety

1122
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,470
and people list things I like that

1123
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,789
however when things are crowd-sourced

1124
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:25,489
there's the opportunity for

1125
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:27,619
misinformation so it's great on one hand

1126
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:29,839
it could be a problem on the other you

1127
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:32,089
sound like an intelligent person the

1128
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,620
Internet is a great tool for people who

1129
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:37,010
are smart enough to filter out the

1130
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:38,779
[ __ ] so I would start it Leafly then

1131
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:42,410
I would venture out to other web sites

1132
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:44,420
like seed finder dot-eu seed finder is a

1133
00:38:42,409 --> 00:38:46,730
great website that lists most of the

1134
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,440
major brands and it's got like a family

1135
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:51,289
tree if you want to learn about a strain

1136
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,670
you type in we're just gonna say lemon

1137
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:54,829
Jeffrey because that's where my brain is

1138
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,960
type in lemon Jeffrey it'll show you

1139
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:59,329
that lemon Jeffrey is a cross of golden

1140
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,220
go and lemon skunk then on the same page

1141
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:03,710
it's also gonna show you that that

1142
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:05,689
golden goat is a cross of Hawaiian sweet

1143
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:08,059
skunk or Island sweet skunk Hawaiian

1144
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:10,010
sativa and Romulan then right under that

1145
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,869
it's gonna show you that lemon skunk is

1146
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:15,080
a cross of this and this and then it's

1147
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:17,779
gonna keep breaking it down for like 25

1148
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:20,480
or 30 lines so you can see the breakdown

1149
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:23,840
the lineage way back and see how it was

1150
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,940
made so I like seed finder EU for doing

1151
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,490
research on strains and finding what

1152
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,369
crosses are and finding the genetic

1153
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:34,339
lineage of things also I like going to

1154
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:36,019
seed vending websites like if you wanted

1155
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,160
to buy some IRA genetics seeds or you

1156
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:38,539
wanted to know something about IRA

1157
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:40,190
genetics if you go to the hella dank

1158
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:41,630
seed company and just click on the

1159
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,700
strains that are available there and

1160
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,260
they should have pretty good

1161
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:46,789
descriptions because they want to sell

1162
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,440
that and they've got a relationship with

1163
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:49,230
the breeder so the breeder probably told

1164
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,820
them that

1165
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,800
this and this and these are the details

1166
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,350
so they've usually got fairly good

1167
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,300
information most of the time with that

1168
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:59,429
same caveat that it's the internet and

1169
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,960
you've got to be smart at filtering

1170
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:02,849
through the [ __ ] on the internet now

1171
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,858
another place that I can highly

1172
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:06,868
recommend to do research on genetics is

1173
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:09,389
breeder websites if you know what

1174
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:11,430
breeder created that strain go to their

1175
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:13,019
website now not all the breeders have an

1176
00:40:11,429 --> 00:40:14,549
up-to-date website my website looks like

1177
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,969
[ __ ] not all of my current strains are

1178
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,670
up there

1179
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:18,929
I am not versed in internet stuff I've

1180
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,490
got a couple of friends that do that

1181
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:22,919
that are working on it for me it will be

1182
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:24,719
updated I focus on the grow I focus on

1183
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,700
the podcast my website looks like [ __ ] I

1184
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,929
am sorry but some of the more

1185
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,819
established and guys that have been

1186
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:31,649
longer around for a longer time they've

1187
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,080
got great websites sub cool has a great

1188
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,880
website greenhouse seeds has a great

1189
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,799
website of course DNA genetics has an

1190
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,329
amazing website folks like that have

1191
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,039
great websites you can rely on the

1192
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:42,599
breeder website because we're putting

1193
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,630
the info up there ourselves

1194
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:48,679
and why would that be wrong so Leafly is

1195
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:52,940
not a bad place to check out strains

1196
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:55,409
seed finder dot edu breeder websites and

1197
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,929
vending websites the places that sell

1198
00:40:55,409 --> 00:41:00,629
seeds holidaying seed company i don't

1199
00:40:57,929 --> 00:41:02,789
endorse buying seeds from overseas but

1200
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,829
the atitude seed bank has all the new

1201
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:05,940
[ __ ] listed if you want to go see what

1202
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,289
they've got listed there you can

1203
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,950
probably find a lot of genetic

1204
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:13,409
information there but again always

1205
00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:14,789
cross-reference your research when

1206
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:17,819
you're working with cannabis because

1207
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:19,590
people are stoned and people will

1208
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,650
believe [ __ ] anything honestly if I

1209
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:25,530
told you I got this clone from DJ Shore

1210
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:28,108
and DJ short got that clone from edy

1211
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:30,000
Rosenthal in 1972 and then I took that

1212
00:41:28,108 --> 00:41:32,400
clone and I bred it to wedding cake

1213
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,630
yesterday and I've gave you seeds you're

1214
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,599
gonna believe it people will believe

1215
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:38,400
[ __ ] anything so people are really go

1216
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,380
about and you can tell them anything so

1217
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,970
the stories get really convoluted and

1218
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,470
[ __ ] gets really convoluted and

1219
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:45,750
distorted in the cannabis industry and

1220
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:47,579
there's a lot of egos and dick swinging

1221
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,349
a dick slinging and [ __ ] talking and

1222
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:50,789
backstabbing so stories get mixed up a

1223
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:53,309
lot so if you want to know about

1224
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:55,170
genetics get as close to the breeder as

1225
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:56,730
you can for the information because the

1226
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:59,039
closer you are to the source the less

1227
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:01,289
that telephone game has been played like

1228
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,920
by the time you say it's a it's a

1229
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:05,710
blueberry cookies s1

1230
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:08,500
then somebody else says it's a blueberry

1231
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,639
cross two cookies and it's a r1 so

1232
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,630
they've already [ __ ] it up you know

1233
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:13,750
what I mean and then you're like yeah

1234
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:15,490
it's blueberry cookies - that's a

1235
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,719
blueberry cross - cookies it's an f-1

1236
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:18,039
and you're like oh now it's really

1237
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,298
changing it just takes three or four

1238
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:20,798
conversations before you've got a

1239
00:42:19,298 --> 00:42:22,179
totally different cross with different

1240
00:42:20,798 --> 00:42:23,409
traits and different colors and a

1241
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:24,669
totally different conversation with

1242
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:26,108
somebody who's never seen or grown the

1243
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,568
plant that's just how the cannabis

1244
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:31,900
industry works so I hope we do a lot of

1245
00:42:28,568 --> 00:42:34,329
research and cross-reference things but

1246
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,940
Leafly seed finder breeder websites and

1247
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:39,579
of course vendor websites are great

1248
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:41,139
places to do research and it just

1249
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:43,390
occurred to me that I should not

1250
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:44,710
overlook the power of social media if

1251
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:46,598
you want to know about the newest

1252
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,880
hottest most current strain that came

1253
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:51,490
out today social media is where you're

1254
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,079
gonna find that so I would follow some

1255
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:55,779
of the bigger accounts on social media

1256
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:57,730
follow all the guys I mentioned DNA

1257
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:59,170
genetics greenhouse seeds maybe you

1258
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,068
don't support them maybe you're not into

1259
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,838
what they've got but if you're

1260
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:03,429
interested in genetics those are the

1261
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,068
guys to follow and then once you follow

1262
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:08,019
DNA genetics greenhouse seeds TGA sub

1263
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:09,099
cool all the other seed breeders are

1264
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:11,650
gonna start popping up in your

1265
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:13,900

1267
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:20,170
like coma guys like the jungle boys and

1268
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:21,699
there are probably 10 or 20 new breeders

1269
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:23,740
that just popped up on Instagram just

1270
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:25,088

brand new hype [ __ ] if you want to stay

1273
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:29,890
on top of all the brand new current

1274
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:31,808
strains but it sounds like you're a

1275
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:33,308
really intelligent person and it sounds

1276
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,269
like you know how to do research and it

1277
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:37,480
sounds like you know what you're looking

1278
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:39,400

and I think you're gonna be a great

1281
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:47,470
asset to the cannabis industry once it

1282
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:49,119
becomes a viable option where you are so

1283
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:50,469
he wraps up the email and he says thank

1284
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,119
you again for all that you do for the

1285
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:54,429
industry it's very uncommon these days

1286
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:57,548
for people to share information so

1287
00:43:54,429 --> 00:43:59,289
valuable free of charge you are truly an

1288
00:43:57,548 --> 00:44:01,630
inspiration hey man thanks for the huge

1289
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:03,519
compliment thank you for listening it is

1290
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,410
free because I feel like if I didn't do

1291
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,809
this podcast I might explode something

1292
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:09,308
would go wrong I've been a musician for

1293
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:11,980
most of my life and I feel like if I

1294
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:14,470
don't play music every so often that I

1295
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,389

bred a couple of new strains there's a

1315
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:53,899
pair of strains in there called bebop

1316
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:55,548
and rocksteady one of my friends got a

1317
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,200
pack of the bebop and a pack of the

1318
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:59,748
Rocksteady and grew it out and they were

1319
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:02,509
happy with the results so they were kind

1320
00:44:59,748 --> 00:45:04,939
enough to paint me a picture of bebop

1321
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:06,679

me right now you can tell they're nice

1323

00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,228
weed leaves but it looks exactly like

1325
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:13,910
