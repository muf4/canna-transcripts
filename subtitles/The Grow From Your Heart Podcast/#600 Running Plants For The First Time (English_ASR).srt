so thank you to everybody and to all of

79
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,199
the patreon contributors 600 episodes

80
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,919
you guys i never imagined it would get

81
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,719
this far

82
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,479
and honestly i see no end in sight you

83
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,080
guys are only sending me better content

84
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,959
better questions the interactions are

85
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,800
much better

86
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
uh you guys are becoming better growers

87
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,920
i've got to see people

88
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,439
evolve as growers from the knowledge

89
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,759
they've learned from this show so thank

90
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,919
you

91
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,679
this does mean a lot to me and i do not

92
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,439
plan on stopping

93
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
i'm glad that all of the holiday

94
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,959
[ __ ] is over we are back to normal

95
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,560
here things are calming down

96
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
the podcast will kind of settle down

97
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,878
we'll get back to the normal podcasting

98
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,400
schedule

99
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,919
i didn't miss an episode but i know that

100
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,879
some of the episodes were short some of

101
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,479
them were brief

102
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,639
i have been skipping the patreon

103
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,799
questions there is a reason for that

104
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,318
i feel like everybody was on vacation

105
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,680
they were on a christmas holiday

106
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,919
and a lot of people weren't able to

107
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,640
listen to the podcast uh however their

108
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,399
regularly

109
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,079
scheduled podcasting listening was

110
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,439
happening they may have had a lot of

111
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,879
family around they may not have been at

112
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,000
work they may have been off schedule

113
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,840
just like i was

114
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,280
so i didn't put your patreon questions

115
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,800
in the past few episodes because i

116
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
didn't want to waste those questions and

117
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,519
people miss them

118
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,959
so that is why the patreon stuff has

119
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,760
been getting skipped in the next few

120
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,120
episodes

121
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,479
we will focus heavily on patreon content

122
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,759
that way the people that did pay for

123
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,959
those questions they won't miss it

124
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,560
they'll get their answers

125
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,479
and they also got their time with their

126
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,759
family during the holidays i hope i made

127
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,639
that nice and clear i think i said that

128
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,079
in another show

129
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,839
wanted to make sure you understand why

130
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
the patreon questions have been getting

131
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,598
overlooked for a couple of shows

132
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,839
now let's jump into the main topic of

133
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,079
today's podcast this may be a quick show

134
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,400
but in the last episode i did talk about

135
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,000
running our plants on an 18-6

136
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
light schedule at the end of flower if

137
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,639
you didn't listen to the last episode

138
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,839
i'll recap that and tell you why i

139
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,238
recommend that

140
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,840
most of us put our plants on a 12 12

141
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,599
flowering light cycle that means the

142
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,319
plants are the lights are on for 12

143
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:51,919
hours a day

144
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,238
they're off for 12 hours a day this

145
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,399
triggers our plants to go into flower

146
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,438
that is basic grow knowledge a lot of

147
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,560
people will do an 11

148
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,598
13 cycle that came from dj short that 11

149
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,759
13 cycle

150
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,280
in my opinion in dj short's opinion as

151
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,199
well will give us better

152
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,479
phenotypical expression if we're looking

153
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,399
for different phenotypes

154
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,158
from a package of seeds we want to see

155
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,360
the variations from this seed and this

156
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,719
seed a little more

157
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,160
defined that 11 13 cycle in my opinion

158
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,040
in dj's experience

159
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,639
will show us more variation more

160
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,160
potential from each plant

161
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,759
so if you're running a population of

162
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,680
plants you may not want

163
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,879
the one that grows real tall and skinny

164
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,160
you may not want the one that's real

165
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,040
short and stout you may want the one

166
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,040
that's right in the middle

167
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,319
we run a phenol hunt to find the one

168
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,680
that is perfect for us

169
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,519
in that 11 13 schedule you may see more

170
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
expression from your plants

171
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,120
now let's jump to the 18 6 part the

172
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,519
reason i recommend

173
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
to turn our timer back to 18-6 for the

174
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,279
last seven to ten days of flower

175
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,199
is because light is the number one

176
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,519
source of energy for our plants

177
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,360
light contributes encourages growth

178
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,240
contributes to all of the photosynthesis

179
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
of our plants

180
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
when the plants are awake they're

181
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,038
photosynthesizing they're getting

182
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,038
beefier and fatter and they're growing

183
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,319
with that more light energy if you go

184
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,839
from 12 12 to 18

185
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,839
six you're getting six more hours of

186
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,198
light every day that's that much more

187
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,799
light energy they'll get bigger they'll

188
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,439
get beefier they'll get fatter

189
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,759
and also they may ripen up a little bit

190
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,600
earlier because of that extra light

191
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,439
now a lot of people are going to say

192
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,680
won't that [ __ ] my plants up if i run

193
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,918
them on 18 6 at the end

194
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,879
your plants eventually will start to

195
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,879
re-veg

196
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,399
but we're flushing and preparing for

197
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,399
harvest already

198
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,478
so if we see any sign of that reveg

199
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,478
happening we chop down right then

200
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,159
usually that reveg is going to take 14

201
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,159
to 20 days to begin the process

202
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,360
we're going to cut down 10 to 14 days in

203
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,039
this process

204
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,639
we should never get to the point of

205
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,560
reveg now

206
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,240
here's something that i should mention

207
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,120
if you're doing a phenol hunt

208
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,000
don't do this 18-6 stuff a phenol hunt

209
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,399
should be ran

210
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,079
as a phenohunt we want that to be done

211
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,519
scientifically if this is your first

212
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,199
time with a strain if you're doing a

213
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,079
phenohunt if you've never run this clone

214
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,038
before

215
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,879
don't do the 18.6 we need to learn our

216
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,318
plants the first time we run them

217
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,639
we're just getting introduced to these

218
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,879
plants we just met this plant we need to

219
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
learn it see what it likes don't do that

220
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,399
18-6 at the end because you don't even

221
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,199
know how long the plant should take to

222
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,279
flower

223
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,199
how do you know when to initiate 18-6

224
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,519
how do you know when to initiate flush

225
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
if you don't even know how long these

226
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,799
plants take to flower so

227
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,638
when you have a new plant if it's a

228
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,120
seedling if it's a clone

229
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,879
don't do a bunch of random experiments

230
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,918
to it run your first plant under

231
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,478
scientific

232
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,599
expectations scientific conditions do

233
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,680
everything the same

234
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
to your new plants you may be growing a

235
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
plant that could be

236
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,319
absolutely the best plant ever but you

237
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,240
did some experiment to it

238
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,160
that thwarted its growth that slowed

239
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,759
down its potential and it was your fault

240
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,400
that that plant didn't get to the best

241
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,759
it could be

242
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,120
and now you're gonna call it because you

243
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,160
think it's a runt or you think it's

244
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
shitty

245
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,360
you're the one that did some weird [ __ ]

246
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,639
to it and caused that problem

247
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,639
so let's give these plants the

248
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,400
opportunity set the plants up for

249
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
success just like we do ourselves give

250
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,239
the plants the opportunity

251
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,319
to shine treat your new plants

252
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
scientifically have a regimen for new

253
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,919
plants don't try new experiments

254
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,598
don't think i got these new seeds i'm

255
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,399
gonna switch to a different soil this

256
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,079
time

257
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,598
what how do you know what to expect from

258
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,639
that soil how do you know what to expect

259
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:16,319
from those plants

260
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
what if those seeds grow like [ __ ] maybe

261
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,840
it's that new soil what if they grow

262
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,000
amazingly maybe it's that new soil

263
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,879
let's not have too many variables for

264
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,439
new plants

265
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,439
and also don't expect too much from that

266
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,199
first run this first run is not going to

267
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,680
be gold we are learning the plants you

268
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,759
should have

269
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,598
quality plants a quality harvest but

270
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,639
that second and third run is when you're

271
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,199
really looking

272
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,478
to reach goals and break limits and have

273
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,960
impressive cannabis

274
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,839
that first run it's the first date don't

275
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,279
expect to

276
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,719
everybody doesn't put out on the first

277
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,519
date the first date is not always

278
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,120
successful

279
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,959
we need a couple of dates a couple of

280
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,639
experiences to get to know this lady

281
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,239
and make sure we satisfy this lady so

282
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,759
that it can satisfy us

283
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,598
get to learn your plans um

284
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
when we're finding we're looking for

285
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,478
phenotypes here we're looking for the

286
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,598
males we're looking for the females if

287
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,639
you're running from seed you could have

288
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,319
a male seed

289
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,478
let's not do a bunch of experiments and

290
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,560
a bunch of training and lollipopping

291
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,399
to a male plant you could have a boy in

292
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,759
there let's focus on females

293
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,279
we're learning the harvest times of

294
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,960
these plants we're learning nutrient

295
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,399
preferences do they need a lot of calmag

296
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,000
do they need a lot of nitrogen

297
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,598
do they get mad if you get them too much

298
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,199
cow mag some plants don't want a lot of

299
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,120
calmag later in flower

300
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,560
we've got to learn these plants the

301
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,478
first time we're running them

302
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,759
we've got to learn temperature and

303
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,598
humidity and vpd

304
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,520
preferences i've got some plants that

305
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,278
want it really really dry i've got some

306
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,918
plants that would prefer a really moist

307
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:35,679
climate

308
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,598
i've got some plants that i only water

309
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,278
every other time when i water the rest

310
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,080
of my garden because they prefer a

311
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,200
really really

312
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,800
dry soil base so it's all about learning

313
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,480
that plant if you're running a bunch of

314
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,759
plants all at once can you learn each

315
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,680
plant individually

316
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,200
i don't know if you really can so the

317
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,639
first time you're running a plant let's

318
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
focus if it's a seedling

319
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,480
if it's a batch of seeds if it's a clone

320
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,399
let's focus on learning that plant

321
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,120
before we do a bunch of crazy tricks and

322
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,799
[ __ ] to it

323
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,799
let's not get too scientific too

324
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,479
experimental you need to learn

325
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,079
when to harvest that plant how do you

326
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
know when to start flushing that plant

327
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,560
how do you know

328
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,399
if you're going to do 18.6 how do you

329
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,919
know when to start that we don't know

330
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,958
any of that stuff the first time we're

331
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,399
running plants so

332
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,399
my advice to you is the first time

333
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,159
you're running it build a relationship

334
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,000
with that plant let that plant show you

335
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,958
what it wants to do before you force

336
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,480
things upon

337
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:26,159
that plant um also a lot of times when

338
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
it's the first time i run a plant

339
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,679
if the breeder said it'll be done in 60

340
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
days i'm going to go

341
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,039
70. i want to see what happens at the

342
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,719
end of flower

343
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,399
a lot of plants will beef up at the end

344
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,440
of flower they'll put on that extra bit

345
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,519
of weight

346
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,120
then we add that 18 6 once we know the

347
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,799
plant and we can get that extra

348
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,240
extra bit of weight but how do you know

349
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,439
what the plant does naturally if we

350
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,120
don't run it once

351
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,640
without doing a bunch of tricks and

352
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,039
crazy weird [ __ ] to it

353
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,000
let that plant be itself let it grow for

354
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,159
the final hunt

355
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,759
once you've selected a keeper then you

356
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,360
can manipulate it you can [ __ ] with it

357
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,480
you can do all of your weird magic that

358
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,320
you want to do to it

359
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,159
you can impose your will on it but the

360
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,200
first time let that plant show you what

361
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,078
it does

362
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,680
um some plants frost up at the end if we

363
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,919
cut it down too early if we don't let

364
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,759
that plant go that extra 10 days

365
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,120
we may not even know that it gets super

366
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,919
frosty at the end

367
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,278
some plants put on beautiful colors

368
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,958
toward the end of flower and if you cut

369
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,120
it down at day 63

370
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,000
and that color happens at day 70 you may

371
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,839
never know it

372
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,440
so the first time you're running a plant

373
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,920
i would recommend going a little bit

374
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,480
longer and not messing with it let it go

375
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,599
5 10 maybe 12 extra days based on what

376
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,519
the breeder says

377
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,360
i know you're in a hurry i know you want

378
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,278
to get this crop down but

379
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,039
this is not the last crop you're going

380
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,799
to grow hopefully hopefully this is

381
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,879
the first crop and hopefully it's the

382
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,319
first date and if that first date goes

383
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,759
well you get a second date

384
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
by the third and fourth date you've got

385
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,039
some sort of rapport some sort of

386
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,480
relationship you've learned each other

387
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,078
do that with your plants let's not

388
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,039
expect the plants to put out on the

389
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,838
first date

390
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,519
let's learn them develop a relationship

391
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,000
learn what that plant wants so we can

392
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,120
satisfy that plant before we expect it

393
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,360
to satisfy us that being said

394
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,720
the first time we're running seeds let's

395
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,639
not veg them forever

396
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,480
i see people running brand new seeds in

397
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,039
seven gallon pots and they flip it into

398
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,720
flour

399
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,919
after like 60 days of vegging and

400
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,879
they're pissed off that they've got a

401
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,519
male

402
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,278
bro we should have found out way before

403
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
then if we had males or females don't

404
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,439
waste time and space and energy on big

405
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,200
ass

406
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,720
plants if you don't even know if you've

407
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,278
got a male or a female

408
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,079
that first run should be a small test

409
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,159
phenohunt

410
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,919
run this is an audition don't spend all

411
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,958
your money all your time all your energy

412
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,278
all your space

413
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,719
on the very first run that is not a

414
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,000
successful way to do it you're going to

415
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,959
disappoint yourself

416
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,639
if you've got 10 seeds probably five of

417
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,479
them are males so if you don't put them

418
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,039
in small pots and identify the males

419
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,800
early

420
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,319
you're already wasting space five of

421
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,120
them are going to get eliminated maybe

422
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,560
six of them

423
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,159
i've seen people come up with three

424
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,759
females from a pack of 10 before it's

425
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,600
all about the numbers game

426
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,039
most likely you're going to get 50 50.

427
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,879
so expect 50

428
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,120
of your plants to be cold before we even

429
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,519
get into the flowering phase

430
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,959
then what if you got a bunch of junk

431
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,200
what you're so you're gonna get

432
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,319
five males then maybe you get five

433
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
females hopefully

434
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,000
then you've got two phenotypes that are

435
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
gonna be like oh man those are the ones

436
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
there's always one that's real tall one

437
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,399
that's real short one that smells real

438
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,240
good

439
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,919
one that's super frosty and then one

440
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
that's kind of got all the traits but

441
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,319
you wish it had one trait a little bit

442
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,839
more

443
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
so there's always that gamble when it

444
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,800
comes to phenol hunt you've got to find

445
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
the one that you want is what i'm

446
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,679
getting at

447
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,560
find the plant that you want don't waste

448
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,078
a bunch of time

449
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,000
growing males don't waste a bunch of

450
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,919
time doing experiments and [ __ ]

451
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,679
get them growing flower them find the

452
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,799
keeper have a clone of that then the

453
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,078
next time you run

454
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,838
that's when we're going to start doing

455
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,278
tricks that's when we start manipulating

456
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,600
we've got the plant we want

457
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,958
we've got the keeper for our grow now we

458
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,560
can do tricks to it but

459
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,239
let the plants show you who they are

460
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,199
before you start manipulating them

461
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,959
in that first run now here's something

462
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,240
that a lot of people have been asking me

463
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,159
a lot of questions about

464
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,320
and i've kind of changed the direction i

465
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,559
go when i give advice on this

466
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,959
a lot of people say hey i bought a pack

467
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,039
of this strain and they've got my seeds

468
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,039
and they want to say which phenotype am

469
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,799
i looking for

470
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,639
i don't know i don't know which

471
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,399
phenotype you're looking for because i

472
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,919
don't know what kind of grow you've got

473
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,559
i don't know what kind of smoke you're

474
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,360
expecting

475
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,039
i don't know i don't know what you want

476
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
i know that you may have a pack of lemon

477
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,879
jeffree

478
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,879
there are a couple of desirable

479
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,879
phenotypes in there but if i say you

480
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,799
want the one that grows in 70 days

481
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,799
that smells like lemon candy that takes

482
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,479
a lot of nutrients and gets real tall

483
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,479
i may be setting you up for failure

484
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,240
because maybe your grow has a short

485
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,399
ceiling height and now the phenotype

486
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,959
that i want is not going to work in your

487
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,720
grow

488
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,239
so the whole idea of buying a pack of

489
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,079
seeds and doing that final hunt is

490
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,320
finding the phenotype that works best

491
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,239
for you uh you don't want to go to

492
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,000
dinner with me i'm a vegetarian

493
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,159
i like spicy food and i drink a lot of

494
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
kombucha unless you're into spicy food

495
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,799
in kombucha you don't want me ordering

496
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,879
your meal

497
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,559
when we go to the restaurant we want the

498
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,919
we both wanted italian food that's why

499
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,278
we went to the italian restaurant we've

500
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,879
got a guideline here we know that

501
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,399
there's italian food in there

502
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,240
now we've got to narrow it down off the

503
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,839
menu and get the italian food for me and

504
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,240
the italian food for you

505
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,360
don't make me pick your italian food

506
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,440
like i may pick

507
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,399
white sauce and real garlicky pasta and

508
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,240
you may have just been

509
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,000
right in the mood for a red sauce and

510
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,278
something a little more not garlicy

511
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,958
what's the word for it anyway

512
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,720
more acidic with that red sauce is what

513
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,078
you were in the mood for we may want

514
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,600
completely different things and they

515
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,198
both fall under the umbrella

516
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,879
of lemon jeffrey they both fall under

517
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,958
the umbrella of italian food

518
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,320
so you make your selection don't let me

519
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,638
choose for you

520
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
i'll give you recommendations and ideas

521
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,560
of what to look for

522
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,320
but that phenotype is not up to me that

523
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,439
is up to you that is up to your garden

524
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,278
do you want the one that

525
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
takes 70 days to grow because i like

526
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,078
those longer finishing plants i think

527
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,278
they get a little more potency i think

528
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:48,879
they put on more weight

529
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,320
i appreciate a long flowering plant

530
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,078
maybe you're too impatient maybe you

531
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,079
need that 60-day finisher

532
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,198
so don't rely on me to select a

533
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,439
phenotype for you

534
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,198
grow the plants the one that screams and

535
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,880
sings at you is the one that you want

536
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,319
it's a lot like dating you're going to

537
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,919
find the one you'll know

538
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,360
if it's not the one for you you guys

539
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,639
will let each other know if it is the

540
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,600
one for you you're going to feel it

541
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,399
you're going to know it

542
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,560
so base your phenotypical selections off

543
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,039
of the plants that work best for you

544
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,479
not best for me i've done a lot of work

545
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,679
to narrow down the phenotypes that are

546
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
going to come out in the out of the

547
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,000
seeds

548
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,160
i've given you a lot of guidance on what

549
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,879
to expect now you've got to select the

550
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,159
phenotype

551
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,240
that works best for you and i've said

552
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,799
this a moment ago this first run with

553
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,879
the plants

554
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,639
is an audition run this is not the last

555
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,759
run you get with these plants this is

556
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
the first date

557
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,600
let's grow them let's see if we even get

558
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,198
along let's see how the outcome goes at

559
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,120
the end of the flowering cycle

560
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,719
chop them down smoke them there might be

561
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,560
one in there that is amazing there might

562
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,040
be four out of those 10 that are useless

563
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,879
to you

564
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,399
you will know exactly which one you want

565
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,919
grow that one again

566
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,519
that is when we're going to start doing

567
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,838
all of the tricks

568
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,360
that's when you can run the 11 13 light

569
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,759
cycle if you want to that's when you can

570
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,360
run the 186 light cycle if you want to

571
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,879
that's when you can lollipop them that's

572
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,159
when you can trellis them that's when

573
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,000
you can work them into a net

574
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,759
but let's not waste all that time space

575
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,639
and energy on brand new plants that we

576
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,079
don't even know

577
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,600
what we're messing with we could have

578
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,919
all males we could have a bunch of

579
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,800
hermaphrodites we could have a bunch of

580
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,599
weird mutant plants or you could have

581
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,439
amazing

582
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,959
keepers so that is my quick rant on

583
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,480
phenotypical selection

584
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,919
this is going to be a quick episode i'm

585
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,120
not going to ramble on and add more to

586
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,360
it unnecessarily

587
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,600
