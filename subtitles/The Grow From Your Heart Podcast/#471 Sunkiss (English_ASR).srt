00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,600
too much time in this episode I did say

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,610
that I wanted to do a strain review

46
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,258
let's talk about one of my favorite

47
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,790
strains that I have bred also a strain

48
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,679
that is getting really popular lately

49
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:17,188
let's talk about a cross that

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,099
I call Sunkiss what is sun kiss Sun kiss

51
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:22,139
is a cross of a female Platinum tangi

52
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,459
plant Platinum tangi comes from our

53
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,929
friends at the garden of Weeden big

54
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,878
shout out to Maddie and Spence and the

55
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,620

good dogs I miss you guys anyway the

60
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,238
platinum tan G is of course a platinum

61
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:41,878
cookies that is a Platinum Girl Scout

62
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,060
cookies female pollinated by a male

63
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:47,068
tangey plant that was named Julius that

64
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,669
was selected by Spence from the garden

65
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:49,530
of Weeden

66
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:51,900
so they pollinated the Platinum cookies

67
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,598
with the pollen from Julius and that

68
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,908
created the Platinum tangi the Platinum

69
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,738
tan G is a wonderful plant I came across

70
00:02:56,908 --> 00:03:00,479
this plant in a commercial cultivation

71
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,430
it had been selected by somebody else

72
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,810
but they did a great job with the

73
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,359
selection it was a very good

74
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,968
representation of both parents it had

75
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,969
that cookies growth the cookies potency

76
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:14,098
but had that stink and that vigor of the

77
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:16,438
tangi it didn't take too long to flower

78
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:18,388
that plant was very pest resistant it

79
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:20,340
was very easy to grow it always gave

80
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:22,379
impressive test results impressive

81
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,739
harvest and the aromas and flavors were

82
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:28,318
very unique very orange dominant flavors

83
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,389
in that cross so Spence and Maddie did a

84
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,068
wonderful job breeding it whoever did

85
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:34,500
the phenotype selection did a wonderful

86
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:36,208
job with the selection I came across it

87
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,340
in a commercial facility and quickly

88
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,049
fell in love with it I acquired a cut

89
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,969
and I introduced that cut of the

90
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,680
Platinum tangi into my garden I began

91
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,258
playing with it and I've read it to

92
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,319
several things in this case we are going

93
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:50,429
to talk about breeding it to the arize

94
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,758
everybody knows I work with a strain

95
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,790
called arise arise comes from a golden

96
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:58,619
goat female pollinated by a Daybreaker

97
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:00,239
male Daybreaker is not a well known

98
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,829
strain so we'll talk about Daybreaker

99
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,519
briefly Daybreaker

100
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:08,250
is a Kim D female pollinated by a joseph

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,039
OG male so you've got chem dog and OG

102
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,799
cushion they're super stinky super funky

103
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,978
really nice vigorous growth big fat wide

104
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,348
leaves kind of short stocky plants I put

105
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,500
that pollen onto a golden goat female

106
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:25,680
that made crazy plants I that is called

107
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,649
a rise that tests really high in THC it

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,720
grows with high

109
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:30,370
vigor it is just a wonderful plant to

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,639
work with the aromas and flavors are

111
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,149
great

112
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,788
I found a male out of my arise breeding

113
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:39,310
project that I have named King Solomon I

114
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:40,659
have made many crosses from King Solomon

115
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,329
and they all have proven to be

116
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,610
tremendous crosses anything Solomon

117
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:47,109
touches it just improves it if you've

118
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,509
got a plant in this case that makes

119
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,699
amazing orange Terps and is very pests

120
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:53,889
and pathogens istant and is very easy to

121
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,288
grow you pollinate it with Solomon and

122
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,629
all of those traits were amplified it is

123
00:04:56,288 --> 00:05:00,728
more potent it is easier to grow it has

124
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:03,430
more rapid vigour it just seems to

125
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:07,180
improve everything so I took my prized

126
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:09,879
King Solomon my arise male plant and I

127
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,250
sprinkled that magic dust all over that

128
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,399
female platinum tangi and that created

129
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,990
what I have called Sun kiss now I'm sure

130
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,659
you can assume with the name like Sun

131
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,579
kiss we are going to have tremendous

132
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,830
orange dominant Terps that is one of the

133
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:25,810
most noticeable things about this cross

134
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,629
we'll talk about that in just a minute

135
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,410
let's focus more on the growth

136
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:31,300
characteristics of this plant we've

137
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,180
talked about the cross it is a platinum

138
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,939
tangi cross to arise the Platinum tangi

139
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,740
plant stays fairly short that platinum

140
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,329
tangi plant didn't get real big it

141
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,978
didn't have a giant main Cola

142
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:43,959
it grows fairly even it does have a

143
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:45,939
dominant main apical top but it wasn't

144
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,158
that giant glory bud like a lot of

145
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:50,110
plants get most of the buds stayed even

146
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:52,060
and uniform which makes it great for a

147
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,400
commercial environment so that's part of

148
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,889
why I selected it i bred it to the arize

149
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,019
the arize is known to grow very quickly

150
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,639
it will get kind of tall on you I

151
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:02,978
figured this would even out that

152
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,360
shortness to that hyper vigor I would

153
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:07,269
add them together and it would just make

154
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,500
a normal speed growth plant and it

155
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:10,810
worked beautifully

156
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,418
many of the phenotypes that come from

157
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,819
the Sun kiss stay shorter and a little

158
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:18,069
bit whiter and when you flower them they

159
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,228
don't have that amazing stretch that a

160
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:21,610
lot of plants have a lot of plants when

161
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:23,439
he flipped them into flower for about

162
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,960
three weeks they're really going to take

163
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,848
off the Sun kiss does not stretch as

164
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,029
hard as a lot of other plants so that's

165
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:32,589
really advantageous for most grows she

166
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:34,209
does grow a little bit wider than some

167
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:35,888
plants you may need a little bit more

168
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:37,810
space if most of the time you give your

169
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,120
plants a two foot Center you may need a

170
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,860
three foot center if you

171
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,418
before you may need a 6 if you're

172
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,280
starting with 6 you may need to go 8

173
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:46,079
feet with a sun-kissed plant you're

174
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,789
gonna get a little bit wider growth than

175
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,339
what you're used to but that is great

176
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,530
because that means more production most

177
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:54,299
of us are limited by plant counts how

178
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,829
many plants we can grow is dictated by

179
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,180
our local government by our local

180
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:59,069
medical cannabis laws if you're a

181
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,780
personal home grower so we need to keep

182
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:02,459
the numbers low having a plant that

183
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:05,069
branches out like this and produces

184
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,478
really well is really advantageous so

185
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,009
they stay a little bit shorter they

186
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,259
don't get as tall as many of the other

187
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,599
plants however they will get a little

188
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,029
bit wider they will branch out but they

189
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,090
will not stretch is rapidly at the start

190
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:19,529
of flower that makes Sunkiss a really

191
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:21,329
good plant for something you want to

192
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:23,638
trellis out if you're working a screen

193
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:25,228
that is a really great plant for it just

194
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,449
screen it out it'll fill that screen

195
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:29,459
real well then put a second screen about

196
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,439
12 to 16 inches above that and it'll

197
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,120
fill right into that net if you're in a

198
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,949
commercial environment put up another

199
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,478
net because it's gonna get right into

200
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,579
that net if you've got those kavita's

201
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,870
banging it will grow into there so it's

202
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:41,728
gonna stay shorter it's gonna get a

203
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,829
little bit wider it's not gonna stretch

204
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:46,228
on you ridiculously tall it's not gonna

205
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:47,639
have that major apical dominant op if

206
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:49,918
you want something that grows even

207
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,569
canopy more easily so you don't have to

208
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,098
cut that main top out if you're not into

209
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,560
topping this is a great plant for that

210
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:57,329
sort of stuff however when you do top it

211
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,269
that [ __ ] will really take off and

212
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:03,269
branch out extra hard this is a great

213
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:05,038
plant for outdoor and greenhouses many

214
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:06,930
people ask me what would you recommend

215
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,538
for an outdoor environment or a

216
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,160
greenhouse from your lineup I start off

217
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:12,750
with the Sun kiss if you want a regular

218
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,729
seat I should mention this is not

219
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,829
feminized since this comes from King

220
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:19,019
Solomon this is not a feminized see this

221
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:21,269
is only regular there is a feminized

222
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,250
version it is known as Michelangelo it

223
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:25,319
is very similar it is currently sold out

224
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,910
but it will be back so check out the

225
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,469
Michelangelo if you need feminized seeds

226
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,419
let's keep talking about this where the

227
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,129
hell was I a lot of people ask me my

228
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:34,110
recommendation on outdoor strains this

229
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,389
is the one I recommend I recommend the

230
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,339
Sun kiss because she doesn't take nearly

231
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:40,199
as long to finish as a lot of my other

232
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,719
plants I've had people email me and say

233
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,580
hey dude this plants been going 45 or 50

234
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,230
days and she looks done is that possible

235
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,480
and I say send me pictures of the

236
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,639
trichomes and without a doubt those

237
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,019
plants were done at 45 or 50 days

238
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,799
outdoors so these plants are great

239
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:58,870
for outdoor or greenhouses they are very

240
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,028
pathogen and pest resistant they don't

241
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,519
get powdery mildew they don't get mold

242
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:05,528
for some reason the spider mites don't

243
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,559
really seem to like the orange turps

244
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:10,750
that come from this plant so Sunkiss is

245
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,669
a great selection for either a new

246
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,409
grower or somebody who is trying to grow

247
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:16,360
in an outdoor environment or in a

248
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:18,159
greenhouse environment or a lot of my

249
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,139
friends are on the coast people up in

250
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,458
the Pacific Northwest or up on the East

251
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,838
Coast they were saying hey what can I

252
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,879
grow outdoors this year I was

253
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,740
recommending the Sun kiss along with a

254
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,480
couple of other things but I like the

255
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,970
Sun kiss because it doesn't get powdery

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,230
mildew and it tends to finish before

257
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,778
people are going to have outdoor

258
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,310
problems so let's focus more on a few

259
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:38,559
growth characteristics and then we'll

260
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,569
move forward she won't get too tall on

261
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,569
you but she will get kind of wide she

262
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,399
will not stretch she will flower in less

263
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,230
time than most of my other plants I want

264
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,028
to say that most phenotypes will be done

265
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,129
around eight weeks there are some

266
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:53,649
outliers that will be done earlier and

267
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:55,149
some that will be done later like I said

268
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:57,669
before I was getting reports of this

269
00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:00,909
strain being done at 45 and 50 days

270
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:03,159
outdoors I've also seen this plant go 65

271
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:04,449
or 70 days indoors so it just depends on

272
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:06,429
your phenotype and we're gonna talk

273
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,709
about that in a minute you do have the

274
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:10,449
opportunity of finding early finishing

275
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,429
phenotypes I recommend you grow a crop

276
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,709
indoors find a good one for the outdoor

277
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:16,449
put that early finisher outdoor and grow

278
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,889
the [ __ ] out of that next year outdoors

279
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,480
put a bunch of clones of that one out

280
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,100
there you know what to do you know what

281
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,750
to expect you know exactly how long it

282
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,100
takes that is setting yourself up for

283
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,458
success but there are some early

284
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,350
finishing phenotypes I can say 8 to 9

285
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:31,328
weeks on most phenotypes a lot of them

286
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,790
will finish around 8 some a little bit

287
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:35,828
earlier as a breeder if I say that this

288
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:37,569
plant will finish at 7 weeks people are

289
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:39,278
going to expect it to be done at the end

290
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,200
of 7 weeks and they will email me when

291
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,720
it's not so I can't say that some

292
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,759
phenotypes will do that more typically

293
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,250
you're going to see 8 weeks some will go

294
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:51,189
9 weeks very untypical II but there will

295
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,958
be some that will go 10 weeks another

296
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,329
great thing about Sunkist is that she

297
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,859
clones very easily if you're cloning in

298
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:58,870
a cube if you're cloning and rapid

299
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,000
rooters however you take your clones you

300
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,730
will have a great success with Sunkiss

301
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,500
she is very easy to clone and I believe

302
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,430
that that comes from the Platinum tangi

303
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,230
that plant just

304
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,609
clones you can just cut clones of it and

305
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,470
set them on the table and they will make

306
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,240
roots so big shout out to Spence for

307
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,460
that that is great work there but that

308
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,860
platinum tangi makes it super easy to

309
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,330
clone the Sunkist plants it just spits

310
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,970
out roots no problem they grow with

311
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,580
great vigor this plant will make robust

312
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,440
stocks very quickly these stocks get

313
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,450
super thick you may need to transplant

314
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,860
these plants earlier than you're used to

315
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,320
transplanting you may want to speed up

316
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,669
your schedule by about one full week if

317
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,050
you're working with good lighting and

318
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:36,429
good soil and you've got proper

319
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:38,229
nutrients and you know what you're doing

320
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:41,079
you could probably speed up your entire

321
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,879
entire cycle by one full week by running

322
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,950
something with the vigor that comes with

323
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,659
the Sunkist plant hyah cones really

324
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,759
quickly it doesn't get too big where

325
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:51,429
else was I its p.m. resistant you were

326
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,919
very unlikely to find powdery mildew on

327
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:55,929
a Sunkist plant indoors or outdoors I

328
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,458
don't see powdery mildew on this plant

329
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:59,409
that is one of my favorite traits about

330
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:02,319
it that is partly why I'd recommend it

331
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:04,838
to an indoor grower also it does not get

332
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,970
bugs I don't find bugs on this plant

333
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,310
nobody ever sends me a picture saying

334
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,990
hey there are bugs on this Sunkist plant

335
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,879
I get pictures of bugs on all other

336
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,200
strains but not Sunkist so that is

337
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,750
something that I think is really

338
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,550
advantageous if you're a new grower this

339
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,220
plant will work great for you I don't

340
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:22,659
see any intersex traits in this plant I

341
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,089
have never seen a photo of a

342
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:27,309
hermaphroditic Sunkist plant so this one

343
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:28,959
is great for new growers this one is

344
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:30,579
also great for outdoor growers or

345
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,519
greenhouse growers because it can really

346
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,950
handle stress and mistakes it also likes

347
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,230
a lot of food you can feed this [ __ ] out

348
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,240
of a Sunkist plant I've got one friend

349
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,519
who grows this plant in all organic

350
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,339
no-till type of environments and he

351
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,679
crushes it it produces delicious orange

352
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,209
crazy Terps and the plants are beautiful

353
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,179
I've grown this in a commercial

354
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,588
environment using all veg bloom and

355
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:56,049
commercial salty nutrients and it

356
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:58,000
crushes it it puts out giant plants I've

357
00:12:56,049 --> 00:13:00,609
seen all kinds of different environments

358
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,200
really win with the Sun kiss again

359
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,850
this is an easy plant to grow if you're

360
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,680
a beginner or if you just need a break

361
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,209
if you're tired of struggling this is an

362
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,519
easy one to grow this one kind of goes

363
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,989
on autopilot if you know how to grow she

364
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,730
doesn't seem to get too upset if you

365
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,740
miss a feed she doesn't seem to get too

366
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,600
upset if you over feed and one great

367
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,700
thing is she really doesn't mind if you

368
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,149
[ __ ] up the pH a little bit too much

369
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm not going to encourage you to

370
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:24,110
go in there and not adjust the pH but if

371
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,429
you're not the best grower if you're

372
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,200
kind of lazy and you're kind of not

373
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,459
checking your pH you're not gonna mess

374
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,710
up the crop with this when I've seen

375
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,629
some lazy growers some new growers and

376
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,910
some pro growers all crush it with Sun

377
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:36,529
kiss now she will get some pretty big

378
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:38,419
buds I said earlier that she doesn't get

379
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:40,429
that big apical dominant bud but she's

380
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:42,110
going to grow some long branches those

381
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:43,639
bottom branches are gonna reach to the

382
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,230
top so they may need some supports

383
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,090
that's one thing I should recommend I

384
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,800
would recommend I like growing with the

385
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,600
trellis like with a net with multiple

386
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,819
layers of netting I know that's not an

387
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,680
option for everybody in your environment

388
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
you may need a tomato cage a tomato cage

389
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:57,589
is great because the plants are gonna

390
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,629
push out they can fall right into that

391
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,790
tomato cage you can pull some branches

392
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:04,159
down and strap them to the cage or you

393
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:06,139
can use sticks I like to kind of spread

394
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,909
this plant out it kind of D foliate kind

395
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,500
of heavily and let a lot of sunshine get

396
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:11,360
into the bottom of that plant you don't

397
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,950
have to clean too far down the bottoms

398
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,440
of this plant are gonna make fat buds

399
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,240
also so don't clean too far down as long

400
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,920
as you get light in there as far as the

401
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,350
light goes you will get buds with this

402
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:23,089
plant some phenotypes will give you what

403
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,159
I like to call taco leaf it looks like

404
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,960
they're getting too warm I don't think

405
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:28,899
those plants are always too warm when I

406
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,070
see that taco leaf I think that is just

407
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:33,230
something in the genetics because I've

408
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,360
seen it in multiple environments the

409
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,580
good thing about that taco leaf is it is

410
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,009
usually just encrusted with trichomes

411
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,840
some of your smaller leaves now your fan

412
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,580
leaves but the secondary leaves that are

413
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,110
coming out of the buds will just kind of

414
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,000
curl up just a little bit and they'll

415
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,129
just coat themselves in trichomes at the

416
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,259
edges don't be worried if you see that

417
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:53,029
that is not a problem what you do have

418
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,649
to watch for is the tips of the leaves

419
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:56,000
starting to look like they're crisping

420
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:58,279
up that is when you're giving it too

421
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,080
much nutrient honestly I think you're

422
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,490
giving the plant just enough nutrient

423
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,690
when you see I call it getting their

424
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,310
nails done when you see the tips

425
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,110
starting to cook you know you've given

426
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:08,329
it just to its limit you're pushing it

427
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,620
it's starting to go hey boss do I really

428
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,150
have to work this hard that's when you

429
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,190
can go okay that's your limit I know how

430
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:14,959
far you can go and you know but there's

431
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,850
a difference between stress between too

432
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,950
much heat and between just seeing those

433
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,269
taco resin rails if you're getting a

434
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,340
little bit of a fold and a bunch of

435
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:23,750
trichomes coming across that you are not

436
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,820
overheating those plants they're a

437
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,340
loving life that is just a trait of the

438
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,930
plants now talking about traits let's

439
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,509
move toward talking about some of the

440
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,859
phenotypes most of the phenotypes are

441
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:35,480
fairly uniform are going

442
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,980
to see platinum tangi dominant

443
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,470
phenotypes and then we're going to see a

444
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,180
rise dominant phenotypes most of them

445
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,310
like I was talking about earlier are

446
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:45,528
going to be a beautiful combination

447
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:47,838
we got short squat plants that grow kind

448
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,519
of wide with a lot of vigor you're going

449
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,959
to get some that are a little taller

450
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,879
you're gonna get some that show a little

451
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,939
bit of stretch for the most part they're

452
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,588
going to be dense wide plants most of

453
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,079
the phenotype differences are going to

454
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:02,899
express themselves in aroma you're going

455
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:05,239
to get straight-up oranges like a basket

456
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:06,799
of fresh delicious oranges that somebody

457
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,899
cut one open right in the middle so it

458
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,299
smells real citrusy in the room you're

459
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:13,970
gonna get a real orange dominant type of

460
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:16,939
a phenotype then we're going to get sort

461
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,950
of a gassy funky orange phenotype it's

462
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,839
oranges and feet and that's coming from

463
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,790
the Daybreaker which is coming from the

464
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,740
Joseph og side of things coming from the

465
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:27,110
chem dog side of things put a little bit

466
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,549
of musty foot into that orange so it's

467
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,980
maybe like if you got to eat a slice of

468
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:32,569
oranges from somebody's dirty feet which

469
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,879
when it comes to cannabis that's a

470
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,560
[ __ ] ideal sort of a smell then there

471
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,419
was another phenotype that is a little

472
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,849
bit different it is a little I call it a

473
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:42,948
sharper of an aroma it is a little bit

474
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,019
more of an orange Ryan it's more like

475
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:46,219
you bit too far down into the orange you

476
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,839
shouldn't have eaten that far and it

477
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,550
tastes a little bit bitter but it's

478
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,190
still real citrusy and it's still really

479
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:54,588
sweet that one smells a little bit funky

480
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,750
on its own but it makes amazing

481
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:58,220
concentrates the concentrates don't come

482
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,549
out with that bitter smell they come out

483
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:04,009
super Jolly Rancher orange candy sweet

484
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:06,500
it is really delicious so that if you've

485
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:08,179
got that astringent funky orange

486
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,650
grapefruit sort of a smelling one in the

487
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:12,110
beginning it is going to turn into

488
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,939
straight-up orange candies when it dries

489
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:16,879
and cures or when you make concentrates

490
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:19,069
out of it that phenotype is identifiable

491
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,480
because it is taller and has skinnier

492
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:23,418
leaves that is going to be the

493
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,029
grapefruit flavored phenotype I believe

494
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:28,400
that that comes from the golden goat

495
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:30,558
side of things I think that that is

496
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,809
either the island sweet skunk or

497
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:33,879
possibly the Romulan doing that I really

498
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:36,200
think that there is a grapefruit

499
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,080
characteristic in the island sweet skunk

500
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,880
a sweet pink grapefruit Terp that is

501
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,009
just hidden back in there somewhere in

502
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,350
the genetics it is in there i unlock it

503
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:46,819
occasionally when I cross the golden go

504
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:47,509
to other things it comes out when I

505
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:49,279
cross the

506
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:50,839
arise to other things that turf comes

507
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,730
out I really believe that's coming from

508
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,230
the golden goat from the island sweet

509
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,019
skunk in the golden goat it is a

510
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:59,059
grapefruit sweet pink grapefruit sugary

511
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:01,160
grapefruit sort of a Terp you'll smell

512
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:03,200
that in flower you'll smell that in the

513
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,529
drain cure process and that will drop

514
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,450
out and it becomes complete orange Jolly

515
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:09,649
Rancher candies not like orange powder

516
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,509
not like orange juice

517
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,800
but that's sweet like when you put a

518
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:14,779
Jolly Rancher in your mouth and your

519
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,700
tongue gets wet like wow that's Orange E

520
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:18,680
it is that sort of orange e sort of a

521
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,569
thing and if you make good concentrates

522
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,700
out of that if you can make a good BHO

523
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:24,500
or a good live batter or I'm not dissing

524
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,029
whatever you're doing I like a good BHO

525
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,759
concentrate I feel like it really brings

526
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:30,649
out a good clean profile you can really

527
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:32,329
taste that orange candy just chilling on

528
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,790
your tongue it just dances around for a

529
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:36,589
little while really delicious so that's

530
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,849
the taller phenotype is what's going to

531
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,740
make that that's where I was with that

532
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:41,689
sorry I got distracted by enjoying that

533
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,370
phyno flavor in my mouth but if you're

534
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,380
looking for that grapefruit Terp

535
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:47,089
dominant phenotype you want the taller

536
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,740
one with the skinnier longer leaves

537
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:50,809
again I believe that comes from the

538
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,490
island sweet skunk if you want just the

539
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:54,289
straight orange e Terps I believe that

540
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,509
comes from the one with the more compact

541
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:58,730
leaves the leaves stay really close to

542
00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:00,379
the plant the pedia yet really long and

543
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,940
if you've got the one with the purple

544
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,560
pea Deol's you've probably got the one

545
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,570
that has got a little bit of foot to it

546
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,309
because those long purple pea deals are

547
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:09,289
a trait of the day breaker and that's

548
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:11,179
where you're gonna get the foot aroma so

549
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,379
those are probably the three different

550
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,269
phenotypes you're gonna find you're

551
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,980
gonna find the street oranges you're

552
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:17,210
gonna find oranges and gasps and then

553
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,610
you're gonna get the astringent

554
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,980
grapefruit Ryne kind of orange peel

555
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:23,689
oranges they're all delicious they're

556
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,370
all amazing they're all beautiful in

557
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,140
their own way you may find some

558
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:29,149
different combos of different things

559
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,880
therein but I think you will be happy

560
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:34,759
with any phenotype you get of Sunkist I

561
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,280
have never gotten any bad reviews or

562
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,650
negative feedback on Sunkist and as a

563
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,609
seed maker as a breeder who has put out

564
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,380
a lot of seeds

565
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:44,359
I do get feedback and some of it

566
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,650
unfortunately is negative but that's how

567
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,479
you improve a business that's how you

568
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,800
improve a product there's always going

569
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,750
to be some type of negative feedback

570
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,629
that's how you improve but I never get

571
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,039
any negative feedback from Sunkiss so

572
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,840
I've talked about the phenotypes that

573
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,569
kind of talked about the flavors mostly

574
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,329
oranges it is just orange candy some of

575
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:02,519
those orange

576
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:05,369
tax order flavors I'm not as much like

577
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,769
orange tang but more fresh oranges gases

578
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,689
gassy oranges and then that that

579
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:12,000
straight-up Jolly Ranchers sweet

580
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,590
delicious drooly kind of orange flavor

581
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,359
those are the flavors you're gonna get

582
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:18,569
now let's talk a little bit about the

583
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,750
buzz from Sunkiss a lot of people ask me

584
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:24,119
for advice on flowers or concentrates it

585
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,859
would reduce anxiety or kind of calm

586
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,778
them down a lot of people get too high

587
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:29,308
and they get anxious when they smoke or

588
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:31,140
they're already experiencing anxiety

589
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:32,879
some people want something that will

590
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,580
help them in a social situation just to

591
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,080
be a little more a little more available

592
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:38,939
for social activity some of us don't

593
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,898
want to go out until we smoke and then

594
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,370
it kind of makes your brain a little

595
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:43,349
more friendly you want to go be around

596
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:45,509
more people be more social a lot of

597
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:49,469
people ask me for that type of a strain

598
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:51,808
I often recommend Sunkiss for that type

599
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,630
of situation Sunkiss will give you a

600
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:56,250
nice friendly smiley buzz you want to

601
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,690
talk you want to be around other people

602
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,250
and it doesn't give you that I hate

603
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,009
society kind of vibe that a lot of

604
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,960
people sort of seem to wake up with it

605
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:05,669
also just puts a smile on your face and

606
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,889
it'll give you a nice buzz without

607
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:10,080
making you anxious if you're prone to

608
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:12,599
getting anxiety when you smoke something

609
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,220
about the orange Terps are real calming

610
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,500
or real they put you in a friendly mood

611
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,240
they're just friendly Orange Terps I

612
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,099
can't describe it any other way there

613
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,589
are very few people that when they smell

614
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:24,898
oranges they say that is unpleasant most

615
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:26,849
of the planet really enjoys an orange

616
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:28,829
fragrant turf that is something that is

617
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:30,629
really popular those fruity sort of

618
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:33,028
Terps make almost everybody happy

619
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,320
the orange smell just puts everybody in

620
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:36,210
a good mood and when you smoked those

621
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,428
orange chirps it really just lifts you

622
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,960
up it's like a good breakfast dad or a

623
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,220
good breakfast joint so if you're

624
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,929
looking for something to smoke during

625
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,519
the day that's not gonna bog you out

626
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:46,139

628
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:50,490

smoke that doesn't make you too anxious

632
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:57,269
cuz a lot of people get that anxiety you

633
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:59,729
take a DAB and you just start oh [ __ ] I

634
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:01,528
gotta go this will not give you dabbe

635
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,389
anxiety this should not give you smoke

636
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:05,190
anxiety if you want something that is

637
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:07,709
great for breakfast smoke for daytime

638
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,058
smoke Sunkiss is the way to go if you've

639
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,288
got to go talk to people and you're not

640
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:11,970
really in the mood to be around people

641
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,019
if if you got out maybe you work

642
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,740
somewhere where you got to deal with

643
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:15,480
customer

644
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,160
Sunkiss just may put a smile on your

645
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,589
face that you might not have had when he

646
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,690
started the day so that is my brief

647
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:23,279
report on Sunkiss at this point I would

648
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,539
usually talk about problems and

649
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,000
struggles you would run into while

650
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:28,558
growing this plant but this plan is such

651
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,150
a breeze to grow that I really don't

652
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:31,980
think you're going to find problems like

00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:34,470
I said I don't get negative feedback on

654
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,150
this plan the only problem you will have

655
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,220
with Sunkiss is that if you leave the

656
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,110
jar around somebody will smoke all of

657
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,480
your buds because that [ __ ] smells

658
