come play for a little rocker so we've

49
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,979
been hanging out [ __ ] and we took a

50
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:42,658
bunch of dads guys so you'll have to

51
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,159
excuse the slowness that will wear off

52
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,200
eventually hopefully and then as soon as

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,299
it does we're gonna take more dads but

54
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,890
uh I wanted to bring Jesse on because

55
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,740
somebody asked me a very interesting

56
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,599
question and I tried to politely not

57
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,769
laugh at them when they asked but it

58
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,849
kind of made me giggle a little bit

59
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,429
there were a lot of things that I was

60
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,539
like oh this guy then I thought I'd

61
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,469
talked about on the show with Jesse

62
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,630
somebody asked me why is it so hard to

63
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:07,319
grow indoors when it just happens

64
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:09,780
naturally

65
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,209
outdoors and that sparked a lot of

66
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,318
thoughts in my head

67
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,800
Jesse looks like he's already got stuff

68
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,000
to say

69
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,969
let it go bro it looks like you want to

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,300
launch something off no man it's been so

71
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:24,419
long I forgot how to podcast for sure

72
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,080
for sure nothing is easier to grow

73
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:30,569
inside nothing you're trying to recreate

74
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,900
a natural environment and even in a

75
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,539
harsh environment it's still a harsh

76
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,930
outdoor desert environment I don't know

77
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:43,199
why I'm assuming desert but it's still

78
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,430
gonna be harder or what am I trying to

79
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,829
say

80
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,409
even that is more loving to a plant then

81
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,900
uh then in a rocker indoor environment

82
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,969
that's not getting fresh here has hot

83
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,230
lights beating down on it the thing I

84
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:56,759
really thought you were gonna laugh at

85
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:59,699
is that they actually thought it was

86
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,590
easy to grow outdoors I think people

87
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,289
think we can just throw a seed out there

88
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,520
and pour some water on it and hope that

89
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:08,669
we have good buds at the end of the

90
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,650
season for sure I understand you know

91
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:14,939
the the notion though that it is a

92
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:17,010
little easier you know you don't you're

93
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,219
not trying to balance environmental

94
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:23,099
differences you know so but yes still

95
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:26,340
definitely not easy you know unless you

96
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:28,709
live somewhere where it rains about an

97
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,360
inch a week time and then it dries out

98
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,300
in the fall and you don't have any

99
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,430
humidity and you know yeah you have dark

100
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,959
deep beautiful soil so like maybe Hawaii

101
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,459
yeah I was gonna say Hawaii is about the

102
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,170
only place for that so if we're gonna

103
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,180
grow outdoors we've got to be out there

104
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:44,069
every morning we've got a supply water

105
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,719
if there's not water being supplied for

106
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,099
sure you gotta put water on it we have

107
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,780
to protect it from the elements if we

108
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,719
don't have some sort of cover out there

109
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,000
we have to prevent bugs we have to do

110
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,889
all of the maintenance it is not as easy

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,239
as a lot of people would like to think

112
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:03,509
it is to grow outdoors no yeah

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,060
everything he said do your arms are huge

114
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:08,489
you're [ __ ] sunburned he's got a

115
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,709
sweat line on it you are a physical

116
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,620
description a depiction of what and how

117
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,890
door grower looks like my I feel that I

118
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,449
have definitely stepped it up to I

119
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,189
proudly call myself a farmer now so I

120
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,199
would agree that you've got that farmer

121
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:24,839
tan going on for sure

122
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,709
but so it's not as easy to grow outdoors

123
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,909
as some people

124
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,008
would like to think so when our friend

125
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,419
said why is it so easy to grow outdoors

126
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,009
why is it so hard indoors when it

127
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:33,629
happens so easily others my first thing

128
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,639
was like I love this dude thinks it's

129
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,129
easy to grow outdoors like I'm glad he

130
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,379
didn't say that in front of Jessie it's

131
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:42,360
not that easy to grow outdoors you have

132
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,490
to you have to dig holes you have to put

133
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,050
or at least fill giant pots and you've

134
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,610
got plants out there in the heat which

135
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,870
means they're thirsty which means you're

136
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,410
out there in the heat giving them a

137
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,780
drink

138
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,930
you're getting sweaty yeah later hauling

139
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,959
water you tend in irrigation systems you

140
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,848
know whatever it is

141
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,060
top Chesson plants mixing feed you know

142
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:04,168
however you do your thing

143
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,949
thinning of the plants throughout the

144
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:10,740
season topping trellising you know a lot

145
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:13,400
of the work is identical to what you do

146
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,990
inside you know so but it's outdoors

147
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,589
yeah yeah and that makes a huge

148
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,240
difference

149
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:19,829
and then you've got elements to deal

150
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,030
with maybe it's gonna rain this morning

151
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:23,519
maybe it's gonna rain late tonight

152
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:26,728
it's Colorado it has been straight up

153
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:30,658
hail season season yeah I've seen a few

154
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:32,339
farms vegetable and cannabis completely

155
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:34,228
wiped out this year Wow yeah we'd be

156
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,569
surprised I mean just completely [ __ ]

157
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:38,370
wiped out nothing left it's also powdery

158
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,379
mildew season outdoors right now it is

159
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,728
hot as [ __ ] during the day and moist as

160
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:43,769
[ __ ] at night it is beautifully

161
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:45,810
conditioned for powdery mildew right

162
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:47,908
there so that's that's my first side of

163
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,500
the coin is it is really not that easy

164
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:51,418
to grow outdoors it's a lot of

165
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,759
challenges there are a lot of challenges

166
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:55,529
yes the light is free but the heat is

167
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,629
excessive and you have to water and you

168
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,829
have to go out there and do it so you

169
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:00,779
have to be out there in the heat it's

170
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:03,269
not as easy as one might think so now

171
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:06,448
let's talk about why indoors is such a

172
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:09,448
challenge we're trying to bring all of

173
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:11,490
that stuff outside into a room let's

174
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,169
just say most people are gonna pick a

175
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,030
bedroom in their house probably a

176
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:16,649
basement maybe an attic those are the

177
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:19,408
classic places you go so you've chosen a

178
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:21,120
bedroom right hang up a couple lights

179
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:26,908
that's always the first step right hang

180
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,990
up a couple of lights lights plug them

181
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:31,408
in what's the first thing that's gonna

182
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,588
happen gets hot as hell gets hot as hell

183
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:36,000
in that room it's gonna run up to 90 110

184
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:37,408
degrees pretty quickly if you got a

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
thousand watt light going on in there

186
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:41,819
and there's zero Erichs

187
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,908
just zero air now now we got to get some

188
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,080
air out and some air in so now we've

189
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:47,668
we've got the light that's what the

190
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,959
plants want but now we're heating it up

191
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:51,000
now the plants are just roasting in

192
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,829
there now we've just created basically a

193
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,120
little oven we're just putting OSH

194
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:58,318
whit's plants in there cooling or some

195
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,968
sort of airflow so now you're adding

196
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,610
another piece of equipment let's say we

197
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:04,199
decided to put let's put a blower in

198
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,689
there to remove some of that air and

199
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,460
pull in some fresh air now it stinks now

200
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:09,930
you gotta add a carbon filter because

201
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,188
that air is blowing out to the neighbors

202
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,439
the neighbors are gonna smell your crop

203
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:16,139
that's still not cooling enough now we

204
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,060
need to add an air conditioner every

205
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,579
time you start adding something the

206
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,839
power is gonna need to be pool D be more

207
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,389
efficient so now you're gonna need to

208
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,378
upgrade the power if that's why it's not

209
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,990
so easy

210
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:30,210
indoors every time you add one element

211
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,009
you're gonna add heat you're gonna add

212
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,339
something so now we've got lights in

213
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:33,990
there

214
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,158
we've got some air conditioning going

215
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,569
we've got a little bit of a blower

216
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:40,680
what's gonna happen the first time we

217
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:42,300
water those plants humidity is gonna go

218
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,949
crazy so now we gotta add it the

219
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,680
humidifier the humidifier wait where'd

220
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,210
this water come from exactly yeah yeah

221
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,709
now we gotta figure out where to get all

222
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:55,468
this water and we spilled some of those

223
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,878
yeah and where's it gonna go yeah where

224
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:59,098
is it gonna go do you have a floor drain

225
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,099
or you a lot of it's gonna become

226
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,209
humidity yeah yeah a lot but the plants

227
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:04,348
are gonna suck up a lot of it we're

228
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,430
gonna spill some on the floor they're

229
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:06,810
gonna run out of the bottom of the

230
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,098
plants if you have a floor drain do you

231
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,199
have a bunch of saucers you're gonna be

232
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:13,228
shot backing that out or you gonna dump

233
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,759
the shot back yeah outside you just pour

234
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:18,028
water on those [ __ ] the ground

235
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,639
doesn't say nature makes it happen for

236
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:23,490
sure so I mean like I said I can

237
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,319
definitely see you know why someone

238
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,680
would think growing outdoors is easier

239
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:32,370
than indoors so but at the same time you

240
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,019
know and as an indoor grower I totally

241
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,940
feel that it is a struggle the whole

242
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:40,019
entire season outdoors because it's so

243
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,000
unpredictable for me it is you have the

244
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,009
same vibe oh yeah you wake up and you

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,220
walk out there and go we don't run

246
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:49,828
overnight like normally we get pretty

247
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,759
good rains in the in the spring and we

248
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:54,969
did not get those this year yeah

249
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:59,289
most of July has been just incredibly

250
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:02,290
[ __ ] hot and [ __ ] we went what six

251
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:06,939
weeks without any noticeable Wow we did

252
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:10,329
and then here recently hell storms and

253
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,820
you know Colorado style monsoon storms

254
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,589
sideways rain yeah flooding out your

255
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,020
field knocking down plants you know I

256
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:18,970
mean it's it's a challenge here at the

257
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:22,750
you know you're at the whim of Mother

258
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,250
Nature for sure absolutely yeah so we're

259
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,289
trying to make that mother nature

260
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,990
indoors so we added a dehumidifier and

261
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:33,939
water that do you humidifier is gonna

262
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:36,580
make heat a little bit more I hate those

263
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,470
damn things is gonna make condensation

264
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,899
dripping out of the back also the

265
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,940
dehumidifier make it more water so now

266
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:45,220
we got to get rid of more water it's

267
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,110
like the old joke about the humidifier

268
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,480
and the dehumidifier side by side

269
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,360
Eastham I can't eat the mic sorry you're

270
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,769
good it's that low sexy voice recording

271
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,769
equipment it's like the old joke about

272
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:59,139
putting a dehumidifier in a humidifier

273
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:00,490
side by side who's going to win that's

274
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,980
basically what we're doing in a grow

275
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,778
room to die in in my dry and cure room I

276
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,610
will put a humidifier and a dehumidifier

277
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:08,500
on opposite ends and I'll set them both

278
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,930
at 50% and I will watch them fight each

279
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,339
other all day long you know don't turn

280
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:15,099
either one of them off all day and then

281
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:17,920
you get that nice squish technique blows

282
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,589
people's mind that people in climates as

283
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,620
dry out stars put humidifiers into the

284
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:26,829
grow into the dry room yeah yes we have

285
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,799
to dust people in the East Coaster like

286
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:31,359
whitey whatsit dehumidifier or a

287
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,949
humidifier why do you have one of those

288
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,079
our rooms are so thick that we can't

289
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,420
even can't even get the plants to dry I

290
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:40,509
was actually talking with an employee at

291
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,549
worked the other day about how I would

292
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:46,439
rather grow in a drier climate when it

293
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:49,719
comes to drying than a wet climate it's

294
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,140
with humidity spikes here this last week

295
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,639
our crop took longer to dry out than

296
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:56,409
normal and there was no you know not

297
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,199
much we could do about it right and it

298
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:01,179
just made me to think you know [ __ ] man

299
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,120
how do they do that you know and humble

300
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:04,849
too

301
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,028
no or anywhere on the west coast main

302
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,759
down in a swamp Florida yeah where they

303
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:13,100
have humidity how the [ __ ] do you guys

304
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,960
drive your butt out well you don't ever

305
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,940
hear about the Florida crunch or the

306
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,740
California crunch but you do rephrase

307
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,260
Colorado crunch when they talk about our

308
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,210
wheat because it is it will get crispy

309
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:24,309
here fairly very quickly most growers

310
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,769
around here

311
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:29,088
or let's say most shops around here

312
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:32,240
especially a few years ago no one knew

313
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,520
how to dry their weed now it's you know

314
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,339
I've seen some shops that know how to do

315
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,799
it right but we here recently we quickly

316
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:41,510
went from a bunch of dudes growing in

317
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,549
our basements taking it to the store to

318
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:45,860
sell it that way and then we bought some

319
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:47,629
bigger buildings and kind of put a

320
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,980
couple more air conditioners than usual

321
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:50,778
you know we didn't know what we were how

322
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,519
to commercially scale it so when it came

323
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,480
to cut down all that product we still

324
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,949
didn't know what we were doing it the

325
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,320
same way we did it in the basement back

326
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,790
in the day so we had to scramble and

327
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,500
figure out how do I Drive 50 pounds of

328
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:02,509
herb at one time this big old building

329
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,700
then we had this giant room that we

330
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:06,799
didn't know how to control so yeah as an

331
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,470
industry we've taught ourselves how to

332
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,659
do so much stuff so it's pretty [ __ ]

333
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,580
amazing actually come a long way yeah

334
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:15,649
we've shot ourselves in the foot a lot

335
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,020
we don't own dicks quite a bit for quite

336
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,689
a while for sure but we've come a long

337
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:23,199
way in this industry we have we have we

338
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,730
spent way too much money on nutrients

339
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,950
way too much money on the wrong HVAC

340
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,620
yeah oh [ __ ] I've seen that so many

341
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,500
times I think I think the HVAC companies

342
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:37,519
had a meeting and the growers come to us

343
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,990
sell them this and then it's wrong so

344
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,610
just just sell them this and then in a

345
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,409
couple months we'll come in and we'll go

346
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,000
oh yeah that other company whichever

347
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:46,069
whoever gets the sale will just blame

348
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
you we'll come in and we'll go on all

349
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,790
those guys are [ __ ] [ __ ] you need

350
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,800
this equipment we'll sell them that and

351
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:53,809
then in about eight months

352
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:57,109
bill bill do you want this sale okay

353
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:58,250
bill and you just throw a wrench in all

354
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,690
of it and you tell them oh no it all

355
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,759
fails we have to replace all of them

356
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,730
we'll just use all three of our techs to

357
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,110
install it they'll never notice I think

358
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,480
they did something there's some sort of

359
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,519
a scam because he

360
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,170
Veck is the biggest [ __ ] joke in the

361
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,240
commercial growing industry right now I

362
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:16,778
think a lot of electricians are running

363
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,698
the same scam too unfortunately here in

364
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:21,039
this town they're all the same business

365
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:24,370
HVAC and electric are pretty much the

366
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:26,139
same damn companies and the guys it's

367
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,409
such a small hiring pool that if they

368
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:34,209
fire bill from a and B he goes and works

369
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:35,860
at C &amp; D the next week but now they

370
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,509
brought this guy he hired got hired at

371
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,310
the other place that you hired and you

372
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:41,879
brought the idiots back dammit it's kind

373
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:46,119
of how growers in this state go to you

374
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:47,769
mention it I wrote down that we should

375
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,440
talk about why growers bounced from

376
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:56,799
facility to facility oh man that's a

377
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:59,949
trilogy boy right there yeah I think the

378
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,019
most diplomatic way we could speak about

379
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:06,129
it is just growers and owners have a

380
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:10,060
different approach for sure the owners

381
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:13,539
so there's usually an investor and an

382
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:15,099
owner and then a lead grower is Canada

383
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:16,809
basically the and then there's also a

384
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,610
metric manager who's got to make sure

385
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:20,469
all the rules are a compliance person

386
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,579
metric person make sure all the rules

387
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,259
are followed they're kind of the referee

388
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:25,269
because they know the grower wants to be

389
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:26,289
[ __ ] gung-ho because we used to grow

390
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,669
in the basement didn't care about the

391
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:29,169
rules we just want to cut as many clones

392
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:31,389
as we can and not write it down and do

393
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,919
whatever compliance person is like hey

394
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:34,990
write down all the clones

395
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,448
anyway the dynamic usually goes an owner

396
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,310
and an investor they got together and

397
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:41,259
they wrote a business plan and this guy

398
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:43,719
gave this guy money but this guy that's

399
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:45,159
got the money just has ideas he doesn't

400
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,079
know how to grow a moat usually they

401
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,778
kind of have a vague idea enough of an

402
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:50,948
idea to [ __ ] everything up is usually

403
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:52,120
about how much they know how to grow

404
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:53,769
just he's keeping his mouth shut because

405
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,360
he's got a job in the industry right now

406
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,250
and he would like to keep it so I see

407
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,389
him nodding and smiling occasionally but

408
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,839
he's gonna keep his mouth out of this

409
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:03,789
one it's business people business people

410
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,800
but they don't and then you've got a

411
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,689
grower like Jesse and I who when we look

412
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,250
at the plant there's some love to it

413
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,620
like something inside of us tingles when

414
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,480
we see a happy [ __ ] row of plants

415
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,759
just pray in I'll trellis tout

416
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,550
beautifully we all started doing this a

417
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,730
long time

418
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:22,759
when money wasn't really the main

419
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,039
motivation right yeah we've risked our

420
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,528
families our freedom our rights and for

421
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,899
this these other people came in after

422
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:31,309
the rules changed and they're not

423
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:32,809
risking what they're risking their money

424
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:34,609
but that's basically what they're

425
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:37,088
risking is their financial future

426
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,680
they wrote business plans based on

427
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:41,570
current trends and a lot of stuff has

428
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,609
happened that you know some people may

429
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,740
have seen the majority of people didn't

430
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,810
see it happening I mean I've seen

431
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:51,740
business plans written on selling pounds

432
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:54,109
for thirty five month old and now the

433
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,940
average grow you know so in somewhere

434
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,560
between like six and a thousand dollars

435
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,440
most of those pounds gone somewhere

436
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:03,109
around eight and then that you know

437
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,709
there's a hefty tax in there you include

438
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:09,769
payroll and you know I mean and yeah so

439
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:12,229
it leads to a messed up situation a lot

440
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:14,088
of people in different states just took

441
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,629
a giant [ __ ] in their car or their

442
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:19,550
cubicle or wherever this he did say six

443
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:21,470
hundred to a thousand dollars a pound

444
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:24,528
for top shelf

445
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,750
indoor or at least high-quality

446
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:28,669
greenhouse hand trimmed product that

447
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,440
Jesse and I would smoke if he drops them

448
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:32,028
on the table we'd grind it up and we

449
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,370
[ __ ] smoke a fatty of it right now

450
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:37,159
it's quality product it's going for $600

451
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,620
to $1,000 a pound commercially this is

452
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,990
not person-to-person this is this is in

453
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,940
wholesale bulk orders we won't talk

454
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,799
about how many but you got a lot of them

455
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,390
that's going and they're paying all at

456
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:50,179
once and they're paying six hundred

457
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:51,919
thousand dollars a pound and people I'd

458
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,088
say three years ago weed was thirty two

459
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,389
hundred dollars a pound about three

460
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:57,980
years ago Oh easily yeah yeah a lot of

461
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:59,569
those business plans got written on

462
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,639
twenty five hundred pounds which was

463
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,860
right you know that was the normal for

464
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,449
quite a while for I never saw it going

465
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,519
less than two thousand I always say

466
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,160
thousand because once you go down less

467
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,639
than 2,000 on a home grower scale that's

468
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,720
when he's you don't it's not really

469
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,759
that's why everybody in Colorado

470
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,189
basically all the cash propers they gave

471
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,328
up yes it's all dispensary weed now if

472
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:21,769
you're a cash crop and it's going

473
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:24,730
somewhere else which I don't condone

474
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:27,529
promote support but that [ __ ] happens

475
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,990
it's worth anything here and if you live

476
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:31,220
in one of these states you know is

477
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,750
building a program and going through

478
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,750
this thing you don't think this is gonna

479
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,759
happen to you you are wrong yeah it will

480
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:42,109
happen and it's gonna go even lower and

481
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:44,089
businesses that can't adapt large-scale

482
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:45,379
indoor places that have twenty thirty

483
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:48,019
thousand dollar-a-month

484
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,450
electric bills they're they're not gonna

485
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:53,859
survive you that's the challenge of

486
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:57,289
being a head grower right now is

487
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:58,909
learning to adapt and to grow a quality

488
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,250
product the same amount of it for

489
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:04,460
cheaper yes the exact same thing is big

490
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:07,160
AG on a large scale and do it over and

491
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,590
over again on a schedule predictable

492
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,058
results never have a room empty for more

493
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,619
than 12 hours you know if you're

494
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:14,029
cleaning it getting it ready that's cool

495
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:16,039
but by the time you come in for the next

496
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:17,000
shift start putting plants in there so I

497
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,889
want to wrap up the part I was talking

498
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,710
about why we jump around because

499
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:24,860
basically that investor wanted his money

500
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,779
returned yesterday that owner told that

501
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:30,289
investor we'd have money in nine weeks

502
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:33,558
the grower told the owner we'll have a

503
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:35,119
crop in 12 weeks so now there's all this

504
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,279
[ __ ] that has to be played

505
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,319
the owner says well I want it in 10

506
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,849
weeks then and then the investor says

507
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,859
well then I want it in 8 weeks the

508
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:44,839
grower has to save but it's still gonna

509
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:47,149
take 12 weeks to grow these plants and

510
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:49,069
so it gets weird they want you to cut

511
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,720
we'll cut off a week on each end it

512
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:52,159
doesn't you can't cut off a week of

513
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,380
hedge and a week of flower it's just not

514
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,759
gonna work so then then you don't have

515
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,050
the harvest weight that you want so then

516
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,400
you have to have these weird arguments

517
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,079
with them and then they're like why

518
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,090
didn't the weight you wanted because you

519
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,649
cut me off two weeks and it tastes funny

520
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:05,149
yeah why does it taste funny cuz I

521
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,440
didn't get to flush for the week because

522
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,230
you've decided we're gonna cut it down a

523
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,000
week early and and odds are this guy I

524
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:16,279
used to work for this guy I think his

525
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,859
name's Dave odds are he forced you to

526
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,660
wet trim too that has happened that has

527
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:22,729
happened so yeah that's why you see

528
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,019
Jesse understands exactly where we were

529
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,640
forced to do things we don't want to do

530
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:27,170
we don't agree we come to it with heart

531
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,550
they come to it with dollar signs in

532
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,050
their eyes and it just doesn't work you

533
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:31,369
gotta put what you got to grow from your

534
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:33,558
heart that's the name of the plant

535
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:34,699
that's what we're doing if you're too if

536
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:37,220
you're a bit too busy thinking about

537
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,870
money when you're in the grow you're

538
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,890
contaminating the plants if you're mad

539
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:41,239
at your girlfriend when you're in the

540
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,259
girl you're contaminating the plants if

541
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,680
you're thinking about porn when you're

542
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:45,250
in the grow some of us might be

543
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,299
contaminating the plants if you're

544
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,769
thinking about what you're gonna name

545
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,539
that cross you made you're probably

546
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,529
[ __ ] up the plants focus pay attention

547
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:52,089
what you're doing feel the vibe of the

548
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:54,250
plant to be in a good mood put some

549
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,839
music on dance around feel the plants

550
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,430
love that get that vibe going in the

551
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,379
grow it's much better than dollar signs

552
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,730
dollar signs dollar signs at this point

553
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,160
in the market if you're looking to make

554
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,920
money do not invest in marijuana

555
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,680
there are your cannabis there are a

556
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,710
million different better ways to make

557
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:14,350
money if you insist on being part of the

558
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,569
cannabis movement and you're not already

559
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:18,279
in the Colorado market invested in

560
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:20,589
possibly an ancillary market but that's

561
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:23,109
already filling up also sure and I mean

562
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:25,269
like I've got these q-tips on the on the

563
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:26,979
table from hemp errcode they cover us

564
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:28,450
with all the the rig cleaning supplies

565
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,680
maybe you can make something like a

566
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,110
company like that this sells us the

567
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,970
q-tips and the alcohol swab q-tips maybe

568
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:35,589
you can make glass maybe you can open up

569
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,710
a head shop maybe you can open up a

570
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:43,329
grossed or a company that buys waste

571
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:45,130
product from the all the grows and takes

572
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:47,169
it and turns it into an amazing compost

573
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,720
and resells it that would be amazing

574
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:54,550
yeah yeah and it's needed grows in the

575
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:56,470
cities have huge problems with people

576
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:58,000
breaking into their trash cans distill

577
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,970
their waste even though it's not worth

578
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,440
[ __ ] yeah they still the pots so you

579
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,930
could probably actually charge the grows

580
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,250
to take away the stuff yeah yes so

581
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,799
you're making money two ways they're

582
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,230
also another business that kills it we

583
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,529
have a company that delivers compressed

584
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,420
co2 we have co2 tanks outside of the

585
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:17,859
back of the building giant co2 tanks

586
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,539
like six or twelve of them depending on

587
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,579
the size of the facility and there's a

588
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,960
regulator inside and then there's a

589
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:24,399
computer attached to that and it runs it

590
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,779
to each room and then each room's got

591
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,210
its own sensors and it triggers when

592
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:30,700
it's needed sirens and flashy lights

593
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,500
yes stupid accessories to be sold to us

594
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,289
and then they'd had to train us on all

595
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,059
the warnings and [ __ ] on it did they

596
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:38,710
show up once a week and the guy gets out

597
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:41,500
of his truck and hooks up a tube to our

598
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,390
tube and hits go to the truck and stares

599
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,769
at his phone yeah seriously heats

600
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,390
breakfast in his truck I watch him

601
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:48,069
spread his McDonald's smorgasbord all

602
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,570
across the page and just grubs down and

603
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:51,939
plays with his phone it takes like 45

604
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:52,759
minutes as loud as [ __ ] it sounds like

605
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:58,190
yeah

606
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:59,629
pompona closely yep yep everyone in the

607
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,690
crow can hear it and can't wait til he

608
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,400
[ __ ] Lee yeah yeah I liked it I

609
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,320
learned a trick go to every great

610
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,900
flowering room and just crank up the

611
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,369
[ __ ] co2 put it up to 2,000 he'll

612
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,320
just dump into the whole room while he's

613
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:15,859
filling you so you can really crank up

614
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,450
those rooms that I'm not sure why their

615
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:22,490
tanks won't fill up they were really low

616
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:24,559
today order delivering water that'd be a

617
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,269
good one oh yeah delivering those so

618
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,819
here in Pueblo County both these

619
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:31,849
businesses there's only there's air gas

620
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:35,960
or no not air gas something green clean

621
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:37,669
or some [ __ ] that does the co2 and then

622
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,769
there's only one water company that's

623
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:45,259
curry transportation I mean [ __ ] is

624
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:49,279
everyone hates curry delivery water yeah

625
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:51,799
yeah that's so and the dude yeah I'm not

626
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,539
gonna say too much but he doesn't have a

627
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:54,500
lot of fans out there but they have no

628
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,809
other choice

629
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,349
yeah he's got water yeah that's like the

630
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:01,700
number-one thing all right so yeah don't

631
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:04,459
if you're gonna get into the industry

632
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,900
don't uh don't try to get into the

633
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,850
cannabis industry in Colorado if you're

634
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,920
doing it to make money because it's kind

635
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:11,449
of late is kind of I think our point but

636
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,240
I mean I'm not trying to discourage

637
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,819
people this is just the truth I agree is

638
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,150
going to be a constant uphill battle for

639
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:18,679
you

640
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,110
there are too many businesses right now

641
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,480
if you don't own the dispensary the grow

642
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:26,059
and maybe something else like an

643
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,829
extraction or a concentrate company or

644
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,569
some sort of other way to run it you're

645
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:31,939
not gonna make any money that's a ten

646
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:33,919
million dollar bill right there and a

647
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,420
weird piece of advice that I don't even

648
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,980
know if I should share but I love the

649
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,180
listeners and I love the community this

650
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,410
is something we should warn everybody

651
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:44,600
about when cannabis becomes popular and

652
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:46,279
I don't wanna say mainstream because

653
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:47,750
it's almost mainstream here now it's

654
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,849
like just the thing here it's one of the

655
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,529
things pretty much when everybody gets

656
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:53,449
into it and it becomes part of the daily

657
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:54,859
flow and people start understanding the

658
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,269
products they enjoy and they start

659
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:57,859
picking dispensaries where they want to

660
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:00,619
go and they start experimenting with

661
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:02,209
what's new and then they start coming to

662
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:06,829
Colorado and checking out the culture

663
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:10,429
here your market is going to turn 225

664
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:12,349
to 35% concentrates yeah definitely yes

665
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:13,940
people don't see that coming they're

666
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:15,019
gonna have all this flour sitting there

667
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,940
and people aren't gonna want to buy

668
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,759
flour they're gonna want high-end

669
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,860
concentrates if I was gonna start any

670
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,750
kind of marijuana business here in

671
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:27,109
Colorado with how that dough it would be

672
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:29,148
a lab yeah that's their uh one of the I

673
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:30,589

675
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:33,678
were business minded they said that

676
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,778

679
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,659
small grow and they run their grow they

680
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:44,148
cut down the growth they turn it into

681

popular you know I'm not a big fan of

734
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:37,000
them but one time we were driving home

735
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,380
in a snowstorm and the car is in front

736
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,140
of me I'll [ __ ] spun out and I was

737
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,880
having a little bit of a like [ __ ] in

738
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,320
the car and somebody just reached down

739
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,390
and they handed me a pen and I like here

740
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,069
this will help I was like oh yeah this

741
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,390
with one good ripoff of that pen and set

742
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:52,470
it down I was like oh the nerves are

743
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:54,730
better if I can focus on driving again

744
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:58,600
go ahead they're great when you're

745
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:00,309
travelling yes we're not condoning maybe

746
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,469
taking a rip off a pen in the car or

747
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:04,119
while you're getting in the airport or

748
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:06,039
whatever but maybe something like that

749
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:08,619
does happen people love the Pens depends

750
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:11,349
are super handy so girls love the pens

751
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:13,689
they're pretty inconspicuous at this

752
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:15,849
point to yank because of all the other

753
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,350
vaping devices right so if you're going

754
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:19,599
to a concert or whatever you could just

755
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:21,579
take your your dab vape in right on in

756
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,319
go take some waxy hits while you're in

757
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:24,819
there my problem is I just pretty much

758
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:29,950
cook them out like two or three good

759
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:32,169
hits roasted and gone but most of them

760
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,299
just don't I mean they're great in

761
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,730
certain situations but like just as a

762
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:38,589
daily use thing most of them don't do it

763
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,880
for me right myself as well

764
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:43,259
I'd rather have a Deb I feel like

765
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:46,270
they're like half a Deb if you're a

766
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:48,129
normal flower smoker if you just smoke

767
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:50,680
flowers like if you're just a normal

768
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:53,200
work Jessie and I are kind of expert

769
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,640
level pot smokers a little more than the

770
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,309
average bear if you're just a normal

771
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,600
smoker those pins since it's

772

break or while you're on a bike ride

775

days or some [ __ ] to get the piece of

810
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,190
paper in the mail that I couldn't print

811
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:23,889
it off like I just I didn't you know

812
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:26,259
yeah when he goes to renew I'll be like

813
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,360
just let me go with you right back in

814
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:29,890
the day you would go to the doctor they

815
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:31,269
would fill out your paperwork you would

816
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,159
mail some paper to the state the state

817
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,629
would take for [ __ ] ever then they

818
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:35,860
would mail you back your card and then

819
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:38,200
you would have this card then you could

820
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:40,209
go to the dispensary if you lost that

821
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,980
card or it got stolen or whatever

822
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:45,250
happened to it now you can't shop the

823
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,259
dispensary you have to mail email or

824
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,609
message or write to the state and then

825
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:49,808
they would send you a replacement card

826
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:51,490
if you could prove you were who you were

827
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:52,538
in the truth heart was valid and that

828
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,839
was yes

829
00:29:52,538 --> 00:29:57,308
now they put all the registry online so

830
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,048
you go to the doctor the doctor types

831
00:29:57,308 --> 00:30:00,460
all your info and while he's visiting

832
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,168
you and he hits and by the time he's

833
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,970
done hitting send your stuff goes to the

834
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:06,038
state the state reviews it for approval

835
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,589
I've never seen anybody get declined

836
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:10,750
with a new doctor set up they send you

837
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:12,730
an email you send in a payment and then

838
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,230
it says print your card is the next tab

839
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,089
that pops up and you hit print and it

840
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,860
sends it right to my printer and you can

841
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:20,168
print your card out now on regular paper

842
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:21,579
if you would like to have a paper copy I

843
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:22,929
actually keep one in my glove box in

844
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:25,389
case my phone dies or something goes

845
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:26,830
weird I got a paper copy in there cuz I

846
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,850
like to shop when I'm out of town I like

847
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:29,528
to be able to just go ship it's much

848
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:31,209
cheaper to shop at the the medical

849
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:33,759
stores by the way definitely and then

850
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,558
I've got my I've got a PDF of my card on

851
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,119
my phone and honestly all the stores I

852
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:38,528
shop they know me so I just flash it

853
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,849
they barely even look now you show your

854
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:43,869
ID in your car and they go okay come on

855
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:45,339
in Jeff so yeah it's a much simpler

856
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:45,819
process now we don't have to deal with

857
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:48,369
the mail

858
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:49,929
so much we kind of touched on it a

859
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:51,009
minute ago and it got abandoned cuz we

860
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,230
were talking about like four things at

861
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:55,750
once but before we start wrapping it up

862
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,849
let's talk about a couple of the major

863
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:01,240
things people are gonna notice when they

864
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:06,129
go from growing in their basement to a

865
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:10,990
large-scale facility I like that look on

866
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:13,300
your face I don't even know where to

867
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:15,069
start with that one I don't mean to

868
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:16,720
sound like this [ __ ] we know it's a

869
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:18,579
completely different ballgame totally

870
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,319
right and I don't have any notes in

871
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:21,429
front of me so that all of this episode

872
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,990
has all been off the top of my head

873
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,190
today so I'm not keeping track of where

874
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,049
we're going a lot of times they keep

875
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,860
notes so I know where we've been a lot

876
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:33,339
of there are a ton of inefficiencies in

877
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:35,169
basement gross you guys I don't mean

878
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:38,759
[ __ ] I sound like such an [ __ ]

879
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:41,289
basement growers of waste an

880
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,759
extraordinary amount of time and an

881
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:46,329
extraordinary amount of money to you in

882
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:49,930
my opinion yes so you're gonna notice

883
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:52,929
going from like a basement to say a 1500

884
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:55,930
plant grow or something like that if you

885
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:59,350
water that 1500 plant grow the same way

886
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:01,330
you possibly water your basement it's

887
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:03,399
gonna take you a day and a half and when

888
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:05,919
you get to the end guess what they're

889
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,820
gonna need water yep start over

890
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:13,180
things like D leafing and topping take

891
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:16,450
so much more time you wouldn't believe

892
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:19,450
what it takes to say top 250 plants or

893
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:23,259
something like that I when I have guys

894
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:25,539
do that I'm normally I'd probably say

895
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:28,869
3-4 hours and these are guys that do

896
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:32,109
that you know what you know once a week

897
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:34,809
they're professionals and it still takes

898
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:38,229
you know a while it's just average the

899
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:41,259
workload is so so much bigger little

900
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:44,470
insect problems turn big very [ __ ]

901
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:46,569
quickly very quickly man there's just

902
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:49,839
it's a completely different ballgame

903
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:52,689
it's like you know having a backyard

904
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:54,579
garden versus having you know two acre

905
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,470
garden yeah that's a good way to put it

906
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:58,428
yeah it's uh you know around like week

907
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,919
four five and six

908
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:02,480
but there's a lot of video game time you

909
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:03,830
got a pacemaker Oh like week four or

910
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,389
five and six are it [ __ ] to do I mean

911
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:06,769
you go to some D leafing and whatever

912
00:33:05,388 --> 00:33:08,689
but all the toppings been done the

913
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:10,399
lollipop has done all the trellising is

914
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,110
in place you're just making sure now

915
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,449
you're in that like fingers are crossed

916
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:16,069
kind of no powdery mildew home stretch

917
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,200
open sure that or making sure that no

918
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:22,278
spider mites pop up now at the end it's

919
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,019
like week four or five six seven [ __ ]

920
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:26,089
play an Xbox you know what I mean like

921
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:28,490
selling the last crop is what we used to

922
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:30,138
be busy [ __ ] smoking and selling the

923
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,359
last one weigh it out bags and meeting

924
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:33,558
up with people we used to do that

925
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:35,269
doesn't happen anymore there's none of

926
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:38,690
that video game time that video game

927
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:40,460
time now you're cutting clones for the

928
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,200
crop that's coming up in two weeks and

929
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,240
then when you're done cutting clones you

930
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,100
have to get the other clones that were

931
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,960
already cut and put them into the

932
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:50,388
six-inch net pots or the four by four

933
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,190
pots listen through their rotation yeah

934
00:33:50,388 --> 00:33:53,839
as soon as you're done with that you

935
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,580
have to go up pot the ones that were

936
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,618
already done into the three gallon pots

937
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:58,999
and then once those are done you have to

938
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,490
move those other three gallon pots into

939
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:04,490
that room that's empty now and it just

940
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,798
never stops and then not never there's

941
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,510
never a diff you fall behind one day

942
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,088
you're two days behind because you have

943
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,440
to do today's work tomorrow and then

944
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:13,818
what are you gonna do about tomorrow's

945
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,338
work you're gonna have to do that

946
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:17,690
sometime also so you're either gonna

947
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:19,789
have to work some overtime you're gonna

948
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,970
have to catch up so it doubles the pace

949
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:24,469
and Jesse started off the best way that

950
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:26,928
shows that Jesse and I have evolved a

951
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:29,029
long way from BB being basement growers

952
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:31,068
to becoming business minded professional

953
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,379
growers we did it gradually because when

954
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:34,940
we started the average commercial grower

955
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:37,398
room didn't look too much different than

956
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,048
a basement right absolutely my first

957
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:41,148
couple of commercial grows were yeah

958
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:42,918
just expanded basement grows we didn't

959
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:46,460
know I've seen clone air he is bigger

960
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:48,500
than two right yeah yeah it's but you

961
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:51,559
have people that have been around as

962
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:54,619
long as me and Jeff kind of grew into it

963
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:56,540
organically right don't jump into don't

964
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,130
don't think your first facility needs to

965
00:34:56,539 --> 00:34:59,480
be a hundred lights figure out how to

966
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,619
kill one light worth of plants before

967
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,449
you figure out how to kill a hundred

968
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:02,660
lights we're at the plants for sure for

969
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:05,149

time I've accomplished a lot in the last

1000

say that about everyone that's moved on

1008
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:30,578
from there I'll just shut my mouth

1009
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:36,288
sometimes in it developing the systems

1010
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:38,538
that we have developed is like one of my

1011
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:40,760
proudest achievements there and it's

1012
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:42,770
like it's something that I really

1013
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,910

this industry along we Wow I didn't I

1020
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,778
don't think about it that much we're

1021
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:07,640
kind of pioneers we were here well like

1022
00:37:05,778 --> 00:37:09,949
I was part of met amar the first

1023
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:11,808
dispensary in town here first

1024
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:13,460
dispensaries in the state yeah it was

1025
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:15,289
the first was the first one in this city

1026
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,519
there were some outside of our city

1027
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:18,349
limits but it was the we're right in the

1028
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:21,170
heart of downtown just doing it loud and

1029
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:23,720
proud that product was grown in my

1030
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:25,159
basement on in another part of town here

1031
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,808
in another house that's where that used

1032
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,449
to come from

1033
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:29,920
then they bill another little thing in

1034
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:32,798
their building there was a little bit

1035
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,880
bigger and then we had some other

1036
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:35,469
friends I don't know how much I could

1037
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,390
talk about it's in the past

1038
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:39,548
throw people under the bus we had

1039
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:41,288
somebody that built a fairly semi large

1040
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:43,329
warehouse that needed help and they let

1041
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:45,939
us come you were there for a while I

1042
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:47,318
went and helped out some times and we

1043
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:49,420
both had other people build greenhouses

1044
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:52,838
and other things and we got to go see oh

1045
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:54,400
it got bigger and then people in Springs

1046
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:55,719
needed help and I got to go see even

1047
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,420
bigger places and I was like wow it's

1048
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:00,159
getting bigger and now you can tell who

1049
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,358
has been in big facilities if you take

1050
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,399
somebody with you and they walk in

1051
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:09,578
places and their chin hits the floor or

1052
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:11,588
they just not like they either pass out

1053
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:13,869
and get shaky or they're just like yeah

1054
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:15,880
whatever another grow it's easy to get

1055
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:18,548
jaded about a lot of things but when I

1056
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,249
do a tour it they grow and I get that

1057
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:22,509
jaw hitting the floor like it just it

1058
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:25,238
takes me back a little bit it makes me

1059
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:29,920
smile so you know to see someone have

1060
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:31,389
that kind of passion for for all of this

1061
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,880
you know it just kind of reminds me of

1062
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:36,308
where I came from right we put in blood

1063
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,179
sweat tears and more blood sweat and

1064
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:42,278
tears a little differently but you know

1065
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:44,199
I try to never try to never lose I try

1066
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:46,630
to still love my photography you love

1067
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,219
growing the plant like I you can see it

1068
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,179
in the photography that I'm still still

1069
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:53,380
in love with those girls

1070
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:55,719
yeah it's I've still you know I'm not

1071
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:59,528
completely jaded the day-to-day process

1072
00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:02,048
I'm like it's I hate it because I used

1073
00:38:59,528 --> 00:39:03,400
to talk to him about it but her talk

1074
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:06,639
[ __ ] about people that thought this way

1075
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,769
but it's a lot to just move in widgets'

1076
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,509
from one place to the other yeah it's a

1077
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:12,008
it's a production it's a conveyor belt

1078
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:14,798
you just got to keep that conveyor belt

1079
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:18,458
going we'll get a new clone I always get

1080
00:39:14,798 --> 00:39:20,528
jazzed about that you know pop a pack of

1081
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:22,659
seeds here and there [ __ ] that's the

1082
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:24,068
kind of [ __ ] that's just all it takes is

1083
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:26,288
a new cut in the garden a new pack of

1084
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:28,058
seeds or just that new opportunity for

1085
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:29,528
something or you find out this new grow

1086
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:31,420
tech you're like oh we're gonna try that

1087
00:39:29,528 --> 00:39:32,978
in the hole next cross the hole next

1088
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,079
crop is super exciting just because of

1089
00:39:32,978 --> 00:39:37,328
some new idea that you got yeah it's

1090
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:39,068
always fun yeah testing product so you

1091
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:41,259
test a bunch of new stuff for a couple

1092
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:43,719
companies we use so that's always fun I

1093
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:47,199
like side-by-side tests is the best it's

1094
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:48,849
easy to do when you've got 3,600 and you

1095
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,588
tell two companies yeah I'm gonna run

1096
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:52,329
your stuff on this many plants and then

1097
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:54,068
like oh [ __ ] and they help you fill it

1098
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:55,209
in and you get your schedule figured out

1099
00:39:54,068 --> 00:39:56,679
with them and then you do the other

1100
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:58,868
company and get it dialed in with them

1101
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:59,739
and then you just go head to head and go

1102
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:01,690
see what happens

1103
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:04,539
wait on the way the weights at the end

1104
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,458
test the potency at the end it's kind of

1105
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:09,930
like being a Roman Emperor man

1106
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:12,278
I mean you create victors and yak terms

1107
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:15,699
because someone's always gonna be sad

1108
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:18,429
when that happens I like the look on the

1109
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:20,288
Rotex faces when new clones come in it's

1110
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:21,399
like they come in in a box and it's

1111
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:22,869
covered you know cuz nobody can see

1112
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,400
anything as it's being transferred and

1113
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:29,499
then you open the box and it's like the

1114
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:44,588
suitcase on pulp fiction gather around

1115
00:40:29,498 --> 00:40:46,058
like Santa Claus were like it's

1116
00:40:44,588 --> 00:40:49,088
blueberry cookies and someone in the

1117
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:50,680
back is like blueberry cookies yeah it's

1118
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:52,150
always so much fun to see people and you

1119
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:55,659
get new cuts in the facility even the

1120
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:58,329
trimmers they're like what the trailers

1121
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:59,708
more so sometimes then they grow Tex

1122
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:01,509
yeah because they've been trimming that

1123
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:03,068
[ __ ] ghost dog for the past seven

1124
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:04,798
days and they cannot wait to trim

1125
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:06,909
something that's not ghost dog

1126
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:16,329
whatever's next problems tired of

1127
00:41:06,909 --> 00:41:19,149
looking at this one when it comes when

1128
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:20,829
you have a commercial facility you just

1129
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,369
cut down we've been throwing out huge

1130
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:26,109
numbers we used to cut down 40 lights

1131
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:29,459
worth of plants at a time it would dry

1132
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:33,369
up to be about 75 to 85 pounds of weed

1133
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:39,879
imagine trimming that like yeah where

1134
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:41,619
are you going to hang it to dry it and

1135
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,930
this is part of why it you have to have

1136
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:46,059
space you have to have a dehumidifier a

1137
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:48,308
humidifier and air conditioner and a fan

1138
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:48,970
all fighting each other see there's

1139
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:50,380
always

1140
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:54,159
problems gonna grow this size because

1141
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,630
either you're not new stuff always comes

1142
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,489
up even if you're doing your job

1143
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:00,039
especially if you're doing your job very

1144
00:41:57,489 --> 00:42:03,189
well new problems come up hey you know

1145
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:06,300
it's you always got problems we gonna

1146
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:10,389
put all this weed problem

1147
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,619
yeah yeah and you can't back crops up in

1148
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:13,269
the drank your room because if you've

1149
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:14,500
got this one that's almost ready to go

1150
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:15,820
into the containers and then you bring

1151
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,858
in this fresh one that just got cut down

1152
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,320
you're just gonna remoisten all of those

1153
00:42:17,858 --> 00:42:21,579
other buds no there's so many challenges

1154
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,650
things you're gonna have to think about

1155
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:24,880
when it comes time to build your large

1156
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,680
facility you guys this episode let's

1157
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,510
start it off with an idea of talking

1158
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:31,089
about the differences between why it's

1159
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,650
so easy outdoors it's not and why it's

1160
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,910
so much more challenging indoors because

1161
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,869
every piece of equipment you put in

1162
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:36,789
there you got to put another piece of

1163
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:37,990
equipment if you put in a light you got

1164
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:39,519
to put in a cooling a piece so when you

1165
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:41,679
put in cooling that makes heat outsides

1166
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,269
and now you got it just it all backs up

1167
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,739
on itself then you gotta make sure the

1168
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,750
power is safe please don't burn down

1169
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:50,139
your house trying to run too many amps

1170
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:51,550
on one breaker please we've seen some

1171
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:52,929
scary things melt and [ __ ] like that

1172
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:55,030
then it turned in us kind of talking

1173
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:56,079
about just random grow industry stuff so

1174
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,609
I hope you guys enjoyed hanging out

1175
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,019
listening to this podcast Bri you got

1176
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:00,940
any stuff you want to ramble about since

1177
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:02,320
we've got you here on the podcast and

1178
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,960
you don't come over often enough for

1179
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,820
sure I'm actually really stoked about my

1180
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,579
market farm business

1181
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:15,039
me and Derek from the Colorado podcast

1182
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:18,909
the summer for years I listen to podcast

1183
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:21,338
a lot while I'm working in big gross and

1184
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:23,379
it kind of turned towards some podcasts

1185
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:26,650
that were centered on urban farming and

1186
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,690
small farming and Derek would listen to

1187
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:30,070
him with me and I always talk [ __ ] and I

1188
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:32,470
was like I could do that [ __ ] [ __ ]

1189
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:35,830
you know this and that and so this

1190
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:37,598
spring I decided to put my you know to

1191
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:39,759
to actually do it

1192
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,539
shut up saying I could do it and show

1193
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,089
that I can do it so we've been farming

1194
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:50,199
800 square feet yes I said farming and

1195
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:52,299
800 square feet counts rough [ __ ] dude

1196
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:55,389
we've had we've had some beds have

1197
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:58,269
turned over four times I had produce

1198
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:59,900
available and for sell before most of

1199
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:01,639
the commercial farmers

1200
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,960
out in the county even [ __ ] had seed

1201
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,940
in the field nice

1202
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,980
we've probably grown about 300 pounds of

1203
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:09,500
food so far they excellent he brought me

1204

1210
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,230
always nice eating things that were

1211
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,760
grown right across town by somebody that

1212
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,980
you know put some love into it seems

1213
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,270
better super organic although I can't

1214
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,960
use that word because the government

1215
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:33,019
stole it from us but it's fueled by

1216
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,519
compost and worm castings nice it's it's

1217
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:37,778
you know that's pretty much it

1218
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:40,788
I put down a little bit of bio live from

1219
00:44:37,778 --> 00:44:42,380
down to earth okay we threw some a

1220
00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:45,200
little of that down early in the season

1221
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:48,230
a little kelp meal to Exxon but yeah

1222
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:50,028
that's it so where I work in locals find

1223
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,588
you I've seen you set up at Thea the

1224
00:44:50,028 --> 00:44:54,710
farmers market they're working people

1225
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:56,778
come find you your produce we do we've

1226
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:57,858
got one more market this year that is

1227
00:44:56,778 --> 00:45:00,079
already planned

1228
00:44:57,858 --> 00:45:03,670
it's the Belmont Market at the Christ

1229
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,839
Congregational Church here in Pueblo

1230
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:08,750
other than that like we didn't make a

1231
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:10,099
commitment to a full-scale farmers

1232
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,329
market this year because it was our

1233
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:14,028
first year I didn't know what to expect

1234
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:15,920
I didn't want it most the time farmers

1235
00:45:14,028 --> 00:45:17,960
markets they don't just want vendors

1236
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,000
coming you know they need a commitment

1237
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,818
from you for the full seasons they know

1238
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,519
that boots salt and yeah so I you know I

1239
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:28,250
had some doubt myself about a few things

1240
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,048
and you know just the nature and

1241
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:32,690
learning a new business I didn't want to

1242
00:45:30,048 --> 00:45:34,659
commit to that so we're not at a steady

1243
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:38,750
market yet but we have a Facebook page

1244
00:45:34,659 --> 00:45:41,118

the county so yeah we're if we get our

1255
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,078
