sweet comment fat ankle-foot I

120
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:34,579
appreciate that I'm glad that soma

121
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:37,549
inspired you and started a lot of your

122
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:39,529
teachings because I was hanging out with

123
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,850
a friend who grew weed for several years

124
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,809
and we were talking about my crops and

125
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,840
he said dude you know who you really

126
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,550
remind me of was a guy named soma never

127
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,269
heard of so I went home and of course I

128
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,329
googled soma

129
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:52,399
and someone I have a lot of the same

130
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:54,560
philosophies a lot of the same practices

131
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,259
we agree a lot so I've learned a lot

132
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,379
from soma I kind of used some sohmas

133
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:02,870
methods but mostly his ideals he almost

134
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:04,668
treats plants is like a religion sort of

135
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,829
you know he's his religion is growing

136
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:08,209
pop and I took that spiritual aspect of

137
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:10,009
growing pot I had that before I ever

138
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:12,049
knew about soma so I kind of I

139
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,969
multiplied on it or expanded on it once

140
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,610
I found so much so I'm glad you knew

141
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,080
soma and glad your soma fan and dude

I know how it is you can't always tell

174
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:23,649
everybody that you grow cannabis if you

175
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:27,889
don't live in Colorado it feels like

176
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:30,199
intro stuff a little bit about the Rocky

177
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,430
Mountain worm company the Rocky Mountain

178
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,769
worm company was kind enough to give me

179
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,840
a tour of the worm farm I'm also gonna

180
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,389
talk a little bit about my company IRA

181
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,879
genetics and I'll also talk a little bit

182
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:42,379
about feminized seeds I've gotten a lot

183
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,089
of emails about feminized seeds I'll

184
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,699
explain my method of making those a

185
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:48,289
little later in the show now let's start

186
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,449
with the Rocky Mountain worm company

187
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,620
last week I was invited to go visit the

188
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:52,519
Rocky Mountain Worrell company and they

189
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,649
gave me a little tour of the building

190
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:57,199
and I got to see where the worm castings

191
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:58,969
are made they don't have a giant

192
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,949
facility but what they do have is super

193
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,110
clean and super organized and I was

194
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:05,240
pretty impressed I got to hang out with

195
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,430
J and Sean and Alan for a few minutes

196
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,860
and they taught me a lot about worms and

197
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,810
worm castings and why they use specific

198
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,819
worms that they use to make the worm

199
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,620
castings some worms you guys only eat

200
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,899
the top layer of if you put them in a

201
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,668
big thing of dirt like if it's a field

202
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:21,620
of dirt or if it's just a bucket full of

203
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:23,418
dirt they will only eat the top layer

204
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,129
and they don't dig down these guys

205
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:26,659
actually know which worms eat the top

206
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:29,180
which worms eat the bottom they know

207
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,410
that some worms will eat every layer

208
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,509
some worms will travel through all of

209
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,550
the dirt or whatever you're putting them

210
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:37,129
in and they will eat and digest all of

211
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,050
that these guys these guys knew a lot

212
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:41,360
about their worms they showed me worms

213
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,079
in every single stage of growth every

214
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,729
single stage of life they have

215
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,348
kind of keep the worms in five-gallon

216
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:47,878
buckets and they let me open the buckets

217
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:49,800
with the warm farms and them I get to

218
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,710
feel the texture of the medium in which

219
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,478
the worms live in it's kind of Airy its

220
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,668
kind of fluffy it feels a lot like the

221
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,839
soil that I mix for my plants one thing

222
00:07:56,668 --> 00:08:00,089
that I thought was really cool is what

223
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,519
they're feeding the worms this is really

224
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:05,848
cool in my opinion

225
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,258
parts of the worm diet is dried and

226
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:10,378
ground herb from a company called

227
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,990
o.penvape open vape makes vapor pen

228
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,599
cartridges so they're using their

229
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,699
extracting the CBD or THC from a plant

230
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,978
and making oil out of it and then they

231
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,379
send all the leftover material to the

232
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:25,258
worm company to feed the worms so the

233
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:27,270
worm company is using ground-up plant

234
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,250
stocks and leaves and whatever else was

235
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:31,589
left for over the plants after harvest

236
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,168
after the making oil part happened and

237
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:36,240
they're feeding the ground-up plant

238
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:38,490
matter back to the worms and then the

239
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,918
worms are making castings at VAT and

240
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,320
those castings are being used to grow my

241
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,669
cannabis and probably those worm

242
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,230
castings hopefully make it back to

243
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:48,809
o.penvape and go back into their

244
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,759
cannabis so we're kind of doing like an

245
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:54,389
in-house recycling sort of thing it goes

246
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,828
full circle without us creating more

247
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,179
stuff without something being tossed

248
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:59,629
into a dumpster for the trash guy to

249
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:02,159
find imagine when you harvest you have

250
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:04,559
every plant has a stalk and stems and

251
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,899
leaves imagine if you let that dry grind

252
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,518
it up and had some worms to feed that to

253
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,839
you wouldn't have to throw all that away

254
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,570
and you wouldn't have to make so many

255
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,100
trips to the dump or wherever that's

256
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:18,390
just super efficient I was completely

257
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,560
impressed so let's see I want to give

258
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:22,078
you huge shout out to Jay and Sean and

259
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,239
Alan and Nick I really like hanging out

260
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:25,948
with those guys the worm Factory is a

261
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,370
cool place I'll definitely be back there

262
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:27,719
soon

263
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,250
those guys through a handful of products

264
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,778
my way and I'm kind of starting to

265
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,120
implement them in my grow I have to

266
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,439
slowly adjust from the organic or from

267
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,519
the non-organic bottled stuff to the

268
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,740
organics because I don't want to ruin

269
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,970
the organic stuff so I'm learning what I

270
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,220
can switch out and what I can use

271
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,870
together and these guys are definitely

272
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,120
definitely definitely moving me along

273
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,070
quickly I've been feeding my plants worm

274
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,259
castings for about a month now and I can

275
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,360
definitely see an improvement in my

276
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,159
crops the first thing I noticed I would

277
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,470
say that after introducing worm castings

278
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,110
and grow Kashi is that my plants are

279
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,778
just simply

280
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,970
more active they look more vigorous they

281
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:02,919
look happier they're greener I see more

282
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,480
growth and they also seem to want more

283
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,699
water which tells me they're growing and

284
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,860
taking nutrients more than before so I

285
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,709
definitely encourage the use of grow

286
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,149
Kashi and worm castings as a nice way to

287
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:17,379
just start leaning toward the organics

288
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:20,289
yeah so I feel like I've been talking

289
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:21,338
about them for a little bit let's see if

00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,850
wanted to talk about is Irie genetics

304
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,709
I've got I get a couple of emails every

305
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,480
week about I read genetics with

306
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:54,609
questions about hydrogen etic stuff and

307
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,750
somebody just asked me why I don't talk

308
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,039
about IRA genetics on the podcast show

309
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,629
isn't really about IRA genetics the show

310
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,278
is about Candice cannabis in general so

311
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:04,570
I not try not to focus too much on my

312
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,480
own company but it seems like you guys

313
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,560
are interested so I guess it seems fair

314
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,850
that I talk about it a little bit I

315
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,869
turned out to toot my own horn I'm gonna

316
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,870
take a sip here sorry hold on

317
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,580
um so let's talk about IRA genetics I

318
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:22,169
guess let's jump into this um I read

319
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,720
genetics is of course my seed company I

320
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:26,579
breed regular and feminized cannabis

321
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,930
seeds right now I read genetics is

322
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,060
pretty much sold out of seeds for the

323
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,829
most part nature's green remedies is my

324
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,500
main distributor and they got most of

325
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,120
what I had left over after I hooked up

326
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,190
most of my local friends with my latest

327
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,789
harvest I really like to get the locals

328

uh all my friends all my Colorado I mean

329
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:45,539
my company is called IRA genetics

330
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:48,389
Colorado Colorado is what allowed me to

331
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,699
become this breeder I feel like the

332
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,559
local people should get the IRA genetics

333
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,910
products first and that way I get to see

334
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,709
what they grow and I get to take

335
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:57,839
pictures of it I can take clones of it

336
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,220
so I'm not trying to be rude about it

337
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,700
but the locals always get served up

338
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,590
first

339
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,690
after I feel like everybody's gotten

340
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,430
their seeds make sure nature's green

341
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,220
remedies gets what they can what they

342
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:10,289
can do so I really can't make enough

343
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,879
seeds to meet the demand lately honestly

344
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:14,309
I'm gonna make more golden goat let me

345
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,289
Jeffery seeds here really soon the boys

346
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:18,629
for that project are actually in flower

347
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:19,799
when you make em seeds or seeds in

348
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:21,809
general you got to start the boys off a

349
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,309
little bit ahead of the females so the

350
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,619
males are in flower now the girls will

351
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,959
go on flower and a couple few days those

352
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,669
should be ready in about ninety days

353
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,800
from now I think this episode will come

354
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:34,199
out March 1st or 2nd and ninety days

355
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:38,279
from then I should have lemon Jeffery

356
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,960
and golden goat seeds available I

357
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,009
actually wrote down the wrong screen and

358
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,930
I'm gonna set the wrong strain and teach

359
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:44,100
you guys but yes I'm making more lemon

360
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,539
Jeffery and I'm making more gold and go

361
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,700
right now they should be ready in about

362
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:49,439
ninety days the locals will get them

363
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,820
first there is no waiting list there's

364
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,310
not a way to get on a waiting list right

365
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,290
now after my locals get served up they

366
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:57,119
will be dished out to nature's drain

367
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:59,610
remedies and nature's drain remedies com

368
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,720
will sell out quickly I promise you that

369
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,879
I'll make an announcement on this show

370
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,500
before they go there so when I make

371
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,450
those lemon Jeffrey and the golden goats

372
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,149
I'm also gonna put a new cut called

373
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:12,720
Kalonji cush in their Kalonji pushes The

374
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:14,699
Grateful dog pollinated the Tahoe og and

375
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,440
I call it Kalonji Kush after a reggae

376
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,640
artist named Sizzla Kalonji if you're

377
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,980
wondering where my weird names come from

378
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,519
Kalonji is a reggae artist sizzle of

379
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,800
Kalonji

380
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,730
so I'm gonna cross the golden goat to

381
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,528
the sizzle of Kalonji

382
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,528
and I want to call that sunshine girl

383
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:30,938
which I is actually a sizzler song so I

384
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:32,799
think that's gonna be pretty cute

385
00:13:30,938 --> 00:13:34,269
I have a couple more ideas that I'm

386
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,679
gonna put in that room I have two more

387
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:36,970
females that are going in there for sure

388
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,278
but I don't want to talk too much about

389
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:42,759
them until I've got some seeds in my

390
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:45,100
hands from those because man we tell you

391
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,870
weird side story one time I reversed the

392
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,240
golden go plant a female golden go

393
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,499
planet I treated it I turned it into a

394
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,028
male and I'll talk more about that later

395
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:54,040
in the show how I do that but I turned

396
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:56,499
this female plant into a male right and

397
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:58,480
it created pollen and I put that pollen

398
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:00,370
on a roomful of plants and that's how I

399
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,470
created the lemon Jeffrey that's how I

400
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,730
made golden goat seeds there was another

401
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,319
cross in the room that's never been

402
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,819
released or shown to anybody because it

403
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:09,849
only made a few seeds and those are mine

404
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:11,498
but I also sprinkled that pollen on

405
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,999
another plant um

406
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,350
the screen was headband it was a

407
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,360
headband cut that I got from my good

408
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,850
buddy hanky B he gave me that headband

409
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,589
cut I sprinkled pollen on it and when

410
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,860
that plant took the pollen the plant

411
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:25,389
died within 24 hours that plant was dead

412
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,039
every other plant in the room was

413
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:28,870
healthy and happy took the pollen it

414
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,549
showed signs of being pollinated just

415
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,039
like it should have I don't know what

416
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:35,318
went wrong but that headband plant died

417
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,389
was in 24 hours of taking feminized

418
00:14:35,318 --> 00:14:38,979
pollen I've never seen that from a plant

419
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:40,870
I have never heard of that from a plant

420
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,430
I've talked to other breeders nobody has

421
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,169
an explanation for that the plant was

422
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:45,638
healthy everything was cool I don't know

423
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:47,049
what the hell happened so I'm gonna put

424
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,028
another headband in there and I'm gonna

425
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:51,008
hit it with golden goat pollen again and

426
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:52,179
I've got a name for it but I'm hesitant

427
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:53,050
to say it on the show because people are

428
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:55,000
gonna rip me off

429
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:57,008
but if I say it that no one can steal it

430
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,259
from me Rex I'm saying it the golden

431
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:02,470
goat is going to pollinate the headband

432
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,639
plant and I will call it as a halo you

433
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,170
know right you see you got a headband

434
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,120
and now it's gold it's above your head

435
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:08,948
that's the halo bro so that's what I

436
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,769
think I'm gonna call it a headband to

437
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:12,938
the golden goat the halo Kalonji cush to

438
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:14,980
the golden goat will be the sunshine

439
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:16,599
girl those are coming up you guys about

440
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,860
90 days so pay attention I'll need some

441
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,649
testers but I didn't say that on the

442
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,600
show let's see more about IRA genetics I

443
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:26,948
recently started my work on making black

444
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,749
cherry Kim f2 seeds f2 is finial

445
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:30,938
generation so I made the f1 right that's

446
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:33,129
plush Barry was pollinated by a

447
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:35,159
Daybreaker plant and the seeds that came

448
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,629
out of there were called f1

449
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:40,019
the first finial generation of that

450
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:42,120
cross so now I grew a bunch of them out

451
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,339
and I found the mail that I want and

452
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,409
I've recently found three females that

453
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,850
are good candidates for breeding so I'm

454
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:49,409
waiting for these plants to finish

455
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,209
before I commit to which females I'm

456
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:54,688
gonna use to continue the line into f2

457
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:55,948
but once I choose one I'm going to I'm

458
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,480
gonna choose two of them actually and

459
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:59,490
I'm going to hit both of them with the

460
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,310
male pollen and then I will keep all of

461
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,500
the seeds separate so that it's

462
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:05,789
phenotype number seven and eight are the

463
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,589
two that I'm really eyeball and for my

464
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:08,879
females so I'll keep black cherry chem

465
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:10,350
seven and black cherry chem eight

466
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,539
separate and pull all the seeds out and

467
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,430
I'll grow a hundred of each one of those

468
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:16,528
and see which one shows me what I like

469
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:18,750
and it will keep that one to continue

470
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:20,068
working with so I'll wait for these

471
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,539
plants to finish I got a smoked them I

472
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:23,009
got a dry them they're gonna turn some

473
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:24,179
of it into ABS I gotta smoke some of it

474
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:26,818
as flour I got to see which one I really

475
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:30,120
like the best and then that will be used

476
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:32,128
to make the f3 and I'm really trying to

477
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,568
stabilize the purple tree and that

478
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:36,389
strain is what I'm trying to do so I

479
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:39,870
really want right now I'm getting about

480
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:41,220
a little more than 50% purple when I run

481
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,528
a pack of 50

482
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,379
I'll have 25 purple plants I want to

483
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:48,990
make it up to closer I want to get like

484
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,490
75% purple plants out of this and then

485
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,799
by the time I'm done I'd like to see

486
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,810
that purple plant come out almost every

487
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,599
time is what I'm aiming for I plan to

488
00:16:54,809 --> 00:17:00,599
take it to f5 over the next few years

489
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,009
I'll breed the f2 s this summer one

490
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,569
thing I've seen out of it that's really

491
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,029
cool is some of the phenotypes look done

492
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:09,119
and there are only 55 days into flower

493
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:11,490
so I have made a purple strain with a

494
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,369
chem flavor that finishes in about 55 to

495
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,779
65 days which is pretty cool so that's

496
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:17,548
my black cherry chem project that's

497
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:18,859
going right now you can check out

498
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:21,629
pictures of those I put them on

499
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:23,849
Instagram and I also put them on my

500
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,579
forum on my website if you go to I read

501
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:28,829
genetics Colorado comm go to the forum

502
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,178
it would be really cool if you join the

503
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:31,710
forum sign up and join the forum it

504
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,000
doesn't cost anything nothing weird is

505
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,230
gonna happen you're just a member now

506
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,200
and you can communicate with us and

507
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:39,058
participate but every week I go and post

508
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,650
a weekly grow journal of my own gardens

509
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,178
up there and the black cherry cam has

510
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,380
been highlighted quite a bit so you can

511
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,790
see a lot of great pictures of black

512
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,980
cherry cam on my website right now

513
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:49,779
for him I'll go there to check it out if

514
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,120
you can and all if you ask me questions

515
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:53,680
there and you talk to me I really that's

516
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,179
my favorite place to go to communicate

517
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,920
with people because they can't censor me

518
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,660
because I own that Facebook can't shut

519
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,039
that down or anything so do what you

520
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,120
want to do there if I think you're a

521
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:03,009
dick I might tell you to quit being a

522
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,049
dick but then grow weed and post your

523
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:08,259
weed pictures there I'd love it alright

524
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:11,909
um one thing I can talk about is I'm

525
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:13,839
looking for an a rise male a rise is

526
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,590
golden goat that was pollinated by

527
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,929
Daybreaker

528
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:20,439
and I really love that strain it makes a

529
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:22,810
great smell it makes great flavor the

530
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,080
high is amazing the plants put on super

531
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:27,579
resin they grow in a good amount of time

532
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,049
they're real stout plants you don't need

533
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:31,210
a lot of staking on it if you find the

534
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:32,859
right phenotypes so I'm looking for an

535
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,720
arise male I want to use a rise in a

536
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:38,169
long term breeding project he will be my

537
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,549
long-term breeding male I see some

538
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,220
beautiful things from the strain and I'm

539
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:44,169
sure the a good male will make some more

540
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,390
amazing crosses the resin production

541
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,100
from that plant is so impressive but

542
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,410
it'll be a few months before I select in

543
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:52,119
a rise male I've got the feminized

544
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,220
golden goat lemon Jeffery project ahead

545
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,979
of that I've got the black cherry Kim

546
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:01,240
ahead of that and then after that will

547
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,680
be the arise male selection I want to

548
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,740
find a good arise male for my permanent

549
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,810
breeding stud but I plan to make like 15

550
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,779
to 20 f1 hybrids with the rise to see

551
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:12,159
what works when I do find that one then

552
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:14,829
I want to see what can be improved on or

553
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,930
what I need to abandon um guys when you

554
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:18,759
if you breed if you take a male plant

555
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,460
and you hit six or seven female plants

556
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:23,980
with it don't be afraid to throw away a

557
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,200
bunch of seeds when you you have to grow

558
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,329
those so you take male plant in a room

559
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,069
with like however many females you're

560
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:31,899
gonna put in there five six maybe 20

561
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:35,349
females you're gonna make that many new

562
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,540
crosses you have to grow some of each

563
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:39,039
batch of seeds yourself before you can

564
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:40,059
do anything else with them unless you

565
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,799
give them to like your friend and you

566
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,720
say these are untested dude because you

567
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,879
don't want to put out seeds with it you

568
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,029
don't know what they're gonna do so get

569
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,650
the seeds and grow at least ten I would

570
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:52,359
say a hundred if you can I know you're

571
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,100
limited on space and things I like a

572
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,349
Fino hunt of a hundred plants it really

573
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:58,480
shows you the what's gonna happen

574
00:19:56,349 --> 00:20:01,058
but grow some of those and if they

575
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,769
totally suck throw them away I know that

576
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:04,480
sounds crazy but there are enough

577
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,069
strains on the planet to where if you

578
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,650
just made some [ __ ] that doesn't

579
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:10,089
improve the genetic line throw it away

580
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,710
why do we need that

581
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,959
don't be so attached to your new

582
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,630
creation that oh it's a great strain it

583
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,759
does this it know it sucks throw it away

584
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:21,460
I have thrown away more screens than I

585
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,109
have kept we all talk about the lemon

586
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,690
cush everybody had high hopes threw the

587
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:28,029
lemon cush that I worked with that

588
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,880
strain sucked it tasted amazing and it

589
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:32,230
drew big fat donkey dicks for buds but

590
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,179
you couldn't get high off of it it would

591
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,679
not make resin none of the phenotypes on

592
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:38,350
that planet made resin and I don't know

593
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,120
why it's just that cross did not work so

594
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:41,589
all of the seeds are gone all of the

595
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,449
clones are gone that project has been

596
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:45,668
abandoned I realized that's a failed

597
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,710
project it wasted some time but I don't

598
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:49,450
want to waste more time or more people's

599
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:53,200
time with the same project by sending

600
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:55,929
out shitty seeds so that's a rant on a

601
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,130
not being too attachment that's an a

602
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,390
lesson an attachment if you're too

603
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,770
attached to that strain then you're

604
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,640
wasting your time growing something that

605
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:01,750
sucks and you could have been grown

606
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,980
something way better you could have been

607
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,150
breeding something that was way better

608
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,140
just let it go

609
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,580
sometimes you gotta learn to let things

610
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,080
go remember that lesson I talked about

611
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:09,308
my rig that I dropped you just got to

612
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,250
sweep it up and move on sometimes

613
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:15,129
alright so when I do get all these new

614
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,529
strains made I will need help testing

615
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,510
these like I said I like to run a

616
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:22,869
hundred myself but I will also send out

617
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:24,460
a bunch of seeds to reliable testers the

618
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:26,109
way that I know you're reliable tester

619
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,850
is you've joined my web forum and you

620
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:29,199
have posted pictures of your previous

621
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,279
grows on my forum and you stay in

622
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,750
contact with me

623
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:34,058
and you show that you're serious about

624
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,519
it that's a lot of how I find my testers

625
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:37,869
is off of my own website so in the

626
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:39,639
future if you're interested in testing

627
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:42,158
eye region etic seeds it would help you

628
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,809
a lot to join the forum I do play

629
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,809
favorites that way it's my choice

630
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,190
let's see I'm not sure what else to say

631
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:52,460
about IRA genetics I'm the head breeder

632
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:54,110
I make 99% of the decisions with help

633
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,579
from my friends I do let the people

634
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:57,589
around me kind of give their input

635
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:59,029
because their cannabis consumers growers

636
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:01,250
smokers they have a lot to say but

637
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:03,769
that's me I read genetics is all Rasta

638
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,059
Jeff I have trim friends that help me

639
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:06,920
shout out to everybody that's ever came

640
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:08,419
and help me trim some IRA genetic stuff

641
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,910
or shout out to all the people that have

642
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,460
helped me package seeds or whatever so

643
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,620
in the future I am going to get away

644
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,509
from the feminized seed as much because

645
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:20,349
feminized seeds are a pain in the ass to

646
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:22,759
make and I think that we should all

647
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:25,069
eventually step up our game and learn to

648
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,750
just grow regular seeds if we didn't

649
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:30,169
have male plants we wouldn't have more

650
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,809
plants anyway so it's my responsibility

651
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:36,800
to put out more regular seeds I think

652
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:38,629
than I do feminized seeds and I see um I

653
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,549
see better [ __ ] come from the regular

654
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,530
crosses then I do the FEM seeds honestly

655
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:44,539
feminized seeds are stuck you can't

656
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,660
improve on them too much the trust that

657
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,519
you make that's what you got like I see

658
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,740
when I cross like if it's feminized if I

659
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,210
cross plant a and plant B they come out

660
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,400
a little bit better than a and B were

661
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,769
but you can't make them super better if

662
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,530
I take a regular male plant and a female

663
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:01,910
plant and cross that I see much better

664
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:04,279
stuff come out of that much more

665
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:07,490
improved plants transgressive

666
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:10,039
segregation my offspring will outperform

667
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,720
each parent and that only happens when

668
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:14,119
I'm using regular pollen I can't make

669
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,390
that happen with my feminized pollen so

670
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,769
there are a couple reasons why I will

671
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,840
eventually abandon the feminized seeds

672
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:22,789
that's eventually I'm not saying soon

673
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,549
but one of these days I will stop making

674
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:27,409
FEM seeds I don't know what else to say

675
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:28,609
about IRA genetics that's uh there's so

676
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,259
much I could say but I feel like I'm

677
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:32,990
just stroking my own ego over here

678
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:36,019
talking about I rely um support I read

679
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,730
genetic student it's a Rastafarian seed

680
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:39,980
company by her Asda man so instead of

681
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,660
having mass-produced commercial seeds

682
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,420
you've got seeds every seed was touched

683
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,460
by me every plant was touched by me by

684
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,750
my Rastafarian hands so it's got a

685
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,430
little bit of Rasta love in there I

686
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,410
think that means something to me I'd

687
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,350
rather buy products from a small company

688
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:56,000
that cares about their products than the

689
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,849
Walmart of whatever industry you're in

690
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,460
alright

691
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:00,629
let's get on to another topic here I

692
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,169
mentioned that I want to talk about

693
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:06,059
feminized seeds a little bit um a lot of

694
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:08,278
people seem to have misconceptions on

695
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:10,048
what feminized seeds are on how they're

696
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:12,569
made on where they come from and on what

697
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:13,918
they will do people think that feminized

698
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:16,980
seeds are straight-up hermaphrodite

699
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,960
seeds which I've got a pretty popular

700
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,880
seed company that only sold feminized

701
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,440
seeds for two years and we came up

702
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,299
pretty good and I don't know how I

703
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,070
region etics would be popular and/or

704
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:28,528
reliable if we just sold a bunch of damn

705
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:29,849
Herms so let's start with some basics

706
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:32,269
here what does it mean to have feminized

707
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:34,319
seeds I took a few random notes

708
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:36,538
feminized seeds mean that the seeds will

709
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,908
produce all female plants I can only see

710
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:41,609
99% of female plants because this is

711
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:44,309
science and nature and [ __ ] happens but

712
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:45,839
there'll be 99% females this is helpful

713
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:48,690
because new growers don't know how to

714
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,490
identify male plants in their gardens so

715
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,960
if you're growing feminized seeds you

716
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,460
don't have to watch for the boys it also

717
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,590
makes things easier for growers with

718
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,990
limited space because the grower knows

719
00:24:55,589 --> 00:25:00,388
that every seed planted will be a usable

720
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,339
female and none of their space soil

721
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:04,138
nutrients water electricity none of

722
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:05,609
that's gonna be wasted on growing a male

723
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:07,378
plant that had to be chopped down ten

724
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:09,628
days in the flower so feminized seeds

725
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:12,178
mean that all the seeds will produce

726
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:14,548
female plants now here is where some

727
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,159
people are confused how were feminized

728
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:20,038
seeds made pay close attention because

729
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,450
honestly you guys I am I'm amazed with

730
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:22,619
myself that I'm giving out this

731
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,000
information this is one of my biggest

732
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:27,329
secrets and I don't usually share with

733
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,919
anyone I want to take a dab in a drink

734
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:30,720
before I share this but I'm gonna take a

735
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,629
quick to happen a quick drink and then I

736
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,058
will teach you guys how I make reliable

737
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:40,469
feminized seeds on a semi large scale

738
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:41,609
for nature's drain remedies and patience

739
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:46,740
throughout Colorado give me a quick

740
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:48,689
second I'm gonna take a DAB in a drink I

741
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,210
want to tell you how I make my feminized

742
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,460
seeds first of all I gotta warn you the

743
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,019
the chemicals that I will describe here

744
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,819
are a little bit dangerous and you need

745
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,589
to follow the safety rules for these I

746
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:00,240
am NOT responsible for you hurting

747
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:02,278
yourself or making yourself sick with

748
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,649
these chemicals okay I'm simply telling

749
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:06,628
you how I do this if you do this follow

750
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:08,679
the instructions wear gloves wearing

751
00:26:06,628 --> 00:26:10,839
goggles do everything safely

752
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,480
so the way I start is I order silver

753
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:17,199
nitrate and sodium thiosulfate from a

754
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:20,069
scientific supply company um I get

755
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,980
powdered versions of silver nitrate and

756
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:25,299
sodium thiosulfate and I mix I'm not

757
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,349
gonna tell you the delusions or the

758
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:32,079
rates but I mix the silver nitrate into

759
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:34,089
an amount of water and I mix an amount

760
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,639
of the thiosulfate into an amount of

761
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:38,970
water and then I mix those two in

762
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,590
another container into another container

763
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,360
and now I've got a hundred percent

764
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:46,089
silver thiosulfate in that third

765
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:49,569
container and I will dilute that to a

766
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:51,730
certain dilution now some plants will

767
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:53,950
take will need stronger delusions of the

768
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,200
silver thiosulfate and some plants will

769
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,890
need lighter delusions of the silver

770
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,580
thiosulfate what I've learned as some

771
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:05,830
plants I can treat some plants one time

772
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:08,139
with the silver thiosulfate at a high

773
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:10,359
dilution just before flower the day

774
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,830
before flower and that will work for

775
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:14,319
that plant some of them I have to make

776
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:16,869
the dilution much weaker and spray it

777
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,819
multiple times and some plants I have to

778
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:20,949
make it stronger and only spray at once

779
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:23,799
and the only way you'll learn this is

780
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:26,860
through experimentation by trying plants

781
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:29,079
by trying different delusions so I put

782
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:30,909
the silver nitrate into one container of

783
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,799
water and put the thiosulfate into

784
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,509
another container of water I shake them

785
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,549
up to where it dissolves I mix equal

786
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:38,500
amounts into another container and then

787
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:39,819
I take that container and dilute it to

788
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,509
the proper dilution for the plant that

789
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:43,720
I'm working with

790
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:45,250
then I will I'm gonna use golden goat

791
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,289
because I'm I just did this the golden

792
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,640
goat about seven days ago I took three

793
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:50,440
golden goat plants and I put them in a

794
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,060
small space where there aren't any other

795
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,279
plants around there's no wind

796
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:56,889
to where my spray is not going to

797
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,240
randomly land on other plants because I

798
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,670
don't want to reverse other plants on

799
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,079
accident in this process so I took my

800
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,930
three golden goat plants I put them in a

801
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:07,449
small confined space and I sprayed them

802
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:09,640
with my silver thiosulfate mix at the

803
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,559
proper dilution and I sprayed these

804
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,990
plants to the point where they are

805
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:15,639
dripping from top to bottom these plants

806
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,220
were covered in the silver thiosulfate

807
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,870
solution be careful because if you use

808
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,410
the silver thiosulfate at a strong

809
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:23,049
dilution

810
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:25,090
it may turn things purple like the floor

811
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:26,889
or the spray lands on the wall behind it

812
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:28,809
may turn I may leave little purple marks

813
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:31,480
so be careful or a little shiny purple

814
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:32,980
mark like shiny iridescent looking marks

815
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,089
I think is the word it's gonna need the

816
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,380
way it looks but it'll screw some stuff

817
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:39,039
up if you don't want your things purple

818
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,870
be careful so spray the plants didn't I

819
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,639
let them sit and dry because I want them

820
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:45,250
dry before they go in a flower room so I

821
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,720
let the plants dry then they carry those

822
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,569
plants to the flower room where they

823
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,029
will go into flower and I try to spray

824
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:53,619
them right before the lights off for the

825
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:55,629
flowering cycle so they get sprayed they

826
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:56,979
dry they go into the flower room and the

827
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,470
lights go off and they have now just

828
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:03,220
gone into flower and with the golden

829
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:06,220
goat I can spray it one time the day of

830
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:10,779
flower and in about 10 days that plant

831
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:13,930
will show me male flowers now people are

832
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:15,490
saying how does that work I gotta

833
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,140
explain this to you kind of slowly so

834
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,400
pay attention because I'm trying to

835
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,810
explain it to myself I don't have any

836
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,330
notes on this I'm just freestyling right

837
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:24,940
now so bear with me what happens is when

838
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:27,939
we spray a female plant with silver

839
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:30,370
thiosulfate solution the thiosulfate

840
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,960
acts as a carrier for the silver the

841
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:34,869
silver isn't really absorbed by the

842
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,819
leaves easily but the thiosulfate makes

843
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:38,500
it get in there a little bit better so

844
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:40,389
we're tricking the plants into taking

845
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,880
the silver by absorbing the thiosulfate

846
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:45,970
now when the silver reaches the plants

847
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,920
the silver disrupts the copper movement

848
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,140
in the plant system there is copper in

849
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:53,170
your plants yes the silver will disrupt

850
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,790
that when that copper movement is

851
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,710
disrupted in the plant system it

852
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:58,990
responds by triggering an ethylene

853
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,490
production or I'm sorry ethylene it

854
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,839
triggers an ethylene response it's not

855
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,630
an ethylene production it's an ethylene

856
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,879
response and that ethylene response

857
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,680
tells the plant that something is

858
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,990
seriously wrong and it's time to go into

859
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,120
survival mode so that plant survival

860
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,519
method is to create male flowers that

861
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,469
will create pollen because now all that

862
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,690
plant wants to do is shoot pollen and

863
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,029
reproduce to keep the species alive

864
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,809
so I've disrupted the copper the plants

865
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,700
freaking out

866
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:27,500
the panic causes ethylene to move

867
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,630
through the plant in a weird way that

868
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,789
ethylene triggers the plant to throw out

869
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:35,030
flowers that are male flowers that

870
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:37,909
produce pollen now since those plants

871
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:39,740
that female plant is all female it does

872
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,570
not have any male chromosomes the only

873
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,670
reason it is showing male sex parts is

874
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:47,029
because I've stressed it and manipulated

875
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:48,590
it so it will now throw out male parts

876
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:52,160
that contain pollen and though that

877
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:53,869
pollen will be all female excuse me my

878
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,190
throat's clogging up here from the dabs

879
00:30:53,869 --> 00:31:00,589
let me take another drink of water so

880
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,240
now we've got female plants that are

881
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:04,069
spitting out all female pollen and we're

882
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,620
taking that pollen and of course putting

883
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:09,919
it on female plants you know we've never

884
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:12,739
introduced any male pollen here so like

885
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,300
I said before 99% of those plants should

886
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,339
come out female and the only reason I

887
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:18,319
can see 99% is because like I said it's

888
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:21,079
science in nature and [ __ ] does happen

889
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,669
and also your grow room can cause issues

890
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,460
as well your gross style can I'm not

891
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,570
blaming it on you I'm just saying that

892
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,730
environmental factors and all that stuff

893
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:29,559
plus science and nature will lead to

894
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,480
some screw-ups

895
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:33,470
and I'll take credit for part of those

896
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,900
screw-ups because I'm the one that made

897
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:40,610
the seeds but when this is done right we

898
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:41,750
get quality reliable feminized seeds so

899
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:44,629
I hope that makes a little bit of sense

900
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:47,839
I make the cytosol fate and I spray the

901
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:50,540
plants with it and magically that makes

902
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,669
the plants turn into transsexuals

903
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:54,490
they're not male plants they're reversed

904
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:57,620
females is what we call it and that

905
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:59,210
basically is how I am making feminized

906
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:00,709
seeds so these are not hermaphrodite

907
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,569
seeds I'm not taking hermaphroditic

908
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,090
plants and using hermaphrodite pollen

909
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:07,700
I'm not doing anything crazy ridiculous

910
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,230
this is reliable science the reason a

911
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,390
lot of people are afraid of feminized

912
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:14,329
seeds is because when it was started

913
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:17,600
there were other less reliable practices

914
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:18,769
used to make phem seeds soma does

915
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,139
another method since we talked about

916
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:23,480
soma earlier in the show soma does not

917
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,560
use the silver thiosulfate method as

918
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,809
often as I do

919
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,240
what soma does is he lets his plants

920
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:30,649
grow too long so if he's got a 10-week

921
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,990
flowering plant he'll let it grow about

922
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,180
12 weeks and when a plant goes that long

923
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,059
it kind of stresses itself and then it

924
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,279
firms out and creates pollen that way

925
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:42,609
and that's what soma is using I've also

926
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,139
heard of soma taking a mature plant and

927
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:45,279
this sounds completely crazy to a lot of

928
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,620
growers but it'll make sense

929
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,690
he takes a completely mature plant and

930
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:51,819
then he will light a small fire and he

931
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:54,190
will put his plant too close to the fire

932
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:56,019
door the plant panics and the plant

933
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,850
feels like it's a forest fire coming so

934
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:00,460
that plant starts to create male flowers

935
00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:02,799
and it's a female plant it's freaking

936
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,920
out it's triggering that survival

937
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,809
instinct so it makes those male flowers

938
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,670
which make pollen and then soma collects

939
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:12,369
that pollen and sprinkles it on to other

940
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:14,110
plants and maybe this explains why

941
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:16,149
feminized seeds are so damn expensive

942
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:18,189
because there are more steps into making

943
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:20,830
feminized seeds than there are to making

944
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,900
regular true breeding male female seeds

945
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:24,970
that's why it's hard for me to keep up

946
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,560
because I have to reverse plants and I

947
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,180
don't get as much pollen from reversing

948
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,460
these plants as I do from a normal male

949
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:33,490
and it takes a little longer

950
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:35,470
alright I feel like I told you enough

951
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,789
about reversing plants I think you

952
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,710
should have caught on by now like I said

953
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:41,649
you're gonna have to experiment with the

954
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,690
delusions and the application rates um

955
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,460
in edie Rosenthal's book I don't have it

956
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:47,559
next me the Oaksterdam chorus guide

957
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,269
they had wrote the most not even sure

958
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,950
that it's the most current but ed

959
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:53,049
Rosenthal wrote an Oaksterdam course

960
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:56,500
guide and in that book there is a recipe

961
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:58,419
to make your own silver thiosulfate that

962
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,890
recipe does work although for some

963
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,340
plants it will need some adjusting

964
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:05,350
that's just my advice alright I am going

965
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:06,819
to take a phat dab and take a drink and

966
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:07,629
try to get this frog out of my throat so

967
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:09,579
that I can sound like an actual

968
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,898
podcaster give me one second I'll be

969
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:13,179
right back guys and we will give some

970
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,589
shoutouts and wrap up the show alright

971
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,668
guys I'm back I won't apologize for

972
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,740
taking so many breaks on you this

973
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:19,389
episode usually I have some guests that

974
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,918
can cover me while in coffin and taking

975
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:22,329
a drink or whatever but today was just

976

Colorado Springs I don't shop at a lot

983
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:40,480
of dispensaries because I'm

984
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,699
self-sufficient but I was low on chatter

985
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,579

986
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:47,289

997
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:08,690

999
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,389
they have quite a few tiers of pricing I

1000
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:13,279
don't want to get you pumped up because

1001
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:16,190

1002
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,600

about this sean is going to drop some

1197
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,920
knowledge on you guys today that is

1198
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:58,340
going to [ __ ] up your whole thought

1199
00:42:45,920 --> 00:43:02,289
process that Mike has impotency problems

1200
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:06,289
it likes to droop after a while I'm not

1201
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:10,730
my word is not law by any means but this

1202
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:13,449
is just my how I grew this is what I

1203
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:17,179
have discovered through my personal

1204
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:22,129
studies but I just want to say stop

1205
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:25,338
using molasses in your teas and yeah I

1206
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:28,309
mean completely and the main reason is

1207
00:43:25,338 --> 00:43:30,170
is a lot of people are using molasses on

1208
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:31,460
a regular basis typically when you ask

1209
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,858
somebody what they're using in your

1210
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,139
compost tea and the same for me um I

1211
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:38,389
think probably on the first episode I

1212
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:42,230
probably even recommended certain rates

1213
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:44,269
to use molasses at I think to not you

1214
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:46,519
know sue I mean you just this is an

1215
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:50,358
evolving industry everything changes we

1216
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:52,579
learn as we go but uh so I cut more I

1217
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:53,809
heard a while ago basically you need to

1218
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:56,000
quit use them somebody told me you need

1219
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:57,920
to quit using molasses I said why and

1220
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,809
they order you know I'll get back to you

1221
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,909
I never heard from him again

1222
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:04,690
but it's stuck in my head so I quit

1223
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:06,608
using molasses just cut it out and

1224
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,088
I didn't see a difference you know I

1225
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:11,619
mean it's not like things quit working

1226
00:44:09,088 --> 00:44:13,059
so it's not acting like the but hardener

1227
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:14,980
and the sweeter like we think it is

1228
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:19,029
maybe yeah you know I didn't I didn't

1229
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:20,530
see it I'm doing my thing and then I get

1230
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:23,490
back in touch with this person and we

1231
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:25,900
kind of discussed a little more and a

1232
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:27,789
lot of people like I was saying for a

1233
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,740
basic compost tea what I used to

1234
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:33,699
recommend and what a lot of people are

1235
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:35,799
using her earthworm castings or Alaskan

1236
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:39,219
houmous or some sort of humic acid

1237
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,859
they're using molasses and then they're

1238
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:45,009
using like a kelp meal or something well

1239
00:44:41,858 --> 00:44:47,170
the reason that you use that molasses

1240
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,540
and the tea is actually not for the

1241
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:52,480
reason that you had mentioned early when

1242
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:55,389
you use excuse me when you use the

1243
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,490
molasses and a tea it's not for not so

1244
00:44:55,389 --> 00:44:59,889
much as a bud hardener for the airplane

1245
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:01,838
it's not so much a carbohydrate for the

1246
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:06,039
plant as it is a food source for the

1247
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:08,828
microbes and the tea right okay and the

1248
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:11,079
thing with molasses is it's a simple

1249
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:14,349
carbohydrate and simple carbohydrates

1250
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:17,589
feed simple organisms and that's the

1251
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:20,920
simplest way to say it so molasses is an

1252
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:22,989
extremely strong bacterial food you've

1253
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,088
probably heard before that marijuana is

1254
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:29,019
a fungal Dom in a plant they like fungal

1255
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:30,639
dominant ease especially in flour so by

1256
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:35,440
using molasses you're gonna be

1257
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:39,309
encouraging bacterial growth well the

1258
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:43,539
molasses not only feeds the bacteria but

1259
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:45,460
it feeds it an enormous rate bacteria is

1260
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:47,199
naturally occurring it's everywhere it's

1261
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:50,800
already in the soil it's on our skin

1262
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:52,779
it's everywhere and in between so it's

1263
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,400
already gonna be there in your teeth

1264
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,800
it's gonna be in your water it's gonna

1265
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,150
be in your soil you know probably some

1266
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,530
of it's already gonna be in molasses so

1267
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:05,050
there's plenty of bacteria out there as

1268
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:08,450
you add this molasses you start to feed

1269
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:10,280
this bacteria and the bacteria starts to

1270
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:14,088
eat the food and they start to digest

1271
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:16,190
and what happens is the growth of the

1272
00:46:14,088 --> 00:46:19,070
bacteria happens too fast and the

1273
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,320
organisms will actually use up all of

1274
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:23,329
the available food and oxygen resources

1275
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,200
so you actually drop the dissolved

1276
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:28,670
oxygen levels in your tea so putting

1277
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:30,799
molasses in your AACT

1278
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:32,358
will take out one of those days it will

1279
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,670
make it go anaerobic and you will no

1280
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:37,659
longer be having an aerated compost tea

1281
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,588
despite you having bubblers running

1282
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:41,899
you're still gonna take out the oxygen

1283
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:44,269
you lower the dissolved oxygen levels

1284
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,858
then you're just harvesting anaerobic

1285
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:47,269
bacteria basically killing off

1286
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:49,309
everything we're working to create

1287
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:51,530
exactly by adding the thing that we

1288
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:53,869
thought was fueling our fire exactly

1289
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:56,210
okay by adding molasses you're just

1290
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:58,820
taking out everything that you just put

1291
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:02,389
all of your money and time into you're

1292
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,980
just growing the bacteria to phenomenal

1293
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:06,348
rate they're out competing everything

1294
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,838
else and that's eventually what you put

1295
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:11,420
on your plant I just googled fungal

1296
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:14,029
dominance we can do an entire episode on

1297
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,710
that just by what I'm reading yes if you

1298
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:17,000
want to catch up google fungal dominance

1299
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:19,280
I can't even begin to explain it there

1300
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,019
is so much going on and fungal dominance

1301
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,859
Wow that'll change your thinking but

1302
00:47:21,019 --> 00:47:27,858
right there yeah definitely so with the

1303
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:30,769
teas like I was saying it so when you

1304
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:32,989
add the molasses it can drop the

1305
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:35,239
dissolved oxygen levels for anybody

1306
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:38,389
who's listening here wants to know

1307
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:40,159
specifically above eight parts per

1308
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:41,629
million of dissolved oxygen is where you

1309
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,899
want your teas that's when you're

1310
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:46,550
brewing aerobic organisms between six

1311
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,130
parts per million and aist parts per

1312
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:51,560
million you are facilitating anaerobic

1313
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:53,539
zones these organisms out-compete the

1314
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:56,500
aerobic organisms at a rate of two to

1315
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:58,818
one these facilitate anaerobic zones

1316
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,019
this is where some really nasty things

1317
00:47:58,818 --> 00:48:02,610
live

1318
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:06,059
these things are in your compost you

1319
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:08,010
were like these bad organisms are in

1320
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:10,079
your compost such as you know really

1321
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:13,380
anaerobic or e.coli or these other

1322
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,809
things just nasties they're gonna

1323
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,059
multiply at an alarming rate once you

1324
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:19,980
start and creating this anaerobic

1325
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:22,079
environment and if you use that as a

1326
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,969
foliar spray you just sprayed eco light

1327
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,949
under your plants right yeah and that's

1328
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:27,719
the thing is they actually like when you

1329
00:48:25,949 --> 00:48:29,549
your tea starts to do that the organisms

1330
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:31,859
are produce acids that kill anaerobic

1331
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:33,330
organisms and high enough qualities

1332
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:36,960
these acids can stress and kill your

1333
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:39,349
plant you know growing environment

1334
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,440
anywhere is there a shortage of bacteria

1335
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:46,130
so there's no need to just feed more of

1336
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,570
them and stress your plants out and

1337
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:52,440
there's other options instead of

1338
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:55,440
molasses so right off the bat just cut

1339
00:48:52,440 --> 00:49:01,139
it out so if you want to do a tea what I

1340
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:03,450
would recommend would be okay but yeah

1341
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:07,980
so if you're gonna start a tea I would

1342
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:14,609
just go with worm castings I would go

1343
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:16,949
with kelp meal and that's just about it

1344
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:18,360
castings and kelp meal yeah I'm sorry

1345
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:20,429
I'm trying to any I've got everything

1346
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,420
right now so yeah there you go he's got

1347
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:23,159
a whole computer and further than you

1348
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,420
guys had to come prepared

1349
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:25,799
he came well-prepared I kind of peeked

1350
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,470
at his notes a minute ago he's got a lot

1351
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,930
of info yes so we've got so basically

1352
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:32,909
for a really basic compost tea I'm gonna

1353
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:37,230
roll with dr. Alaine Ingram's compost

1354
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:39,629
tea so her teas are basically compost or

1355
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:45,780
you know worm castings or whatever you

1356
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:48,690
can source kelp meal and then you can

1357
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:51,060
add in instead of molasses you can add

1358
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:53,700
in a humic source so you can add in like

1359
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:55,469
a humic acid derived from peat like a

1360
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:58,889
dragon fire with medicines brilliant

1361
00:49:55,469 --> 00:50:00,539
black there's a lot actually yeah

1362
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:02,288
there's a lot of different options out

1363
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,389
there but you can add in a few

1364
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:08,289
acid or in that place you could add

1365
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:11,318
enough fish hide really so for your bass

1366
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:14,589
T's every time I would just go with worm

1367
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:17,048
castings in water outside of that you

1368
00:50:14,588 --> 00:50:18,759
can add in kelp meal or alfalfa meal or

1369
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:21,909
anything like that specific to your

1370
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:23,889
stage your plant stage in life and then

1371
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:26,379
if you want to start adding foods for

1372
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:29,918
the fungi basically if you're in veg

1373
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:32,499
fish hydro slate also for vegetative

1374
00:50:29,918 --> 00:50:34,509
growth instead of using molasses replace

1375
00:50:32,498 --> 00:50:37,899
it with fish Hydra sleep now fish hide

1376
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:39,998
really it can it can go the same way as

1377
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:43,028
molasses it can turn your tea anaerobic

1378
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:44,918
really fast and I know you're probably

1379
00:50:43,028 --> 00:50:46,958
thinking anaerobic well you know you

1380
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:49,748
I've personally talked about anaerobic

1381
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:51,159
teas and do Kashi and all of these

1382
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:52,178
things which is you know they're

1383
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:55,149
actually integrate with fermentation

1384
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:57,039
sinaner it in terrific compost that's

1385
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:59,889
completely different that's because we

1386
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:02,799
want anaerobic environments we don't

1387
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:06,219
want anaerobic bacteria in our aerobic

1388
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:12,208
teas okay you know so they're separate

1389
00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:12,208
but equal that you are exactly

1390
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:17,018
fermenting don't let oxygen get into it

1391
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:23,708
and when you're reading don't let it go

1392
00:51:17,018 --> 00:51:26,828
stagnant so as far as food for your teas

1393
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:30,098
like I was saying if you need to improve

1394
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:31,929
your fungal count which everybody wants

1395
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:34,479
to everybody wants a fungal Domenic

1396
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:38,349
you can add a steel-cut oat bran or

1397
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:42,879
steel-cut oat bran Crowder shrimp pills

1398
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:44,679
I mean there's any sort of really any

1399
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,608
sort of like high protein we can just

1400
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:47,189
pick that up at the health food store

1401
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:49,989
you can pick all of that alright

1402
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:52,178
actually there's a lot of like it seen a

1403
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:54,759
lot of stuff on people or people are

1404
00:51:52,179 --> 00:52:00,130
starting to consume like fish Hydra

1405
00:51:54,759 --> 00:52:01,449
slaves and stuff I mean I wouldn't be

1406
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:05,119
surprised if you can pick that up at the

1407
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:11,970
health food store soon eventually right

1408
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:13,619
but yes so just molasses I mean take it

1409
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:16,019
how you want it you know take it or

1410
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:19,440
leave it I recommend cutting it out I

1411
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:22,139
think I've learned from very reputable

1412
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:26,760
sources and you know they're these

1413
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:29,250
aren't people just you know talking [ __ ]

1414
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,390
these are real scientists these guys are

1415
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:33,659
sitting there in front of their

1416
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:35,819
microscopes and they're strain in their

1417
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:37,589
minds in their eyes so we don't have to

1418
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,210
know I don't think you need to try to

1419
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,590
give yourself any sort of credit or your

1420
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:42,119
sources you've been on here enough and I

1421
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:46,650
think people have realized that you are

1422
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:49,440
definitely not full of [ __ ] well thank

1423
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:50,789
you we respect your opinion well thank

1424
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,409
you I've been at this for years and you

1425
00:52:50,789 --> 00:52:56,460
teach me stuff every time you come I

1426
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:59,099
really appreciate it yes I mean just cut

1427
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,710
cut the molasses out of your teas I used

1428
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:04,139
to use it every [ __ ] day and like

1429
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:06,210
every time my last batch of tea you know

1430
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:08,549
I didn't see much of a difference I used

1431
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:10,289
I used used to use your recommendation

1432
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,539
or the Rebs recommendation of molasses

1433
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:15,119
MIT and I made a tea just a few days ago

1434
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:17,279
with some focus bucket leachate in there

1435
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,529
and I actually got way more foam without

1436
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,280
the molasses on that bucket than I've

1437
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,600
ever made

1438
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,490
that's the best you have ever made was

1439
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,549
my most recent without the molasses yeah

1440
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:29,599
I mean love yeah you're gonna get better

1441
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:32,700
results using beneficial microorganisms

1442
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,679
using things like cold processed fish hi

1443
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:36,539
drew Slade like the Browns fish hide

1444
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:39,059
really you grab from Rocky Mount worm

1445
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:42,599
company or you can make your own fish

1446
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:45,960
hide really but those food sources work

1447
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:47,759
way better they're way more natural but

1448
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,289
just like us if we eat natural food our

1449
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,760
body absorbs it much more naturally pull

1450
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:55,170
out the nutrients and poop out the crap

1451
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,970
instead you're able to absorb what

1452
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:59,650
you're eating it should be so you can

1453
00:53:56,969 --> 00:54:01,209
eaten a pop-tart or an apple yeah

1454
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:06,910
you know how does your body run off of

1455
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:08,500
it but uh yeah the so forties just keep

1456
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:12,819
it simpler the better

1457
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:14,800
you know just run your castings run you

1458
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:17,680
know your kelp if you want to add a food

1459
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,230
source you can I like I really like fish

1460
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:22,210
hide really during veg you see

1461
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,320
tremendous vegetative growth and then

1462
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:25,690
that's how you really step away from

1463
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,309
bottled nutrients you know that way if

1464
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:30,280
you are using bottled nutrients the only

1465
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:33,210
one you're using is a fish product what

1466
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:37,570
are we using what are we using to feed

1467
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:40,289
vt in bloom you keep saying surfer if

1468
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:42,940
you're gonna feed your tea and bloom

1469
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:45,670
soft rock phosphate there we go yeah

1470
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:47,530
that's a lot in your GT so sorry

1471
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:49,150
phosphate but that goes right back in

1472
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:51,190
till you need to know what you're using

1473
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:53,260
how much you're using where you're

1474
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,820
sourcing it from you go and you dump

1475
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:58,210
astronomical amount of stuff rock

1476
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:00,010
phosphate on your plant you're gonna you

1477
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:02,409
know like I said that goes right back to

1478
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:04,120
you can be organic and you can be worse

1479
00:55:02,409 --> 00:55:06,129
than all your synthetic buddies out

1480
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:09,309
there right I actually I think I

1481
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:10,960
overused some OGT because I wasn't I was

1482
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:12,219
thinking oh so GT let's [ __ ] it up so I

1483
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,510
fed it instead of every two weeks I was

1484
00:55:12,219 --> 00:55:15,699
doing it every week because I wasn't

1485
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,320
paying attention and I think the plants

1486
00:55:15,699 --> 00:55:18,219
sped up too much like you said because

1487
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,050
they were burnt they were showing

1488
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:21,730
nitrogen deficiencies in like week five

1489
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:25,900
yeah and I think they're just going to

1490
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:27,670
fix like the trichoderma the experience

1491
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,280
that they have in there but he has soft

1492
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:32,590
rock phosphate also in there which works

1493
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,800
as a food for the microbes you know it's

1494
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:37,900
a fungal food but you can also get your

1495
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,090
phosphates obviously from introducing

1496
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:43,660
that into the tea so it's a great that's

1497
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:45,760
a great source of if you need a blue tea

1498
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:47,799
for say theoretically you should have

1499
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,800
all of that a minute in your soil and

1500
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,450
it'll just kind of take up what it wants

1501
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,750
which kind of rolls into what we were

1502
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:57,219
yeah that was our original idea today

1503
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,980
was to talk about building a little bit

1504
00:55:57,219 --> 00:56:01,750
of soil so I believe you I like you guys

1505
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,159
molasses is unnecessary those are

1506
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:06,550
old-school farmer tricks we were taught

1507
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:08,829
that uh try it yourself make us do a

1508
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:10,060
test run set one set of plants on one

1509
00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:11,980
side of the room one set on the other

1510
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:14,380
add molasses to one say

1511
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,789
tea or however you're feeding ad Milan

1512
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:18,280
don't add molasses together see the

1513
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:19,869
difference for yourself it's you're not

1514
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,000
gonna see enough difference to like

1515
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:23,890
break the bank or anything so give it a

1516
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,320
try yeah and I mean keep your molasses

1517
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:29,949
around I use it for plenty of stuff f

1518
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:31,840
PJ's a lot of the yeah a lot of the

1519
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:34,059
Korean farming techniques that I do

1520
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,740
a lot of the homemade fertilizers I use

1521
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:39,608
molasses and like I said if you're gonna

1522
00:56:35,739 --> 00:56:41,469
use it for your sweetener purposes or

1523
00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:43,840
your hardener purposes or your foliar

1524
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:46,059
sprays or if you use it for stuff but

1525
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,150
don't use it for the teas food source

1526
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:50,769
and don't use it every time don't use it

1527
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,660
for your teas food source guys we're

1528
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:54,070
over or like over amping the tea

1529
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:56,920
basically we're making hyper little tea

1530
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:59,230
is all little kids just like sugar yeah

1531
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:04,480
they're all competing everybody yeah all

1532
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:07,539
right so you have four soil mixes for

1533
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,599
this one I know that everybody has their

1534
00:57:07,539 --> 00:57:13,619
own mix everybody has their way of doing

1535
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:17,500
things they're super soils and there's

1536
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:19,960
layers and there's no till there's a

1537
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,670
million ways to do everything so I just

1538
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,579
I figured maybe the best way to go about

1539
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:26,950
it would be to kind of just discuss you

1540
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:30,880
know what what they are so okay that

1541
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:34,809
sounds great yes a super soil super

1542
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:40,329
soils are a term for a nutrient charged

1543
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:43,210
soil a sub cool is the father of super

1544
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:47,019
so yeah cool made it really famous and

1545
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:50,139
basically the idea is you're gonna

1546
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:51,820
create this nutrient rich mixture soil

1547
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:53,799
and you're gonna layer the bottom if

1548
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:57,789
your pot with it and then you're gonna

1549
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:59,410
plant your plant actually into a less

1550
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:02,259
hot medium like so you would use a

1551
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:04,269
bagged soil and you would take your five

1552
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:06,609
gallon container and you fill the bottom

1553
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:10,449
so many inches up with your super soil

1554
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:12,159
mix and then add in your bag soil and

1555
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:13,960
then actually transplant you're playing

1556
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:17,618
into it theoretically you water your

1557
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:20,420
plant the roots grow through the bagged

1558
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:22,820
soil medium into the super soil

1559
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,590
then you never have to fertilize your

1560
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,240
plant you can just always feed a water

1561
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:28,280
you know every times everything

1562
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:33,159
everything's already mixed cannabis oil

1563
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:38,300
bottle so that's one method of mixing

1564
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:40,699
another method for a lot of people is

1565
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:44,450
just like a complete through-and-through

1566
00:58:40,699 --> 00:58:47,509
mix so like a dragon fire if medicine

1567
00:58:44,449 --> 00:58:50,989
just does it really really awesome mix

1568
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:53,390
where they do it's similar to the super

1569
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:55,189
soil but it's actually incorporated

1570
00:58:53,389 --> 00:58:57,230
throughout the entire mix okay so you

1571
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:59,179
don't like the whole thing exactly so

1572
00:58:57,230 --> 00:59:01,789
there is no like layering and you don't

1573
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:04,129
pad it with you know other soil what

1574
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:06,800
they'll do is they they make their soil

1575
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:09,380
and then they do what's a term called

1576
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,690
cooking which is just composting so they

1577
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:13,490
let their soil sit for a couple of weeks

1578
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:16,429
or a month you know the longer the

1579
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:18,709
bedroom and by doing that you can really

1580
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:20,119
encourage natural processes and if you

1581
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:21,409
go to Dragonfly with medicines feed

1582
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:24,799
they've got some really cool things

1583
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:25,879
about how they'll you know if the soil

1584
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,910
that's cooking they'll treat with

1585
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,769
[ __ ] and lactic acid bacteria and

1586
00:59:28,909 --> 00:59:32,299
they pour all their excess compost teas

1587
00:59:30,769 --> 00:59:35,150
on it and you can do these things too

1588
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:36,950
while your soil cooks but they do them

1589
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:40,369
like really it's more of a botanical

1590
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:42,859
mixture they use like a kelp meal

1591
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:44,719
alfalfa nettle you can go to their

1592
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,990
website to their feats and kind of find

1593
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:49,069
out I don't want to give away all their

1594
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:50,049
got some check out dragon flavors

1595
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,280
medicine will get them on the show

1596
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:53,480
they're in Canada they said they were

1597
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,430
gonna come here and then they had to go

1598
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:58,849
back to Canada or Washington there right

1599
00:59:55,429 --> 01:00:00,230
bike in Pacific Northwest they're just

1600
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:03,019
holding it down up there actually

1601
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:09,019
they're in Europe right now if they went

1602
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:10,159
to like Prague do an interview with me

1603
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:11,289
and they're gonna tell me about all the

1604
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:13,599
things they've seen around the world

1605
01:00:11,289 --> 01:00:16,329
that'll be great yeah but they've been

1606
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:19,940
protecting the soil mix for a while and

1607
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:22,549
you know I mention them cuz they do like

1608
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,900
a completely botanical base you know

1609
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:26,030
everything's plant-based with their

1610
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:28,650
mixes I know a lot of other people are

1611
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:32,280
traditionally doing especially like with

1612
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:35,250
the Rev and some other people moonshine

1613
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:38,430
man and there's a lot other mixes out

1614
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:42,059
there which you're all bone meal blood

1615
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:44,579
meal phosphates it's real similar to sub

1616
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:46,170
cools mix but it's the same idea that

1617
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:48,090
you mix it throughout the whole batch

1618
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:50,159
and you let it cook for a period of time

1619
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:52,309
and then you go into it and we gotta get

1620
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,960
away from the blood meal the bone yeah

1621
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:59,759
yeah there's an alternative to mania

1622
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,720
bone meal a soft rock phosphate comfrey

1623
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,300
metal yarrow

1624
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:07,939
fishbone meal there's other options

1625
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:10,830
blood meal which is your nitrogen source

1626
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,820
yeah there's I don't even need to like

1627
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:16,380
get in there there's so many other

1628
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:18,150
nitrogen alfalfa yeah there's there's so

1629
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,090
many other nitrogen sources I don't even

1630
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:22,410
need to cover that but uh I mean

1631
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:26,370
definitely source where your products

1632
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:33,089
are coming from me personally I go with

1633
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:36,329
a very simple mix I use typically I like

1634
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:40,440
to mix my own soil base the best mixture

1635
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:43,819
I've ever used personally was it's a

1636
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:48,809
product called Malibu compost it's a

1637
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:50,039
biodynamic compost blend it's [ __ ]

1638
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:52,199
awesome it's only available in

1639
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,849
California it's really hard to get here

1640
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:56,789
I was fortunate enough to come across a

1641
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:58,440
couple of bags and it was probably some

1642
01:01:56,789 --> 01:02:00,599
of the best properties but it takes

1643
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,039
compost it's not a soil mix whose in

1644
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:03,809
California that can send us a couple of

1645
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:05,849
bags of that hook me up please

1646
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:07,440
here we need that Malibu compost I'll

1647
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:09,449
give you my p.o box number just took me

1648
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,340
up yeah but it's a biodynamic blintz

1649
01:02:09,449 --> 01:02:13,139
they have like yarrow and nettle and up

1650
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:17,039
dandy lines and all sorts of cool stuff

1651
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:19,650
mixed in there but uh so I used so I'll

1652
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,960
use a compost and then cut it in with

1653
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:24,599
perlite I'm not sorry not perfectly I

1654
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,570
use a compost I think I cut it in with

1655
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:28,650
worm castings so I make my own like

1656
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:30,220
vermicompost

1657
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:33,340
so use the

1658
01:02:30,219 --> 01:02:35,949
yeah the Malibu's compost Rocky Mount

1659
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:39,670
worm castings and then I'll add in an

1660
01:02:35,949 --> 01:02:41,139
aerator which is typically a lot of

1661
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:44,470
people use perlite

1662
01:02:41,139 --> 01:02:48,069
I don't like perlite so much so I use a

1663
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:50,529
Diana might because I've got a huge bag

1664
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:52,390
of it I've had for like years I'm still

1665
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:54,970
working through it but you can use like

1666
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:58,179
Pumas or lava rock I'd like to recommend

1667
01:02:54,969 --> 01:03:00,099
people use things that don't go away as

1668
01:02:58,179 --> 01:03:03,009
fast you know

1669
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:05,500
perlite floats to the top and it grinds

1670
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:07,960
up really fine and it just kind of goes

1671
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:11,110
away to nothing but I always recommend

1672
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:13,539
people to do like 50 percent like lava

1673
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:15,490
rock or Pumas or Diana my something that

1674
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:18,070
doesn't break down as quick and then do

1675
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:20,409
another 50 the other half do like a rice

1676
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:23,970
whole or buckwheat whole okay or some

1677
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:26,559
more of a carbon-based aerator alright

1678
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:29,559
so yeah we put in our aerator and then

1679
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,090
after your compost in your aerator then

1680
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:33,489
you make the decision of whether or not

1681
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:37,030
you're gonna want to use coco coir or

1682
01:03:33,489 --> 01:03:41,589
peat moss I like peat moss but I like

1683
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:44,490
the environment to all comes from like

1684
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:47,170
one swamp in Canada or something

1685
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:48,879
organics it seems like it's always

1686
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,930
awesome but it's not always the best you

1687
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,780
just kind of got to pick what you want

1688
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:56,349
I've actually found best result I like a

1689
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:57,550
mixture of cocoa and peat moss there's

1690
01:03:56,349 --> 01:03:59,110
something about the oils that come from

1691
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:01,620
the cocoa fibers that the plant really

1692
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:03,910
likes yeah I have really like a mix of

1693
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:05,170
I've been plenty to take a DAB so you

1694
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:06,039
better keep talking oh you again yeah

1695
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:13,930
I've been playing around with different

1696
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:15,880
ratios 50 50 75 25 of cocoa 2 peat moss

1697
01:04:13,929 --> 01:04:19,149
but I kind of like a half-and-half

1698
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:21,700
mixture with it and then outside of that

1699
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:24,130
will go in and then add a kelp meal

1700
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:28,029
crustacean neem oyster shell powder

1701
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:29,619
glacial rock dust jimson if we really

1702
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:32,410
want to get into it we'll add your

1703
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:34,449
biochar mukashi and a lot of other

1704
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:36,819
natural farming inputs but that's

1705
01:04:34,449 --> 01:04:40,269
personally for like my home growth I can

1706
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:42,340
give into it with that stuff but you

1707
01:04:40,269 --> 01:04:43,960
guys can't - listen to this episode hit

1708
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:45,760
pause and rewind all that stuff and

1709
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,470
listen back and make a list and if you

1710
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,420
can't afford to buy a bunch of [ __ ] by

1711
01:04:47,469 --> 01:04:51,219
the first - yeah and the next time buy

1712
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,019
the buy three of them and then you'll

1713
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:54,819
make a better soil every every time and

1714
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:56,079
we'll start you'll start seeing good you

1715
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:58,330
should get great results right often I

1716
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,799
usually if you think if you if you play

1717
01:04:58,329 --> 01:05:02,380
it back and you think it's too

1718
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:05,019
overwhelming I see what I do work with

1719
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:06,730
the dispensaries a lot you know I run a

1720
01:05:05,019 --> 01:05:09,579
consultation company so if any of you

1721
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:11,170
guys out there know anybody who I hate

1722
01:05:09,579 --> 01:05:13,360
the word column i interesting i'm we do

1723
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:15,159
consultations but if anybody out there

1724
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,900
wants to switch you know any facilities

1725
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:19,239
that want to switch we're all licensed

1726
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,950
over here natural farming and you know

1727
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:22,509
we've got our cards we can go in and

1728
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:24,939
help your favorite grow convert to

1729
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:27,340
organics but I work with a couple of

1730
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:29,110
different shops and they always seem a

1731
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:31,030
little overwhelmed when I come in there

1732
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:33,130
and I started running my mouth about

1733
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:34,960
mixing soils and you're gonna get this

1734
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:37,210
and this and you're gonna mix it

1735
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,500
together and it's overwhelming they like

1736
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:41,170
that when you can walk in there and you

1737
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:43,599
can be like yep buy a pallet of this you

1738
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:45,940
want a pallet of that so I've actually

1739
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:48,610
got a mixture for everybody out there

1740
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,750
who wants to go and just buy a pallet of

1741
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:52,780
soil or you want to go buy a bale of

1742
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:56,170
pro-mix or some sunshine for so just go

1743
01:05:52,780 --> 01:06:00,130
and grab your sunshine for your Pro mix

1744
01:05:56,170 --> 01:06:02,800
I recommend cutting in worm castings 10%

1745
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:05,800
for your microbial source

1746
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:07,060
then I would just add in depending on

1747
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,460
what you're going with so if you go with

1748
01:06:07,059 --> 01:06:11,559
like a sunshine for Advance they've got

1749
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:14,260
like a nutrient starter pack which is I

1750
01:06:11,559 --> 01:06:17,469
think there's some like minerals in

1751
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:19,360
there other things like that yeah that

1752
01:06:17,469 --> 01:06:22,269
one's a really good one to go with and

1753
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:27,940
then just add in your worm castings kelp

1754
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:29,409
meal mmm cake and crustacean meal or

1755
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:31,360
oyster shell powder just kind of

1756
01:06:29,409 --> 01:06:34,149
depending on how you want to grow

1757
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:35,769
personally okay but that's it that's

1758
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:38,050
that's a good start right there I've

1759
01:06:35,769 --> 01:06:40,750
I've tried them out like right now if

1760
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:43,780
you go to the king underscore Cola feed

1761
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:46,719
on Instagram you can look at the there's

1762
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:48,880
pictures of worms just all over the

1763
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:51,099
containers and your top soils move in

1764
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:54,340
and that's actually all done in sunshine

1765
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:56,860
for with kelp mean crustacean an oyster

1766
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:58,539
shell fabric nice I really simple I mean

1767
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:01,870
I feel like I'm getting some of the best

1768
01:06:58,539 --> 01:07:04,989
results that I've ever had with this

1769
01:07:01,869 --> 01:07:06,639
super the between this mix and then the

1770
01:07:04,989 --> 01:07:08,289
mix I'd mentioned earlier with Malibu

1771
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:10,089
compost are probably the two best

1772
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:14,409
results I've gotten since I've started

1773
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:17,380
okay it's so hard to source a solid like

1774
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:21,809
place to get compost so if you can't do

1775
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:21,809
that and you can't make your own compost

1776
01:07:26,789 --> 01:07:32,889
[Music]

1777
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:33,850
over the past three or four weeks I

1778
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:35,589
don't know how long I've been talking

1779
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:38,949
about the [ __ ] bucket but I see it

1780
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:41,950
turning into funk inside that bucket and

1781
01:07:38,949 --> 01:07:43,359
I will have that's a five-gallon bucket

1782
01:07:41,949 --> 01:07:45,730
essentially I'll have five gallons of

1783
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,680
compost to add to a whole bunch of dirt

1784
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:49,570
and then a month or two I will have my

1785
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:53,199
own amazing compost started from May

1786
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:57,309
exactly and I mean even they even buying

1787
01:07:53,199 --> 01:08:00,069
soil from the store using the nicest

1788
01:07:57,309 --> 01:08:04,570
castings that money can buy like Rocky

1789
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:06,820
Mount warm castings and it's still crazy

1790
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:08,410
and then after amending the soil soil

1791
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:10,120
it's amazing how cheap this stuff comes

1792
01:08:08,409 --> 01:08:12,759
out I'm not gonna say the name of this

1793
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:15,369
thick shot that I'm working for but

1794
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:19,060
I will say that they're running 488 20

1795
01:08:15,369 --> 01:08:22,630
gallons and when we priced him out at $1

1796
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:28,359
20 per gallon of soil wow that's amazing

1797
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:30,600
so suckle now and synthetics and that's

1798
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:34,150
for a dispensary so they have to rely on

1799
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,470
quality products I hate to sneak in a

1800
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:37,689
commercial but I have to do them and

1801
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:39,279

1882
01:11:02,609 --> 01:11:06,179
own soil or do you want to talk about

1883
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:08,100
something different no I think that's it

1884
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:10,440
this is a good point to go back to high

1885
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,429
gray oh I do want to mention because I

1886
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:14,759
feel like we've been taught I don't want

1887
01:11:11,429 --> 01:11:16,949
to know be other people we're talking

1888
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,659
about no I mean because I was telling

1889
01:11:16,948 --> 01:11:22,649
people to go and grab soil mix you know

1890
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:26,009
yeah yeah I work with Jesse a little bit

1891
01:11:22,649 --> 01:11:27,689
and we'll try to get we'll call it a

1892
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:29,219
Rocky Mountain natural farming mix up

1893
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:30,539
there for you at the stores I mean they

1894
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:31,829
already carry in the soil they've

1895
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:34,279
already got the castings up there

1896
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:36,899
they've got grow Kashi up there yeah

1897
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:39,000
yeah you talked to Jesse we can get you

1898
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:41,420
fixed with the Rocky Mountain a chiral

1899
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,639
farming mix which is like I said it's

1900
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:47,850
mean pro-mix sunshine for kelp

1901
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:50,279
crustacean mean get to rockin well

1902
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:52,050
pretty good hey guys here's my idea I

1903
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:54,000
want you to set up one little section

1904
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:57,270
just a shelf so we can just walk right

1905
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,520
there and get this stuff like it'll be

1906
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:01,440
the girl from your heart rocky mountain

1907
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,630
worm castings Highgrove indoor growing

1908
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:06,619
supplies little bonus section and just

1909
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:09,179
go right there be some girl Kashi there

1910
01:12:06,619 --> 01:12:12,329
for you to be so awesome let's do this

1911
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:14,369
guy's that's my proposal to you guys if

1912
01:12:12,329 --> 01:12:16,469
you can't if you can't source compost

1913
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:20,010
and all of that jazz then go to your

1914
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:22,439
local hydro store high-growth and grab

1915
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:25,199
your bagged soil get you some basic

1916
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:28,169
amendments and the the trick is is to

1917
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:31,169
figure out what works for you I don't

1918
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:32,599
like this the one-size-fits-all idea of

1919
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:34,699
growing

1920
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:36,650
because it doesn't you know I mean you

1921
01:12:34,698 --> 01:12:41,299
probably water completely different like

1922
01:12:36,649 --> 01:12:43,488
that if I used your soil mixing method I

1923
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:45,139
would probably slaughter those plans

1924
01:12:43,488 --> 01:12:48,408
I guarantee I'd kill every single one of

1925
01:12:45,139 --> 01:12:50,389
them and then you do the same thing in

1926
01:12:48,408 --> 01:12:52,339
my style does that mean that you're a

1927
01:12:50,389 --> 01:12:54,409
better grower than me or vice versa no

1928
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:57,110
it doesn't exactly it's just a matter of

1929
01:12:54,408 --> 01:12:58,488
you've got to dial it in you know I

1930
01:12:57,109 --> 01:13:02,000
would recommend starting out with the

1931
01:12:58,488 --> 01:13:04,189
pro mix or a sunshine for once you get a

1932
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,368
grower to down with that and your really

1933
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:09,229
basic soil amendments then all sunshine

1934
01:13:07,368 --> 01:13:13,158
for in pro mixes is peat moss and an

1935
01:13:09,229 --> 01:13:14,598
aerator and you know those products last

1936
01:13:13,158 --> 01:13:18,170
one was done it with sunshine for

1937
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:19,610
products yeah and you know yeah I think

1938
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:21,349
people get overwhelmed when you start

1939
01:13:19,609 --> 01:13:22,670
talking about the conversion to organics

1940
01:13:21,349 --> 01:13:25,369
but if they only knew how close they

1941
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:27,170
already were so many synthetic growers

1942
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:29,509
are using sunshine for and they're using

1943
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:31,429
pro mix it's like well next time you do

1944
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:33,889
that just add in on microbial source

1945
01:13:31,429 --> 01:13:35,599
like earthworm castings add in some kelp

1946
01:13:33,889 --> 01:13:38,300
meal you know to help prevent against

1947
01:13:35,599 --> 01:13:41,210
you know fungus gnats and white flies

1948
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:45,560
and spider mites add in some name cake

1949
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:47,270
or crustacean meal yeah I mean easy

1950
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,070
stuff like that right at you're mixing

1951
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:50,360
soil anyway you should be yeah oh you

1952
01:13:49,069 --> 01:13:51,738
shouldn't I don't think you should open

1953
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:53,269
the bag and start pulling out of the bag

1954
01:13:51,738 --> 01:13:55,549
you should dump it into something kind

1955
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:58,010
of spread it out I was surprised to

1956
01:13:55,550 --> 01:14:00,409
learn the sin that like I said I've

1957
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:02,719
always grown organically so I always I

1958
01:14:00,408 --> 01:14:04,189
see a lot of the commercial synthetic

1959
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,899
growers and kind of how they're doing

1960
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:07,609
stuff and I was really surprised to see

1961
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:09,500
even name in the [ __ ] out of their soil

1962
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:11,750
I mean they're growing you know in Pro

1963
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,460
mix and that it would pour and the end

1964
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:15,170
they're still ready to drink until it

1965
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:17,100
all yeah

1966
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:18,659
it was something we were trying to talk

1967
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,340
to a friend about last night is finding

1968
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:21,779
that balance between the worm castings

1969
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,069
and the advanced nutrients he's like can

1970
01:14:21,779 --> 01:14:25,079
I do this and we were trying to tell him

1971
01:14:23,069 --> 01:14:26,880
gently that your advanced is just gonna

1972
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:29,729
kill all that stuff bro throw away those

1973
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,250
advanced bottles yeah if you're wanna

1974
01:14:29,729 --> 01:14:34,529
make the if you want to make the switch

1975
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:35,939
then you need to not get advanced

1976
01:14:34,529 --> 01:14:45,000
nutrients go get something like a

1977
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:47,929
general organics or roots organic yeah I

1978
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,460
mean even if you were to go age-old is a

1979
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:53,310
really old-school product it really is

1980
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:56,220
so cheap and I know so many people who

1981
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:58,230
crush it with I've got a friend who

1982
01:14:56,220 --> 01:15:00,659
grows nothing but I regen etics with

1983
01:14:58,229 --> 01:15:02,339
nothing but a jolt and it's so cheap I

1984
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:04,409
mean you wanna talk about low cost of

1985
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:06,449
production who cares if I mean you know

1986
01:15:04,409 --> 01:15:08,099
yo yields good but even if you did it's

1987
01:15:06,449 --> 01:15:10,829
so [ __ ] cheap you're only paying for

1988
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:13,380
power right yeah that's the truth and

1989
01:15:10,829 --> 01:15:14,640
it's the beauty of organics organics I'm

1990
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,500
making a switch and I love it I've

1991
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,000
really seen a difference in my plants

1992
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:21,119
they perform better

1993
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,680
they don't seem and I do cannabis for a

1994
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,149
long time the plants always seemed like

1995
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:25,560
they were thriving to me and now that

1996
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:27,659
I'm using the organics I can see that I

1997
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,520
was missing something they look they

1998
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:31,470
just look they're waxy err they don't

1999
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,620
have they have more the cuticles on the

2000
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:36,990
leaves are thicker the stems are more

2001
01:15:34,619 --> 01:15:38,430
robust and I was feeding I've fed all

2002
01:15:36,989 --> 01:15:39,989
the commercial brands of nutrients

2003
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:41,700
before and I'm definitely noticing a

2004
01:15:39,989 --> 01:15:43,349
difference with just basic and just

2005
01:15:41,699 --> 01:15:46,109
small jumps to organics it's not even

2006
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:47,430
anything major and then you told me you

2007
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:51,179
since you come from

2008
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:52,680
listen thetic growth is it easier I hear

2009
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:56,490
a lot of people tell me it's more

2010
01:15:52,680 --> 01:16:00,240
complicated but I am NOT the move I mean

2011
01:15:56,489 --> 01:16:02,729
I do a lot of other stuff I'm not in my

2012
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:05,699
grill like I used to be at my plants are

2013
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:07,769
fine the way I think this seems to make

2014
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:08,699
more sense to me than mixing up bottles

2015
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:10,170
like a scientist

2016
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:12,029
yeah and I've read all of my bottles

2017
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:13,440
anyway so I know what that's coming from

2018
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:15,210
like I know that that's chicken [ __ ]

2019
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:18,000
seabird guano why don't I just use

2020
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:19,980
chicken [ __ ] seabird guano yeah and I

2021
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,270
think I didn't trust myself to make

2022
01:16:19,979 --> 01:16:22,739
those mixtures I thought I'd burn

2023
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:25,080
something or whatever but there are so

2024
01:16:22,739 --> 01:16:27,090
many guides between you the red

2025
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:29,010
and every forum on the internet I can

2026
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:31,739
find the correct mixture for everything

2027
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:33,720
the podcast now this is a good you're

2028
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:35,429
gonna be way more forgiving to you

2029
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,350
putting the guan i wanted then to you

2030
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:39,350
putting a bottled nutrient that's got

2031
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:41,850
guano in it on it

2032
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:43,380
very true that's more concentrated and i

2033
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:45,870
can definitely add too much of that way

2034
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:47,640
easily exactly yeah I don't even like

2035
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:50,659
using guano I'm gonna stay away from any

2036
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:53,700
kind of [ __ ] guano is actually extremely

2037
01:16:50,659 --> 01:16:55,619
unsustainable to harvest and then it's

2038
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:57,210
really bad for you to breathe in but I

2039
01:16:55,619 --> 01:17:01,559
know a lot of people are diehard about

2040
01:16:57,210 --> 01:17:12,329
it and personally I think like produces

2041
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:16,020
really awesome outdoor waters pretty

2042
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:19,439
banging for outdoor there's other

2043
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,700
options but hey if we're dissing your

2044
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:22,679
growing methods I'm sorry we're not

2045
01:17:20,699 --> 01:17:24,899
dissing it we're just trying to

2046
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,670
encourage you to do more sustainable

2047
01:17:24,899 --> 01:17:27,929
healthier things do what you want do

2048
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:29,489
actually you're gonna get it if you if

2049
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:33,420
you're okay with it go for it yeah I

2050
01:17:29,489 --> 01:17:36,539
don't eat meat you know I don't eat GMO

2051
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:38,579
foods I live my life a certain lifestyle

2052
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:40,859
that I try to live by and I incorporate

2053
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:43,229
that all the way into the medicine and

2054
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:44,969
the plants that I grow so yeah I don't

2055
01:17:43,229 --> 01:17:46,199
force it I hang out with people who we

2056
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:48,360
meet they hang out with people who are

2057
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:52,349
synthetics like it's no big like to each

2058
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:54,539
his own you don't have to I really I get

2059
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:56,130
attacked a lot on Instagram and a lot of

2060
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:57,300
these like other places when I feel like

2061
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:59,340
when I try to put information out there

2062
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:02,940
I feel like it get met with a lot of

2063
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:04,319
resistance but I'm not telling p.m. not

2064
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:06,779
trying to tell people how to do things

2065
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:09,359
I'm just trying to give it put

2066
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:12,420
information out there so please don't

you know if you don't I'm following me

2069
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:21,020

2070
01:18:21,408 --> 01:18:26,029
but that being said if you if you ever

2071
01:18:24,168 --> 01:18:28,668
have questions and you're serious and

2072

got your back you will get you know

2075
01:18:33,469 --> 01:18:38,899
we'll get you the knowledge he needs

2076
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:40,340
yeah we know we've got resources for all

2077
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:41,538
kinds of knowledge I was funny because

2078
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,889
we were at a growers meeting last night

2079
01:18:41,538 --> 01:18:44,509
in Sean and I were both stumped on

2080
01:18:42,889 --> 01:18:46,189
something and people looked at us like

2081
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:51,349
well what the [ __ ] if you guys don't

2082
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:53,209
know then what is the answer we're never

2083
01:18:51,349 --> 01:18:54,769
seen that so I don't know give me three

2084
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:56,418
days to research it we'll find out but

2085
01:18:54,769 --> 01:19:00,949
right now you might have to call Jim

2086
01:18:56,418 --> 01:19:03,380
Ferrer people have this like they've got

2087
01:19:00,948 --> 01:19:05,569
this idea that we can just look at one

2088
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:07,819
picture on your phone are you gonna send

2089
01:19:05,569 --> 01:19:09,558
me one direct message and I'm gonna know

2090
01:19:07,819 --> 01:19:12,618
what you fed him for the past three

2091
01:19:09,559 --> 01:19:14,510
weeks yeah we'll try yeah we'll try

2092
01:19:12,618 --> 01:19:15,708
sometimes yeah that one last night was a

2093
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:18,880
weird challenge I don't know what it was

2094
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:23,269
as powdery something they'll do wish

2095
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:25,219
that was a case of all - it's all too

2096
01:19:23,269 --> 01:19:27,019
familiar like I know him person I was

2097
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,939
actually working with him on that before

2098
01:19:27,019 --> 01:19:31,400
the meeting he was introduced to me

2099
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:33,050
through a friend of mine but uh yeah I

2100
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:35,388
thought it was powdery mildew originally

2101
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:37,519
and then we thought it was a pH problem

2102
01:19:35,389 --> 01:19:39,139
and he thought it was new law and it's

2103
01:19:37,519 --> 01:19:41,090
all too familiar of a problem he

2104
01:19:39,139 --> 01:19:44,538
actually you know wasn't too familiar

2105
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:46,519
with growin I went to the local hydro

2106
01:19:44,538 --> 01:19:48,018
store not high grow because if you you

2107
01:19:46,519 --> 01:19:49,610
know Jesse would have helped him the guy

2108
01:19:48,019 --> 01:19:51,769
would have been killing it but he goes

2109
01:19:49,609 --> 01:19:54,348
to these horrible competitors here in

2110
01:19:51,769 --> 01:19:57,789
town and they set him up only he thinks

2111
01:19:54,349 --> 01:20:02,679
his cocoa they give him a cocoa nutrient

2112
01:19:57,788 --> 01:20:02,679
he's running it turns out it's peat moss

2113
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:13,400
it happens and he's learned so much and

2114
01:20:11,328 --> 01:20:15,679
he's his plants are still alive even

2115
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:17,719
after all of that you know like I mean

2116
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:19,609
is we so [ __ ] up pictures of them but

2117
01:20:17,719 --> 01:20:21,229
hey they're still kicking yeah he makes

2118
01:20:19,609 --> 01:20:22,488
it to harvest that's what counts you

2119
01:20:21,229 --> 01:20:24,380
know but uh

2120
01:20:22,488 --> 01:20:26,899
press reverance you know you just gotta

2121
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:28,699
keep stay committed to it don't if you

2122
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:34,699
think that I grew beautiful plants every

2123
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:35,119
time you're out of your mind that I've

2124
01:20:34,699 --> 01:20:36,829
done

2125
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:38,779
I'll admit one time I had and this was

2126
01:20:36,829 --> 01:20:40,510
years ago the first time it was the

2127
01:20:38,779 --> 01:20:42,800
first time I said I was in a new house

2128
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:44,180
growing in a brand new basement in the

2129
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,949
middle of winter and I'd never grown in

2130
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,570
there before and you got a dial in a

2131
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:49,010
room but I had a White Rhino plant in a

2132
01:20:47,569 --> 01:20:51,889
seven gallon pot there probably weighed

2133
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:53,119
between five and six ounces and I went

2134
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:55,100
to cut it down and I noticed powdery

2135
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:57,800
mildew all up the one side that was near

2136
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,120
the exterior wall corner so that wall

2137
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,579
was colder than the whole rest of the

2138
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:03,079
room and he got powdery mildew it was

2139
01:21:01,579 --> 01:21:05,210
ugly [ __ ] my buddy Mike was there

2140
01:21:03,079 --> 01:21:07,010
helping me trim I say Mike watch this

2141
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:08,539
I'm gonna chop the plant and usually

2142
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:09,829
he's got a hand on it when I cut it so

2143
01:21:08,539 --> 01:21:11,119
that it doesn't timber you know and I

2144
01:21:09,829 --> 01:21:13,369
just cut that son of a [ __ ] right to

2145
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,539
the ground just timber and he hit the

2146
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:16,039
floor he looked me like what the hell

2147
01:21:14,539 --> 01:21:17,449
man I was like there's powdery mildew on

2148
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:19,670
it we're throwing the whole plant away

2149
01:21:17,449 --> 01:21:21,829
it happens I mean people ask me all the

2150
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:23,779
time how do you know if it works that's

2151
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:27,079
how thousands and thousands of dollars

2152
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:28,579
worth of juice just do but if you're

2153
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:30,260
gonna try something crazy trying on one

2154
01:21:28,579 --> 01:21:32,090
plant if you have the option yeah don't

2155
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,829
do something ridiculous

2156
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:35,779
I've been trying extreme defoliation on

2157
01:21:33,829 --> 01:21:38,000
one planet I won't do it to it more than

2158
01:21:35,779 --> 01:21:41,509
one I see a difference and I like it

2159
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:44,449
honestly guys I doubted it and I learned

2160
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:46,850
this the hard way every scientific

2161
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:52,689
experiment for God's sake make sure you

2162
01:21:46,850 --> 01:22:01,700
have a control we forget a lot of [ __ ]

2163
01:21:52,689 --> 01:22:03,019
six-month trial notes we should go for

2164
01:22:01,699 --> 01:22:04,699
about five more minutes guys the last

2165
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:06,320
episode was short and you listen to

2166
01:22:04,699 --> 01:22:07,488
every minute of it I can see the stats I

2167
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:08,929
can tell how long you listen

2168
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,799

episode I like that we've covered soil

2175
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:25,218

doing to you guys but I like supporting

2427
01:32:14,689 --> 01:32:17,300

2453

2461
01:33:22,779 --> 01:33:25,748
to teach you guys trying to educate a

2462
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:27,969
little bit trying to move cannabis

2463
01:33:25,748 --> 01:33:30,189
forward I think if we talk more

2464
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:31,809
positively about this plant people will

2465
01:33:30,189 --> 01:33:33,939
be less afraid so all we got to do is

2466
01:33:31,809 --> 01:33:35,498
open the door to talk about it so again

2467

information but if you want to be in

2482
01:34:01,238 --> 01:34:05,978
touch I'd love to hear from you so I

2483
01:34:04,569 --> 01:34:08,319
said at the beginning of the show that I

2484
01:34:05,979 --> 01:34:11,559
had a bunch of news and stuff to talk

2485
01:34:08,319 --> 01:34:13,118
about so let's click on some stuff here

2486
01:34:11,559 --> 01:34:14,590
we go clicking away click click click

2487
01:34:13,118 --> 01:34:17,558
and I'm finding the first news article

2488
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:19,479
the first news article is um it kind of

2489
01:34:17,559 --> 01:34:21,130
hits home here because I actually am a

2490
01:34:19,479 --> 01:34:23,800
medical marijuana caregiver the way you

2491
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:27,130
become a caregiver all you really have

2492
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:28,570
to do is have um so I'm a there's a

2493
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:29,920
patient there's that's what we call the

2494
01:34:28,569 --> 01:34:32,139
person that smokes the medical marijuana

2495
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:33,519
there's a patient that person goes to

2496
01:34:32,139 --> 01:34:35,710
the doctor they get their medical

2497
01:34:33,519 --> 01:34:37,420
marijuana recommendation and then when

2498
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:40,599
you send that into the state of Colorado

2499
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:43,479
you can assign a caregiver and that's

2500
01:34:40,599 --> 01:34:44,979
where my name goes on to that paper my

2501
01:34:43,479 --> 01:34:45,640
name and my address and a copy of my

2502
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:46,840
idea

2503
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:48,760
and to the state and I become a

2504
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:50,680
caregiver which means I am now

2505
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:54,789
responsible for growing medical cannabis

2506
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:56,200
for my friend who signed me up and there

2507
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:58,029
is a limit of five people that you're

2508
01:34:56,199 --> 01:35:00,279
allowed to be a caregiver for so you can

2509
01:34:58,029 --> 01:35:02,199
be you can have yourself plus five other

2510
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:05,639
people and you can grow cannabis for

2511
01:35:02,199 --> 01:35:07,539
them um that's kind of how it was and

2512
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:09,070
before you were allowed to have six

2513
01:35:07,539 --> 01:35:12,039
plants per person but then there are

2514
01:35:09,069 --> 01:35:15,250
doctors that are willing to write you an

2515
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:17,170
extended plant count so if you say my

2516
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:19,270
back hurts a lot or I've got

2517
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:20,980
fibromyalgia and I don't smoke cannabis

2518
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:23,260
I actually make oils out of all of this

2519
01:35:20,979 --> 01:35:25,059
and I need a lot more plants the doctors

2520
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:26,230
will be a little compassionate and they

2521
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:28,720
will write you what's called an extended

2522
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:30,669
plant count and sometimes that cost you

2523
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:32,020
more money but in the long run that's

2524
01:35:30,670 --> 01:35:33,970
worth it because you need your medicine

2525
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:37,720
and I just allows you to grow more

2526
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:40,150
plants and possess more cannabis so the

2527
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:42,730
state is kind of caught on that some of

2528
01:35:40,149 --> 01:35:44,889
some people are going to the doctor and

2529
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:46,689
there are some doctors in Colorado that

2530
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:48,520
it just cost money if you want the

2531
01:35:46,689 --> 01:35:50,619
original six plants it's cheap you go in

2532
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:54,460
there and pay a cheap like 45 50 dollar

2533
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:57,099
visit if you want 12 plants they double

2534
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:59,140
it if you want 25 plants they pretty

2535
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:01,090
much quadruple your price if you're

2536
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:03,190
wanting 50 plants you're paying five

2537
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:05,560
times what you did before there are some

2538
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:07,419
doctors that will write a 99 plant

2539
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:10,240
recommendation for five hundred dollars

2540
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:12,340
flat so you can grow 99 plants in your

2541
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:15,010
house for five hundred dollars for one

2542
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:16,539
here that's how it was but now they're

2543
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:17,949
making all kinds of rules because they

2544
01:36:16,539 --> 01:36:20,710
have seen that what happens is a lot of

2545
01:36:17,949 --> 01:36:23,349
people sign up for 99 plants and if you

2546
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:25,000
grow 99 seven gallon pots hopefully

2547
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:27,310
you're pulling a whole bunch of weight

2548
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,020
and then that's hitting the black market

2549
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:30,220
and they're kind of aware of that and

2550
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:31,690
they don't want that happening in the

2551
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:33,190
state of Colorado anymore if they're

2552
01:36:31,689 --> 01:36:35,469
really trying to crack down and tax

2553
01:36:33,189 --> 01:36:36,609
every gram of pot that's produced I'm

2554
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:39,630
gonna take a sip here and then I'll read

2555
01:36:36,609 --> 01:36:39,630
you this news article I've got

2556
01:36:41,539 --> 01:36:45,970
got some your Belmonte here it's nice

2557
01:36:43,399 --> 01:36:48,829
and hot be careful with that all right

2558
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:50,570
so the this news article comes from a

2559
01:36:48,829 --> 01:36:53,090
website called the cannabis shout-out to

2560
01:36:50,569 --> 01:36:54,769
the cannabis I pull a lot of news

2561
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:56,750
articles from this site this was

2562
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:58,250
actually published February 26th so I'm

2563
01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:00,710
a little bit behind but this is still

2564
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:02,590
relevant the article was by Joey bunch

2565
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:05,270
of the Denver Post the headline is

2566
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:08,510
Colorado MMJ caregiver bill clears

2567
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:09,920
Senate Committee the article says a

2568
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:11,720
state Senate Committee on Thursday

2569
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,609
unanimously approved a bill that would

2570
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:15,890
require medical marijuana caregivers to

2571
01:37:13,609 --> 01:37:17,750
register and allow state agencies to

2572
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:20,110
share enough information to ensure pot

2573
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:22,819
grown for medicine isn't sold illegally

2574
01:37:20,109 --> 01:37:24,500
while pot sold for recreational use has

2575
01:37:22,819 --> 01:37:26,239
been subject to a battery of tests and

2576
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:27,979
regulations since it became legal last

2577
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:30,199
year medical marijuana has gone

2578
01:37:27,979 --> 01:37:32,000
relatively unregulated requiring only

2579
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:34,699
that caregivers be at least 18 years old

2580
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,109
and have some significant responsibility

2581
01:37:34,699 --> 01:37:38,929
for the care of a licensed medical

2582
01:37:36,109 --> 01:37:40,519
marijuana user there's actually a spot

2583
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:43,039
on the application that asks what

2584
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:46,160
services you provide for your patient

2585
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:47,420
I write spiritual counseling I write

2586
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:49,309
that I drive them to and from their

2587
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:51,380
doctor's appointments because a lot of

2588
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:55,340
that is true I prepare meals for some of

2589
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:56,449
my patients they ask for what you do so

2590
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:59,510
you got to fill that in and actually

2591
01:37:56,449 --> 01:38:01,189
they have denied one of my care giver

2592
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:02,480
requests I had to refill out to pay for

2593
01:38:01,189 --> 01:38:04,579
and put better reasoning because they

2594
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:06,949
did not like my reasons why I was part

2595
01:38:04,579 --> 01:38:07,850
of their significant responsibility so

2596
01:38:06,949 --> 01:38:09,979
they are paying a little bit of

2597
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:11,870
attention I'll get back to the article

2598
01:38:09,979 --> 01:38:14,029
it says the regulatory bill was

2599
01:38:11,869 --> 01:38:15,769
characterized by the state agency and

2600
01:38:14,029 --> 01:38:17,869
law enforcement officials as a benefit

2601
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:19,910
to caregivers because those registered

2602
01:38:17,869 --> 01:38:22,159
would not have to face arrest or cost or

2603
01:38:19,909 --> 01:38:24,559
a costly legal proceedings if they're

2604
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:26,059
registered with the state the bill is

2605
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:28,070
supported by the Colorado cannabis

2606
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:29,780
Chamber of Commerce the medical

2607
01:38:28,069 --> 01:38:31,519
marijuana supporters testified they were

2608
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:33,769
concerned about cost from regulations

2609
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:36,500
patient privacy and the risk risks of

2610
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:38,180
untested medical marijuana this bill is

2611
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:39,710
written really about assessing law

2612
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:41,329
enforcement but it's doing so at the

2613
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:43,069
expense of the rights of patients and

2614
01:38:41,329 --> 01:38:45,680
caregivers said Colorado marijuana

2615
01:38:43,069 --> 01:38:48,739
activist Robert chase who opposed to the

2616
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:50,750
legislation legislation I'm sorry in

2617
01:38:48,739 --> 01:38:52,550
2009 when the US attorney general's

2618
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:54,179
office advised federal agents not to

2619
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:55,650
intervene in cases the

2620
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:57,658
compliant with state laws medical

2621
01:38:55,649 --> 01:39:02,488
marijuana license have exploded in

2622
01:38:57,658 --> 01:39:04,170
Colorado in 2008 there were 4800 19

2623
01:39:02,488 --> 01:39:06,658
licensed medical marijuana patients in

2624
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:08,760
Colorado said senator Irene Aguilar

2625
01:39:06,658 --> 01:39:10,679
as of last December there were a hundred

2626
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:13,079
and fifteen thousand four hundred and

2627
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:15,328
sixty-seven license loser users said

2628
01:39:13,078 --> 01:39:16,828
Aguilar at the bill Senate sponsor but

2629
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:19,018
to keep federal regulators out of

2630
01:39:16,828 --> 01:39:21,328
Colorado's pot business the state must

2631
01:39:19,019 --> 01:39:23,189
regulate it adequately she said the

2632
01:39:21,328 --> 01:39:25,170
federal expectation is that states that

2633
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:27,300
have allowed marijuana to be legal and

2634
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:29,069
local governments will be implementing

2635
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:30,449
strong and effective regulatory and

2636
01:39:29,069 --> 01:39:32,698
enforcement systems that will protect

2637
01:39:30,448 --> 01:39:35,248
Public Safety Public Health and law

2638
01:39:32,698 --> 01:39:36,808
enforcement interests she said while the

2639
01:39:35,248 --> 01:39:37,679
average age of Colorado medical

2640
01:39:36,809 --> 01:39:40,529
marijuana user

2641
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:42,118
is 42 years old the number of children

2642
01:39:40,529 --> 01:39:43,768
has increased in the past two years on

2643
01:39:42,118 --> 01:39:46,139
indication spot helps children with

2644
01:39:43,769 --> 01:39:49,409
seizures and other illnesses in March

2645
01:39:46,139 --> 01:39:51,779
2013 Colorado had 35 patients younger

2646
01:39:49,408 --> 01:39:55,279
than 18 by last December the number of

2647
01:39:51,779 --> 01:39:57,719
minors had grown to 462 Aguilar said

2648
01:39:55,279 --> 01:40:00,509
Sierra riddle of Colorado Springs said

2649
01:39:57,719 --> 01:40:02,099
she moved from Utah in 2013 because her

2650
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:05,189
son has cancer and needs medical

2651
01:40:02,099 --> 01:40:06,389
marijuana big shout at the team Landon

2652
01:40:05,189 --> 01:40:07,889
what's up I didn't even know Sierra was

2653
01:40:06,389 --> 01:40:09,929
gonna be mentioned in this article those

2654
01:40:07,889 --> 01:40:12,090
are people that we support in Colorado

2655
01:40:09,929 --> 01:40:14,399
Springs so support team Landon and

2656
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:15,840
Sierra riddle if you can pick shadow the

2657
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:17,429
amount of children that are increasing

2658
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:19,050
on the medical marijuana registry needs

2659
01:40:17,429 --> 01:40:21,149
to be considered because it's only going

2660
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:22,829
to increase more she said these rules

2661
01:40:21,149 --> 01:40:24,629
and laws need to be put in place to

2662
01:40:22,828 --> 01:40:26,399
protect our children to protect their

2663
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:29,248
planet count and to protect our rights

2664
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:30,538
to grow their plants now this article

2665
01:40:29,248 --> 01:40:33,179
kind of hits home because I'm a

2666
01:40:30,538 --> 01:40:36,118
caregiver myself and the local rules are

2667
01:40:33,179 --> 01:40:37,769
changing here to where we are we're

2668
01:40:36,118 --> 01:40:40,170
being reduced on the number of patients

2669
01:40:37,769 --> 01:40:41,760
we are allowed to have which will also

2670
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:43,300
reduce the number of plants we are

2671
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:45,219
allowed to have

2672
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:47,349
and they have also reduced the amount of

2673
01:40:45,219 --> 01:40:49,448
space we are allowed to use so that

2674
01:40:47,349 --> 01:40:51,279
means the five people that I am

2675
01:40:49,448 --> 01:40:53,589
responsible for providing medical

2676
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:55,479
marijuana to somebody is going to have

2677
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:57,578
to find somebody else to grow their

2678
01:40:55,479 --> 01:40:59,319
medicine for them and the state doesn't

2679
01:40:57,578 --> 01:41:02,558
give a [ __ ] that I have been responsible

2680
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:05,649
for them for the past seven or eight

2681
01:41:02,559 --> 01:41:07,420
years it has been my responsibility and

2682
01:41:05,649 --> 01:41:09,848
my duty to take care of these people I

2683
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:11,920
have established a relationship with

2684
01:41:09,849 --> 01:41:13,449
them and I have a significant role in

2685
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,670
caring for these people but the state

2686
01:41:13,448 --> 01:41:17,319
does not care they need to end that and

2687
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:20,078
find a new caregiver to grow their

2688
01:41:17,319 --> 01:41:21,880
medical cannabis for them I think that's

2689
01:41:20,078 --> 01:41:23,500
[ __ ] because I know these people

2690
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:26,710
I know what strains they like I have

2691
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:28,149
bred strains for my patients yes that's

2692
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:30,158
what I do I have people that smoke

2693
01:41:28,149 --> 01:41:31,779
medical cannabis and I will breed

2694
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:35,109
strains for them the night nurse was

2695
01:41:31,779 --> 01:41:37,000
inspired by my friend Doug he's an older

2696
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:38,738
cat and his body hurts and he has a hard

2697
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,158
time sleeping when he smoked the Tora

2698
01:41:38,738 --> 01:41:41,259
Bora

2699
01:41:39,158 --> 01:41:43,149
he said holy [ __ ] when he smoked The

2700
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:45,460
Grateful dog he said holy [ __ ] those

2701
01:41:43,149 --> 01:41:47,738
were two of his favorite strains ever so

2702
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:48,939
I felt like it was my job to make a

2703
01:41:47,738 --> 01:41:50,828
hybrid of the two

2704
01:41:48,939 --> 01:41:52,808
and then find the right phenotype that

2705
01:41:50,828 --> 01:41:56,049
worked for Doug and when I grew those he

2706
01:41:52,809 --> 01:41:57,340
loved it and now guess what sorry Doug I

2707
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:58,599
don't get to be your caregiver anymore

2708
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:00,190
because the state doesn't give a [ __ ]

2709
01:41:58,599 --> 01:42:02,619
about our bona fide relationship that

2710
01:42:00,189 --> 01:42:04,299
we've developed over years not really

2711
01:42:02,618 --> 01:42:06,399
Doug I'm keeping it but that's my

2712
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:08,619
example team Landon there are little

2713
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:11,948
kids out there with brain tumors cancers

2714
01:42:08,618 --> 01:42:13,779
seizures lymphoma kids have all kinds of

2715
01:42:11,948 --> 01:42:15,698
bad things that adults have and now we

2716
01:42:13,779 --> 01:42:18,368
need to let these kids have their

2717
01:42:15,698 --> 01:42:21,250
caregivers have plant counts this is

2718
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:22,598
messed up this is why I'm fired up

2719
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:24,010
because this is what medical this is

2720
01:42:22,599 --> 01:42:25,719
what started the cannabis movement in

2721
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:28,030
Colorado was medical cannabis and

2722
01:42:25,719 --> 01:42:29,859
caregivers caregivers are what started

2723
01:42:28,029 --> 01:42:31,719
it the patients and the caregivers are

2724
01:42:29,859 --> 01:42:33,368
Ground Zero and now guess who's being

2725
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:35,349
screwed right out of this deal the

2726
01:42:33,368 --> 01:42:37,269
patients and the caregivers because they

2727
01:42:35,349 --> 01:42:39,550
want us to be forced to shop at

2728
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:41,710
recreational dispensaries where taxes

2729
01:42:39,550 --> 01:42:43,300
are [ __ ] ridiculous and we cannot

2730
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:44,529
afford it how are we gonna medicate

2731
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:46,210
ourselves that way the reason we are

2732
01:42:44,529 --> 01:42:47,289
medicating ourselves with cannabis is so

2733
01:42:46,210 --> 01:42:48,969
that we don't have to jump through

2734
01:42:47,289 --> 01:42:49,960
somebody else's hoops so that we don't

2735
01:42:48,969 --> 01:42:52,480
have to go stand in line to pay

2736
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:55,239
ridiculous prices for medicine you're

2737
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:57,228
[ __ ] us over guys sorry in the rant

2738
01:42:55,238 --> 01:42:59,299
I'm passionate about this it pisses me

2739
01:42:57,229 --> 01:43:00,949
because the patients that started

2740
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:03,229
medical cannabis are now the people that

2741
01:43:00,948 --> 01:43:04,759
nobody I can't say nobody the people

2742
01:43:03,229 --> 01:43:07,280
that most of this industry is looking

2743
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:08,689
over right now we've forgotten them it's

2744
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:10,038
all about the patient patients first

2745
01:43:08,689 --> 01:43:12,168
without the patients there have been no

2746
01:43:10,038 --> 01:43:13,488
medical marijuana movement they've not

2747
01:43:12,168 --> 01:43:15,109
been caregivers they would have not been

2748
01:43:13,488 --> 01:43:17,118
homegrown we would not have gotten as

2749
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:18,529
far as we've gotten today we'd be years

2750
01:43:17,118 --> 01:43:19,518
behind if we did not start this with

2751
01:43:18,529 --> 01:43:21,618
medical marijuana

2752
01:43:19,519 --> 01:43:24,019
all right so think about the patients

2753
01:43:21,618 --> 01:43:26,179
you guys I'm gonna do the best I can I'm

2754
01:43:24,019 --> 01:43:27,918
gonna have to register my grows with my

2755
01:43:26,179 --> 01:43:29,989
city and with my state they're going to

2756
01:43:27,918 --> 01:43:31,458
come to my private grow and they're

2757
01:43:29,988 --> 01:43:32,718
going to look through my grows and make

2758
01:43:31,458 --> 01:43:34,458
sure that I'm following all of the laws

2759
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:36,529
and that everything is done up to code

2760
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:37,668
I'm gonna sign up to do that because I'm

2761
01:43:36,529 --> 01:43:39,438
well known around here

2762
01:43:37,668 --> 01:43:40,819
and if I don't do it I know they will

2763
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:43,099
come here and they will try to press

2764
01:43:40,819 --> 01:43:45,228
some kind of legal charges on me um

2765
01:43:43,099 --> 01:43:47,119
there are paperwork papers that I can

2766
01:43:45,229 --> 01:43:49,939
fill out to have an excuse or an

2767
01:43:47,118 --> 01:43:53,509
exception to have more patients but I

2768
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:55,010
don't see I'm gonna really have to pull

2769
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:56,510
a lot of reasons out of the air because

2770
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:58,189
they're they're paperwork they don't

2771
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:59,449
have any compassion they have checkmarks

2772
01:43:58,189 --> 01:44:01,729
you know what I mean does this this and

2773
01:43:59,448 --> 01:44:03,109
this happen then no and it's just like

2774
01:44:01,729 --> 01:44:05,418
talking to a computer instead of a

2775
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:06,859
person with compassion it sucks alright

2776
01:44:05,418 --> 01:44:08,988

2777
01:44:06,859 --> 01:44:10,578
second all right guys I'm back I took a

2778
01:44:08,988 --> 01:44:11,988
couple dab to calm down I'm not so

2779
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:14,118
pissed off about that last article

2780
01:44:11,988 --> 01:44:15,978
anymore but we have a whole new article

2781
01:44:14,118 --> 01:44:18,378
coming up in this could this could do a

2782
01:44:15,979 --> 01:44:19,999
lot of things to us the sub headline is

2783
01:44:18,378 --> 01:44:22,118
another lawsuit has been filed in

2784
01:44:19,998 --> 01:44:25,458
federal court over Colorado's marijuana

2785
01:44:22,118 --> 01:44:28,038
legalization amendment the headline is

2786
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:31,458
new lawsuit sheriff's from Colorado and

2787
01:44:28,038 --> 01:44:33,498
elsewhere challenged amendment 64 what

2788
01:44:31,458 --> 01:44:35,988
makes the new suit unique is that it is

2789
01:44:33,498 --> 01:44:38,688
also asking for a federal judge to

2790
01:44:35,988 --> 01:44:42,018
overturn amendment 64 s protections for

2791
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:44,269
marijuana use and a pro possession this

2792
01:44:42,019 --> 01:44:46,399
articles written by Kirk Mitchell and

2793
01:44:44,269 --> 01:44:48,100
John Engel of the Denver Post let's get

2794
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:50,110
right into it

2795
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:51,760
six Colorado sheriff's sued their own

2796
01:44:50,109 --> 01:44:53,259
governor in federal court on Thursday

2797
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:55,119
arguing that state laws legalizing

2798
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:57,400
marijuana require them to violate

2799
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:59,439
federal law during the sheriff's in the

2800
01:44:57,399 --> 01:45:01,599
lawsuit the fourth to be filed against

2801
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:03,159
Colorado over marijuana legalization are

2802
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:05,710
the sheriffs and prosecutors from

2803
01:45:03,159 --> 01:45:07,720
Nebraska and Kansas the suit argues that

2804
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:09,819
federal law supremacy means Colorado

2805
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:12,010
cannot allow people to possess or use

2806
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:14,170
marijuana for recreational purposes and

2807
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:16,060
it cannot license stores to sell it the

2808
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:18,670
law does not challenge Colorado's

2809
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:20,590
medical marijuana laws or stores the

2810
01:45:18,670 --> 01:45:22,569
suit is about one thing the rule of the

2811
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:25,420
law Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith

2812
01:45:22,569 --> 01:45:27,699
said in a news release release I said

2813
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:30,430
released J's the Colorado Constitution

2814
01:45:27,699 --> 01:45:32,500
mandates that all elected officials

2815
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:34,930
including sheriffs swear an oath of

2816
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:37,239
office to uphold both the United States

2817
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:39,100
as well as the Colorado constitutions

2818
01:45:37,239 --> 01:45:39,789
the suit names governor john

2819
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:42,039
hickenlooper

2820
01:45:39,789 --> 01:45:44,079
as the lone defendant Colorado's

2821
01:45:42,039 --> 01:45:45,729
Attorney General cynthia coffman will

2822
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:47,889
defend the state against the lawsuit a

2823
01:45:45,729 --> 01:45:50,378
spokesman for her said

2824
01:45:47,889 --> 01:45:52,149
lawsuit excuse me the lawsuit has the

2825
01:45:50,378 --> 01:45:54,788
backing of national anti illegal ization

2826
01:45:52,149 --> 01:45:56,709
groups and its nationwide ambitions were

2827
01:45:54,788 --> 01:45:58,628
apparent in the choice of where to

2828
01:45:56,708 --> 01:46:00,398
announce the suit in a news conference

2829
01:45:58,628 --> 01:46:02,439
Thursday morning at the National Press

2830
01:46:00,399 --> 01:46:04,239
Club in Washington DC Smith told

2831
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:06,699
reporters that Colorado's passage of

2832
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:08,948
amendment 64 created a constitutional

2833
01:46:06,698 --> 01:46:11,319
shutdown in the state the amendment

2834
01:46:08,948 --> 01:46:13,748
which voters approved in 2012 made it

2835
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:15,368
legal for people over 21 in Colorado to

2836
01:46:13,748 --> 01:46:17,378
possess a limited amounts of marijuana

2837
01:46:15,368 --> 01:46:21,458
and for licensed stores to sell

2838
01:46:17,378 --> 01:46:23,050
marijuana this we think they call we

2839
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:24,898
think that what Colorado has done is

2840
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:28,599
illegal we think it's unconstitutional

2841
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:30,399
Scottsbluff County Nebraska sheriff mark

2842
01:46:28,599 --> 01:46:32,199
Overman who is also a plaintiff in the

2843
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:34,209
suit said at the news conference

2844
01:46:32,198 --> 01:46:35,788
I believe my fellow plaintiffs believe

2845
01:46:34,208 --> 01:46:38,738
that this case is going to have national

2846
01:46:35,788 --> 01:46:40,628
ramifications and if we win then we can

2847
01:46:38,738 --> 01:46:43,988
reverse what looks like a surrender to a

2848
01:46:40,628 --> 01:46:45,519
pro marijuana crowd the lawsuit follows

2849
01:46:43,988 --> 01:46:47,768
another legal challenge filed in

2850
01:46:45,519 --> 01:46:50,050
December by Nebraska and Oklahoma which

2851
01:46:47,769 --> 01:46:52,570
asked the US Supreme Court to strike

2852
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:54,519
down the history-making law two lawsuits

2853
01:46:52,569 --> 01:46:56,648
filed earlier this year by the anti

2854
01:46:54,519 --> 01:46:59,168
legalization group safe streets Alliance

2855
01:46:56,649 --> 01:47:01,088
on behalf of several Colorado residents

2856
01:46:59,168 --> 01:47:03,639
are also pending against the state over

2857
01:47:01,088 --> 01:47:06,189
a minim at 64 similar to the previous

2858
01:47:03,639 --> 01:47:07,689
lawsuits the new suit seeks to close all

2859
01:47:06,189 --> 01:47:10,599
of Colorado's recreational marijuana

2860
01:47:07,689 --> 01:47:13,329
stores but it also asks federal a

2861
01:47:10,599 --> 01:47:15,189
federal judge to overturn amendment 64 s

2862
01:47:13,328 --> 01:47:17,139
protections for marijuana use and

2863
01:47:15,189 --> 01:47:19,510
possession the law enforcement officials

2864
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:21,099
suit claim that local officers are

2865
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:23,168
breaking federal law and international

2866
01:47:21,099 --> 01:47:25,510
treaties when they find marijuana but

2867
01:47:23,168 --> 01:47:27,849
they do not seize it at Thursday's news

2868
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:30,789
conference Yuma County Sheriff Chad day

2869
01:47:27,849 --> 01:47:32,800
said Colorado's marijuana laws now

2870
01:47:30,788 --> 01:47:34,628
prohibit officers from seizing marijuana

2871
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,899
and serving certain circumstances

2872
01:47:34,628 --> 01:47:40,779
putting officers he said in an

2873
01:47:36,899 --> 01:47:43,209
inevitable position that's kind of funny

2874
01:47:40,779 --> 01:47:45,518
by supporting and upholding one were

2875
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:47,618
violating the other he said I'm excited

2876
01:47:45,519 --> 01:47:48,280
to very least to get an answer from the

2877
01:47:47,618 --> 01:47:50,438
courts

2878
01:47:48,279 --> 01:47:52,929
these cops are not robots they are

2879
01:47:50,439 --> 01:47:54,459
people and they know they're they know

2880
01:47:52,929 --> 01:47:56,050
what they're supposed to do these guys

2881
01:47:54,458 --> 01:47:58,479
are acting like we've got droids out

2882
01:47:56,050 --> 01:47:59,859
there acting as police officers and

2883
01:47:58,479 --> 01:48:01,250
we're gonna flip their switch and make

2884
01:47:59,859 --> 01:48:04,070
their computers crash this is

2885
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:06,020
ridiculous dude Sam came in I'm probably

2886
01:48:04,069 --> 01:48:07,399
saying that wrong Sam Kay a law

2887
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:09,200
professor at the University of Denver

2888
01:48:07,399 --> 01:48:11,629
was skeptical of the sheriff's argument

2889
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:14,389
he said no law requires local officers

2890
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:17,359
to act as de facto federal drug agents

2891
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:19,369
of the four lawsuits this is the one

2892
01:48:17,359 --> 01:48:20,960
with the least merit came and said they

2893
01:48:19,369 --> 01:48:22,579
have targeted not just the marijuana

2894
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:24,289
store regulation piece but they're also

2895
01:48:22,579 --> 01:48:26,630
essentially saying Colorado can't

2896
01:48:24,289 --> 01:48:27,729
legalize marijuana no one has ever gone

2897
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:29,690
that far

2898

2919
01:49:14,899 --> 01:49:17,299
at the document sorry I kind of

2920
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:20,680
snowballed in that last part there but

2921
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:22,820
those a lot of names is really all

2922
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:24,619
excuse me as in the lawsuit filed in

2923
01:49:22,819 --> 01:49:26,179
Nebraska and Oklahoma the law

2924
01:49:24,619 --> 01:49:28,640
enforcement officials from Nebraska and

2925
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:30,829
Kansas are are arguing in the new

2926
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:32,930
lawsuit that marijuana flowing out of

2927
01:49:30,829 --> 01:49:35,649
Colorado post legalization has led to

2928
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:38,440
more arrests and strain their budgets

2929
01:49:35,649 --> 01:49:41,779
I'm gonna jump in here and say so

2930
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:43,189
legalize pot in your states just

2931
01:49:41,779 --> 01:49:46,849
legalize weed in Nebraska and Oklahoma

2932
01:49:43,189 --> 01:49:48,349
in Kansas and you won't have to worry

2933
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:49,789
about arresting more people and

2934
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:51,289
straining your budget you'll be able to

2935
01:49:49,789 --> 01:49:52,819
sell cannabis like we do here in

2936
01:49:51,289 --> 01:49:54,470
Colorado and you'll be able to fill up

2937
01:49:52,819 --> 01:49:56,210
your cash registers at the stores and

2938
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:59,240
you'll be able to fix your stupid-ass

2939
01:49:56,210 --> 01:50:00,890
roads that you guys have think about it

2940
01:49:59,239 --> 01:50:02,840
come on let's use our [ __ ] brains

2941
01:50:00,890 --> 01:50:04,340
people alright it's actually taking

2942
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:05,449
money out of Sherman County taxpayers

2943
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:08,960
pockets

2944
01:50:05,449 --> 01:50:10,670
Burton Pianalto the sheriff in Sherman

2945
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:13,699
County Kansas said at Thursday's news

2946
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:14,929
conference in January 9 out of the 46

2947
01:50:13,699 --> 01:50:17,238
people booked into Sherman

2948
01:50:14,929 --> 01:50:19,368
jail were suspected of possessing or

2949
01:50:17,238 --> 01:50:21,198
distributing hallucinogen hallucinogenic

2950
01:50:19,368 --> 01:50:23,029
drugs the category under which marijuana

2951
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:26,328
is classified in Kansas criminal law

2952
01:50:23,029 --> 01:50:28,639
according to an online booking log 2 out

2953
01:50:26,328 --> 01:50:30,380
of the 15 inmates listed on Thursday as

2954
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:31,760
being currently housed in the County

2955
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:35,208
Jail face charges related to

2956
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:37,269
hallucinogenic drugs so more [ __ ]

2957
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:39,708
they call cannabis a hallucinogenic drug

2958
01:50:37,269 --> 01:50:44,239
which is right in the same category as

2959
01:50:39,708 --> 01:50:45,859
probably LSD mushrooms ecstasy um this

2960
01:50:44,238 --> 01:50:47,868
is some cannabis you guys this is

2961
01:50:45,859 --> 01:50:50,299
medical marijuana it's funny to think

2962
01:50:47,868 --> 01:50:52,158
that over an invisible line that this is

2963
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:54,498
now a hallucinogenic drug and you cross

2964
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:56,569
this invisible line and now it's

2965
01:50:54,498 --> 01:50:58,550
recreational cannabis and then you can

2966
01:50:56,569 --> 01:51:01,038
cross another line and it's medical

2967
01:50:58,550 --> 01:51:03,288
marijuana this is so good I love the

2968
01:51:01,038 --> 01:51:05,059
time and place that we live in this is

2969
01:51:03,288 --> 01:51:07,368
so amazing to me all right

2970
01:51:05,059 --> 01:51:08,689
where was I Colorado officials have not

2971
01:51:07,368 --> 01:51:10,728
yet responded to any of the pending

2972
01:51:08,689 --> 01:51:12,229
lawsuits previously state attorneys have

2973
01:51:10,729 --> 01:51:14,030
argued that Colorado's more permissive

2974
01:51:12,229 --> 01:51:16,340
marijuana laws both from medical and

2975
01:51:14,029 --> 01:51:18,380
recreational use and sales do not amount

2976
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:19,699
to legalization of marijuana instead

2977
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:22,010
they contend that marijuana remains

2978
01:51:19,698 --> 01:51:23,958
illegal in Colorado aside from the

2979
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:26,380
specific exemptions allowed under the

2980
01:51:23,958 --> 01:51:28,819
medical and recreational marijuana laws

2981
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:30,949
when Nebraska and Oklahoma filed their

2982
01:51:28,819 --> 01:51:32,958
lawsuit against Colorado last year in

2983
01:51:30,948 --> 01:51:34,819
Colorado Attorney General John John

2984
01:51:32,958 --> 01:51:37,188
Suthers said in a statement that it

2985
01:51:34,819 --> 01:51:39,469
appears the plaintiffs primary grievance

2986
01:51:37,189 --> 01:51:41,539
stems from a non enforcement of federal

2987
01:51:39,469 --> 01:51:43,719
laws regarding marijuana as opposed to

2988
01:51:41,538 --> 01:51:46,368
choices made by the voters of Colorado

2989
01:51:43,719 --> 01:51:48,800
basin to virt one of the lead proponents

2990
01:51:46,368 --> 01:51:50,299
of amendment 64 said if the lawsuits are

2991
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,309
successful in striking down the measure

2992
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:54,409
it would lead to a system of marijuana

2993
01:51:52,309 --> 01:51:55,820
chaos which I would love to see what

2994
01:51:54,408 --> 01:51:56,988
happened I don't want it to happen but

2995
01:51:55,819 --> 01:51:58,429
it'd be really neat to see how it's

2996
01:51:56,988 --> 01:52:00,738
dealt with because there are

2997
01:51:58,429 --> 01:52:02,719
dispensaries on every other corner in

2998
01:52:00,738 --> 01:52:05,538
Denver every other corner in Colorado

2999
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:07,578
Springs Bob Lowe West has 12 or 15

3000
01:52:05,538 --> 01:52:10,340
dispensaries now in that small community

3001
01:52:07,578 --> 01:52:11,509
they are everywhere it'll be hard to

3002
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:13,279
complain they'd have to go to California

3003
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:14,929
they'd have to go to every state that's

3004
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:17,569
got medical cannabis they couldn't just

3005
01:52:14,929 --> 01:52:19,908
come here cuz then that would be they'd

3006
01:52:17,569 --> 01:52:21,768
be signaling us out says this is just

3007
01:52:19,908 --> 01:52:23,359
another case of the arrest and

3008
01:52:21,769 --> 01:52:25,190
prosecution industry teaming up with

3009
01:52:23,359 --> 01:52:26,449
marijuana prohibition groups to roll

3010
01:52:25,189 --> 01:52:27,949
the progress that has been made in

3011
01:52:26,449 --> 01:52:31,279
Colorado he said in a statement Thursday

3012
01:52:27,949 --> 01:52:33,349
a US Rep jared Polis said in a statement

3013
01:52:31,279 --> 01:52:34,909
that the US Department of Justice and

3014
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:36,470
President Obama have made clear that

3015
01:52:34,909 --> 01:52:38,420
they will not interfere with the states

3016
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:40,970
whose citizens voted for recreational

3017
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:42,770
marijuana use this lawsuit is a silly

3018
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:45,140
attempt to circumvent the will of

3019
01:52:42,770 --> 01:52:47,450
Colorado voters and is a waste of time

3020
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:49,070
Bullough statement says unfortunately

3021
01:52:47,449 --> 01:52:52,099
these frivolous lawsuits will likely

3022
01:52:49,069 --> 01:52:54,289
continue until we pass by bar bipartisan

3023
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:56,480
regulate marijuana like alcohol Act and

3024
01:52:54,289 --> 01:52:59,659
finally end the outdated federal

3025
01:52:56,479 --> 01:53:01,219
prohibition of marijuana so these states

3026
01:52:59,659 --> 01:53:03,529
have filed a suit they're trying to sue

3027
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:06,050
us to shut down our recreational

3028
01:53:03,529 --> 01:53:08,239
marijuana program because they can't get

3029
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:10,640
cannabis to stop coming into their

3030
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:13,489
states I think I said it the first time

3031
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:17,030
stop [ __ ] with us and do what you can

3032
01:53:13,489 --> 01:53:19,939
to make respectable responsible cannabis

3033
01:53:17,029 --> 01:53:22,159
laws in Nebraska and Kansas in Oklahoma

3034
01:53:19,939 --> 01:53:23,809
and then the state's bordering those

3035
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:25,760
will have to follow suit and then

3036
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:27,530
eventually it'll just be a whole dream

3037
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:29,750
mat stead of having a red and blue map

3038
01:53:27,529 --> 01:53:32,359
we'll start having all green states this

3039
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:33,770
will be great all right so here's

3040
01:53:32,359 --> 01:53:35,359
another article that I keep seeing pop

3041
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:36,740
up on social media I'm finding this

3042
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:38,960
article on the cannabis they get a lot

3043
01:53:36,739 --> 01:53:40,969
of my articles from there this was

3044
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:43,100
written by Christopher Ingraham from the

3045
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:46,310
Washington Post there's a cute little

3046
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:47,930
headline article headline picture of a

3047
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:49,610
little bunny rabbit sitting on a digital

3048
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:52,820
scale and the bunny weighs ninety three

3049
01:53:49,609 --> 01:53:55,399
point two grams it's kind of cute um the

3050
01:53:52,819 --> 01:53:57,170
headline says Utah DEA warns of stoned

3051
01:53:55,399 --> 01:54:00,979
rabbits if state passes medical

3052
01:53:57,170 --> 01:54:03,890
marijuana bill I'll say it again DEA

3053
01:54:00,979 --> 01:54:06,139
warns of stone rabbits if state passes

3054
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:09,519
medical marijuana bill well let's take

3055
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:11,530
that in now I'll read the article

3056
01:54:09,519 --> 01:54:13,329
Utah's considering a bill that would

3057
01:54:11,529 --> 01:54:14,889
allow patients with certain debilitating

3058
01:54:13,328 --> 01:54:16,899
conditions to be treated with edible

3059
01:54:14,889 --> 01:54:19,630
forms of marijuana if the bill passes

3060
01:54:16,899 --> 01:54:21,729
the state's wildlife may cultivate a

3061
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:23,559
taste for the plant lose their fear of

3062
01:54:21,729 --> 01:54:24,069
humans and basically be high all the

3063
01:54:23,559 --> 01:54:25,989
time

3064
01:54:24,069 --> 01:54:28,328
that's according to testimony presented

3065
01:54:25,988 --> 01:54:29,138
to a Utah State panel last week by an

3066
01:54:28,328 --> 01:54:32,590
agent of the Drug Enforcement

3067
01:54:29,139 --> 01:54:34,719
Administration I deal in facts I deal in

3068
01:54:32,590 --> 01:54:36,279
science at Special Agent Matt Fairbanks

3069
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:38,859
who's been working in the state for a

3070
01:54:36,279 --> 01:54:41,259
decade he is a member of the marijuana

3071
01:54:38,859 --> 01:54:42,729
eradication team in Utah some of his

3072
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:45,998
colleagues in Georgia recently achieved

3073
01:54:42,729 --> 01:54:48,598
notoriety by raiding a retirees garden

3074
01:54:45,998 --> 01:54:50,859
and seizing a number of okra plants

3075
01:54:48,599 --> 01:54:52,900
Fairbanks spoke of his time eliminating

3076
01:54:50,859 --> 01:54:55,238
backcountry marijuana grows and the Utah

3077
01:54:52,899 --> 01:54:57,158
mountains specifically the environmental

3078
01:54:55,238 --> 01:54:59,649
cost associated with large-scale weed

3079
01:54:57,158 --> 01:55:01,029
cultivation on public land personally

3080
01:54:59,649 --> 01:55:03,098
I've seen an entire mountainside

3081
01:55:01,029 --> 01:55:05,590
subjected to pesticides harmful

3082
01:55:03,099 --> 01:55:08,380
chemicals deforestation and erosion he

3083
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:10,389
said the ramifications to the flora the

3084
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:14,050
animal life the contaminated water are

3085
01:55:10,389 --> 01:55:15,670
still unknown at some illegal marijuana

3086
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:17,590
grow sites he saw rabbits that had

3087
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:19,690
cultivated taste for the marijuana it

3088
01:55:17,590 --> 01:55:22,090
continued one of them refused to leave

3089
01:55:19,689 --> 01:55:24,609
us as we took all the marijuana around

3090
01:55:22,090 --> 01:55:27,909
him his natural instincts to run or

3091
01:55:24,609 --> 01:55:29,589
somehow gone it's true that illegal pot

3092
01:55:27,908 --> 01:55:31,598
farming can have harmful environmental

3093
01:55:29,590 --> 01:55:33,279
consequences of course nothing about

3094
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:35,440
these consequences is unique to

3095
01:55:33,279 --> 01:55:36,849
marijuana if corn were outlawed the

3096
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:38,888
cartels would start growing it on

3097
01:55:36,849 --> 01:55:41,230
national forests the per plant

3098
01:55:38,889 --> 01:55:43,630
environmental toll would be about the

3099
01:55:41,229 --> 01:55:45,459
same which is kind of a neat fact but

3100
01:55:43,630 --> 01:55:47,739
back County marijuana grows are a direct

3101
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:49,179
result of marijuana's illegal status if

3102
01:55:47,738 --> 01:55:51,819
you're concerned about the environmental

3103
01:55:49,179 --> 01:55:53,800
impact of the grows an alternative is to

3104
01:55:51,819 --> 01:55:55,630
legalize and regulate the plants so that

3105
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:58,119
people can grow it on farms and in their

3106
01:55:55,630 --> 01:56:01,150
gardens rather than on remote mountain

3107
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:02,979
sides now regarding stone rabbits some

3108
01:56:01,149 --> 01:56:04,768
wild animals apparently do develop a

3109
01:56:02,979 --> 01:56:07,168
taste for bud

3110
01:56:04,769 --> 01:56:08,969
but I don't know that the occasional

3111
01:56:07,168 --> 01:56:10,679
high rabbit constitutes four grounds for

3112
01:56:08,969 --> 01:56:12,448
keeping marijuana prohibition in place

3113
01:56:10,679 --> 01:56:14,969
any more than drunk squirrels are an

3114
01:56:12,448 --> 01:56:16,648
argument for outlawing alcohol and let's

3115
01:56:14,969 --> 01:56:20,219
not even get started on the nationwide

3116
01:56:16,649 --> 01:56:22,349
epidemic of catnip abuse

3117
01:56:20,219 --> 01:56:24,118
there was a time not too long ago when

3118
01:56:22,349 --> 01:56:25,860
drug warriors terrified a nation with

3119
01:56:24,118 --> 01:56:28,049
images of The Devil's weed and reefer

3120
01:56:25,859 --> 01:56:29,848
madness now it seems that enforcers of

3121
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:32,429
marijuana law conjuring up a stoned

3122
01:56:29,849 --> 01:56:34,199
bunny not scary enough for the Utah

3123
01:56:32,429 --> 01:56:35,639
State it seems the panel approved the

3124
01:56:34,198 --> 01:56:38,759
bill and sent it to the full Senate

3125
01:56:35,639 --> 01:56:40,440
where it will be debated this week well

3126
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:42,179
good luck to you Utah I hope that this

3127
01:56:40,439 --> 01:56:45,828
bill passes I hope that you're allowed

3128
01:56:42,179 --> 01:56:48,719
to consume an edible form of marijuana

3129
01:56:45,828 --> 01:56:50,279
outlying cannabis in your state because

3130
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:51,989
the rabbits are gonna get stoned

3131
01:56:50,279 --> 01:56:53,939
would be a lot like outlined roads

3132
01:56:51,988 --> 01:56:56,129
because dogs and squirrels are going to

3133
01:56:53,939 --> 01:56:58,638
get ran over it's kind of a stupid-ass

3134
01:56:56,130 --> 01:57:01,260
argument come up with something better

3135
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:03,059
we aren't buying that [ __ ] anymore

3136
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:04,229
because I've got one more news article

3137
01:57:03,059 --> 01:57:08,010
that I want to read and then we're gonna

3138
01:57:04,229 --> 01:57:10,440
wrap up the show this one is from the

3139
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:12,479
toke of the town actually and this will

3140
01:57:10,439 --> 01:57:14,279
be the final news article that I am ever

3141
01:57:12,479 --> 01:57:16,949
going to read from the toke of the town

3142
01:57:14,279 --> 01:57:18,809
and I will tell you why this article

3143
01:57:16,948 --> 01:57:21,029
comes from the toke of the town and it

3144
01:57:18,809 --> 01:57:24,179
says after five years toke of the town

3145
01:57:21,029 --> 01:57:25,498
says goodbye since 2009 toke of the town

3146
01:57:24,179 --> 01:57:27,389
has brought you the biggest marijuana

3147
01:57:25,498 --> 01:57:28,800
news and the loudest pot views from

3148
01:57:27,389 --> 01:57:31,050
across the country and around the world

3149
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,639
along the way we've covered the huge

3150
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:35,248
progress many states have made toward

3151
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:37,739
legalization and wondered why others are

3152
01:57:35,248 --> 01:57:39,510
so far behind this country still has a

3153
01:57:37,738 --> 01:57:41,388
long way to go but things are looking up

3154
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:43,650
and we have our fingers crossed that

3155
01:57:41,389 --> 01:57:46,440
2015 will be another big year for

3156
01:57:43,649 --> 01:57:48,538
legalization but the toke won't be

3157
01:57:46,439 --> 01:57:50,908
around to see it at least not in its

3158
01:57:48,538 --> 01:57:52,469
present form this is the toks

3159
01:57:50,908 --> 01:57:53,969
total the town's final day of

3160
01:57:52,469 --> 01:57:55,649
publication and this was actually

3161
01:57:53,969 --> 01:57:57,029
written at the end of the year don't

3162
01:57:55,649 --> 01:57:58,529
worry we're not quitting the movement

3163
01:57:57,029 --> 01:58:00,569
we're just returning the focus of our

3164
01:57:58,529 --> 01:58:02,429
marijuana coverage to our local voice

3165
01:58:00,569 --> 01:58:04,288
media group papers you can still read

3166
01:58:02,429 --> 01:58:06,599
William breeds weekly pot reviews and

3167
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:08,609
ask a STONER to call him at Westward com

3168
01:58:06,599 --> 01:58:09,929
or they started and you can continue to

3169
01:58:08,609 --> 01:58:11,939
follow him on Twitter and on Facebook

3170
01:58:09,929 --> 01:58:13,469
and you can keep following Tok on

3171
01:58:11,939 --> 01:58:15,478
Facebook and Twitter too for the latest

3172
01:58:13,469 --> 01:58:17,429
marijuana news from all of our papers

3173
01:58:15,479 --> 01:58:19,139
many thanks for reading and supporting

3174
01:58:17,429 --> 01:58:20,368
us for the past five years we couldn't

3175
01:58:19,139 --> 01:58:22,679
have covered the marijuana community

3176
01:58:20,368 --> 01:58:24,478
without such a strong one reading us

3177
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:25,498
though the community itself is a strong

3178
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:27,840
one I was thrown off by the way they

3179
01:58:25,498 --> 01:58:29,279
worded that and all of our archives will

3180
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,659
remain online because we wouldn't want

3181
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:32,788
you to lose access to our serious

3182
01:58:30,658 --> 01:58:33,750
reporting on issues of Medicine and our

3183
01:58:32,788 --> 01:58:36,239
light-hearted coverage

3184
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:38,189
stoner movies light went up for us won't

3185
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:39,840
you so this is a little outdated because

3186
01:58:38,189 --> 01:58:41,099
this was put out at the end of the year

3187
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,050
at the start of this year at the end of

3188
01:58:41,100 --> 01:58:44,789
last year the toke of the town is not

3189
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:46,980
posting any more news I used to pull a

3190
01:58:44,789 --> 01:58:49,050
lot of news articles from there but I

3191
01:58:46,979 --> 01:58:51,329
will not have them as a resource anymore

3192
01:58:49,050 --> 01:58:53,070
so we will miss you talk of the town you

3193
01:58:51,329 --> 01:58:54,739

cat known as soil grown on Instagram

3371
02:06:07,698 --> 02:06:11,808
entire order that's [ __ ] super sweet

3372
02:06:09,769 --> 02:06:15,110
super phat deal everybody wants to save

3373
02:06:11,809 --> 02:06:18,610

3374
02:06:15,109 --> 02:06:18,609
to take a selfie this at

3375
02:06:19,319 --> 02:06:22,369
[Music]

3376
02:06:34,550 --> 02:06:37,619
[Music]

3377
02:06:38,529 --> 02:06:46,158
what's up with you taking selfies on the

3378
02:06:40,729 --> 02:06:47,599
show that's og right there Spence is

3379
02:06:46,158 --> 02:06:48,888
here and we're hi and I just want to get

3380
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:50,150
to the conversation I don't want to

3381
02:06:48,889 --> 02:06:51,710
ramble about commercials you guys don't

3382
02:06:50,149 --> 02:06:52,638
want to hear a lot of commercials but if

3383
02:06:51,710 --> 02:06:54,079
you guys are interested in sponsoring

3384
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:56,000
the show sent me an email it's grow for

3385
02:06:54,079 --> 02:07:05,779
me hard at hotmail.com I'll get you all

3386
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:07,760
of that info so and he said management

3387
02:07:05,779 --> 02:07:12,948
so we're gonna jump right into it that's

3388
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:15,230
good [ __ ] so canopy management I've

3389
02:07:12,948 --> 02:07:16,879
been watching Spence follow a guy named

3390
02:07:15,229 --> 02:07:18,869
green works on Instagram so a lot of

3391
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:21,949
this will be inspired by our buddy green

3392
02:07:18,869 --> 02:07:21,948
[Music]

3393
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:33,948
works he kind of inspired Spence to set

3394
02:07:30,408 --> 02:07:37,339
up some really killer Cage like not

3395
02:07:33,948 --> 02:07:39,138
really cages the keys only on top do you

3396
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:42,409
want me to keep rambling for it alright

3397
02:07:39,139 --> 02:07:48,199
so it's essentially a single plant scrub

3398
02:07:42,408 --> 02:07:50,509
to where you have these bigger pots uses

3399
02:07:48,198 --> 02:08:05,509
27 I'm pretty sure something like that I

3400
02:07:50,510 --> 02:08:10,489
use around 2020 the pots are two foot

3401
02:08:05,510 --> 02:08:11,960
tall but it's just it's it works for

3402
02:08:10,488 --> 02:08:14,988
what it is it's all about you know

3403
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:16,850
working surface area you're giving

3404
02:08:14,988 --> 02:08:20,359
especially like in areas where they

3405
02:08:16,850 --> 02:08:23,360
limit plant counts do a lot of things

3406
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:24,649
for people I'm writing down the word

3407
02:08:23,359 --> 02:08:25,609
surface area because that's a good thing

3408
02:08:24,649 --> 02:08:27,979
to think about we're gonna go back to

3409
02:08:25,609 --> 02:08:29,658
that so yeah for people with limited

3410
02:08:27,979 --> 02:08:30,769
plant counts in Colorado well in our

3411
02:08:29,658 --> 02:08:32,799
location

3412
02:08:30,770 --> 02:08:34,730
definitely messing with plant counts and

3413
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:35,810
we're not gonna be able to grow as many

3414
02:08:34,729 --> 02:08:37,429
plants as we used to

3415
02:08:35,810 --> 02:08:39,530
so what's Vince has done he's taking

3416
02:08:37,430 --> 02:08:43,490
these giant pots and he takes a plant

3417
02:08:39,529 --> 02:08:45,050
and he build a PVC sort of a frame

3418
02:08:43,489 --> 02:08:46,250
around it so it's he's got a square

3419
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:50,060
frame now above the plant

3420
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:51,439
how big is that square anywhere it's a

3421
02:08:50,060 --> 02:08:54,260
four by four square

3422
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:56,779
cage basically you've got a cage out of

3423
02:08:54,260 --> 02:09:01,270
your PVC and you do layers of trellis

3424
02:08:56,779 --> 02:09:04,789
for support you know if some people do

3425
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:06,890
there's a lot of people because it works

3426
02:09:04,789 --> 02:09:09,199
I mean it's it's more bang for your buck

3427
02:09:06,890 --> 02:09:16,070
if you have you know especially it's in

3428
02:09:09,199 --> 02:09:18,409
my opinion strain dependent strains that

3429
02:09:16,069 --> 02:09:21,529
are built for that system Gorilla Glue

3430
02:09:18,409 --> 02:09:24,019
loves it loves it killers I'm saying so

3431
02:09:21,529 --> 02:09:26,929
like those moonshine Hays that lobsters

3432
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:29,420
grow all inside that net so things like

3433
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:34,340
that works and cookies will do decent

3434
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:36,520
but not like essentially it's a four by

3435
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:40,850
four cage with you know multiple

3436
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:43,100
trellises and then you lollipop from the

3437
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:44,690
soil to the first trellis you know so

3438
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:48,950
everything from that first trellis up

3439
02:09:44,689 --> 02:09:51,109
will be just knows okay yeah all right

3440
02:09:48,949 --> 02:09:55,880
so you go get your frame you got a

3441
02:09:51,109 --> 02:09:57,319
square then you put a net over you just

3442
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:05,720
got a bud going through each part of the

3443
02:09:57,319 --> 02:10:07,130
screen it's out of control because it's

3444
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:09,560
more about you know canopy management

3445
02:10:07,130 --> 02:10:11,329
like making sure while it's you know

3446
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:14,720
especially through the stretch face from

3447
02:10:11,329 --> 02:10:16,880
they want a flower till date 21:22 which

3448
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:18,289
when it's growing like crazy you'll want

3449
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:20,239
to get in there and really like tie them

3450
02:10:18,289 --> 02:10:21,019
down make sure they're not growing out

3451
02:10:20,239 --> 02:10:23,779
of

3452
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:25,490
what they didn't need to so it's you

3453
02:10:23,779 --> 02:10:28,519
know with those trellis nets are like

3454
02:10:25,489 --> 02:10:30,409
3x3 squares or 4x4 squares you know you

3455
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:32,810
want to try to essentially get a node or

3456
02:10:30,409 --> 02:10:36,319
a coal to hit every single one of those

3457
02:10:32,810 --> 02:10:37,820
squares I mean there's if there's 60 of

3458
02:10:36,319 --> 02:10:42,319
them on a plant so just you know the

3459
02:10:37,819 --> 02:10:44,059
surface area works okay how early in the

3460
02:10:42,319 --> 02:10:49,509
veg do you start manipulating the screen

3461
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:55,400
so typically what I do is I'll go from a

3462
02:10:49,510 --> 02:10:57,110
one gallon pot or a clone to three and

3463
02:10:55,399 --> 02:10:59,359
I'll let that three kind of get bulky in

3464
02:10:57,109 --> 02:11:01,549
that three gallon and then straight into

3465
02:10:59,359 --> 02:11:03,859
the final pots and then give them you

3466
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:05,659
know five six weeks but it's really not

3467
02:11:03,859 --> 02:11:06,979
as long as people think it is especially

3468
02:11:05,659 --> 02:11:09,470
when it's strain dependant and strain to

3469
02:11:06,979 --> 02:11:13,819
grow you know faster than other strains

3470
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:17,180
yeah it's gonna be worth it so once you

3471
02:11:13,819 --> 02:11:19,309
you know find your strain that you want

3472
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:21,200
to use you know you basically are

3473
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:24,039
training it through the net so you know

3474
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:30,139
so if it's getting too tall

3475
02:11:24,039 --> 02:11:32,479
make it go back under the trellis what I

3476
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:34,039
like to do is I like to just kind of on

3477
02:11:32,479 --> 02:11:36,139
your first screen you kind of spread it

3478
02:11:34,039 --> 02:11:37,850
open and then you let all the insides

3479
02:11:36,140 --> 02:11:40,369
grow up and everything on the outsides

3480
02:11:37,850 --> 02:11:41,570
gonna grow okay around in the case all

3481
02:11:40,369 --> 02:11:43,849
those little shoots that would just be

3482
02:11:41,569 --> 02:11:45,380
cut off your normal you're gonna grow

3483
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:51,920
into actual bridge yeah they're gonna go

3484
02:11:45,380 --> 02:11:54,369
straight to branches so the bottom of

3485
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:57,680
the stalk that shoot clear up to the top

3486
02:11:54,369 --> 02:11:59,420
canopy management okay I read an article

3487
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:00,920
a long time ago they kind of introduced

3488
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:03,079
me to this idea the article was actually

3489
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:05,149
called growing on the grid is what I

3490
02:12:03,079 --> 02:12:06,710
think it was called and author was Eric

3491
02:12:05,149 --> 02:12:09,229
Pizza I'm gonna Google that just to make

3492
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:11,149
sure but he was used to be a writer for

3493
02:12:09,229 --> 02:12:15,039
High Times and he wrote an article about

3494
02:12:11,149 --> 02:12:15,039
this I'm searching his name while I talk

3495
02:12:17,949 --> 02:12:21,649
it's called growing on the grid with

3496
02:12:19,909 --> 02:12:23,389
Eric pizza it'll kind of if you guys

3497
02:12:21,649 --> 02:12:26,869
want to read more about it this is kind

3498
02:12:23,390 --> 02:12:29,030
of we're gonna give you the the in

3499
02:12:26,869 --> 02:12:31,069
action in practice sort of talk Eric

3500
02:12:29,029 --> 02:12:32,659
pizza is he writes a lot so he's gonna

3501
02:12:31,069 --> 02:12:33,439
give you a really technical explanation

3502
02:12:32,659 --> 02:12:35,229
on it

3503
02:12:33,439 --> 02:12:38,359
I'm not sure how many times he's done it

3504
02:12:35,229 --> 02:12:39,549
Spence here has done it message and

3505
02:12:38,359 --> 02:12:41,539
Greenworks

3506
02:12:39,550 --> 02:12:42,860
we're gonna try to get Greenworks to

3507
02:12:41,539 --> 02:12:45,369
call in one day and we'll talk to him

3508
02:12:42,859 --> 02:12:48,019
we've got I just actually learned how to

3509
02:12:45,369 --> 02:12:50,569
record quality phone interviews using

3510
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:51,860
FaceTime I probably can do it with Skype

3511
02:12:50,569 --> 02:12:54,139
also I just haven't experimented with

3512
02:12:51,859 --> 02:12:55,429
that yet I opened a FaceTime and played

3513
02:12:54,140 --> 02:12:57,469
around and I'll be able to record so

3514
02:12:55,430 --> 02:12:59,449
beyond the show you're far away

3515
02:12:57,469 --> 02:13:01,850
FaceTime is now the way to do it it'll

3516
02:12:59,448 --> 02:13:02,719
be great Greenworks I'm inviting you

3517
02:13:01,850 --> 02:13:04,820
call us

3518
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:06,140
speaking of FaceTime I'm gonna get up I

3519
02:13:04,819 --> 02:13:06,948
want to talk about this guy in a couple

3520
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:09,020
of minutes but I'll talk more about

3521
02:13:06,948 --> 02:13:26,179
Canon canopy management but I have a

3522
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:29,660
phone interview plan into the three goes

3523
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:39,980
into the 20 do top before you transplant

3524
02:13:29,659 --> 02:13:42,738
into the 20 at all it's a plan to me

3525
02:13:39,979 --> 02:13:45,049
some people do top it but I'm more of

3526
02:13:42,738 --> 02:13:47,329
just kind of you know working it through

3527
02:13:45,050 --> 02:13:48,650
the net so I'll take one branch and take

3528
02:13:47,329 --> 02:13:49,969
it all the way to the left side and take

3529
02:13:48,649 --> 02:13:52,009
this branch and take it to the right

3530
02:13:49,969 --> 02:13:57,230
side and eventually in that system it's

3531
02:13:52,010 --> 02:13:58,940
gonna fill itself back up if I took my

3532
02:13:57,229 --> 02:14:07,039
whole arm and just it over its gonna

3533
02:13:58,939 --> 02:14:09,698
just make little shoots horizontal you

3534
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:12,979
know your colas grow your nodes stack

3535
02:14:09,698 --> 02:14:14,389
vertically they grow together so if you

3536
02:14:12,979 --> 02:14:16,459
were to bend that branch all the way

3537
02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:19,190
down you're taking each one of those bud

3538
02:14:16,460 --> 02:14:20,779
sites turning them up which creates more

3539
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:33,229
bud sites on that plant then you would

3540
02:14:20,779 --> 02:14:34,698
get stacking it together okay for the

3541
02:14:33,229 --> 02:14:36,709
plant all right that makes pretty good

3542
02:14:34,698 --> 02:14:39,619
sense so you don't talk at all that's

3543
02:14:36,710 --> 02:14:40,840
see I would have topped them some

3544
02:14:39,619 --> 02:14:44,729
strains I do

3545
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:44,730
girl Guzman the ones I kind of gross

3546
02:14:46,159 --> 02:14:50,250
[Music]

3547
02:14:50,970 --> 02:15:01,119
there's there's some things I would do a

3548
02:14:58,630 --> 02:15:02,980
couple two weeks worth of aiming and

3549
02:15:01,119 --> 02:15:13,829
your training and stuff like that and

3550
02:15:02,979 --> 02:15:20,769
then know what to do because they are

3551
02:15:13,829 --> 02:15:25,359
know which ways up still alright and I

3552
02:15:20,770 --> 02:15:28,180
have like seven questions in my head if

3553
02:15:25,359 --> 02:15:43,719
it's not gorilla glue what other strain

3554
02:15:28,180 --> 02:15:45,220
do you like to sprog and it's I'm still

3555
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:46,570
learning like the curve I'm still

3556
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:50,440
picking up the curve which is you know

3557
02:15:46,569 --> 02:15:52,689
going from you know seven and tens up to

3558
02:15:50,439 --> 02:15:54,699
20s and to plants that are two to three

3559
02:15:52,689 --> 02:15:56,139
times the size you know maintenance on

3560
02:15:54,699 --> 02:15:58,269
those plants like you always have to be

3561
02:15:56,140 --> 02:16:02,200
cleaning up the bottoms and stuff cuz

3562
02:15:58,270 --> 02:16:05,860
imagine you know six-foot plant that's

3563
02:16:02,199 --> 02:16:07,269
four and a half feet wide underneath

3564
02:16:05,859 --> 02:16:08,559
there so the things like the leaves and

3565
02:16:07,270 --> 02:16:10,210
stuff died off just because they don't

3566
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:12,300
get light to survive so you have to

3567
02:16:10,210 --> 02:16:14,980
constantly be in there picking them off

3568
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:15,850
and things like that it's a good thing

3569
02:16:14,979 --> 02:16:17,319
to think about

3570
02:16:15,850 --> 02:16:18,670
I like that you said that would have

3571
02:16:17,319 --> 02:16:19,960
been a six-foot-tall plan that you've

3572
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:20,859
gotten it down to four feet tall that

3573
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:25,949
kind of puts it into a lot of

3574
02:16:20,859 --> 02:16:28,779
perspective for me I'm running in a

3575
02:16:25,949 --> 02:16:31,420
nine-foot ceiling but it's all about can

3576
02:16:28,779 --> 02:16:32,590
you keep him down the light.the kavita's

3577
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:35,290
will work for you it's just all about

3578
02:16:32,590 --> 02:16:37,210
like in my opinion when you when plants

3579
02:16:35,290 --> 02:16:39,219
get tall and get close up to the

3580
02:16:37,209 --> 02:16:44,739
kavita's and then they kind of feel how

3581
02:16:39,218 --> 02:16:48,009
powerful they are all the way down you

3582
02:16:44,739 --> 02:16:49,479
know it's all about surface area oh do

3583
02:16:48,010 --> 02:16:50,979
you have a prediction on how much weight

3584
02:16:49,479 --> 02:16:52,659
you're gonna pull per thousand watt

3585
02:16:50,979 --> 02:16:55,989
light with this new system

3586
02:16:52,659 --> 02:17:01,989
well right now per thousand watt I'll

3587
02:16:55,989 --> 02:17:04,659
probably pull all my first go probably

3588
02:17:01,989 --> 02:17:06,699
six seven hundred grams per gorilla

3589
02:17:04,659 --> 02:17:11,590
booth that's not bad at all that's over

3590
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:12,519
a pound and a quarter yeah comes back

3591
02:17:11,590 --> 02:17:15,880
right okay

3592
02:17:12,519 --> 02:17:18,040
and that'll be pound and a half with

3593
02:17:15,879 --> 02:17:20,670
it's only in a 4k I'm running a 4k

3594
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:23,469
kavita's and for a six week that's not

3595
02:17:20,670 --> 02:17:25,030
the plants really grow like when you put

3596
02:17:23,468 --> 02:17:27,669
them from a three gallon pot into a

3597
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:28,960
plant a pot that's I've seen stocks of

3598
02:17:27,670 --> 02:17:35,829
your plants and their figure around in

3599
02:17:28,959 --> 02:17:37,119
these microphones for sure Wow yeah it's

3600
02:17:35,829 --> 02:17:38,228
impressive your rooms look great I've

3601
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:39,460
been in there well I've been in there a

3602
02:17:38,228 --> 02:17:40,898
few days or so but I've been there

3603
02:17:39,459 --> 02:17:44,169

broadcasting but we have a house and all

3613
02:18:28,450 --> 02:18:31,210
that so I talked about taking my

3614
02:18:29,739 --> 02:18:32,679
recording equipment to the cup and just

3615
02:18:31,209 --> 02:18:46,808
taking it to my hotel bring it to my

3616
02:18:32,679 --> 02:18:48,099
house this is not snow but he's gonna be

3617
02:18:46,808 --> 02:18:49,688
in the Denver area during the Cannabis

3618
02:18:48,099 --> 02:18:50,978
Cup and you're down with Spitz and you

3619
02:18:49,689 --> 02:18:53,439
want to take a dad with Rasta Jeff in

3620
02:18:50,978 --> 02:18:55,209
the garden of Weeden true there's a good

3621
02:18:53,439 --> 02:18:56,648
chance I will bring some maybe not this

3622
02:18:55,209 --> 02:18:58,509
big ol set up but I might bring some

3623
02:18:56,648 --> 02:19:00,099
small recording gear I just have a lot

3624
02:18:58,510 --> 02:19:01,389
going on I don't want this to disappear

3625
02:19:00,099 --> 02:19:03,280
while I'm at the cup or something for

3626
02:19:01,388 --> 02:19:04,869
sure from the car or some [ __ ] I get

3627
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:05,670
prayer this is my livelihood so I'd be

3628
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:07,979
crushed with

3629
02:19:05,670 --> 02:19:10,228
but uh this gear some kind of recording

3630
02:19:07,978 --> 02:19:14,099
gear may end up at the got my phone if

3631
02:19:10,228 --> 02:19:15,808
nothing else that works well let's at

3632
02:19:14,099 --> 02:19:17,299
least hang out a few guys and take some

3633
02:19:15,808 --> 02:19:22,468
dabs this show won't come out for

3634
02:19:17,299 --> 02:19:24,238
probably a week front it's tomorrow but

3635
02:19:22,468 --> 02:19:25,289
you'll have plenty of time it's just the

3636
02:19:24,238 --> 02:19:26,488
middle of March when this comes out

3637
02:19:25,290 --> 02:19:28,290
let's meet up the cannabis cup you guys

3638
02:19:26,488 --> 02:19:30,359
let's take some dabs I should have some

3639
02:19:28,290 --> 02:19:40,050
Geoff's OG dad's if spence's down to

3640
02:19:30,359 --> 02:19:42,689
blast it for me do that if you're not

3641
02:19:40,049 --> 02:19:44,129
gonna do this grogs you can lollipop

3642
02:19:42,689 --> 02:19:46,590
really heavily that's another good way

3643
02:19:44,129 --> 02:19:48,509
to make space for what you've got kind

3644
02:19:46,590 --> 02:19:50,460
of pay attention get down on your knees

3645
02:19:48,510 --> 02:19:53,130
and see how far the light is getting

3646
02:19:50,459 --> 02:19:54,389
into your plants and when you don't see

3647
02:19:53,129 --> 02:19:55,619
any light hitting those leaves just

3648
02:19:54,389 --> 02:19:57,389
clean that [ __ ] off from the bottom

3649
02:19:55,620 --> 02:20:02,970
there because there's no like it's gonna

3650
02:19:57,389 --> 02:20:10,379
be a waste of space there's you can do

3651
02:20:02,969 --> 02:20:13,289
shaking I like the system but I still

3652
02:20:10,379 --> 02:20:15,000
like the old-school look going in a room

3653
02:20:13,290 --> 02:20:25,409
and being a hundred stakes deep in there

3654
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:32,790
and I like some stakes I grow some

3655
02:20:25,408 --> 02:20:35,250
plants I use the seven gallon requires

3656
02:20:32,790 --> 02:20:37,319
either a tomato cage or some staking

3657
02:20:35,250 --> 02:20:41,879
yeah I like this because I can pull it

3658
02:20:37,318 --> 02:20:46,228
apart and I can break I can support do

3659
02:20:41,879 --> 02:20:48,839
what you do just train it to like this

3660
02:20:46,228 --> 02:20:50,429
this coal has got this section this coal

3661
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:53,809
has got this section you want to kind of

3662
02:20:50,430 --> 02:20:58,408
fill as many sections as you can yeah

3663
02:20:53,809 --> 02:21:02,760
you're using the golden go or the whole

3664
02:20:58,408 --> 02:21:04,770
bunch of heads doesn't really like to do

3665
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:07,199
it so maybe grow a whole bunch of small

3666
02:21:04,770 --> 02:21:09,029
cookies plants like just if you can do a

3667
02:21:07,199 --> 02:21:11,460
bunch of two-foot tall three foot tall

3668
02:21:09,029 --> 02:21:15,658
cookies - flour it yeah that's the way

3669
02:21:11,459 --> 02:21:18,408
to go G cush just do a bunch of small

3670
02:21:15,658 --> 02:21:18,408
ones instead of one

3671
02:21:19,530 --> 02:21:30,480
yeah they couldn't figure out how to

3672
02:21:37,799 --> 02:21:40,869
[Music]

3673
02:21:48,750 --> 02:21:52,020
[Music]

3674
02:21:54,329 --> 02:22:01,450
light a flower to help you know early or

3675
02:22:00,190 --> 02:22:02,771
the first couple weeks of fire do you

3676
02:22:01,450 --> 02:22:05,851
keep them lowered you keep them further

3677
02:22:02,771 --> 02:22:08,530
away you know my lights don't move I

3678
02:22:05,851 --> 02:22:09,730
sometimes put my plants on a five-gallon

3679
02:22:08,530 --> 02:22:11,290
bucket to get them higher but for the

3680
02:22:09,729 --> 02:22:17,949
duration of the girl my plant my lights

3681
02:22:11,290 --> 02:22:20,740
don't move on in the rooms one thing I

3682
02:22:17,950 --> 02:22:22,329
do is I don't change out from the

3683
02:22:20,739 --> 02:22:25,629
halides to the sodium's for the first

3684
02:22:22,329 --> 02:22:29,110
two weeks of flower they keep some I

3685
02:22:25,629 --> 02:22:31,539
feel like they don't stretch as far when

3686
02:22:29,110 --> 02:22:40,630
I do the switch I start to bulk up right

3687
02:22:31,540 --> 02:22:43,450
away at the two weeks I really probably

3688
02:22:40,629 --> 02:22:46,060
that change from blue to HBS kind of

3689
02:22:43,450 --> 02:22:48,521
gives them a time span they gotta get

3690
02:22:46,060 --> 02:22:58,510
used to that [ __ ] I do dark periods

3691
02:22:48,521 --> 02:23:02,851
before flower under 24 hours and then I

3692
02:22:58,510 --> 02:23:02,851
would veg for 24 and then go dark for 24

3693
02:23:10,399 --> 02:23:19,270
[Music]

3694
02:23:12,329 --> 02:23:27,399
so I go 18 to 6 when they sleep they're

3695
02:23:19,271 --> 02:23:28,811
ugly and then when they you know

3696
02:23:27,399 --> 02:23:31,239
eventually when the lights come back on

3697
02:23:28,810 --> 02:23:34,029
their get into the swing of things and

3698
02:23:31,239 --> 02:23:36,039
then you know before the cutoff start

3699
02:23:34,030 --> 02:23:42,851
going back down and then I usually hit

3700
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:45,160
that 48 hours dark even when it's dark

3701
02:23:42,851 --> 02:23:46,540
they're already praying and ready I feel

3702
02:23:45,159 --> 02:23:49,271
like they're just preparing themselves

3703
02:23:46,540 --> 02:23:52,240
for the time change yeah excited for it

3704
02:23:49,271 --> 02:23:54,101
yeah it's crazy how like you the plants

3705
02:23:52,239 --> 02:23:55,930
will be the veg looking and then that

3706
02:23:54,101 --> 02:23:59,800
dark period you go in there like oh [ __ ]

3707
02:23:55,930 --> 02:24:01,540
they're ready plant these plants tell us

3708
02:23:59,799 --> 02:24:03,279
what they want that's for sure I like it

3709
02:24:01,540 --> 02:24:06,130
he'll be afraid to try a different light

3710
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:08,110
cycled my mother plants run on a 19-5

3711
02:24:06,129 --> 02:24:10,750
cycle recommended by dieter Knight is in

3712
02:24:08,110 --> 02:24:12,940
1950 a 19-5 recommended by DJ short and

3713
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:14,709
that's the best performance I've ever

3714
02:24:12,940 --> 02:24:17,440
had from the mother plant so don't be

3715
02:24:14,709 --> 02:24:20,259
afraid to experiment with some stuff now

3716
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:30,790
I do the I do 18 6 in my veg areas and

3717
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:37,960
then my flower I just ever grown was

3718
02:24:30,790 --> 02:24:40,000
actually grown under a high pressure

3719
02:24:37,959 --> 02:24:41,649
sodium in a 400 watt metal halide in the

3720
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:46,870
same bulb and that grow syllable that

3721
02:24:41,649 --> 02:24:48,879
Hydrofarm a yeah that was great great

3722
02:24:46,870 --> 02:24:50,771
bud it had great flavor it looked great

3723
02:24:48,879 --> 02:24:51,429
some of my best pictures came from that

3724
02:24:50,771 --> 02:24:53,440
run a flower

3725
02:24:51,430 --> 02:24:56,970
there's definitely quality buds my best

3726
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:56,970
girl of that headband cut ever

3727
02:25:03,909 --> 02:25:06,988
[Music]

3728
02:25:11,510 --> 02:25:27,020
so what's his name there's going on

3729
02:25:31,219 --> 02:26:20,189
there's some new [ __ ] it's called I saw

3730
02:26:18,389 --> 02:26:26,659
it first on Instagram from a dude named

3731
02:26:20,190 --> 02:26:28,319
soil called this dude what do you think

3732
02:26:26,659 --> 02:26:33,539
cuz we're gonna have me on the show

3733
02:26:28,319 --> 02:26:35,159
pretty soon I will gladly support

3734
02:26:33,540 --> 02:26:40,140
somebody trying something new for sure

3735
02:26:35,159 --> 02:26:45,930
like no doubts I was listening to church

3736
02:26:40,139 --> 02:26:47,939
today don't like don't freak out on me

3737
02:26:45,930 --> 02:26:49,489
cuz I say this cuz people argue about it

3738
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:53,069
all the time but it's the first

3739
02:26:49,489 --> 02:26:55,860
non-solvent actual not enough there's

3740
02:26:53,069 --> 02:26:58,799
not like water as much as you do you

3741
02:26:55,860 --> 02:27:00,450
don't believe it it's a solvent then the

3742
02:26:58,799 --> 02:27:02,699
butane and propane those are all

3743
02:27:00,450 --> 02:27:05,730
solvents but he's just using pure heat

3744
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:08,950
to extract oils there's no you can't use

3745
02:27:05,729 --> 02:27:13,329
heat as a solvent heat and pressure

3746
02:27:08,950 --> 02:27:18,110
see the pictures like the whole slab

3747
02:27:13,329 --> 02:27:20,420
rolled up in a worm around the car he's

3748
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:22,220
been going in lately yeah I've got a

3749
02:27:20,420 --> 02:27:23,569
scheduled phone interview with him he

3750
02:27:22,219 --> 02:27:25,099
said Tuesday or Wednesday he hasn't

3751
02:27:23,569 --> 02:27:26,569
confirmed a specific time but we're

3752
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:28,130
gonna talk to him I'll probably just

3753
02:27:26,569 --> 02:27:29,989
piece that right into this episode you

3754
02:27:28,129 --> 02:27:31,789
guys if I can get him to call me on time

3755
02:27:29,989 --> 02:27:33,469
that's all I need I'll throw that into

3756
02:27:31,790 --> 02:27:35,689
this show probably right here so here's

3757
02:27:33,469 --> 02:27:39,379
an interview maybe hopefully what so how

3758
02:27:35,689 --> 02:27:40,610
you doing bro great cool man thanks for

3759
02:27:39,379 --> 02:27:45,379
uh pulling some time away from your work

3760
02:27:40,610 --> 02:27:46,550
to join us I'm just gonna I know you're

3761
02:27:45,379 --> 02:27:47,719
a busy man I'm just gonna get right to

3762
02:27:46,549 --> 02:27:49,459
it and start asking a couple of quick

3763
02:27:47,719 --> 02:27:51,679
questions first of all can you explain

3764
02:27:49,459 --> 02:27:54,639
to me a little bit about what rasen tech

3765
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:54,639
is and how you got the idea

3766
02:28:09,430 --> 02:28:17,720
hash you take your hash no no you can

3767
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:19,520
turn it into now all the resin out of

3768
02:28:17,719 --> 02:28:23,809
the no no you know with the double

3769
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:29,540
boiler a ball and your no notes so if I

3770
02:28:23,809 --> 02:28:31,519
did this different method rosin I guess

3771
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:33,530
what rosin is technically it's just a

3772
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:35,840
form of resin obtained from my plant you

3773
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:37,850
know that's where like I don't I don't

3774
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:40,489
know why it's called rising I mean it's

3775
02:28:37,850 --> 02:28:42,649
similar like rosin what I know Roz was

3776
02:28:40,489 --> 02:28:46,699
like you know for both strings for

3777
02:28:42,649 --> 02:28:48,949
friction together but I don't know where

3778
02:28:46,700 --> 02:28:51,740
the term actually stuck in cannabis but

3779
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:53,570
that's where I know it's from and it's

3780
02:28:51,739 --> 02:29:05,930
really kind of related to Residence you

3781
02:28:53,569 --> 02:29:09,469
know in a way basically I know so I

3782
02:29:05,930 --> 02:29:12,620
decide something out I have all this no

3783
02:29:09,469 --> 02:29:15,920
no but I remember back then collecting

3784
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:19,520
his teeth but something on on the IG

3785
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:21,170
about taking like a flat iron just

3786
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:22,699
suppressing you know I'm just

3787
02:29:21,170 --> 02:29:25,010
by your hash much simpler than heating

3788
02:29:22,699 --> 02:29:26,420
up a wand or you know doing something

3789
02:29:25,010 --> 02:29:27,978
like that you can set the right town

3790
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:32,329
just to press it out you have a proper

3791
02:29:27,978 --> 02:29:35,090
track down well I used to take my wife's

3792
02:29:32,329 --> 02:29:37,488
hair curler and I would uh sometimes I

3793
02:29:35,090 --> 02:29:39,228
get too hot you know by accident and I

3794
02:29:37,488 --> 02:29:40,850
would notice better with separate is the

3795
02:29:39,228 --> 02:29:43,129
oil and then the hash

3796
02:29:40,850 --> 02:29:45,050
I wasn't thinking this is like you know

3797
02:29:43,129 --> 02:29:46,158
this is uh this was a while back so I

3798
02:29:45,049 --> 02:29:49,129
didn't think anything of it I would just

3799
02:29:46,158 --> 02:30:13,250
focus on backup and yeah I have a pest

3800
02:29:49,129 --> 02:30:16,339
catty that was over but uh anything that

3801
02:30:13,250 --> 02:30:22,219
I would try to try to increase the

3802
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:23,809
quality on it so we'll give you the idea

3803
02:30:22,219 --> 02:30:34,969
to just start pressing straight buds

3804
02:30:23,809 --> 02:30:36,228
without trying passion there we just

3805
02:30:34,969 --> 02:30:38,510
took I don't know we're just sitting

3806
02:30:36,228 --> 02:30:43,478
here smoking no I'm not I smoked flour

3807
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:47,318
but my thing is yeah me too definitely

3808
02:30:43,478 --> 02:30:50,469
yeah so so we're just sitting here

3809
02:30:47,318 --> 02:30:53,420
bullshitting with my father-in-law and

3810
02:30:50,469 --> 02:30:54,889
like hey let's try this I grab now he's

3811
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:56,359
like what are you doing I put it in

3812
02:30:54,889 --> 02:31:00,289
between the parchment just like I would

3813
02:30:56,359 --> 02:31:04,790
a you know a rolled-up ball and hash and

3814
02:31:00,290 --> 02:31:07,130
my surprise resin squeeze out the button

3815
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:10,220
we were both in shock like no way

3816
02:31:07,129 --> 02:31:11,658
so I scooped up the oil did it again

3817
02:31:10,219 --> 02:31:13,579
scooped it up there was a little there

3818
02:31:11,658 --> 02:31:15,750
was enough on the hand look like a gap

3819
02:31:13,579 --> 02:31:26,939
so we tried it out

3820
02:31:15,750 --> 02:31:28,709
and uh and to my subscribers even good

3821
02:31:26,939 --> 02:31:31,829
ba Jolie for Reza do sometimes

3822
02:31:28,709 --> 02:31:34,829
so that's impressive yeah yeah exactly

3823
02:31:31,829 --> 02:31:46,469
very sweet you got lucky figuring that

3824
02:31:34,829 --> 02:31:57,420
one out do what I do every day and I was

3825
02:31:46,469 --> 02:31:59,099
so much into the to the extracts as much

3826
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:00,420
as you do to find that for us because it

3827
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:23,520
seems to be the thing now bro you're

3828
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:24,779
blowing up on Instagram yeah just kind

3829
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:26,130
of a brief oh I know it's just a pretty

3830
02:32:24,779 --> 02:32:31,409
simple process can you tell me kind of

3831
02:32:26,129 --> 02:32:34,469
briefly how you do it process and

3832
02:32:31,409 --> 02:32:36,029
extraction I would say if you want to do

3833
02:32:34,469 --> 02:32:40,318
it the most basic way to do it for

3834
02:32:36,029 --> 02:32:42,149
anybody at home ladies flat iron your

3835
02:32:40,318 --> 02:32:45,028
hair straighter get the widest one you

3836
02:32:42,148 --> 02:32:47,579
can digital settings would be optimum

3837
02:32:45,029 --> 02:32:52,800
that's not I mean when I first did it I

3838
02:32:47,579 --> 02:32:59,818
had it up to 420 degrees yeah I mean it

3839
02:32:52,799 --> 02:33:01,469
seems worried about you know so to my

3840
02:32:59,818 --> 02:33:03,539
surprise I was pulling out that and now

3841
02:33:01,469 --> 02:33:04,500
that I'm fine tuned it a little bit and

3842
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:13,800
there's gonna be a lot more involved

3843
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:15,629
it's just those Turks out of it but so

3844
02:33:13,799 --> 02:33:19,159
you just get the straightening comb with

3845
02:33:15,629 --> 02:33:21,509
a flat iron and then just baseball game

3846
02:33:19,159 --> 02:33:24,329
yeah so you put it between the parchment

3847
02:33:21,510 --> 02:33:25,889
and then put it between the firon you

3848
02:33:24,329 --> 02:33:28,109
want to do it in a quick fast as

3849
02:33:25,889 --> 02:33:29,489
possible put it between my flat iron and

3850
02:33:28,109 --> 02:33:32,579
then press it as hard

3851
02:33:29,489 --> 02:33:34,470
you know as far as you can for about I'd

3852
02:33:32,579 --> 02:33:37,379
say one or two to three seconds

3853
02:33:34,470 --> 02:33:40,049
depending like how hot you got your iron

3854
02:33:37,379 --> 02:33:42,810
but usually you hear you come out it

3855
02:33:40,049 --> 02:33:45,060
mostly it comes down to trial and error

3856
02:33:42,810 --> 02:33:47,399
and hearing that that sound of knowing

3857
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:52,829
when to pull up and you know knowing

3858
02:33:47,399 --> 02:33:53,970
when you have it to Heidi really all

3859
02:33:52,829 --> 02:33:55,739
right so I'm just gonna practice and

3860
02:33:53,970 --> 02:33:56,970
waste a couple of buds doesn't look like

3861
02:33:55,739 --> 02:33:58,590
you're doing a lot of buds at one time

3862
02:33:56,970 --> 02:34:13,709
so that's not too big of a deal to waste

3863
02:33:58,590 --> 02:34:15,931
a couple nuggets I get a more efficient

3864
02:34:13,709 --> 02:34:18,329
process but right now this seems to work

3865
02:34:15,931 --> 02:34:20,790
it's if I can fine-tune this to make it

3866
02:34:18,329 --> 02:34:22,379
workable do whatever goes on after it's

3867
02:34:20,790 --> 02:34:23,700
gonna be better there you go keep

3868
02:34:22,379 --> 02:34:26,369
improving everyday that's the way this

3869
02:34:23,700 --> 02:34:27,990
industry is working so are you doing

3870
02:34:26,370 --> 02:34:29,311
anything special to prepare the buds do

3871
02:34:27,989 --> 02:34:30,569
you like them a little more so you like

3872
02:34:29,310 --> 02:34:43,760
i'm dr you like them crispy

3873
02:34:30,569 --> 02:34:49,699
do you like I'm cured too much moister

3874
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:52,021
it probably will work too much like

3875
02:34:49,700 --> 02:35:03,931
fresh nuts and I haven't had too many

3876
02:34:52,021 --> 02:35:08,000
results with it nothing under static is

3877
02:35:03,931 --> 02:35:13,790
gonna affect whether we see it or not

3878
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:18,239
you know moisture just wrapping in there

3879
02:35:13,790 --> 02:35:21,721
some not properly dried ìwe you know

3880
02:35:18,239 --> 02:35:24,899
you're trapping moisture so I don't see

3881
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:26,729
that being the same for this process all

3882
02:35:24,899 --> 02:35:27,029
right do I do certain strains work

3883
02:35:26,729 --> 02:35:28,529
better

3884
02:35:27,030 --> 02:35:29,909
do you like into Custer sativas work

3885
02:35:28,530 --> 02:35:36,721
better or do you have a favorite strain

3886
02:35:29,909 --> 02:35:39,319
that works the best for making rosin I

3887
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:43,140
mean I've even had some real frosty

3888
02:35:39,319 --> 02:35:46,739
tequila's but not like it

3889
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:51,511
9% but I have some indicas fall around

3890
02:35:46,739 --> 02:35:53,869
anywhere spun like 9 to 22% you know wow

3891
02:35:51,511 --> 02:35:53,870
that's impressive

3892
02:35:54,470 --> 02:36:24,209
yeah all right that's good to know how

3893
02:36:21,931 --> 02:36:26,431
does the flavor of a rosin dab compared

3894
02:36:24,209 --> 02:36:35,459
to like a Pho dab result unless tab are

3895
02:36:26,431 --> 02:36:36,659
you still getting good flavors my next

3896
02:36:35,459 --> 02:36:38,279
question I was gonna ask if you've had

3897
02:36:36,659 --> 02:36:40,909
anything tested or if anybody that you

3898
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:43,141
know is how to test it yet yeah actually

3899
02:36:40,909 --> 02:36:46,170
foundation extracts I think somebody

3900
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:51,379
else um actually seemed like it was

3901
02:36:46,170 --> 02:36:53,851
pretty high in CBD my page with the

3902
02:36:51,379 --> 02:36:55,949
results of combination extract I think I

3903
02:36:53,851 --> 02:36:56,641
was like eighty-three percent THC and

3904
02:36:55,950 --> 02:37:13,620
eight percent

3905
02:36:56,640 --> 02:37:15,000
Wow have you seen any hatred from all

3906
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:16,620
the BHO people you guys have spent

3907
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:19,819
thousands of dollars on equipment and

3908
02:37:16,620 --> 02:37:19,820
now you're just doing it with the shirt

3909
02:37:22,430 --> 02:37:25,549
[Music]

3910
02:37:30,300 --> 02:37:35,189
a lot of people are just like just not

3911
02:37:33,479 --> 02:37:37,619
giving it a chance but then you know

3912
02:37:35,190 --> 02:37:39,899
like I'll see them I'll see some of

3913
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:41,579
these people like changing their minds

3914
02:37:39,899 --> 02:37:43,859
about it they're trying it out once they

3915
02:37:41,579 --> 02:37:44,341
try it like you can't knock it till you

3916
02:37:43,860 --> 02:37:48,329
try it

3917
02:37:44,341 --> 02:37:50,940
right you know this industry they make

3918
02:37:48,329 --> 02:37:52,440
decisions right away yeah you're right

3919
02:37:50,940 --> 02:37:55,620
you're right just how the way the world

3920
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:56,909
it's the way the world works but they're

3921
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:59,250
gonna be the one in this

3922
02:37:56,909 --> 02:38:00,659
right that's true guys if you ever get a

3923
02:37:59,250 --> 02:38:02,879
chance anybody that's listening if you

3924
02:38:00,659 --> 02:38:04,770
get a chance take a dab of some rosin

3925
02:38:02,879 --> 02:38:09,059
before you dissin try the rosin check

3926
02:38:04,770 --> 02:38:11,100
yourself don't be a hater there you go

3927

how's the hi is it similar to a normal

3928
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:45,059
dab do you get feeling like you do

3929
02:38:24,870 --> 02:38:47,189
sometimes from a water dab or most

3930
02:38:45,059 --> 02:38:49,049
likely being challenged this year all

3931
02:38:47,189 --> 02:38:50,550
right well if you were at the Denver Cup

3932

action as well very cool I can't wait to

3941

seen people are loving it Thirteen's

3946
02:39:52,159 --> 02:39:56,000

that I went just can't forget that it's

3948
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:02,870
thought of this I'm not big on [ __ ]

3949
02:39:59,319 --> 02:40:05,351
saw that with solvent extracts that's

3950
02:40:02,870 --> 02:40:08,210
sometimes in my mind I have four years

3951
02:40:05,351 --> 02:40:11,569
against it you know there's some very

3952
02:40:08,209 --> 02:40:24,919
enjoyable extracts actually solvents but

3953

4006
02:43:18,681 --> 02:43:22,489
her I've seen people use a flat iron or

4007
02:43:21,260 --> 02:43:32,360

02:43:33,500 --> 02:43:36,890
person that's been in my house I'm in

4011
02:43:35,510 --> 02:43:41,601
Colorado I grew up in Southern

4012
02:43:36,890 --> 02:43:43,310
California where I had like she had she

4013
02:43:41,601 --> 02:43:45,680
called it a flat iron or a straightening

4014
02:43:43,310 --> 02:43:48,010

4015
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:50,271
[Music]

4016
02:43:48,010 --> 02:43:52,610
these guys are using [ __ ] that's around

4017
02:43:50,271 --> 02:43:53,510
the house and handmade Adam had from

4018
02:43:52,610 --> 02:43:56,000
handmade apparel

4019
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:57,500
he showed me his what he posted his slab

4020
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:04,250
because of course he had a t-shirt press

4021
02:43:57,500 --> 02:44:17,479
already and just kind of around the

4022
02:44:04,250 --> 02:44:21,229
house actually I think it has something

4023
02:44:17,479 --> 02:44:24,470
to do with the moisture content of how

4024
02:44:21,229 --> 02:44:27,829
your wheat is dried like you down here

4025
02:44:24,470 --> 02:44:37,670
is really dry so it's just maybe I

4026
02:44:27,829 --> 02:44:40,159
needed to do more we've got his piece

4027

because maybe we won't get his interview

4030
02:44:45,079 --> 02:44:49,909
this dude's taking a t-shirt press and

4031
02:44:47,690 --> 02:44:51,920

4032
02:44:49,909 --> 02:44:54,590
parchment paper a little layer of buds

4033
