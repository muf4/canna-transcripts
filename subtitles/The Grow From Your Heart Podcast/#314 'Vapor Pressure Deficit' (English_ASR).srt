27
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,929
start the show off by letting you know

28
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:04,269
what I'm dabbing on right before the

29
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:06,579
show I took a big fat dab of starchild

30
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,548
og live resin from a cut above in

31
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:11,349
Colorado Springs I love the flavor of

32
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:14,020
this concentrate they told me it was

33
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:16,209
tangerine Hayes and trainwreck I can

34
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:18,789
certainly taste that trainwreck tripping

35
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:21,069
alene that a dryer sheet sort of a smell

36
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,960
and there's a very small hint of the

37
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,798
tangerine haze in there maybe on the

38
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,469
aftertaste

39
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,450
I love it the high is amazing it's a

40
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,759
super head high gets me a nice and

41
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:34,118
talkative gets me nice and creative

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,099
really good podcast dad's star child og

43
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,739
live resin from a cut above in Colorado

44
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:40,688
Springs great concentrate also what a

45
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:42,548
great name I wish I had thought of that

46
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:44,919
but you know what I did think of you

47
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:46,509
guys what a great segue I've got a plant

48
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,399
called cactus cooler and it's called

49
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,649
cactus cooler because it tasted just

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,930
like the cactus cooler soda it tastes

51
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,879
like oranges and pineapples and it is

52
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,250
delicious I did not breed it I did not

53
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,099
create it the clone of cactus cooler was

54
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:02,618
gifted to me by a friend but I did breed

55
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:05,438
it to my arise it has been given out as

56
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:07,868
the freebie or as a bonus pack on the

57
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,909
dank seed dot store but now it has an

58
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:12,189
official name it is officially called

59
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:14,770
pineapple wine so if you got a freebie

60
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,699
five pack of the cactus cooler to arise

61
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,219
you

62
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:21,068
changed the label to pineapple wine that

63
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:22,810
is the new official name and the reason

64
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:24,518
I went with the pineapple wine not only

65
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,530
is it a great reggae song name and it

66
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,969
represents that Island flavor that it's

67
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,580
gotten the vibe of the strain that I

68
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:33,239
felt but it carried that pineapple and

69
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:37,540
fruity flavor over but it's also the

70
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:39,129
there's a chem dog and an OG Kush and a

71
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:41,229
funky flavor that kind of came along

72
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:42,639
with it it was added to the pineapple

73
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,889
flavor and it kind of gives it sort of a

74
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,500
fermented wine funky sort of a thing so

75
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,939
pineapple wine was a perfect name it's

76
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,430
gonna make giant plants you're gonna get

77
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,769
big old buds the concentrates are

78
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,480
amazing the concentrates that are gonna

79
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,789
come off of these buds are going to

80
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,068
taste like pineapple candy and pineapple

81
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:02,019
wine and fruity delicious Terps and

82
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:04,030
there will be plenty of concentrates

83
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,700
coming off of these buds so pineapple

84
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,439
wine at dink seed dot store make sure

85
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:09,729
you check them out you guys all right

86
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,489
I've got a couple of questions that came

87
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:14,560
from Instagram let's start with I think

88
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,019
this one was kind of fun kind of funny

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,640
and I want your opinion on it I thought

90
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,620
it was a great question I don't have a

91
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,839
real answer but I wanted to share this

92
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,389
with my listeners it goes like this

93
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,000
hello bro hope you're well I had a mad

94
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:30,459
stoned thought if you use beneficial

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,139
insects does that mean they're poo ends

96
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,709
up on the bud like the same if it was

97
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:34,930
pest

98
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,670
would it be sensible to rinse or soak

99
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,879
your finished plants like Jorge does

100
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:41,469
with the ones with PM that's a really

101
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,959
good question about the bug poo I never

102
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:45,669
thought about the other bug poo

103
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,439
of course those bugs that go in there

104
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:49,479
and eat the spider mites they're gonna

105
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,849
have to poo somewhere they're probably

106
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,500
pulling right on your leaves they're not

107
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,379
gonna be pooping in the buds the buds

108
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,030
the bugs don't really live in the buds

109
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,560
as much you'll notice the spider mites

110
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,090
don't really go into the buds they're

111
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,949
more on the leaves and they want to suck

112
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,569
the chlorophyll out of the leaves they

113
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:07,060
prefer the weaker leaves they don't want

114
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:08,500
to go sucking on the buds as much you do

115
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,939
find them making their little teepees up

116
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,919
on top of the buds that's just cuz they

117
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:13,959
want to get up high so the fan can grab

118
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,370
them the wind can blow them to the next

119
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,379
plant they can start taking over the

120
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,810
next plant and build their colony but

121
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:21,759
you'll notice that they don't eat the

122
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,439
buds they eat the leaves so hopefully

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,360
the predator bugs are gonna get in there

124
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,098
and they're gonna realize that all those

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,389
trichomes and all that resin is not a

126
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,110
fun place to be and they're just gonna

127
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,819
hang out

128
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,500
the leaves they're gonna go and eat all

129
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:34,000
the shitty bugs and then they're just

130
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,560
gonna the shitty bugs right then they're

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,639
just gonna [ __ ] right there on the

132
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,410
leaves and then hopefully you're gonna

133
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,269
trim that off and you're not gonna get

134
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,080
too much of the beneficial insect poop

135
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:46,180
into your buds your concentrates and

136
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,870
eventually of course into your edibles

137
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,240
so how much poop do you think a little

138
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,329
tiny spider my eater is going to make

139
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,310
because spider mites are microscopic how

140
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:59,919
big is their poop gonna be I think I

141
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,740
would rather have that little bit of

142
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,569
spider mite poop in my garden then more

143
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,300
spider mites producing more spider mite

144
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,370
eggs and hopefully by the time you

145
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,009
harvest it it's been blown off by a fan

146
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,870
or knocked off by a spray hopefully that

147
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:16,089
that little tiny bit of poop is gone

148
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,649
hopefully it gets knocked off and the

149
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:19,299
last part of your message you say should

150
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:21,789
we dunk it like we've seen Jorge

151
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,990
Cervantes do for powdery mildew and if

152
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,990
you guys aren't familiar with that

153
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,629
there's a video of Jorge Cervantes he

154
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,220
takes a five-gallon bucket he puts he

155
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,769
fills it most of the way with water

156
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,840
he puts the 30% hydrogen peroxide in

157
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:36,189
there he stirs it up then he takes long

158
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,019
colas that he's harvested they're

159
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:40,329
freshly harvested mostly trimmed up he

160
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:42,250
trims it most of the way then he dunks

161
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:44,289
these buds straight into the hydrogen

162
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,389
peroxide and gives them a shake and you

163
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,830
can see the powdery mildew come right

164
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,519
off of the buds and it floats to the

165
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:50,169
surface

166
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,399
right at the top of the water and then

167
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,040
he pulls him out and then he just hangs

168
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,689
him up to dry that method does work if

169
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,490
you've got powdery mildew or if you're

170
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,870
trying to clean something off it's kind

171
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,550
of a shitty method it's kind of funky

172
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,110
I'd rather you figure out what your

173
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,879
problem isn't correct that and get rid

174
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,199
of the mildew we stuff but I understand

175
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,509
that in a commercial gross sometimes

176
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,370
[ __ ] has to happen it's not the best way

177
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:10,389
to do things but I get it sometimes

178
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,500
you're not the boss

179
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,289
sometimes you're told what to do

180
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,569
whatever but that method does work if

181
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:20,800
you're in dire straits I wouldn't do it

182
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:22,930
in fear of predatory mite poop that's a

183
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
little little over-reactive what you

184
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,480
could do

185
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,360
toward the end of the flowering cycle

186
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:31,480
you could spray the plants lightly with

187
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,100
just clean water ah that wouldn't be a

188
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,600
problem if you don't soak them to where

189
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,490
they're dripping to where the buds are

190
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,080
gonna get saturated like sponges you

191
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,819
could just dust them off that's kind of

192
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,889
a common thing you can just go in there

193
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,819
and hit them lightly with water if you

194
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:44,649
use the pain spray

195
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,599
or if you pump up the sprayer real hard

196
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:48,219
it'll just spray on like a little bit of

197
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,980
win and a little bit of water just clean

198
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:55,750
them off hopefully hopefully that's

199
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:58,180
knocking off any predatory insect poop

200
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,620
that you think may have gathered up on

201
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,480
the buds and there's not gonna be much

202
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,040
if you're running a large grow and

203
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,480
you've released thousands of predators

204
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,400
in there you're not gonna get enough

205
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,439
you're not gonna find a half a gram of

206
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,729
bug [ __ ] and the whole thing I wouldn't

207
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:14,889
imagine and the little tiny bit of

208
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:17,830
predatory mite poop that does happen is

209
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:20,349
way better than spider mite eggs and

210
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:23,620
spider mites and spider mite webbing and

211
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,270
a diminished crop quality and a lessened

212
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,220
harvest weight because you let the

213
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:29,649
spider mites take hold and it's way

214
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,880
better think about it this way I didn't

215
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,799
even get to this part of my head yet

216
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,829
it's way better than smoking some

217
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,750
questionable pesticide maybe you smoked

218
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:40,209
a couple of pieces of bug poop

219
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,220
I haven't even established how much bug

220
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:44,680
poop we may have smoked but maybe you're

221
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,280
smoking a miniscule amount a little bug

222
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,290
turds

223
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:53,139
we know that bug turds are less harmful

224
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,970
than a little bit of flora might we know

225
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:59,289
that some bug turds are a little bit

226
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:02,200
less harmful for you than pyrethrins we

227
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:05,439
know they I would rather smoke a little

228
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:09,009
bit a bug turd then consume something

229
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,600
covered in funky pesticides so I think

230
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,420
it's worth it it's a fair trade-off for

231
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,670
me I think it's a great conversation

232
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,830
what do you guys think do you think that

233
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,810
the predatory mites that I'm releasing

234
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:21,939
in my garden are taking a [ __ ] in my

235
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,230
buds do you think they're taking a [ __ ]

236
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:25,569
on the leaves because they obviously

237
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,740
poop all creatures that are eating

238
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:29,139
something they're gonna poop something

239
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,469
out where's that poop going is it ending

240
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:33,639
up in the cannabis that we're smoking do

241
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:35,349
you think it's shaking off during

242
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,899
harvest we hang the plants upside down

243
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,490
for like 14 day not 14 days like seven

244
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:41,439
days they hang upside down do you think

245
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,090
all the the bug poop is coming off then

246
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,410
do you think the light spray that we

247
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,420
applied toward the end of harvest do you

248
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:47,679
think that gets rid of the bug poop what

249
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,059
do you think I want your opinion you

250
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,919
guys send me an email it's girl from

251
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:52,449
your heart at hotmail.com or tweet me at

252
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:55,729
gf white podcast

253
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:58,339
let's talk about bug poop in cannabis

254
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,500
either way however much Bug poop were

255
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,660
smoking I think it's probably safer and

256
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,120
better than smoking a bunch of crazy

257
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,500
pesticides Hey Dude thanks for the great

258
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,970
message I'm not sure if you want your

259
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,039
name said on the podcast you didn't

260
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,870
mention that and you also said it was a

261
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,088
stoned idea so thanks for getting stoned

262
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,070
and having a great idea that started a

263
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,500
conversation and created some podcast

264
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,750
content I've got another question that

265
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,028
came from Instagram live this one is

266
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,940
about lab testing an Instagram live

267
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:28,610
watcher asked when we send a sample to a

268
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,220
lab for potency testing do we send just

269
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,629
the top or do we send certain parts of

270
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,820
the plant and that's a very good

271
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:36,620
question because the procedure was

272
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,629
recently changed by the Colorado

273
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,490
marijuana Enforcement Division by the

274
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:41,600
Colorado Department of the Colorado

275
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,339
Department of Public Health and

276
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,009
Environment and also the Colorado

277
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,510
Department of Agriculture they all got

278
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:50,799
together and they made a new testing

279
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:53,360
guideline or a new sample collection

280
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,828
standard operating procedures what it is

281
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,289
it's the new sample collection the

282
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:59,239
potency and contaminant sample

283
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:00,620
collection standard operating procedure

284
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,318
and it was sent out to all of the grows

285
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,299
everybody with the metric ID number got

286
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:06,828
the email recently and we all had to

287
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:10,009
kind of change the way that we collect

288
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:12,019
samples so now we are not allowed to

289
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,600
just send in the best looking buds no

290
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:17,839
that's not what we do everything happens

291
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,519
on camera there are every inch of a grow

292
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,680
facility is on camera if you're at a

293
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,350
Colorado marijuana Enforcement Division

294
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,198
regulated recreational or medical grow

295
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,149
you were on camera so it all happens on

296
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:32,269
camera this happens in a very specific

297
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:33,740
room there's a very specific way that

298
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,179
the samples are to be collected I'm not

299
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,089
gonna tell you the entire procedure but

300
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:40,068
I'll tell you why we're not able to just

301
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:42,800
take those prime choice tops that look

302
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:46,399
like they're the best when we harvest

303
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,409
there are going to be between 20 and 60

304
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,110
plants of the same strain and they'll

305
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:53,809
all be harvested as the same batch so

306
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,209
let's just pick a strain will say Ghost

307
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:58,338
Dog say we just took down 40 ghost dog

308
00:10:56,208 --> 00:11:02,059
plants that is a batch and they've got a

309
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:03,709
batch ID number those ghost dog plants

310
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:05,539
aren't all going to fit in one container

311
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,338
when they go into our dry and cure room

312
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,649
they're gonna get separated they're

313
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,569
gonna get in into probably I don't even

314
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:13,429
guess how many I'll say eight to ten

315
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:14,719
different containers and they're gonna

316
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:17,628
have different numbers on they're gonna

317
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,600
say Ghost Dog batch whatever container

318
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:22,069
number one Ghost Dog batch number or

319
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,269
whatever container number two and

320
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:25,549
they'll be labeled up to whatever number

321
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:27,078
they are then they're gonna get trimmed

322
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:29,838
then they're going to get put into

323
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:31,519
containers after they're trimmed each of

324
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,699
those containers will still be labeled

325
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,039
Ghost Dog batch number ah [ __ ]

326
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:39,678
container number whatever then we're

327
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,448
gonna get instructions from the lab

328
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:43,188
testing place that's gonna say okay

329
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:45,049
Ghost Dog batch number or whatever

330
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:45,708
you're talking about container number

331
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:48,558
three

332
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:50,359
grab that container open it up then go

333
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:52,909
to the far bottom-left corner

334
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,110
we won and these are dried and cured and

335
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:55,549
trimmed buds these are buds that have

336
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,769
been trimmed and dried and cured and

337
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,539
that are ready to go to the store so the

338
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,889
next step is to reach into there and get

339
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:03,139
one out of the bottom left like they

340
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:05,778
requested and put that sample in the

341
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,579
sampling container then they'll request

342
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:09,948
another bud though they may say ghost

343
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:12,409
dog batch number whatever container

344
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:14,028
number six open the container and take

345
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:15,828
the bud from the very top right in the

346
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:16,909
middle so okay Google will open it up

347
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:18,620
take the blood right out of the middle

348
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:20,600
then that bud goes into our little

349
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,120
collection container and then they'll

350
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,129
give you different various areas to take

351
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,480
plants from or to take your samples from

352
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:27,769
and you've got to follow those

353
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,999
instructions and you've got actually

354
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:30,379
sign for it and you've got to have a

355
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,959
witness and you got to mark it down on a

356
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:34,999
little paper so quite often it's say hey

357
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,469
Mike did Jeff do his job and Mike's got

358
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:38,749
to sign off for it yes Jeff actually

359
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,399
took these samples so no we're not

360
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:42,589
allowed to just go and get those prime

361
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,289
lookin buds and all of this stuff is

362
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:47,149
done I'm wearing a face mask I've got a

363
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:48,528
mask on my face so I don't get any beard

364
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,089
hair into there so I don't breathe into

365
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:52,909
it

366
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:56,120
I've got goggles on well I've got rubber

367
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:58,639
gloves on and then I've got a lab coat

368
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,019
or a Tyvek suit that I've cut the the

369
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,698
leg end off of to make a little

370
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,438
makeshift lab coat it's a little lighter

371
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:06,378
and easier to work with so I'm all

372
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:08,928
covered up I'm all lab procedure if I

373
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:11,420
switch strains I will switch gloves and

374
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:12,649
if I am using scissors to maybe cut some

375
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:14,778
stems out or something

376
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:16,909
I would actually switch scissors or

377
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:19,990
clean the scissors to make sure that if

378
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:22,938
one sample has a microbial contaminants

379
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,490
ampuls and mess things up for our sample

380
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:26,309
and get

381
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:29,339
things sterilized you got to keep being

382
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:32,309
separate it is a pretty tedious task of

383
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,680
taking samples to pass the Colorado

384
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:37,169
standards now these samples that were

385
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,719
taking for potency these are also our

386
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:42,389
microbial samples so we send in the same

387
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,028
sample to the same lab to check the

388
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:47,789
level of THC CBD and a few other

389
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:50,759
cannabinoids you can do a terpene test

390
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:52,980
but it costs more money also they will

391
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,080
run a microbial test on there they will

392
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,310
look for yeast and mold and I'm not sure

393
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,810
everything that they look for because

394
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:00,569
we've never had a problem nothing has

395
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:03,958
come up we're doing things correctly but

396
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:07,110
also at the same time they run a random

397
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:09,419
pesticide test I'm not sure who decides

398
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,669
to run the pesticide test but randomly

399
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:13,588
it happens and when they run that

400
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:16,169
pesticide test they can tell you if

401
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:18,149
pesticides were applied to the buds they

402
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:19,588
can tell you which pesticides were

403
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,450
applied to the buds and they can tell

404
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,760
you if they were illegal pesticides that

405
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,528
are allowed by the Colorado Department

406
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,480
of Agriculture and the Colorado

407
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:29,399
marijuana Enforcement Division along

408
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,889
with the Colorado Department of Public

409
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,769
Health and Environment they know what

410
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:37,439
was applied to your buds so there's no

411
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:39,659
fooling these tests uh you're getting

412
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,610
your microbe test your potency test and

413
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:43,980
your pesticide test from the same sample

414
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:47,039
we were actually required to send in

415
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,110
four grams so they're able to do up to

416
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,519
four tests if they require a gram per

417
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,050
test and I think they should be able to

418
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,299
test it with just a half a gram so they

419
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:56,759
can probably do somewhere between four

420
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,409
and eight hopefully six solid tests so

421
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,049
they can test us for potency if we come

422
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:03,059
up real high they can retest it they can

423
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:04,500
test it for microbes if it comes up with

424
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:06,239
something hopefully they've got enough

425
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
for another test and then if they're

426
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,879
gonna test us for all that and they see

427
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,708
something weird then I would just say

428
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,299
run that pesticide test just see if

429
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,739
they're doing something fishy and then

430
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,479
you're gonna need that fifth and sixth

431
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,799
sample and then where it all comes back

432
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,120
legit they're gonna say well [ __ ]

433
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,500
test it again for potency because that

434
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,209
Rasta Jeff killed it and they're gonna

435
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,120
need sample number seven at that point

436
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:26,369
but that's just hypothetical anyway no

437
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,500
the question was do you guys just send

438
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,078
in the main top for lab testing no we do

439
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,019
not we are specifically instructed by

440
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,539
the laboratory through an email of which

441
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:39,269
parts of the plant to send in for

442
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,919
testing and before those regulations

443
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:42,569
were like that we were still not allowed

444
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,740
to just send in the MainTop you were

445
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,020
supposed to pool parts from different

446
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,110
parts of the plant I would actually be

447
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,449
dried trimmed cured buds that are ready

448
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,800
for the store like buds that are you're

449
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,090
almost ready to drive them to the store

450
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,089
you're just waiting for the lab tests

451
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,769
that's what gets tested so we get it

452
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,269
tested and then it's got to sit there we

453
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:02,429
are not even allowed to sell it until

454
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:04,259
that lab test comes back it's not

455
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:06,719
allowed to leave the grow it can't go to

456
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,850
the store until it's lab tested so you

457
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,860
guys know it's safe it's also not

458
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,800
allowed to go to a concentrate or edible

459
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,259
maker if it hasn't been tested yet so if

460
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,089
we've got trim or buds set aside that we

461
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,860
want to make concentrate out of we're

462
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,810
not allowed to send that until the buds

463
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,090
have been tested and we know that

464
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:26,399
everything is clean and safe so no

465
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,290
basically we're not allowed to send just

466
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,470
the tops was what your question was and

467
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:36,059
oftentimes you may find that the tops

468
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:37,860
don't hold the most THC a sometimes the

469
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:40,049
light was too close and it cooked the

470
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,700
THC right out of them sometimes those

471
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:43,889
bottom buds get a little frosty err

472
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,020
sometimes the tops got touched too much

473
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:48,240
sometimes those big old tops were just

474
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,129
handled and destroyed sometimes you'll

475
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,649
find those middle buds have the better

476
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:54,570
potency but that is not always the case

477
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:56,309
all right thanks again for another great

478
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,170
question I'm not sure that that person

479
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:00,000
wants their name revealed on the podcast

480
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:02,279
so I'm gonna keep that private they know

481
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,809
who they are big shout out much respect

482
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,180
again if you guys have a question you

483
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:08,849
can send me an email my email address is

484
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,740
grow from your heart at hotmail.com I

485
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,299
would love to hear from you all right

486
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,759
I've gotten a lot of requests to talk

487
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:16,529
about vapor pressure deficit so I wrote

488
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:19,769
a few notes and I would like to teach

489
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:21,569
you guys about vapor pressure deficit

490
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:23,339
vapor pressure deficit has been the hot

491
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:25,230
new buzzword in the cannabis community

492
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,329
it's been in the magazines it's been in

493
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,829
the forums people are trying to sell you

494
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:32,279
new equipment so that you can monitor

495
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:35,099
your vapor pressure deficit if you keep

496
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,629
seeing the letters VPD in magazines when

497
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,129
people are talking about conditions in

498
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,590
the grow room they are talking about the

499
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,090
vapor pressure deficit now let's talk

500
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:44,759
about a couple of things before we work

501
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:47,519
up to explaining the vapor pressure

502
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:49,650
deficit now before we can understand

503
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,309
vapor pressure deficit we need to learn

504
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,870
about

505
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,789
transporation a lot of you already know

506
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:54,839
what transpiration is but just to get

507
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:56,940
everybody up to speed

508
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,829
transpiration that is when water

509
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,000
evaporates from the plants basically the

510
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,649
plants absorb the water through the

511
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,480
roots they use what they need and then

512
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,040
they release the excess nutrients

513
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,349
through transpiration through the

514
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,819
underside of the leaves this is

515
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:11,669
basically the plant's version of

516
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:13,439
sweating or maybe the plant going to the

517
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,289
bathroom now the main factors that

518
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,330
contribute to transpiration are

519
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:20,250
temperature and humidity when the grow

520
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:23,669
room gets hot the plants will sweat and

521
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:26,430
transpire the vapor pressure deficit is

522
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:29,940
what decides how much those plants are

523
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,950
allowed to transpire the vapor pressure

524
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,529
deficit is basically what the plants

525
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,269
feel the main force that moves water

526
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:38,039
vapor out of the leaf is the vapor

527
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:40,170
pressure difference between the water

528
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,599
vapor inside the leaf and the water

529
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,120
vapor surrounding the leaf so if there

530
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,339
is too much vapor around that leaf it

531
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,199
won't be able to release more vapor if

532
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:51,480
there's not enough then it's going to

533
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,880
just go wide open and release too much

534
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,250
but the plant is smart and it tries to

535
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,020
prevent that so if it's too dry and the

536
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,609
plant can feel that it's too dry and

537
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:01,650
it's releasing too much vapor it will

538
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:04,979
actually close the stomata and stop

539
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,810
itself from dehydrating itself so too

540
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,579
high of a vapor pressure deficit the

541
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:11,009
stomata will close and the plant will

542
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:12,839
basically stop functioning too high of a

543
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:15,539
vapor pressure deficit and guess what

544
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,009
that's tomahto will close and again stop

545
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,269
functioning which will cause your plant

546
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:20,069
to slow down have you ever seen the

547
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:21,990
plants just look like [ __ ] and you can't

548
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:23,279
figure out why they're the leaves are a

549
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,509
little leathery they're a little bit

550
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,759
funky or maybe they're a little bit

551
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:29,700
crispy oftentimes that's from a vapor

552
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,980
pressure deficit oftentimes that's

553
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,049
caused by a fan beating the [ __ ] out of

554
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,420
that area of the plants it's just moving

555
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:38,039
all the vapor away and you've got

556
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,900
nothing but dryness so you've got a

557
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:42,059
plant with no moisture it's got these

558
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,710
closed stomata because it's just dry all

559
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,389
the time around there and so the plant

560
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,700
is actually struggling to keep that

561
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,530
section happy and healthy and keep the

562
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,110
nutrients moving the way that it should

563
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:54,180
so vapor pressure deficit is basically

564
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:56,009
what the plants are feeling now think

565
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,470
about think about yourself trying to

566
00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:00,180
breathe maybe you go to the desert or

567
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,160
it's super dry and then maybe another

568
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,659
day you go to the zoo and you go to the

569
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,788
rain for

570
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,349
stereo where it's super moist or [ __ ]

571
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,729
maybe you lived in Las Vegas where it's

572
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:09,408
super dry and then maybe you spent a

573
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:11,778
summer in Lawrence Kansas where it's

574
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:14,299
super moist now think about how your

575
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:15,558
skin and your lungs reacted to those

576
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:17,720
different environments when you go to

577
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:19,368
Las Vegas and it's super hot it's a

578
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,558
hundred and twenty degrees and it's dry

579
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:23,449
you get out of the car your skin starts

580
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:24,950
to feel tight and dry and when you go to

581
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,139
breathe your lungs are like dude that

582
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,879
air is hot and dry [ __ ] you your lungs

583
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:30,949
get all dried out and you need water you

584
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:32,269
got to go get a drink because you're

585
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,609
just drying yourself out

586
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,989
now imagine when you go to Kansas and

587
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,608
you get out of the car and your skin

588
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:39,200
feels all moist and supple and your hair

589
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:40,668
gets all funky and curly because all the

590
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,009
moisture in the air but you can breathe

591
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:44,840
because all that moisture you use you to

592
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,618
suck in big ole clouds cuz it's not dry

593
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,138
and stale

594
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:50,478
that's the vapor pressure deficit having

595
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:51,769
an effect on humans notice when it's a

596
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,330
little cooler you can breathe a little

597
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:54,888
bit better notice if you ever have been

598
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:56,989
in a walk-in cooler you can breathe a

599
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:58,488
super well in the walk-in cooler but

600
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,659
have you ever been standing by the oven

601
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:01,879
and tried to take a big deep breath

602
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,799
that's really unpleasant right that's

603
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:05,418
sort of the same thing that's a lot of a

604
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,089
lot of temperature there but there's

605
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:09,649
also moisture being involved in that

606
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:11,778
temperature now let's talk about the

607
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:13,548
equation I said earlier that vapor

608
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:15,108
pressure deficit is actually a math

609
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:16,368
equation so let me try to explain this

610
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,819
equation for you I've got it written

611
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:23,569
down vapor pressure deficit equals

612
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:27,189
liquid saturation vapor pressure - okay

613
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:31,489
- the air saturated vapor pressure times

614
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:33,019
the air relative humidity now I'm gonna

615
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:35,749
say it again so if you want to write it

616
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:39,769
down you can write this down VPD equals

617
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:43,278
LS VP which is liquid saturation vapor

618
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:45,679
all right - and then in parentheses

619
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:51,409
we've got the air saturation vapor

620
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:55,629
pressure times the air percent of

621
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:59,470
relative humidity so you're multiplying

622
00:21:55,628 --> 00:22:04,548
air saturated vapor pressure times area

623
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,979
today t then you were subtracting that

624
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:08,989
from the liquid saturation vapor

625
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:10,308
pressure now if that makes any sense to

626
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:13,190
you you'll understand how to do that

627
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:15,108
equation if not it's not necessary you

628
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,700
do not need to do that equation there

629
00:22:15,108 --> 00:22:18,589
are charts available there are

630
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,210
monitors available there are several

631
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:22,579
companies that make light temperature

632
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,860
humidity co2 monitors and a lot of them

633
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:27,169
already include the vapor pressure

634
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:28,969
deficit so if you see that VPD and you

635
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,130
never knew what that was that is vapor

636
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,960
pressure deficit now you'll find a lot

637
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,120
of great charts online then will show

638
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,549
you your ideal vapor pressure deficit

639
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,649
range if you look online for a chart

640
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:41,779
keep in mind that a lot of those charts

641
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,570
are designed for non cannabis plants

642
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:46,339
this is going to be very plant specific

643
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:48,379
I've been running a couple of different

644
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:49,970
devices that show me my vapor pressure

645
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,470
deficit I've got multiple growth

646
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,240
facilities I've got a personal grow I

647
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,100
would grow for other people I also visit

648
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,140
other grows I've been paying attention

649
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:59,209
to a smart bee unit I've also been

650
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:03,259
paying attention to the PIO grow systems

651
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:05,569
unit now what I've learned where I see

652
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:07,970
the plants happiest in weeks one through

653
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:10,250
two a flower I like to have a vapor

654
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,440
pressure deficit somewhere between eight

655
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:16,279
and 11 which is gonna put you at about

656
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,870
77 to 79 degrees with 65 to 75 percent

657
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,700
of humidity now if you do the equation

658
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:22,339
we talked about earlier the liquid

659
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,190
saturation vapor pressure minus the air

660
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:28,069
saturation vapor pressure times air per

661
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:32,750
centum it a that equation is going to

662
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:34,339
come out to between 8 and 11 so for

663
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,250
weeks 1 through 2 you're looking at a

664
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:39,139
vapor pressure deficit of 8 to 11 for

665
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,549
weeks 3 through 4 you're gonna want to

666
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,690
start lowering your humidity a little

667
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:43,339
bit you're gonna want to get a little

668
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,950
bit cooler you're looking for a vapor

669
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:50,179
pressure deficit somewhere between 10

670
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:52,940
and 13.5 ok you're gonna be at 75 to 77

671
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,049
degrees and you're looking for 55 to 65

672
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,960
percent humidity

673
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:58,879
now weeks 5 through 9 we're going to

674
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,090
adjust we're gonna go down to about 42

675
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,550
to 50% humidity you want 74 to 76

676
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:06,139
degrees and if we do the math equation

677
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:09,980
in those ranges that is going to bring

678
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:12,380
our vapor pressure deficit to 13 to 15

679
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,819
point 5 and we want it a little cooler

680
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,780
and a little drier at the end of flower

681
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,609
we don't want to give it too much

682
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:17,930
moisture because we want to avoid bud

683
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:20,149
rot and we want to get it a little

684
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,980
cooler because that nice cool ending

685
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:26,090
temperature is gonna give us some nice

686
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:28,190
sexy colors so those are the ideal vapor

687
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:30,289
pressure deficit ranges you're always

688
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:33,289
going to be between 11 and 5

689
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:35,359
15.5 seems to be our ideal range if you

690
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:37,430
don't have anything to measure your

691
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,349
vapor pressure deficit you can measure

692
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,120
your relative humidity and you can

693
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:43,009
measure your temperature and then you

694
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:46,069
can do the math equation and you can

695
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:48,170
figure out your vapor pressure deficit

696
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:50,269
get that dialed in once you get it

697
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,279
dialed in you may notice that you can

698
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:53,869
increase the amount of nutrients you're

699
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:56,299
giving your plants you may actually have

700
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:58,759
to water the plants more frequently when

701
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:01,430
you get when you get your vapor pressure

702
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,410
deficit dialed in your soil may dry more

703
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,269
quickly you may get a better wet dry

704
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,620
cycle from your plants so you're going

705
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:08,059
to have to pay attention to all of these

706
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:10,339
things it's going to change your grow

707
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:12,529
but it will be for the better it's one

708
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:15,049
more thing that we can tweak and dial in

709
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:17,629
and make our plants reach their full

710
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:19,940
potential all right you guys I think I

711
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,950
have covered vapor pressure deficit if

712
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,140
I've left you with questions please

and be patient you guys you're gonna

736
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:10,970
have to dial it in and every time you

737
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,979
dial in one more thing it's gonna get

738
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,680
better but you're also going to find one

739
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,000
more thing to dial in all right you guys
