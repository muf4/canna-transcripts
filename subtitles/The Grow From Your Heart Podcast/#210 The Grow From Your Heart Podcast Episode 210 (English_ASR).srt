booyah are hanging out in my kitchen so

196
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,590
did we record this show about ten feet

197
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:37,529
from my kitchen so that could have been

198
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:41,519
a reality almost it's kind of you

199
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:42,929

come cook for us anybody can come cook

201
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,709

202
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:53,100
will eat almost anything

203
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:56,879
Tony chef all right I've got a couple

204
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,080
topics written down one of them this

205
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,149
just came up I was kind of rude to

206
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,969
somebody the other day I realized that

207
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:05,849
they were selling their plants their

208
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,890
crop got powdery mildew and instead of

209
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,900
salvaging it they decided to cut the

210
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,490
drop down and make live resin out of it

211
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:13,709
and I would not have known about it

212
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,579
unless somebody else told me that they

213
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:19,379
were doing that and so I called him out

214
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,180
on it and I said you are the difference

215
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,860
between being a caregiver and a cash

216
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,840
crop er you were the person that's gonna

217
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,449
make somebody sick because we shouldn't

218
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:30,079
be giving tainted medicine to people who

219
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:32,218
already have a compromised immune system

220
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,860
other people in the room treated me like

221
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,719
I was kind of going overboard but I felt

222
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,389
it was kind of my responsibility to call

223
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,979
this dude out and let him know that he's

224
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:42,838
really doing it wrong and he's making us

225
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,610
all look bad you know he's not helping

226
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,320
the movement at all and that's not what

227
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,060
I'm working towards so I wanted have a

228
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,520
little bit of backup when I approached

229
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:51,539
this dude saying this is why so that's

230
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,769
why I brought Tony on the show like I

231
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,509
was saying earlier Tony's an organic

232
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,338
chemistry student and he knows a lot

233
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,710
about this so I guess the simple

234
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:01,620
question I want to ask once again excuse

235
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,210
my dad's throat if we take these powdery

236
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,940
mildew buds and we blast them with

237
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,740
butane are we gonna get powdery mildew

238
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,970
or what is happening can you tell me a

239
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,659
little about that well you're not gonna

240
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:15,839
get the powdery mildew itself but you'll

241
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:18,088
get the mycotoxins or any sort of toxins

242
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:23,400
that they create which powdery mildew is

243
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:24,780
fairly toxic to humans now believe it or

244
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,539
not you actually probably be better off

245
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:30,120
smoking the buds yourself not

246
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:32,490
distributing them but you'd be less

247
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,350
toxic than blasting it and concentrating

248
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,600
it that's why the column concentrates

249
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,480
because we're concentrating everything

250
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,519
that's in the plant matter into a an oil

251
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,580
that

252
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:46,129
is far far far more concentrated than

253
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,629
plant matter itself I hadn't even

254
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:49,850
thought about that route you're making

255
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,049
powdery mildew dabs just like you are

256
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,340
ash yeah

257
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:57,139
you're taking it mycotoxins and

258
00:09:52,340 --> 00:10:01,519
concentrating it okay when you say

259
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:03,199
fairly toxic could you put some kind of

260
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,059
comparison on that well it's definitely

261
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,730
not like black mold or anything like

262
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:11,029
that but um I'm sure you guys remember

263
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,639
the swag days Oh cheap brick weed oh

264
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:16,250
yeah that stuff had powdery mildew in it

265
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,720
very often and even smoking small

266
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,080
quantities of that you'd end up with

267
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,330
chest congestion bronchitis usually sore

268
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,410
throat for a week and a half so you

269
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,830
could imagine what happens if you

270
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:29,750
concentrate it 10 to 15 times the dosage

271
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,090
and then you take a big fat dab like I

272
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,070
like to do oh yeah you just probably got

273
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,050
a good percentage of mycotoxins in your

274
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,520
body yeah and the trippy thing about

275
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:39,679
that is it's not gonna show up

276
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,960
immediately immediately it's probably

277
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,729
gonna show up in a month or two it's a

278
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,430
really weird effects you're probably

279
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,440
gonna go a little nuts from it a little

280
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:50,179
bit of psychosis in my mind behavior

281
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,500
change yeah but there annoy you that's

282
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:54,379
if we smoke a lot right that's not like

283
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,779
someone or two dads and p.m. dabs it's

284
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:58,730
consistent small doses okay

285
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:01,549
so if you're smoking it use them once a

286
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,379
day for a week or two it's gonna do some

287
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:05,299
weird stuff to you all right definitely

288
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,769
don't want to do that makes you think

289
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:09,949
guys wonder why your dads are coming

290
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:11,720
from this is something that caught my

291
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,790
mind he said it's almost it would be

292
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,950
better if you smoke the buds than it

293
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:17,629
would be to smoke the hash and I also

294
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,190
like that you said smoke the damn buds

295
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:21,259
yourself don't give them out to anybody

296
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,760
that's what you should do if you drew

297
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:23,269
powdery mildew buds and you have to do

298
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,580
something

299
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:27,199
smoke it yourself that way you know

300
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,090
reflux you so well you're not getting

301
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,710
somebody else sick if you're gonna do it

302
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,280
do it don't give it to someone else to

303
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,580
smoke

304
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,779
alright so mycotoxins you said a little

305
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,230
bit of psychosis do you think a little

306
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:41,110
bit of headache nausea diarrhea vomiting

307
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,490
stuff that would be described yeah first

308
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,310
mistaken as other things definitely

309
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,230
usually flu-like or cold symptoms and

310
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:51,439
then as it gets later you'll definitely

311
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,220
get like typical mould poisoning exceeds

312
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,550
and

313
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,670
I'm very very very very bad things will

314
00:11:55,549 --> 00:12:00,859
happen to you a kidney and liver

315
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:02,919
toxicity from mycotoxins right oh yeah

316
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,460
those those wreak havoc on you and

317
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:09,409
powdery mildew is its of that type of

318
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,600
organism that's gonna produce those and

319
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:14,600
it's they don't worry about it for food

320
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,540
crops very often because it's only leafy

321
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,250
parts that get affected but okay most

322
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:21,199
fruits like tomatoes and stuff won't

323
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,240
show the little patches on them so like

324
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,910
cucumbers are squash that always get

325
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:35,029
infected the the fruit itself is

326
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:39,199
probably said um yeah to consume some

327
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,759
turps bro yeah and even then that's not

328
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,920
very strong quantities cuz you have to

329
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,559
have a large amount of leafy matter

330
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:47,899
infected with the the white patches

331
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:50,000
that's the fruiting body and then it's

332
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,309
it's a toxin it's systemic that goes

333
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,139
throughout the plant so yeah you'll end

334
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:56,569
up with it in your cucumbers or squash

335
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,669
or whatever but not much however were

336
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:01,450
we're smoking a leafy leafy flowers

337
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:05,240
which accumulate that stuff with

338
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:08,509
freakishly high concentrations itself so

339
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,549
it's not the same as a food a food issue

340
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:12,919
because it's it's technically considered

341
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:14,959
non-toxic for food crops even though

342
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,250
they don't let it ever happen but you

343
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,009
definitely don't want to be smoking that

344
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,190
stuff we've had like you said the leafy

345
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:28,490
parts of plants but we've never actually

346
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:34,970
like a gangster rapper what was that

347
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:38,600
punk rocker okay I've always you know

348
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:43,519
since powdery mildew Canada came around

349
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,560
last few five six years seems like I've

350
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,909
wondered about those late season crops

351
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:51,159
that always get affected was that

352
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:52,659
yeah yeah I've tended to throw a lot of

353
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:54,999
that stuff in the compost pile that's

354
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:56,528
probably what you should do well I don't

355
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,129
know is that powdery mildew gonna affect

356
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:58,419
his compost

357
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:01,449
yeah you don't want to actually put that

358
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:05,169
in compost either they say oh yeah it's

359
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:07,838
it's not a good one to have mycotoxin I

360
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:09,938
figured you got hot enough and doesn't

361
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,230
kill the spores okay and you don't

362
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:12,909
actually have to worry about inhaling

363
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,308
the spores it's that literally the

364
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:17,558
toxins that you're burning are doing

365
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:18,850
havoc on your uh the mucous membranes at

366
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:22,028
first and then it's gonna be a little

367
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,428
weird I've been I've seen some big

368
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:32,919
commercial rooms that I felt like the

369
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:34,659
the spores actually burn my nose this

370
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:38,278
dude told me that using a 1 micron

371
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:40,448
screen would prevent any of the

372
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,188
mycotoxins or spores getting into the

373
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:44,708
hash that's completely [ __ ] cuz he's

374
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:46,509
were basically juicing the mycotoxins

375
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:49,208
right through that screen there in

376
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:51,789
solution so you can't filter them out as

377
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:54,549
if they were solid particles just like

378
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:56,469
that THC is correct correct yeah it's

379
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:58,479
totally yeah same anything is salt and

380
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,149
water unless you actually have a filter

381
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,620
that's not even that's not even a filter

382
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:05,259
anymore they call a semi permeable

383
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:08,379
membrane that's what osmosis uses okay

384
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:09,970
that's that's yeah that's not even

385
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:12,789
filter anymore you can't filter a

386
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:15,399
dissolve solid out of liquid I like the

387
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:18,879
Tony knows a lot of [ __ ] yeah sorry it's

388
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,889
warm in here today man those tabs got to

389
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,808
me

390
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:24,058
everyone's a little slow I can tell on

391
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:25,919
the show all right so basically powdery

392
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:27,389
mildew is [ __ ] terrible you guys if

393
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,338
you've got powdery mildew on your buds

394

don't give that to somebody else smoke

395
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,709
that yourself if you're gonna do

396
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:33,869
anything with it

397
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:35,698
don't blast it please don't blast it if

398
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:38,160
you're a medical marijuana provider and

399
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:40,528

00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:50,369
difference between the Cache cropper and

a lot of people will accept that and I

413
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:06,208
want to speak out about it and make sure

414

422
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:21,899
nutrient part to Tony's I'm not gonna

423
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:24,508
call him a pro level grower he's got a

424
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,188
couple few crops under his belt he he's

425
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:28,528
got that chemistry background so it

426
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:30,480
really helps him out but it also kind of

427
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:32,068
kills him all right guys we had to take

428
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,558
a quick break but we are back Jesse had

429
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:35,998
to dip out he uh I wish I had a better

430
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:38,668
story for you he took a DAB and turned

431
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:39,689
green so we had to cut out and get Jesse

432
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:42,149
some water and get him to the couch

433
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:43,498

couch he'll be all right you may come

435

436
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:49,139
go on without him so we're gonna do that

437

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,309
a brand new nano luxe light to test big

467
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,140
shout out to Nana na Nana Lux lighting

468
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:48,700
I can't run it till January because my

469
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,230
rooms are full but I really look forward

470
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,330
to running that light it's one of the

471
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,710
dual ended light bulbs I'm sure it's

472
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:55,000
gonna put out some lumens it's gonna

473
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,500
make my room bright it's gonna make my

474
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,569
plants happy Jessie was giving him

475
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,190
praise earlier he said he set up one

476
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:02,319
light with a room that had an uneven

477
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,580
canopy because a lot of times your

478
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,409
middle plants will grow better that's

479
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:07,899
where all the lighting is he said they

480
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:10,330
evened out within a week or two so must

481
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,740
be doing something right all right I

482
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:14,019
said we're gonna talk about doing

483
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,539
nutrients and was also mentioning that

484
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:19,629
Tony is a chemistry and organic

485
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:20,950
chemistry major he's a physics nerd he's

486
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,590
a computer nerd but this dude knows a

487
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,210
lot of stuff I think that his knowledge

488
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:27,639
of science really helps him when he

489
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,500
grows but I also think it almost kills

490
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,390
him when he grows yeah

491
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,230
plants are predictable but plants aren't

492
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:37,000
science they're nature yeah Tony he's

493
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,980
like I fed them potassium why aren't

494
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,359
they potassium II come on do it and I'm

495
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,860
like you got to go to bed you got to

496
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,479
wait like three days and you got to come

497
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:45,699
back and check and then maybe you'll see

498
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,079
what you did he's like I want it now he

499
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,009
thinks he should mix it up and see

500
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:52,179
explosions for the way plants work

501
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:54,549
sometimes it does but it's funny

502
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,740
watching you be baffled I know how much

503
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:58,720
you know about science and organics and

504
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,579
to see you look at me like dude how come

505
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,160
and it's just the smallest thing that

506
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:04,899
you overlooked it's it's great but

507
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,009
sometimes it does sometimes it totally

508
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,360
shoots you in the foot because you don't

509
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:09,279
believe that the plants will do what I

510
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,199
think they should do on their own yeah

511
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,230
you want everything to be the Incredible

512
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,230
Hulk

513
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,950
all right so we're gonna talk a little

514
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:19,240
bit about nutrients I was hoping Jessie

515
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,980
would be here because he really has a

516
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,140
lot of cool [ __ ] to contribute but I

517
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,180
will cover I will try to uncle like my

518
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,450
voice really deep I'll turn up the lows

519
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,799
on the microphone maybe I'll turn up my

520
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,319
voice real deep and I'll do Jesse's

521
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,419
parts most of what we're gonna cover

522
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,980
today will be based on bottled nutrients

523
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,539
I think it's a lot easier for a new home

524
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,849
grower to learn what's a good line of

525
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:41,259
bottled newts next week I'm gonna have a

526
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:43,059
guy named Sean over you know it may be

527
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:44,349
two weeks until I have Sean over we got

528
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,849
to see what happens with the secret cup

529
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,779
no I should Sean will be here next week

530
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:48,279
maybe Spence will be here

531
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,649
week after with the secret Cup victory

532
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,899
that's what I'm hoping for Sean's gonna

533
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,120
teach us about organics and sustainable

534
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,410
horticulture Sean doesn't use to the

535
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,919
best of my knowledge Sean doesn't use

536
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:01,330
any Hydra store products but for today's

537
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,070
lesson we're gonna focus on basics

538
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:05,980
bottled nutrients are usually reliable

539
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:08,740
and consistent our good friend Adam who

540
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,450
he specifically asked me what he needs

541
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,339
to be feeding his plants and he also

542
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,559
asked what the numbers on the front of

543
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:15,579
the bottles mean so I think the numbers

544
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,109
on the front of the bottle is a good

545
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:19,449
question and it's a super good spot to

546
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:20,589
start so we'll talk about that there are

547
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,880
three numbers if you go to the hydro

548
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:23,679
shop and you pick up almost any

549
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,810
fertilizer bottle there are three

550
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,120
numbers on the front the first number

551
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:30,069
represents nitrogen the second number

552
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,069
represents phosphorus and the third

553
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:35,980
number represents potassium that's NPK

554
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:37,599
those are known as macronutrients so a

555
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,400
bottle of basic grow nutrients like if

556
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,159
you grabbed botanic here botanic air

557
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,160
pure blend Pro or maybe some my advanced

558
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,420
nutrients jungle juice grow the numbers

559
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,029
on they're gonna be like three to five

560
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,730
or two one six or something like that

561
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:53,680
each brands gonna be different so if it

562
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,700
says two three three to five that's what

563
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,140
we're gonna work with house three to

564
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,779
five it means there's three percent

565
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,759
nitrogen two percent phosphorus and five

566
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:03,460
percent potassium in that nutrient in

567
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,829
that bottle so the numbers on those

568
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,600
bottles tell us the NPK values of what

569
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:09,159
the NPK values are of the fertilizers

570
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,339
we're buying but it's up to us to figure

571
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,230
out which bottles to use and when to use

572
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:15,549
them and how much to use most of the

573
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,410
nutrient companies make a really cool

574
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:18,639
nutrient calculator that you get the

575
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,170
hydro shop a lot of times it's in a

576
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,910
little insert thing like a coupon right

577
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,519
next to the brand get those those are

578
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,750
always super helpful a lot of times Tony

579
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:27,759
will be like how much of this nutrient

580
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,410
do I use it since I'm kind of a nerd

581
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,730
I've happened to have a bunch of those

582
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,960
little inserts laying around and I'll

583
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,079
just pull it out and be like it says

584
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,569
this yeah but I definitely recommend

585
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:39,939
reducing the recommended dosage to about

586
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:40,539
half of what they say you use sometimes

587
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,769
two-thirds

588
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:43,539
you can tell we'll talk more about that

589
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:47,049
I wrote that bark down

590
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:49,539
so most of the companies make a chart or

591
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:52,059
also online you can go online to botanic

592
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:54,250
Ericom or advance nutrients calm I know

593
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:56,859
they have super great feeding schedule

594
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,779
calculators use a pre developed recipe

595
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:01,240
from there they'll tell you exactly what

596
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:02,619
to use every week I suggest you reduce

597
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,029
the dosage like I've seen about half

598
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:05,829
those companies they want to sell you

599
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:07,299
more they really want you to buy more

600
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:10,119
[ __ ] so they tell you to lose a little

601
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:12,669
bit extra like five or ten milliliters

602
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,989
every week adds up to them and to you

603
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,269
but you don't notice it your plants

604
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,549
won't notice it so they kind of over

605
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:20,799
feed your plants on purpose so reduce

606
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:22,419
what they say if you see signs of a

607
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,250
deficiency you can't increase your

608
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,160
fertilizer on the next feed but you

609
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,170
can't if you over tracked it if you over

610
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,850
feed you can't correct that you've got

611
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,460
burnt leaves and angry roots and your

612
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,569
plants look all [ __ ] fried out I

613
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,690
think I've seen a couple of your plants

614
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:39,519
do that one time oh yeah yeah Tony's not

615
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,140
afraid to mess with some plants Tony is

616
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,269
all about getting in there and torturing

617
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,140
the [ __ ] out of his crop and so usually

618
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:46,420
pH burns

619
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,620
I was gonna talk a lot about pH burns if

620
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,840
we have time I'm gonna try to go about

621
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:52,569
45 to an hour here but if we have time

622
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,490
for pH we'll get into it something I

623
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:56,169
recommend and this is this is part of

624
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,339
what I think Tony shoots himself in the

625
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,080
foot with I recommend that if you're

626
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:00,519
gonna use a brand of bottled nutrients

627
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,929
you stick with the brand until you

628
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:04,240
become experienced and you can identify

629
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,890
deficiencies and problems which means a

630
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,230
few things first if you use botanic air

631
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,540
pure blend Pro is a base I totally

632
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,370
recommend using whatever botanic air

633
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:14,470
pure blend Pro additives you can afford

634
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:16,809
to add but don't mix enough from other

635
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,579
brands I know that sounds ridiculous

636
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:20,589
like brand loyalty or a sales pitch but

637
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:22,539
I think it's rational with any brand and

638
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:24,819
I'll explain why I don't mix brands

639
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:27,609
because of Antonio like this chelation

640
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:29,589
buffers and bonding agents versus

641
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:30,849
organics a lot of products have

642
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:33,730
chemicals that make the products last

643
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:35,139
longer some have chemicals that prevent

644
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,730
certain compounds from bonding inside

645
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,070
the bottle and ruining the solution and

646
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,990
many of those chemicals will ruin all of

647
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:43,750
the beneficial compounds in an organic

648
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:46,029
solution Tony may correct me on this I

649
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,099
feel like if I poured some synthetic

650
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:49,690
nutrient like if I got almost anything

651
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:51,969
from advanced nutrients if I poured big

652
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:54,009
bud and do a batch of organic compost

653
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,089
tea I think the Big Bud would kill most

654
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:58,700
of the bio activity in my compost

655
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:01,459
is that correct I think Big Bud

656
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,528
especially like overdrive definitely

657
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,000
would wreak havoc okay how about my

658
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:08,619
mykos is there just gonna destroy my

659
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,849
micro life destroy your mykos and

660
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:13,548
actually is probably gonna bring things

661
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:17,509
out of solution like calcium compounds

662
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:19,429
and those once they're unavailable to

663
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:21,980
the plant they actually create other

664
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:24,470
deficiencies it's all about balance

665
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,269
apparently all right you just over

666
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,860
you definitely enforced what I was

667
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:28,730
trying to say I sound like I know what

668
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:31,189
I'm talking about now

669
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,390
all right so unless you unless you're

670
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,620
sure the product gets along with other

671
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,870
products you shouldn't be adding two

672
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:37,189
things from different brands cuz you

673
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:38,778
could cause problems you could have

674
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,730
everything going for the first six weeks

675
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:42,710
and then you go and add in some bud

676
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,278
booster that doesn't match up with your

677
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,590
schedule

678
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,759
and it could totally just ruin all the

679
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:49,879
work you've done for the past

680
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:52,069
vej time plus six weeks of flower so

681
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,750
another reason I stick with one brand is

682
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:55,339
because as you learn you need something

683
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,380
to be consistent as many things as you

684
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:59,058
can need to be consistent it's hard to

685
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,370
adapt to changes and identify problems

686
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:03,079
with too many variables I feel like if

687
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:05,298
we minimize the variables we can dial in

688
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:06,678
our crops to perfection if you're not

689
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:08,058
truly happy with your nutrients you can

690
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:09,620
for sure switch them but I recommend

691
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:11,210
trying the same brand while you learn I

692
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:13,099
know I keep talking about it but I

693
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,110
personally I like botanic air I've used

694
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:18,019
advanced nutrients I felt like with

695
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:20,629
advanced I got huge buds and everything

696
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:23,000
finished really quickly but I also feel

697
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,590
like everything looked and smelled and

698
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,990
tasted the same I don't think there was

699
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:29,839
much variation if I ran OG Kush Sour

700
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:31,370
Diesel strawberry haze they all kind of

701
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,759
have the same advanced nutrients they

702
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:37,459
all smelled like Nirvana oh yeah and

703
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:42,589
advanced kind of like junk food it's the

704
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:45,769
wrong kind of nitrogen but they're not

705
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:47,658
as healthy as they should be okay I

706
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:48,950
didn't ever think of that like all I

707
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:51,140
could tell is that they were taken off

708
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,490
and for what I paid I could tell I was

709
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,288
getting my money's worth I was getting

710
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,970
that extra that they advertised but I

711
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:57,890
didn't like the flavor and when you're

712
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,259
growing crops for yourself I I want the

713
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,000
flavor I want the flavor I want I'd grew

714
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,558
with psycho I did a couple rounds with

715
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,079
psycho that actually gave me a free box

716
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:07,460
set and I ran it side by side next to

717
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,720
botanic air you know I

718
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,909
a five-by-five Hut next to a

719
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,500
five-by-five Hut everything is the same

720
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:14,000
it's in the same room and I did psycho

721
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,548
on one side botanic hair on the other

722
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,500
the psycho side everything turned really

723
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:19,879
really purple and it was sexy it was

724
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,460
really photogenic bud

725
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,590
once again I didn't like the flavor yeah

726
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,100
it didn't burn as well and I had a funky

727
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:27,428
flavor

728
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:30,709
I used sole synthetics from Aurora

729
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:32,450
excuse me from Aurora innovations and it

730
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,919
has a lot of molasses II type stuff a

731
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,919
lot of humic stuff and that made for

732
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,210
tasty tasty buds but it didn't give me

733
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:39,830
enough harvest and it didn't get real

734
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,079
resonate it tasted super good but I

735
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:43,908
didn't get the harvest I wanted Humboldt

736
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,589
nutrients that stuff worked well but

737
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:47,899
there's a lot of PG RS and things I'm

738
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:49,519
trying to get away from in there just

739
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,528
like advanced nutrients I don't want to

740
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,798
use a lot of PD yards and things like

741
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:54,200
that

742
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:56,058
Humboldt did well but again I prefer

743
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,500
botanic air for the flavor that's what I

744
00:26:56,058 --> 00:27:01,908
like the best yeah now it's turn now

745
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,200
it's getting to be all about the teas

746
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:06,020
the guy that's coming up next week is

747
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,640
all about making super awesome teas so

748
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:09,230
for my person he'll always probably go

749
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,788
back to the botanic air pure blend pro

750
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:14,690
with all the additives recommended I

751
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:15,829
also use SEAPLEX and from the organic

752
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,110
hair lineup and I'll add some kind of

753
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:20,000
molasses and yucca extract and maybe

754
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:21,769
some dehydrated coconut water to my

755
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,269
feeding toward the middle of bloom but

756
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:24,619
that's our secret so don't ever say that

757
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:26,629
on a podcast where people could hear you

758
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:30,288
it's actually good for beginner growers

759
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:32,929
pile on your error tolerance for

760
00:27:30,288 --> 00:27:35,119
temperatures and a bunch of things yeah

761
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:37,309
it's very good for you it's kind of like

762
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,658
aloe vera on a sunburn except inside I

763
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:40,339
know that sounds weird but it definitely

764
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:42,409
works to moisten things up and keep

765
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:43,879
things safe a good source of yucca

766
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:45,528
extract if you don't want to just go

767
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,159
find yucca extract and figure out how to

768
00:27:45,528 --> 00:27:48,558
use that

769
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,120
Humboldt honey is actually packed with

770
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,710
yucca extract and it's a great product

771
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,079
you need something with molasses and

772
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,840
sugars in it anyway laid in bloom so

773
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,730
that's what I would recommend if anybody

774
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,168
from botanic air is listening you can

775
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,149
send me an email and I'll get you my

776
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:03,890
shipping address and sponsorship info I

777
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:06,648
region etics on instagram check out my

778
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:09,950
feed ya Botanica I buy a lot of your

779
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:11,298
stuff guys talk to me hello I'm another

780
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,950
reason I would stick to one brand is

781
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:15,129
because doubling up on nutrient brands

782
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,850
you could actually double up on

783
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,760
something you don't want you could have

784
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:21,730
overlapped there could be too much

785
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:24,039
magnesium in this one or two

786
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,390
I don't know molybdenum in this one and

787
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,769
you don't realize it because they don't

788
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:29,290
list all that small stuff on every

789
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:30,759
bottle so if you use something from the

790
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,039
tannic air or something firm advanced

791
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,679
nutrients you may possibly be overdosing

792
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,808
your plant with something and so botanic

793
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,620
air is not gonna botanic air is not

794
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:43,178
gonna make a nutrient a with nutrient B

795
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,529
that would overlap they would and they

796
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,809
kind of would they wouldn't do that they

797
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:48,099
know that that's in there sorry guys my

798
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,048
throats all clogged up from taking those

799
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:52,149
dabs that killed Jesse no I should say

800
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:57,808
that most of the nutrient companies make

801
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:57,809
their own my co products those you can

802
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:09,309
absolutely for enzymes I always

803
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,190
recommend the hydros I'm and for

804
00:29:09,308 --> 00:29:14,168
Michael's lately all the ogt products

805
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,750
are freaking awesome and I also like

806
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:19,360
great white shark myself I put those in

807
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,829
almost every plant if you want to go the

808
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,599
advance nutrients route and you want to

809
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:24,699
spend a lot of money that piranhas and

810
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,928
tarantula and the liquid bottles it's a

811
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,039
hundred and eighty three dollars and

812
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:29,559
fifty cents per bottle

813
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,298
but like ten or twenty bills will give

814
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:33,220
you explosive roots put that [ __ ] in

815
00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:35,168
your cloner if you've got an easy cloner

816
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,669
your roots will push the lid off the

817
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,759
cloner your plants will get up and walk

818
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:40,540
away yeah so once you guys get

819
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,679
comfortable and have a good

820
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:43,119
understanding of your feeding routine

821
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,400
you can add whatever you feel like you

822
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,558
need just read the bottles adjust your

823
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,240
PPM's accordingly and pay attention to

824
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:52,240
what you're feeding the plants like if

825
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,950
you're just read the labels like read

826
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,808
them go to the website find out what's

827
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,190
in those products they should be readily

828
00:29:55,808 --> 00:29:58,329
available if a company doesn't want to

829
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,679
tell you what's in their stuff I don't

830
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:02,168
want to use it as kind of how I feel

831
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,429
anyway yeah I wrote down a side note

832
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:04,690
talking about PPM's

833
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:07,059
friend of mine was having problems with

834
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:10,630
this crop his leaves were curling up

835
00:30:07,058 --> 00:30:12,039
looking like goofy fingers I thought it

836
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,980
was a light leak during the dark cycle

837
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,909
he thought it was the genetics

838
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,960
everybody was real confused sorry I just

839
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,110
burp right into the microphone

840
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,819
everybody was real confused but the room

841
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,048
was correct he had good genetics and

842
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:25,298
after a few days we realized the problem

843
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:27,369
his magnetic ballasts were causing

844
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:30,158
interference with the ppm and pH meter

845
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:31,599
and everything was way off so he's

846
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,669
thinking he's balancing out the pH

847
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,480
perfectly you know six five seven and

848
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:37,090
he's actually making it

849
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,039
eleven or lower he's probably going down

850
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:40,240
is probably like four cuz that low is

851
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,649
probably what made everything curls

852
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:47,169
getting it real low so what I what I was

853
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,269
gonna say is uh try to get away from

854
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:51,820
your magnetic ballasts so that when you

855
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:53,259
take readings your magnetic ballasts

856
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,879
aren't making everything jump up and

857
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:56,890
down and also take good care of your ppm

858
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,299
and pH meters people overlook those and

859
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,280
they're super important

860
00:30:58,298 --> 00:31:02,289
Jesse recommended making the cords as

861
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:03,759
short as possible in your grow rooms

862
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:05,769
yeah and that would definitely help with

863
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:09,039
stuff like having your ppm meter

864
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:10,298
fluctuates so heavily it'll take a

865
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,589
couple weeks but his plants will be back

866
00:31:10,298 --> 00:31:13,960
on track he's just a couple of weeks

867
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:15,009
behind they'll look good alright so

868
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,240
we're talking about nutrients that was a

869
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:18,700
sight note I wanted to make sure to get

870
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,200
out our main goal here with nutrients is

871
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,298
to have the correct amount of nutrients

872
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,980
at the right time to keep the plants at

873
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:25,509
peak performance without ever over

874
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,390
feeding them and causing nutrient burn

875
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:30,519
or lockouts and also I wrote down don't

876
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,290
forget to pay attention to your pH and

877
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,389
also I said when do you see problems it

878
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:36,490
look like deficiencies they are often

879
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,870
from a pH issue that was overlooked if

880
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,569
you're gonna push your plants to perform

881
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:42,579
you need to have the proper pH I think

882
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:44,200
six point five to seven is ideal for

883
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:46,659
most cannabis drains you're gonna have

884
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,600
to adjust to your room your environment

885
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,400
and your strain the cocoa fiber people

886
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,428
they have a different range and then

887
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,290
regular like deep water culture hydro

888
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:58,720
people I think they want it down in the

889
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:00,190
five fires yeah that sounds about right

890
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,720
most of what I talk about is soil sorry

891
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,640
guys I'm a soil soil this kind of guy

892
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,190
most everything I do is in soilless mix

893
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,390
indoors under thousand watt lights so

894
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,880
you'll have to adjust like I'm

895
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,410
everything is about adapting all right

896
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,169
good call right now for reminding those

897
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:16,840
people or me so drink during the veg

898
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:18,309
phase your plants are gonna want high

899
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:19,808
levels of nitrogen as the planets

900
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:21,519
progress into the flowering stage

901
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:22,928
they're gonna require much less nitrogen

902
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,298
and they're gonna want more phosphorus

903
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:27,070
and potassium so we're gonna kind of

904
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:28,298
shift into explaining the nutrients and

905
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:29,409
their functions which is cool that

906
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:32,200
Tony's here for this one because he

907
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:34,058
knows a lot you hear us talk about NPK

908
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,009
will focus on nitrogen phosphorus and

909
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:38,139
potassium will go with nitrogen first

910
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:39,879
you'll almost always hear nitrogen first

911
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,850
most of what you breathe is nitrogen

912
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,500
it's an odorless colorless gas that

913
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:45,769
constitutes over 75% of the Earth's

914
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,420
atmosphere

915
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:48,920
despite the overwhelming presence of

916
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,440
atmospheric nitrogen there are only a

917
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:54,110
few kinds of plants in the legume family

918
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,509
that can make use of it marijuana is not

919
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:58,159
a legume oh it should say cannabis geez

920
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:59,450
I couldn't pasted this from the internet

921
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,070
I'll give them credit in a minute I just

922
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,650
don't want to break away from my focus

923
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:05,929
here where is the website that I stole

924
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,190
this from yeah I don't want to stumble

925
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,320
around and do so many things I'm messing

926
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,210
with the computer and getting distracted

927
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:13,039
so marijuana is not a legume so nitrogen

928
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,319
must be supplemented synthetically

929
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,119
produced nitrogen fertilizer is made in

930
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:19,129
the form of anhydrous ammonia from

931
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,559
natural gas yeah that's what I said and

932
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,120
hydrous ammonia from natural gas an

933
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,859
hydrous ammonia is then usually

934
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:26,959
converted into ammonium nitrate for

935
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:29,269
storage and ease of application once

936
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,220
granulated the ammonium nitrate is ready

937
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:33,289
for use as cost-effective and easy to

938
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,509
use plant food natural sources of

939
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:38,149
nitrogen are numerous and include blood

940
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:40,309
meal manure bird and bat guano among

941
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,720
many others alright guys Sean will be

942
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,129
here next week I'm gonna jump in for a

943
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,680
minute he'll be here next week to

944
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,510
discuss this all organic method now he

945
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,130
calls it organic as [ __ ] what you hear

946
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:51,049
about your new tree is being fed being

947
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,490
made with anhydrous ammonia it kind of

948
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:54,409
makes you start getting more interested

949
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:57,289
in that sustainable horticultural stuff

950
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:59,060
it sounds kind of weird and extreme like

951
00:33:57,289 --> 00:34:01,670
some crazy chemistry but it actually

952
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:05,329
happens in the soil itself there's a

953
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:10,240
little cycle that nitrates ammonium

954
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:13,219
nitrates and actually pure nh3 ammonia

955
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:16,099
are converted back and forth by your

956
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:18,309
mykos sometimes you'll buy a pack of

957
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,750
mykos that'll say uh nitrogen-fixing

958
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:23,599
that's what they're talking about they

959
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:26,510
convert nitrates usually into the

960
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,940
ammonium so it happens in the soil

961
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,460
anyway but that's actually what makes

962
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,950
advanced nutrients junk food it's all

963
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,030
nitrates you want to have some ammonium

964
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,628
ions in there too

965
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:42,440
Wow and they actually do exist in the

966
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:45,259
composted organic stuff um they're just

967
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:49,119
produced usually by bacteria aerobic

968
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:51,830
decay so Tony's got access to all of the

969
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,509
ingredient lists and studies from the

970
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:55,610
college's because he's a college kid and

971
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,200
now he's read some great [ __ ] and told

972
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,920
me some great things about nutrients and

973
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,788
it's that's enough right there that's

974
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,170
yeah yeah all right so uh where was I

975
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm talking about Sean's coming dude

976
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:08,010
once I read about this stuff I got kind

977
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,108
of like I want to go more toward a

978
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,490
sustainable way of growing my plants I

979
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,529
think it would be better that's my next

980
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:16,348
step I can crow I can breed I can select

981
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:18,059
the phenotypes I can identify problems

982
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:20,849
like everything my game is strong now I

983
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:22,740
just got to adjust and get more more eco

984
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:26,039
friendly quit using so much electricity

985
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:27,659
and photon hydro shop stuff much love to

986
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,059
my hydro shop sponsor I just got to get

987
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:31,618
away from some of that stuff you know so

988
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:32,880
because I was talking about nitrogen

989
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:34,650
because if it's crucial role in

990
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,088
photosynthesis fertilizers high in

991
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,670
nitrogen are used during the vegetative

992
00:35:36,088 --> 00:35:40,440
phase of growing cannabis nitrogen is

993
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,730
key to both chlorophyll and protein

994
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,500
production and used throughout

995
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,019
photosynthesis for the conversion of

996
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,960
carbon into sugars and other organic

997
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:50,909
compounds so grow fertilizers are high

998
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,500
in nitrogen they're used for rapid

999
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:54,179
growth they're used to build chlorophyll

1000
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,119
and promote a healthy green color and

1001
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:59,759
they improve the volume and health of

1002
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,530
plant foliage you guys if you see your

1003
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,539
plants looking pale and yellow that's

1004
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:08,160
your first sign of probably a nitrogen

1005
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:09,660
deficiency over 35 minutes in we'll get

1006
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,239
through these nutrients at least this

1007
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:17,639
will be cool I should say that the plant

1008
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:19,469
most plans in general will intake 80% of

1009
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:22,798
all of the nitrogen they use in a

1010
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:24,929
lifetime during the vegetative stage so

1011
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:29,940
that's why all your vegetative cannabis

1012
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:32,250
nutrients have a higher right at the

1013
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,980
start of flower stores it up for

1014
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,440
metabolic processes okay so just say

1015
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,298
it's just chilling in there just save

1016
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,889
carbohydrates actually okay it stores it

1017
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:44,159
up as energy and then it releases it

1018
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:47,278
during flower so I usually feed my veg

1019
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:49,558
nutrients until about two two weeks into

1020
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:51,358
flower so that I'm giving them more

1021
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,359
nitrogen to have available should I just

1022
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:57,028
switch right away that's what I've been

1023
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:58,739
doing but mine turn yellow way too fast

1024
00:36:57,028 --> 00:37:00,599
all right I'll just keep feeding that

1025
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:02,639
next that extra two weeks kind of seems

1026
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:05,309
to keep them green for the time that I

1027
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,788
need now there's like veganic sources of

1028
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:10,680
plant nitrogen's usually amino acids

1029
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:11,320
those usually they direct you to use

1030
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:14,710
those

1031
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:19,480
up to flush which I've not figured out

1032
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:21,579
why but it's the good nitrogen lots

1033
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,869
vegan annex is way different I've grown

1034
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:24,489
if you get a crop with some veganic

1035
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:24,940
nutrients I was given and it had the

1036
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:29,139
flavor

1037
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:32,860
it definitely cottonseed or soybean meal

1038
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:35,230
those are very high weird organic types

1039
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,269
of nitrogen's usually amino acids and

1040
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,740
proteins that's why all these organic

1041
00:37:37,269 --> 00:37:41,380
guys are getting great results they're

1042
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:45,729
using actually naturally-occurring but

1043
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:50,110
uses a high highly active microsphere

1044
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:52,389
there lots of bacterias and ransoms so

1045
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,710
you have to be Shawn to come listen to

1046
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:54,190
the next episode of Shawn you'll love it

1047
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,119
you'll love it

1048
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,190
alright let's talk a little bit about

1049
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,960
phosphorus phosphorus is a volatile

1050
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,639
volatile and reactive element which is

1051
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,130
why it is probably never found in its

1052
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,559
pure elemental form in nature because of

1053
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:07,570
its volatility fertilizer packaging is

1054
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:11,469
actually showing a measure of its oxide

1055
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:15,280
P 2:05 phosphorus is commonly refined

1056
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:17,739
from stone called phosphatidyl islands

1057
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,350
comprised of primarily bird and bat

1058
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:22,629
droppings a common bio massive source of

1059
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:26,199
phosphorus is found in the ground bone

1060
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:27,400
also known as bone meal cannabis plants

1061
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:29,169
use the phosphorus throughout their

1062
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,329
growing cycles but at elevated levels

1063
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,619
when flowering is the plant's nutrient

1064
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:34,869
requirements change the feeding schedule

1065
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:36,789
is adjusted to include bloom foods with

1066
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:38,980
higher levels of phosphorus and lower

1067
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:40,840
levels of nitrogen because plants also

1068
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,210
use phosphorus and root formation low

1069
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:47,410
doses of it are often found in cloning

1070
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:48,639
solutions so phosphorus basically bloom

1071
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,759
foods are higher in phosphorus

1072
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,139
phosphorus improves blood production

1073
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,570
phosphorus aids and root development and

1074
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:57,369
it's involved in oil and glucose

1075
00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:00,340
production in the end of your blooming

1076
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:02,598
cycle yeah you're actually you want your

1077
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:05,568
highest phosphorus levels

1078
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:07,220
a few weeks before flower and like for

1079
00:39:05,568 --> 00:39:11,210
the first third of flower

1080
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:13,639
okay so boost those up just like we did

1081
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,949
with the nitrogen yeah the nitrogen

1082
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,469
starts to drop down and that's when the

1083
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:21,048
phosphorous goes up and then towards the

1084
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:23,449
middle end of flower you want lots and

1085
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:26,239
lots of K so you want a very very high

1086
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:29,328
last number okay alright let's talk

1087
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,338
about K potassium potassium is an alkali

1088
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:33,380
metal that reacts violently with water

1089
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:35,778
and oxidizes quite rapidly when exposed

1090
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,640
to air this unstable nature requires

1091
00:39:35,778 --> 00:39:39,469
that it be added to fertilizers in the

1092
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:42,139
form of potassium compounds known as

1093
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:44,298
potash not all forms of potash are

1094
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:47,618
suitable for planets like phosphorus

1095
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:51,139
potassium is mined from mineral Laden or

1096
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:53,239
like and in P potassium which is K is a

1097
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,798
key component in the mid metabolic

1098
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:56,420
functions of plants and plays a large

1099
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:58,818
role in the production of proteins and

1100
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,619
photosynthesis potassium also helps

1101
00:39:58,818 --> 00:40:02,599
strengthen the marijuana plants immune

1102
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:04,970
system but it correct that cannabis

1103
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:05,960
plants immune system which help helps

1104
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:08,169
the plants cope with environmental

1105
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,789
stresses including insects and diseases

1106
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:12,528
bloom formulated fertilisers often

1107
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:14,869
include increased levels of potassium

1108
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:17,630
because it helps improve flower quality

1109
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:19,099
also potassium is found in both grow and

1110
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,420
bloom fertilizers because Tony was

1111
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:23,059
saying that it's good towards the end of

1112
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:25,338
veg it helps the plants immune system

1113
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:26,778
and it increases flower quality you'll

1114
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:28,880
see it in most of your bloom boosters

1115
00:40:26,778 --> 00:40:30,619
it'll be real high in potassium so if

1116
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,778
you're looking for a bloom booster and a

1117
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:34,479
bud hardener that last number on the

1118
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:37,278
bottle that's the one you're looking at

1119
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:40,009
yeah so would you agree with me that

1120
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:42,048
that's the basics of the NPK yeah you

1121
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:47,358
want to start higher nitrogen and then

1122
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:50,630
end very low and then start mid to low

1123
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:52,489
potassium and end very very high very

1124
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,719
high yeah and then the phosphorus kind

1125
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:55,789
of like goes in like a little mountain

1126
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,989
hope there's some plants I feel like you

1127
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:59,839
almost can't give them too much

1128
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:02,690
phosphorus it's a timing thing actually

1129
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,608
I feed them a bunch of it right as

1130
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:07,190
they're going into flower and then when

1131
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:08,549
I noticed the buds have naturally

1132
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,429
stopped

1133
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,740
swelling up I do some what's quite a bit

1134
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:15,899
more and then they just they're little

1135
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,109
metabolism kicks back on for one more

1136
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,590
week

1137
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:21,240
yeah there's yeah if you kick a lot of

1138
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,559
potassium in and it keeps it moving it

1139
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:24,029
definitely keeps them from slowing down

1140
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,980
and plants don't get as lazy

1141
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:27,720
alright so we'll talk a little more

1142
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,490
specifically about when to feed things

1143
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:31,679
to our plants when the plants are young

1144
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:32,699
we kind of covered this but the plants

1145
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,159
are young they don't require as much

1146
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:36,839
realization I focus on root building

1147
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,269
when the plants are young mykos are your

1148
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,500
friend and enzymes are - we've talked

1149
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:42,420
about Michaels and enzymes on the show

1150
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,559
before we'll come back to that I want to

1151
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,829
get all the basics covered

1152
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,480
that's your og T and your hydros I'm if

1153
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:49,619
you guys are looking for products use

1154
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,079
them just like they say on the bottle

1155
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:53,550
those are perfect small plants want

1156
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,619
nitrogen to grow strong a little bit of

1157
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:58,140
phosphorus will help them build roots

1158
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:00,000
and grow figure it vigorously a little

1159
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:01,920
potassium will keep them healthy your

1160
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,139
basic veg nutrients probably have enough

1161
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,150
NPK to get you through your veg phase if

1162
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:09,329
you veg for long periods you may need to

1163
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,860
add some calcium magnesium ah that's

1164
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:12,090
something that larger plants will start

1165
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,619
running out of so let's talk a little

1166
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,750
bit about cal-mag while we're here

1167
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:18,510
calcium and magnesium are what are known

1168
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,309
as secondary nutrients calcium is a big

1169
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,530
part of the cell structure and cellular

1170
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:24,469
growth calcium stimulates enzymes that

1171
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:27,030
build strong roots and cell walls

1172
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:29,159
magnesium is essential to absorb light

1173
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:31,680
energy if your plants are slow and lazy

1174
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:34,769
they may be experiencing a magnesium

1175
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:37,019
deficiency you know certain types of

1176
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:39,509
yellowing between the veins it's

1177
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:41,460
magnesium deficiency magnesium is

1178
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,710
actually what makes chlorophyll green a

1179
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,300
little bit of Hume egga from organic

1180
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:48,809
hair will speed your plants up when they

1181
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,220
start getting lazy like that yeah so in

1182
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:52,139
the beginning you need nitrogen a little

1183
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,669
phosphorus and a little potassium if

1184
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:55,529
you're looking for big roots definitely

1185
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,990
add some type of mykos or root inoculant

1186
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,310
I always brag about the og tea and great

1187
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:01,409
white shark together that [ __ ] works

1188
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:04,500
great for your root to get big fat white

1189
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:06,149
roots if you feed a gteen great white

1190
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,980
shark along with your mix your regular

1191
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,210
feed schedule in the morning right when

1192
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,429
the plants come on if you go in about

1193
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:13,829
two hours later most of your leaves will

1194
00:43:11,429 --> 00:43:15,419
be pointing straight up and they're

1195
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:17,549
praying and thanking you they're saying

1196
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,070
holy [ __ ] I love that that's what

1197
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,720
they're doing they love that

1198
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,519
if your plants get a little too big and

1199
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,019
fed you're gonna need cow bag once you

1200
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:25,940
into the flower phase totally like we

1201
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:27,320
talked about reduce the nitrogen the

1202
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,000
first two weeks of flower will show you

1203
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,190
much keep the plants fed and happy I use

1204
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,050
micro based nutrient until week three a

1205
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:35,720
flower like I was talking about feel

1206
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:38,090
like it keeps him nicely nitrogen up

1207
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:40,389
until the end of flower I had some cow

1208
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:44,079
bag and put some potassium silicates in

1209
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:47,000
and also some type of kelp in week 3 so

1210
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,980
that's cal-mag potassium silicates and

1211
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,289
kelp at week three I'll add liquid karma

1212
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,940
and sweet at week three also so when he

1213
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:54,320
started week three a flower you can drop

1214
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,750
out most of the nitrogen and really

1215
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:00,830
start pumping up the P and K wait for I

1216
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:02,690
do the same thing as week three we

1217
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:04,610
should be low on nitrogen and pumping up

1218
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,860
the P and K I'd had some kelp and a

1219
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:08,570
small amount of molasses by now it also

1220
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:10,160
had some enzymes to my mix I'd be

1221
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:14,030
running the whole botanic air feed chart

1222
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:15,409
by week five week four so here we go

1223
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,240
week five is where I really pound my

1224
00:44:15,409 --> 00:44:18,440
plants with food I think day thirty is

1225
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:19,879
where they're really ready for sugars

1226
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,559
and boosters that's when they're really

1227
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,840
ready to get hammered with a lot of

1228
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:25,940
stuff so I've dropped the nitrogen by

1229
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,280
now and I'm feeding heavy doses of P and

1230
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,050
K I'd be adding my bloom boosters and

1231
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,730
lots of molasses and sugars

1232
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:34,400
cal-mag will be super important for the

1233
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:36,110
next couple weeks enzymes and kelp would

1234
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,930
also be helpful for a big tasty buds I

1235
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:42,289
think kelp I'll use a lot of SEAPLEX

1236
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:44,389
I think all that kelp really adds to the

1237
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:46,579
stink and the density it really adds to

1238
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:49,849
the some flavors if they have that foot

1239
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:51,289
cushy skank skunk smell that stank it

1240
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:53,449
kind of makes them come out a little bit

1241
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:55,610
better if you had a lot of lot of kelp

1242
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:57,559
so you should add some potassium

1243
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:59,960
silicates for thick branches at this

1244
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,159
time like week five week 30 ish maybe

1245
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,900
you could have put those in at week four

1246
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:04,129
but if you got good healthy plants I

1247
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,900
think they're cool on week five you just

1248
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:07,010
need up four to build those branches up

1249
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,599
a little bit while the buds grow to

1250
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:09,920
super thick cuz they're gonna start

1251
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,440
falling over if you don't have some kind

1252
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,840
of tomato cages so a week five is

1253
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:17,420
basically your blue based nutrients lots

1254
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:20,720
of blood bud boosters sugars enzymes

1255
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,340
potassium silicates and kelp week six

1256
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,399
will basically be the same thing focus

1257
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,539
on your bud boosters and sugars and get

1258
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,280
that stuff up there as high as you can

1259
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:31,940
without burning the plants put a lot of

1260
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:34,010
molasses in there a lot of P&amp;K products

1261
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,829
and some enzymes in there to keep all

1262
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:39,110
that stuff moving if you do the same

1263
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:41,389
thing up to however long you need to go

1264
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:42,769
week seven week eight usually don't feed

1265
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:44,210
after week nine you should start

1266
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:46,130
flushing by week eight most plants are

1267
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:47,420
going to go more than ten weeks off

1268
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,950
you're growing a plant that takes more

1269
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,269
than ten weeks I hope you're experienced

1270
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:52,609
and I hope all of this stuff already

1271
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:54,800
makes sense to you because that's gonna

1272
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:56,240
be it's gonna be a [ __ ] for you to grow

1273
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,300
an 11-week plant without this knowledge

1274
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:01,099
so once you get to week eight and you've

1275
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,480
gotten done feeding these plants and

1276
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:04,759
keeping them happy and healthy you need

1277
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,579
to flush you we've just talked about how

1278
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,470
much stuff we pour it into these plants

1279
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:12,199
now you need to spend at least ten to

1280
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:15,289
fourteen days with nothing but water in

1281
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:17,599
these plants so on Monday however much

1282
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:18,920
if you've got a five gallon pot pour

1283
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,089
water through it tell that [ __ ] to run

1284
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,039
it through until your tree is almost

1285
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,210
full until you're worried about it if

1286
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:25,519
you have a way to get that water out of

1287
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,809
the tray that's ideal get that water out

1288
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,269
of there and let those plants sit until

1289
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:30,019
they're almost dry and do the same thing

1290
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:31,789
all over again

1291
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:33,409
and do that for the next ten to fourteen

1292
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,179
days try to get three or four cycles of

1293
00:46:33,409 --> 00:46:36,769
just clean water through there so that

1294
00:46:35,179 --> 00:46:38,809
you can push out all the nitrogen the

1295
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:42,139
phosphorus the potassium the calcium the

1296
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:43,579
magnesium the mykos that we just put in

1297
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:44,929
there you need to clean your soil out

1298
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:47,319
you want to get all that stuff out of

1299
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:49,969
there now if you have like really clean

1300
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:54,519
really clean sources like molasses you

1301
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:58,639
could use that your first flush watering

1302
00:46:54,519 --> 00:47:01,190
quite a bit of that and sugars displace

1303
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:03,529
salts that's why all the like clear X

1304
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:06,619
that they'll sell you clear X is just a

1305
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:08,860
bunch of different types of sugars just

1306
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:12,139
places salt but it feeds off your mykos

1307
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,940
it basically feeds all home boots their

1308
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:16,579
colonization up and they end up eating

1309
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,900
any residual food that's lipped they eat

1310
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:20,929
a bunch of it for you little garbage

1311
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,809
disposals he just said sugars displace

1312
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:26,389
salts you guys so most of the nutrients

1313
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:28,610
you're feeding are salts and your plants

1314
00:47:26,389 --> 00:47:30,529
are filled with salts salts don't taste

1315
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,030
so good sugar sounds like it tastes good

1316
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:34,160
right so if you put some sugars in there

1317
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:35,390
when you're flushing it'll push the salt

1318
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,129
out of your plants it'll also clean up

1319
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:38,809
the soil it'll break it up kind of goes

1320
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:41,450
in there and stir it around right yeah

1321
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:43,909
feed feeds your hands are hungry mykos

1322
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:44,419
which is always awesome I want to go to

1323
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:45,889
a web

1324
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,559
this is where I got a lot of the

1325
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:50,389
information about just a lot of

1326
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,210
information from this show it's called

1327
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:55,308
marijuana growers HQ comm is where I got

1328
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,710
a lot of it and I also got some guidance

1329
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:59,089
from the Botanic Air website I'm kind of

1330
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,500
looking at their feed charts to keep in

1331
00:47:59,088 --> 00:48:01,909
mind what I would feed every week

1332
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,920
because I don't have my own feed chart

1333
00:48:01,909 --> 00:48:05,480
in my hand because it's so it's in the

1334
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,028
gross spaces you know I don't carry that

1335
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,278
around but yeah so that was a shout-out

1336
00:48:08,028 --> 00:48:12,528
to the people that made the charts easy

1337
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:15,619
for me to figure out and they made NPK

1338
00:48:12,528 --> 00:48:17,329
easy for everyone to understand I think

1339
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:20,240
we should stop there on the nutrient

1340
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:21,380
lessons because we're 45 minutes in 47

1341
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:23,118
minutes and I think if we go any further

1342
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,650
we'll end up running over an hour and

1343
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,930
you potheads run out of attention span

1344
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:29,269
at 45 minutes I can tell how long you

1345
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:30,259
listen stitcher tells me Tony can

1346
00:48:29,268 --> 00:48:31,669
definitely tell how long you're

1347
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,910
listening because he runs all my web

1348
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:36,920
stats we've had about 5,000 lessons on

1349
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:39,710
the past few episodes yeah which is

1350
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,599
remarkable I want to thank all 5,000 of

1351
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:44,389
you hope all 5,000 of you continue to

1352
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,068
listen it seems like it's about time to

1353
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:48,139
wrap up the show I don't feel like I

1354
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:49,670
have much more to cover or was that page

1355
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:50,989
that I had my topics I think I covered

1356
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:53,210
them all we're gonna say we did because

1357
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:54,288
I can't find the damn paper so we had to

1358
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,750

1359
00:48:54,289 --> 00:48:59,690

shoutouts for now that's enough let's

1567
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:06,059
get on to the meat of the show here we

1568
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:07,350
got a guy that does all kinds of

1569
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:10,170
organics and we've been talking about a

1570
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:11,670
lot of grow lessons so I guess the first

1571
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,110
question to jump right into it dude if

1572
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,298
we just want to get down to it you want

1573
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:27,229
to tell me all

1574
00:58:14,298 --> 00:58:28,699
Organic is [ __ ] [ __ ] it's a Jessie

1575
00:58:27,228 --> 00:58:32,328
actually started the hashtag of stole it

1576
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:35,838
obvious page but now it's the idea is

1577
00:58:32,329 --> 00:58:38,179
that all organic we don't like the idea

1578
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:40,748
of any bottled fertilizers and that ik

1579
00:58:38,179 --> 00:58:45,229
nutrients specifically no pesticides

1580
00:58:40,748 --> 00:58:50,259
anything with mineral salts map and dap

1581
00:58:45,228 --> 00:58:54,198
mono Ematic mono ammonium phosphate

1582
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:59,088
preservatives the idea is to create a

1583
00:58:54,199 --> 00:59:00,650
clean product food grade everything half

1584
00:58:59,088 --> 00:59:04,369
of the products I use it our local

1585
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:07,459
natural grocers just a really big

1586
00:59:04,369 --> 00:59:10,160
emphasis on growing style that's most

1587
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:14,419
growers tend to focus on flower where we

1588
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:17,178
focus on the soil I feel a lot of stuff

1589
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:21,829
is lost when you're just focusing on

1590
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:24,439
weight high vegetative yields you quit

1591
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:28,759
flowering times you're just losing a lot

1592
00:59:24,438 --> 00:59:31,188
of I mean money you just lose them so

1593
00:59:28,759 --> 00:59:33,199
much in that process quality exactly and

1594
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:35,298
then hurting the environment and a lot

1595
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:36,709
of other people and that's that part is

1596
00:59:35,298 --> 00:59:37,998
what's really got me interested I want

1597
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:39,708
to learn a lot from you to maybe shift

1598
00:59:37,998 --> 00:59:42,498
my grow toward this style and my

1599
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:45,469
reasoning is the sustainability I've got

1600
00:59:42,498 --> 00:59:47,419
a kid and she's 11 now and I keep

1601
00:59:45,469 --> 00:59:48,469
thinking about the stuff that I hear I

1602
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,329
read about what they're making my

1603
00:59:48,469 --> 00:59:52,420
nutrients out of and then I'm thinking

1604
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:52,420
about

1605
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,010
I toured a large girl facility that runs

1606
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:58,779
a lot of hydro and they have lots of

1607
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,460
water that has to be flushed out as

1608
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:02,050
waste and I thought where does that go

1609
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:03,730
that's going back to our municipal water

1610
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:05,050
supply and being filtered out and when

1611
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:06,608
you get water out of the sink that's

1612
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:08,230
what we're drinking and that really

1613
01:00:06,608 --> 01:00:09,369
that's enough the past few years has had

1614
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,650
me thinking I want to get more

1615
01:00:09,369 --> 01:00:14,530
sustainable and no offense to the hydro

1616
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:16,358
shops but I love them because they help

1617
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:18,640
us out but we don't need to be paying

1618
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:20,409
over March prices for a botanic air

1619
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:21,730
bottle because it says Botanica when

1620
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:23,889
Sean can teach us how to take that

1621
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:33,130
chicken [ __ ] and seabird guano and make

1622
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:35,618
something that we can I do feel

1623
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:37,660
hypocritical sometimes because I use

1624
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:45,220
very few products from our stores well

1625
01:00:37,659 --> 01:00:47,440
so it has the option I was pretty blown

1626
01:00:45,219 --> 01:00:53,219
away when I first walked in there from a

1627
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:55,240
guy who just absolutely you're doing it

1628
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:56,559
mostly out of the organics with the

1629
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:58,539
clean product for the food grade I'm

1630
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,730
interested more for the sustainability I

1631
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:02,739
think that's both a great reason to do

1632
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:04,750
it one thing that got my attention right

1633
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:07,569
off the bat you said you don't use any

1634
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:09,280
pesticides or non-organic pesticides I'm

1635
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:11,440
really curious and I bet the listeners

1636
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,630
are too how do you keep bugs out of your

1637
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,460
crop without some nuclear attack right

1638
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:17,740
at the beginning of the fall here

1639
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:21,970
everybody I know got three types of bugs

1640
01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:22,719
at once three letters I pee em can I

1641
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,639
guess what that means

1642
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:26,649
ladies and gentlemen integrated pest

1643
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,509
management please write that down that's

1644
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:30,039
important we will talk about that a lot

1645
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:31,840
that's gonna be a glossary term that you

1646
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:34,059
need to mark IPM integrated pest

1647
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:37,900
management prevention is the only

1648
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:40,750
guaranteed form of pest control 100% if

1649
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:42,760
you don't want to deal with pests then

1650
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:45,730
you have to start a program and that

1651
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,800
starts with a nice organic base you want

1652
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:50,590
to start out with you know things high

1653
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:53,470
in chitin insect frass crab you know uh

1654
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:55,590
things neem cake all of that into the

1655
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:57,659
soil mix then you want to start off on a

1656
01:01:55,590 --> 01:02:01,289
regimen of

1657
01:01:57,659 --> 01:02:03,118
you know silica what else

1658
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:04,589
aloe vera you want to build you wanna

1659
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,778
strengthen the plant help it build us

1660
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:08,489
cell walls basically you need to build

1661
01:02:06,778 --> 01:02:10,170
its immune system so it can take care of

1662
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:13,528
itself so throw away the bottle of

1663
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:16,769
potassium silicates and use the aloe

1664
01:02:13,528 --> 01:02:18,028
vera and the one that you said that I

1665
01:02:16,768 --> 01:02:21,239
felt would really build the cell walls

1666
01:02:18,028 --> 01:02:31,048
the silica silica is just such an

1667
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:34,038
underutilized all the fiber grows

1668
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:35,818
exactly the stronger leaf wall is the

1669
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:37,829
stronger is gonna be able to stay enough

1670
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:40,349
to attack okay what are you used to get

1671
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:43,109
silica organics there's a couple of

1672
01:02:40,349 --> 01:02:44,548
different options all no actually

1673
01:02:43,108 --> 01:02:45,358
there's thousands of different options

1674
01:02:44,548 --> 01:02:47,670
on the market

1675
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:51,210
potassium silica is probably the number

1676
01:02:47,670 --> 01:03:44,130
one most common it's really that's a

1677
01:02:51,210 --> 01:03:46,068
good one to use most companies from cuts

1678
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:51,630
up the bugs if they try to get through

1679
01:03:46,068 --> 01:03:58,500
okay well actually they do high for

1680
01:03:51,630 --> 01:04:00,390
spray every it's every girl likes to

1681
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,789
spend time in their garden and if you

1682
01:04:00,389 --> 01:04:06,420
can find a way to do it yeah they go for

1683
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:08,730
me my ways to spray so you know I do

1684
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,259
break it down into regiments shout out

1685
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,838
to dragonfly earth medicine with their

1686
01:04:10,259 --> 01:04:15,659
natural mystic T's of foliar sprays

1687
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:17,308
their soil inoculates and other herbal

1688
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:21,538
inoculate but that's a big part of my

1689
01:04:17,309 --> 01:04:23,910
spray regiment homemade compost teas F

1690
01:04:21,539 --> 01:04:25,980
PJs ffj civ fermented fruit juices

1691
01:04:23,909 --> 01:04:27,808
fermented plant juices that I make

1692
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,670
myself and you're actually spraying that

1693
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:32,730
on your Plus bring that on the plate

1694
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:34,889
into flour and I usually don't go okay

1695
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:37,949
just like a traditional spray sounds

1696
01:04:34,889 --> 01:04:41,489
even though it's organic things just

1697
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:43,078
tend to stick around okay yeah Newton

1698
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:44,358
cause problems going past week four or

1699
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:47,278
five I assume exactly especially

1700
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:55,259
everything that I use is very sugary

1701
01:04:47,278 --> 01:04:58,768
ya know guys I'm not gonna say that I

1702
01:04:55,259 --> 01:05:00,088
was a hater of organics but I feel he

1703
01:04:58,768 --> 01:05:01,469
stood up for himself before anybody even

1704
01:05:00,088 --> 01:05:03,028
mentioned it he said I brought this to

1705
01:05:01,469 --> 01:05:04,889
show you that it's dense and it's

1706
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:06,539
odoriferous and it's covered in

1707
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:08,400
trichomes and it's all of that the

1708
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:09,839
trichomes are actually real they're not

1709
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,809
tall they don't stick off the bud that

1710
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:13,500
he showed me real far but they're

1711
01:05:11,809 --> 01:05:15,750
compacted they're everywhere all over

1712
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,039
that nugget even between where the two

1713
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:19,108
little buds touch on that branch there

1714
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,750
between there you got resin everywhere

1715
01:05:19,108 --> 01:05:23,670
on that Thanks organics do work I can

1716
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:26,358
see the proof you know I do some

1717
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:36,509
consulting on the side with a couple of

1718
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:38,308
concentrate companies Rocky Mountain a

1719
01:05:36,509 --> 01:05:41,099
chiral farming you can check us out on

1720
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:43,740
Instagram following us a lot of these

1721
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:45,390
guys you know they're making pho and

1722
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:50,219
it's funny you you have your little meme

1723
01:05:45,389 --> 01:05:52,018
on the internet can only smokes bhu but

1724
01:05:50,219 --> 01:05:53,518
I'm pretty sure there's plenty of guys

1725
01:05:52,018 --> 01:05:55,649
out there who will back me on this one

1726
01:05:53,518 --> 01:05:58,318
say it organics produce better hash

1727
01:05:55,650 --> 01:06:01,230
I feel the trichomes more fully develops

1728
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:03,599
you your membranes more intact you're

1729
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:05,170
not gonna get that mush I see it a lot

1730
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,960
especially when making the ice why

1731
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:13,480
as you can see this is some stuff that's

1732
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:14,710
locally grown smoke this tonight one of

1733
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:23,829
your buddies had some of this I actually

1734
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:28,510
made it for him okay this is organic

1735
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:30,068
soup it still has a nice smell a lot of

1736
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:32,109
this Ovilus they kind of loses the odor

1737
01:06:30,068 --> 01:06:35,460
in my opinion and it's still got that

1738
01:06:32,108 --> 01:06:38,739
dank smell I believed it

1739
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:41,920
maybe it's degrading a little quicker so

1740
01:06:38,739 --> 01:06:47,889
you check the quality of that one I like

1741
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:49,809
this one a lot this one is tasty who did

1742
01:06:47,889 --> 01:06:52,000
you say made this that was made by

1743
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:55,109
trichome heavy extracts shout-out to

1744
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:58,329
jibs and grown by growing cush 1 ma ha

1745
01:06:55,108 --> 01:07:01,420
Rob he was just killing the game right

1746
01:06:58,329 --> 01:07:03,190
now I walked into the first cannabis cup

1747
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,200
nobody knew who I read genetics was I

1748
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:07,358
hadn't put my face on Instagram yet and

1749
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:09,009
I had my shirt on and growing cush 1

1750
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:11,048
mile high spotted me right away and he

1751
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:12,520
goes dude your IV genetics come here and

1752
01:07:11,048 --> 01:07:14,920
took a picture with me and posted it to

1753
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:16,750
Instagram and now my face was out that's

1754
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,010
what did it that's what put my face on

1755
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,539
Instagram that's when I was like well

1756
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:20,260
I'm the tall guy with dreadlocks that's

1757
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:26,949
how it goes

1758
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:40,480
I remember that if you want to get your

1759
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:43,029
genetics off their game a couple of

1760
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,588
weeks if everything goes well do you

1761
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,880
think the you er I'm gonna kind of back

1762
01:07:44,588 --> 01:07:47,798
loop here you said that the trichomes

1763
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,440
have a better the trichome heads have a

1764
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:51,730
better casing from organics do you think

1765
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,530
that it's because we're using what the

1766
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:55,630
plant actually wants instead of feeding

1767
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:57,730
it junk foods out of a bottle exactly a

1768
01:07:55,630 --> 01:08:00,190
few of the synthetic approaches like you

1769
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:01,509
say junk food is just the such an

1770
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:03,369
appropriate term

1771
01:08:01,509 --> 01:08:04,688
your buds are gonna get denser if

1772
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:06,519
they're gonna get bigger they're gonna

1773
01:08:04,688 --> 01:08:09,248
get fatter does that necessarily mean

1774
01:08:06,518 --> 01:08:12,098
they're any better no I mean it's only

1775
01:08:09,248 --> 01:08:14,528
better for your wallet exactly and we're

1776
01:08:12,099 --> 01:08:16,900
fortunate enough to be in an industry or

1777
01:08:14,528 --> 01:08:18,929
at a point in this industry where maybe

1778
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:22,149
that doesn't matter as much anymore

1779
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:38,980
so now the people are all obsessed with

1780
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:40,808
hitting a perfect example one plant

1781
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:42,788
kicked out donkey dicks the size of my

1782
01:08:40,809 --> 01:08:44,529
arms and then the Girl Scout cookies

1783
01:08:42,788 --> 01:08:46,929
have little popcorn but there was as

1784
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:48,549
much resin on that little popcorn of

1785
01:08:46,929 --> 01:08:51,969
Girl Scout cookies as there was spread

1786
01:08:48,548 --> 01:08:53,798
amongst that entire other plant it was

1787
01:08:51,969 --> 01:08:57,130
so dank that little cookies plan is just

1788
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:59,019
coated I'd rather grow more of those if

1789
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:00,279
I didn't have picky patients if my

1790
01:08:59,019 --> 01:09:01,690
patients weren't demanding of the

1791
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:03,880
Grateful dog and other strains I grow

1792
01:09:01,689 --> 01:09:06,129
all cookies just cuz the resin it puts

1793
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:09,190
out it's so going to cookies you do you

1794
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:11,019
nesaf eat some grateful dog in there but

1795
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:17,229
I definitely have like a 36 light room

1796
01:09:11,019 --> 01:09:18,250
of just cookies cookies cookies I kind

1797
01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:19,808
of want to mention things but I don't

1798
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:24,429
want to say too much I am in the process

1799
01:09:19,809 --> 01:09:30,940
of possibly taking on a badass position

1800
01:09:24,429 --> 01:09:34,630
running 227 lights within the next month

1801
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:38,018
I will be in there growing under 227

1802
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:40,798
kavita's oh yeah I'm a little stoked

1803
01:09:38,019 --> 01:09:44,500
it's all hydro tables it's gonna be fun

1804
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:46,238
all right so try better trichome heads

1805
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,500
because of organics does the aloe vera

1806
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:50,828
have anything to do with that you think

1807
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:54,309
it makes my skin more supple and doesn't

1808
01:09:50,828 --> 01:09:57,518
burn under the grow light yeah I mean

1809
01:09:54,309 --> 01:09:59,140
you can really go into the properties of

1810
01:09:57,519 --> 01:10:02,230
aloe and yucca and

1811
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:03,850
saponin and all of that stuff that's you

1812
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:06,069
have 30 minutes worth the conversation

1813
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:08,860
but bottom line is it increases the

1814
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:12,130
healthier plant silica aloe coconut

1815
01:10:08,859 --> 01:10:15,489
water those are the bases outside of

1816
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:17,800
that preach those products other than

1817
01:10:15,489 --> 01:10:19,210
the Basilica I'm always about aloe and

1818
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:27,159
coconut water I teach a lot of people

1819
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:29,800
that myself I feel amazing when I drink

1820
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:32,380
it you know with the gardening that I

1821
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:34,810
use I like the idea that my plants share

1822
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:37,630
the same food you know the more I grow

1823
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:39,430
and the more I evolve into this I think

1824
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:41,770
my plants I was a vegetarian before I

1825
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:43,480
grew I took decent care of myself but I

1826
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:45,100
think learning about the plant biology

1827
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:47,169
has made me take better care of myself

1828
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:48,520
and it's influenced my shopping when I

1829
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:50,949
go to vitamin cottage or whatever

1830
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:53,380
grocery store I hit and jesse has done

1831
01:10:50,949 --> 01:10:55,179
it to his own practices have influenced

1832
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:57,279
my shopping am i eating a little bit and

1833
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:58,630
it's which is in turn has affected my

1834
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,679
growing because now you're here to teach

1835
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:01,720
me how to be more healthy more

1836
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:05,409
sustainable so I see it going full

1837
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:07,720
circle that's I like it I feel like

1838
01:11:05,409 --> 01:11:09,699
people maybe put a little bit too much

1839
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:11,140
emphasis on the switch I mean if you're

1840
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:19,929
running soilless and you're running

1841
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:24,850
betaine a care I've got a grateful dog

1842
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:26,829
run to perfect a few strains but it's a

1843
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:29,680
big jump for me to just go change but I

1844
01:11:26,829 --> 01:11:32,559
may do it write down what you do and I

1845
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,909
can people have probably disagree with

1846
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,460
me on this but I don't think you're

1847
01:11:33,909 --> 01:11:38,979
gonna lose yield I have to swear up and

1848
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:42,569
down that this whole organic seals less

1849
01:11:38,979 --> 01:11:45,069
is just a misconception in the industry

1850
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:47,259
really is unfortunately you do have

1851
01:11:45,069 --> 01:11:49,479
people it's a different approach than

1852
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,949
traditional gardening so you've got guys

1853
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:52,979
out there have been doing hydro or

1854
01:11:50,949 --> 01:11:55,689
soilless mixes for years switch into

1855
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:58,419
super soils and burn in their plants and

1856
01:11:55,689 --> 01:12:00,219
all can extend use anything but it

1857
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,449
reflects a lot on the grower also I

1858
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:04,000
think somebody like you could definitely

1859
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:05,019
just take off with it especially with

1860
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,989
your experience with the hata dose

1861
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:08,500
that's the key okay is with Oregon I see

1862
01:12:07,989 --> 01:12:10,569
you started

1863
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:12,880
face a lot of people like to water never

1864
01:12:10,569 --> 01:12:14,590
or water every time I'm sorry they don't

1865
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,840
use anything but water and me personally

1866
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:19,409
I like to water never and that's kind of

1867
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:21,460
your style now or you're giving it I

1868
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:23,439
don't know all the product name but

1869
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:25,180
you're eating them silica and yucca and

1870
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:27,369
you're giving them everything that I am

1871
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:29,170
just just in the liquid bottle I'm doing

1872
01:12:27,369 --> 01:12:31,210
it the lazy way you know how most of

1873
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:33,850
that stuff is made is it's a compost tea

1874
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:35,470
and then so they make like a compost tea

1875
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:38,320
and then they basically they'll arrest

1876
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:40,420
fermentation so they stop and kill all

1877
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:42,460
the living organisms in there turn it

1878
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:44,949
through a protein skimmer bottle it up

1879
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:46,649
and then sell it to you so just cut out

1880
01:12:44,949 --> 01:12:49,029
the middleman

1881
01:12:46,649 --> 01:12:50,349
there we go by the summer guys we should

1882
01:12:49,029 --> 01:12:52,389
all be making our own newts when it's

1883
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:54,220
warm and we're in Colorado I'm not going

1884
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:56,050
on the backyard doing it this week I got

1885
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:57,520
a garage if I had some space by the

1886
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:59,710
summer we'll get it going will all be

1887
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,970
grown organic let's get away we have to

1888
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:02,409
support the hydro shops go buy the

1889
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:03,670
organics there get the stuff that's in

1890
01:13:02,409 --> 01:13:05,979
the box the blood meal the bone meal

1891
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:08,350
things if you're doing that get your

1892
01:13:05,979 --> 01:13:11,379
worm castings and stuff where we locally

1893
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:12,760
go go to high growth and make sure that

1894
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:14,440
when you're mixing your soil talk to

1895
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:16,480
Jesse about that cuz he can fill you in

1896
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:18,279
on the whole meal and blood meal thing

1897
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:21,629
I'm pretty sure Justin loves to talk to

1898
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:25,380
people he loves to just get paid to talk

1899
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:28,270
it's better than advanced but you know

1900
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:30,400
the meal but no can be improved upon as

1901
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:32,530
well so exactly and this goes back to

1902
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:34,809
the the veganic sweet version to kind of

1903
01:13:32,529 --> 01:13:37,599
talking about before the show by no

1904
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:39,880
means do I claim to be a viana grower we

1905
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,579
use a hashtag called beyond veganic to

1906
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:45,279
kind of poke fun at it just for the

1907
01:13:42,579 --> 01:13:45,640
simple fact vegan growing is kind of

1908
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:48,719
funny

1909
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,720
just like vegans are a

1910
01:13:49,329 --> 01:14:00,380
you know so it's a vegan don't worry and

1911
01:13:55,010 --> 01:14:03,020
that's really how they're using just

1912
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:03,829
bottled nutrients it's just plain and

1913
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,210
simple yeah

1914
01:14:03,829 --> 01:14:06,859
and if they're not they're really

1915
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:08,529
depriving their plants of you know

1916
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,149
certain things they could be using

1917
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:15,199
earthworm castings for example like I

1918
01:14:11,149 --> 01:14:17,539
nuclear there's a nice little show Rocky

1919
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:21,199
Mount earthworm castings I know Jessie

1920
01:14:17,539 --> 01:14:24,439
uses it I usually belch they're super

1921
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:26,319
high quality he's killing the game right

1922
01:14:24,439 --> 01:14:28,699
now dedicated his life to making

1923
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:30,619
castings for people like me and Jessie

1924
01:14:28,699 --> 01:14:33,489
I've heard a lot of good things if

1925
01:14:30,619 --> 01:14:37,550
you're a customer of my store and use

1926
01:14:33,489 --> 01:14:40,909
earthworm castings ask me for him please

1927
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:43,329
do you know is organic grower I've been

1928
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:45,769
in Colorado for about two years now

1929
01:14:43,329 --> 01:14:47,180
before then I grooves that all I've

1930
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:52,130
known you bros two years it's only been

1931
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:53,780
two yeah but no so you know I have a

1932
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:56,359
degree in horticulture I'm from North

1933
01:14:53,779 --> 01:15:00,500
Carolina obviously but back there I grew

1934
01:14:56,359 --> 01:15:02,269
fall so it was organically small-scale

1935
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:04,250
but you know I've been doing teas and

1936
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:08,750
soil mixes for a while

1937
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:10,340
coming out here really opened my eyes to

1938
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:11,989
the fact that you know you think you're

1939
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:13,970
gonna come out to Colorado you think

1940
01:15:11,989 --> 01:15:15,829
you're gonna grow organics you think

1941
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:19,130
it's this big popular thing but it's all

1942
01:15:15,829 --> 01:15:21,260
about money um yeah but you know Jay I

1943
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:23,060
met Jay um and then he had the high

1944
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:25,460
quality these high quality castings I've

1945
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:27,320
never turned back mayhem probably within

1946
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:30,770
a month of being here I've been using

1947
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:33,710
his castings ever since he does all

1948
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:35,450
testings on his stuff you know it's

1949
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:37,340
super high quality and that's really

1950
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:40,159
posted to them today actually yeah and

1951
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:43,010
that's really the key to basically what

1952
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:44,479
I do is my castings and plain and simple

1953
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:45,960
everybody wants to know how do I do it

1954
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:47,819
it's Jase castings

1955
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,800
without a microbial inoculant not

1956
01:15:47,819 --> 01:15:53,819
microbial source I couldn't do what I do

1957
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:56,489
a lot of people source

1958
01:15:53,819 --> 01:15:58,619
you know wrigglers them castings from

1959
01:15:56,489 --> 01:16:00,659
stores you know you can make your own

1960
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:02,220
compost it's probably the best way to do

1961
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:04,170
it your own where I'm castings is

1962
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:06,390
probably the best way to do it but at

1963
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:08,760
the same time a lot of people I call it

1964
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:10,740
green washing they go out and they buy

1965
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:13,130
something because it looks organic or it

1966
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:15,420
looks like it's you know gonna be

1967
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:18,930
all-natural exactly like this

1968
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:20,730
environmental friendly product and these

1969
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:22,289
companies are preying on the consumer

1970
01:16:20,729 --> 01:16:25,319
just like they would in any other you

1971
01:16:22,289 --> 01:16:27,390
know organic companies aren't any nicer

1972
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:29,549
than synthetic companies there's a

1973
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:31,920
company right now for example that loves

1974
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:33,900
to kick out this they throw numbers at

1975
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,989
people and you your average grower

1976
01:16:33,899 --> 01:16:39,239
doesn't really understand how these work

1977
01:16:36,989 --> 01:16:43,670
but for example like Jesse was saying

1978
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:46,710
Jay actually posted something earlier

1979
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:48,539
about the worm castings I'm sorry I

1980
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:50,819
wanted to bring this up check it out do

1981
01:16:48,539 --> 01:16:53,279
your research I like um know for example

1982
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:56,250
so you've got a company out there who's

1983
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:59,969
throwing this number around like 30,000

1984
01:16:56,250 --> 01:17:02,520
plus microbe you know living microbes in

1985
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:04,890
your tea and you can use it and multiply

1986
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,110
it and you know it sounds amazing it

1987
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:10,850
really does then you read J's test and

1988
01:17:07,109 --> 01:17:13,799
it's like six point nine million

1989
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:15,780
protozoa and one gram of material so in

1990
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:18,150
one pound that's through over 3 billion

1991
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:18,630
protozoa that's before you multiply in

1992
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:21,449
your Brewer

1993
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:23,760
so to everybody out there that's using

1994
01:17:21,449 --> 01:17:27,569
these these products you know these

1995
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,970
sales pitches I'm sorry

1996
01:17:27,569 --> 01:17:32,039
[Music]

1997
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:33,420
exactly you know you think you're

1998
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:36,060
getting a leg up but really you're

1999
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:38,369
paying for an overpriced Brewer and

2000
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,870
somebody to put stuff in a bag for you

2001
01:17:38,369 --> 01:17:41,099
I saw you're paying when to bottled me

2002
01:17:39,869 --> 01:17:42,630
it's a lot like clothes we're paying for

2003
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:44,460
the label you're paying for that Nike

2004
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:46,150
symbol hair symbol that advance

2005
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:48,670
nutrients logo

2006
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:51,789
so shout out to Jay he's doing it big in

2007
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:54,789
not only worm castings he can source a

2008
01:17:51,789 --> 01:17:57,850
lot of things that you know grow stores

2009
01:17:54,789 --> 01:18:00,850
can't get Jesse can probably attend to

2010
01:17:57,850 --> 01:18:02,679
that there's a lot of things that you're

2011
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:04,840
just not gonna be able to source he

2012
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:07,270
approaches it a little differently thing

2013
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:09,069
you know that's it's cool once you get

2014
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:12,070
to a certain scale it's time to adjust

2015
01:18:09,069 --> 01:18:14,170
from being garage basement attic grower

2016
01:18:12,069 --> 01:18:16,389
to actually being a horticulturalist and

2017
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:18,039
setting up a grow and doing horticulture

2018
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:26,770
that's kind of what it sounds like

2019
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:28,899
that's what Jays more aimed for here's a

2020
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:31,090
weird question I'm gonna feed botanic

2021
01:18:28,899 --> 01:18:33,488
hair will it kill my neem meal if I put

2022
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:35,440
it in my soil before I mix no you got it

2023
01:18:33,488 --> 01:18:38,500
the only reason you really have to be

2024
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:41,109
careful mixing synthetics and organics

2025
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:44,679
is you can really throw off your micro

2026
01:18:41,109 --> 01:18:46,929
herd you feed too much of something your

2027
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:48,969
fungus is gonna feed it a faster rate

2028
01:18:46,929 --> 01:18:51,010
than your bacteria to kill your bacteria

2029
01:18:48,969 --> 01:18:53,739
out and your fungus will actually start

2030
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:56,409
to pull things from the plant if it's

2031
01:18:53,738 --> 01:18:58,599
not in the soil so it's a balancing act

2032
01:18:56,408 --> 01:19:00,158
there's a couple of people I've seen on

2033
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,679
Instagram who are just absolutely

2034
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:05,170
killing the balancing act with the

2035
01:19:02,679 --> 01:19:07,690
synthetics and organics I would never

2036
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:09,130
recommend it to anybody that's something

2037
01:19:07,689 --> 01:19:12,029
we talked about in the last shows don't

2038
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:14,679
mix just stay away unless you were just

2039
01:19:12,029 --> 01:19:17,079
extremely well versed in what you do I

2040
01:19:14,679 --> 01:19:19,300
would highly recommend staying away from

2041
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:22,920
running synthetics and organics at the

2042
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:27,958
same time I know a guy that admin's his

2043
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:30,300
cocoa saloon and he's runnin full-blown

2044
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:32,038
- hydroponic smell though yeah these

2045
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:34,380
probiotic guys now I've seen a lot of

2046
01:19:32,038 --> 01:19:35,969
I'm running Coco the probiotic farmers

2047
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:37,769
Alliance is getting crazy it's giving

2048
01:19:35,969 --> 01:19:39,719
everybody this table knows there's one

2049
01:19:37,769 --> 01:19:41,670
grower he runs organics all the way

2050
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:44,309
until about week six and then he starts

2051
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:46,408
just pummeling with like hammer head and

2052
01:19:44,309 --> 01:19:48,059
all kinds of ridiculous PG ARS just to

2053
01:19:46,408 --> 01:19:50,670
make him explode and he said that gives

2054
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:53,309
it the flavor that's his but you know

2055
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:54,449
I'm just yeah that's his girl he can do

2056
01:19:53,309 --> 01:19:55,769
what he wants in there just don't sell

2057
01:19:54,448 --> 01:19:58,198
it to me I heard they didn't make that

2058
01:19:55,769 --> 01:20:00,599
stuff anymore you know they don't but I

2059
01:19:58,198 --> 01:20:04,169
know it's called like bushmasters or

2060
01:20:00,599 --> 01:20:06,449
something there are two or three bottles

2061
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:15,090
on the shelf at hydro and supplies if

2062
01:20:06,448 --> 01:20:17,399
you use hammer head made my buds larger

2063
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:19,078
I'll say it if you're an advanced

2064
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:20,098
nutrients grower or a hydro farmer and

2065
01:20:19,078 --> 01:20:29,639
you want to clean that [ __ ] off the

2066
01:20:20,099 --> 01:20:34,349
shelf at Jesse there we go advances on

2067
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:35,939
really good sale culture show

2068
01:20:34,349 --> 01:20:37,199
speaking of advanced I had something

2069
01:20:35,939 --> 01:20:38,489
written down we've already gone a half

2070
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:41,478
hour guys with this show maybe a little

2071
01:20:38,488 --> 01:20:44,069
longer than an hour if nobody minds um

2072
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:45,510
why don't you guys I'm gonna take a DAB

2073
01:20:44,069 --> 01:20:46,948
and I'm gonna this is I'm like I'm

2074
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:48,659
starting a fight right now tell me a

2075
01:20:46,948 --> 01:20:53,879
little bit about PG ours and how you

2076
01:20:48,658 --> 01:20:55,558
feel about them PG R stands for plant

2077
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,909
growth regulator you guys and I'm gonna

2078
01:20:55,559 --> 01:21:00,029
let Sean tell us about those while I

2079
01:20:56,908 --> 01:21:03,029
take a DAB there's a time and place for

2080
01:21:00,029 --> 01:21:06,050
everything man um not in my food crops

2081
01:21:03,029 --> 01:21:08,000
at least not

2082
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:10,550
synthetically made PG RS there's

2083
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:15,039
obviously plenty of ways to use natural

2084
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:15,039
PG ARS playing hormones gibberellic acid

2085
01:21:29,409 --> 01:21:34,029
barley tea over two weeks on my

2086
01:21:31,729 --> 01:21:36,619
benchmarks yeah actually alternate

2087
01:21:34,029 --> 01:21:40,279
alfalfa and barley for veg and then corn

2088
01:21:36,619 --> 01:21:52,210
and barley for flowers just because I

2089
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:55,699
haven't found I mean I know I've been

2090
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:57,529
yeah learning that you know a lot of

2091
01:21:55,699 --> 01:21:59,869
cool little additives you don't find it

2092
01:21:57,529 --> 01:22:02,800
gross doors although almost art have

2093
01:21:59,869 --> 01:22:05,630
sperm ferments for immense ferment like

2094
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,869
cold processed extractions that's how

2095
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:11,690
you're gonna get your natural PG RS

2096
01:22:07,869 --> 01:22:13,880
fermented plant juices basically you're

2097
01:22:11,689 --> 01:22:24,889
gonna collect growing new it's just what

2098
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:27,319
a PG are actually is basically basically

2099
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:30,410
what a PG R is is it controls the

2100
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:32,539
plant's growth um so it contains either

2101
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:35,569
real or synthetic forms of plant

2102
01:22:32,539 --> 01:22:37,850
hormones and then it's gonna make the

2103
01:22:35,569 --> 01:22:41,019
plant react in a certain way usually by

2104
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:44,300
triggering like apical dominance or

2105
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:46,790
stimulating the plant's SAR there's

2106
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:48,260
different ways that these PG RS can

2107
01:22:46,789 --> 01:22:50,930
affect the plants but for the most part

2108
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:53,390
you're just applying it to the plant at

2109
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:54,530
a certain stage in its growth cycle to

2110
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:57,380
make it do what you want

2111
01:22:54,529 --> 01:22:58,819
you're just manipulating nature so the

2112
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:00,319
most popular one I think that a lot of

2113
01:22:58,819 --> 01:23:04,069
us have used in the past would be

2114
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:04,849
snowstorm snowstorm ultra it's basically

2115
01:23:04,069 --> 01:23:06,559
they've taken

2116
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:09,920
I think it's seek help and other plant

2117
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:12,680
proteins and concentrated them why don't

2118
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,869
I want to feed that to my plants and I'm

2119
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:16,949
just being I'm just trying to yeah and

2120
01:23:14,869 --> 01:23:18,090
the thing is a lot of those

2121
01:23:16,948 --> 01:23:20,460
yeah I can't really tell you without

2122
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:22,110
looking at the bottle what exactly is in

2123
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:25,649
it but if you telling me it's the kelp

2124
01:23:22,109 --> 01:23:27,569
um me personally my favorite flower

2125
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:30,479
hardener back when I used to use bottled

2126
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:33,389
organics was what is it mindo avalanche

2127
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:35,428
Mendocino avalanche which is basically

2128
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:38,100
two different types of kelp and molasses

2129
01:23:35,429 --> 01:23:41,039
so that I've actually kind of adapted

2130
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:44,610
that to my so just replace the trap and

2131
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:49,069
you just make a real deal natural

2132
01:23:44,609 --> 01:23:52,769
healthy PG jars versus exactly into the

2133
01:23:49,069 --> 01:23:54,210
fermented like plant juices extracts is

2134
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:56,340
the way to go it's basically the same

2135
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:57,060
idea is if you wanna if your human wants

2136
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,710
to get ripped

2137
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:00,090
you shouldn't go inject steroids and sit

2138
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:02,698
on the couch you should go to the gym

2139
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:04,829
eat protein eat vegetables get all the

2140
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:06,299
things you need and workout we're not

2141
01:24:04,829 --> 01:24:09,300
giving our plants a workout we're

2142
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:11,130
feeding them energy bars and protein

2143
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:13,199
shakes and treating them like [ __ ] and

2144
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:14,819
expecting them to be fully healthy we

2145
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:17,488
need balanced healthy play these doctors

2146
01:24:14,819 --> 01:24:19,979
they use these steroid boosted I use PG

2147
01:24:17,488 --> 01:24:22,738
ours it's so funny like axiom is one of

2148
01:24:19,979 --> 01:24:26,879
the best juice lots of not on my

2149
01:24:22,738 --> 01:24:28,859
personal stuff you know you're using

2150
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:34,289
this synthetic to stimulate the plants

2151
01:24:28,859 --> 01:24:35,880
SAR which is its systematic automated

2152
01:24:34,289 --> 01:24:39,689
response that the first word might be

2153
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:41,789
off some sort of automated response

2154
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:44,669
basically it's the plant's ability to

2155
01:24:41,789 --> 01:24:46,350
protect itself its defense mode that's

2156
01:24:44,670 --> 01:24:50,190
the reason you know the plant produces

2157
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:51,719
resin is to protect itself basically and

2158
01:24:50,189 --> 01:24:54,719
that's kind of axiom does is it

2159
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:57,060
stimulates that chain reaction inside of

2160
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:57,359
the plant so it's going into defense

2161
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,760
mode

2162
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:02,339
the plant it's exactly what it's doing

2163
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:05,489
is its chemically stressing the plant

2164
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:06,690
you have to be careful you know just can

2165
01:25:05,488 --> 01:25:08,069
probably contended this when you're

2166
01:25:06,689 --> 01:25:10,379
messing with you Berlocq acid and stuff

2167
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:12,179
I get a lot of fox tailing yeah when I

2168
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:14,940
can to use it later into flour and

2169
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:17,369
that's usually with any PGR

2170
01:25:14,939 --> 01:25:20,189
it wasn't a sherbert like acid at one

2171
01:25:17,369 --> 01:25:26,119
point was a choice for people creating

2172
01:25:20,189 --> 01:25:29,250
from my seeds too stretchy yeah I found

2173
01:25:26,119 --> 01:25:39,539
silver thiosulfate did I make myself is

2174
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:40,890
the best way for reversing I was you're

2175
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:42,600
gonna reverse seeds definitely make your

2176
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:44,369
own silver thiosulfate at home it's

2177
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:51,750
really easy to do make everything at

2178
01:25:44,369 --> 01:25:53,420
home kind of apologize also if you live

2179
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:56,100
in an apartment if you're a new grower

2180
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:57,390
if you're not if you're not striving

2181
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,980
through what we already don't don't feel

2182
01:25:57,390 --> 01:26:00,449
bad use your bottles do what you can if

2183
01:25:58,979 --> 01:26:01,948
you're a medical patient and you don't

2184
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:03,988
have the physical ability to mix this

2185
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:05,698
[ __ ] up we're not hating you we're just

2186
01:26:03,988 --> 01:26:07,259
recommending we're encouraging there's

2187
01:26:05,698 --> 01:26:08,939
no and reach out to us because we

2188
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:11,100
definitely have ways that we could help

2189
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:14,219
you yeah well you know if you live in an

2190
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,780
apartment if you are unable to mix your

2191
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:18,719
soil and make your own teas there are

2192
01:26:15,779 --> 01:26:20,750
definitely options out there for you see

2193
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:26,969
that stuff community on the podcast

2194
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:28,979
everybody truck and will drive up soil

2195
01:26:26,969 --> 01:26:30,510
in your yard for you and pots and will

2196
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:31,859
carry it in and hopefully you can get

2197
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:35,820
your wheelchair between the plants to

2198
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:37,909
water them yeah I think people kind of

2199
01:26:35,819 --> 01:26:39,840
over complicate things with organics

2200
01:26:37,909 --> 01:26:42,090
basically if you if you want to grow

2201
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,619
organics or start growing organic side

2202
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:46,050
recommend going and finding a nice and

2203
01:26:43,619 --> 01:26:49,710
organic bottled line of nutrients roots

2204
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:51,510
organic general organic age-old you know

2205
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:57,069
the list goes on and on and

2206
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:57,069
[Music]

2207
01:26:57,389 --> 01:27:02,940
fish Hydra slate is very good yeah I

2208
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:03,570
used to use it when I was back in the

2209
01:27:02,939 --> 01:27:06,839
dizzy

2210
01:27:03,569 --> 01:27:10,380
but anyways I'd recommend picking up a

2211
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:12,380
nice bottled organic nutrient line then

2212
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:14,760
outside of that go and get you some nice

2213
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:17,940
Rocky Mount where I'm casting style worm

2214
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:21,050
castings they the quality is extremely

2215
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:24,299
important I cannot stress that enough

2216
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:27,059
fine high quality worm castings or find

2217
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:27,750
a high quality microbial source and then

2218
01:27:27,059 --> 01:27:30,150
molasses

2219
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:35,250
there's your compost tea sean is pretty

2220
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:36,118
much describing the the way I grew they

2221
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:42,179
were supposed to call him something

2222
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:45,000
different that's basically the way I go

2223
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:48,420
inside and I could promise you if you

2224
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,880
get stellar results and it's you know

2225
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:52,770
it's the way better than I drove us for

2226
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:55,199
damn sure and you're just replacing you

2227
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:58,469
know synthetics FG lates

2228
01:27:55,198 --> 01:28:00,868
and that's kind of the idea of using the

2229
01:27:58,469 --> 01:28:02,939
tea with your organic bottled nutrient

2230
01:28:00,868 --> 01:28:04,348
is when you feed with your teeth when

2231
01:28:02,939 --> 01:28:05,848
you feed with the nutrient you're

2232
01:28:04,349 --> 01:28:08,460
putting it in the soil when you're

2233
01:28:05,849 --> 01:28:10,650
feeding with UT you're activating that

2234
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:11,939
soil to help me eat those nutrients to

2235
01:28:10,649 --> 01:28:14,339
give it back into you it's a really good

2236
01:28:11,939 --> 01:28:16,169
way to put that it's a great way to if

2237
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:18,599
you're growing with bottled organic

2238
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:20,429
nutrients and you're not using a tea of

2239
01:28:18,599 --> 01:28:22,380
some some sort of microbial source

2240
01:28:20,429 --> 01:28:23,908
you're just hurting yourself playing

2241
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,319
simple I have a couple of questions

2242
01:28:23,908 --> 01:28:28,859
getting down free and stuff will you

2243
01:28:25,319 --> 01:28:30,779
give us a quick run through five gallon

2244
01:28:28,859 --> 01:28:31,948
bucket on how to make a nice Jessie's

2245
01:28:30,779 --> 01:28:34,109
done this for us but we chose how to

2246
01:28:31,948 --> 01:28:35,519
make nice microbial tea for her just to

2247
01:28:34,109 --> 01:28:38,328
start off with yeah we can use almost

2248
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:41,940
any time okay so yeah without a doubt

2249
01:28:38,328 --> 01:28:45,328
worm castings in molasses if you can't

2250
01:28:41,939 --> 01:28:47,279
get anything else just those two and

2251
01:28:45,328 --> 01:28:50,069
there's your microbial source and

2252
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:51,960
there's a food for it of dependent on

2253
01:28:50,069 --> 01:28:54,630
your quality of castings 1/4 the cup per

2254
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:56,250
gallon molasses depending on how often

2255
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:58,400
you're using it one teaspoon to 1

2256
01:28:56,250 --> 01:29:01,470
tablespoon for a gallon

2257
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:03,750
outside of that kelp meals always a good

2258
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:05,310
one i coat me all I mean if you're not

2259
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:07,289
familiar with the benefits of kelp you

2260
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:09,660
should really look it up plenty of plant

2261
01:29:07,289 --> 01:29:14,130
hormones there's a decent NPK value in

2262
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:16,559
there and then really go crazy just

2263
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:18,390
molasses earthworm castings then you can

2264
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,240
go into kelp you can go into alfalfa

2265
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:22,740
depending on you know veg flour that's

2266
01:29:21,239 --> 01:29:24,840
how you're gonna kind of deliver more of

2267
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:28,349
an NPK value to your plant

2268
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:34,230
do you agree with the Rebs the Rebs book

2269
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:36,539
true living organics you know either the

2270
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:39,209
Reb sub I grew up learning organics just

2271
01:29:36,539 --> 01:29:41,939
like everybody else did and I really

2272
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:44,760
don't agree with his unfort

2273
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:48,089
but I learned everything did I know now

2274
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:49,530
from his book you know it's if I

2275
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:51,569
wouldn't I went through that trial I

2276
01:29:49,529 --> 01:29:53,279
wouldn't be where I am today so I can't

2277
01:29:51,569 --> 01:29:54,899
be mad at him you just have to work

2278
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:56,189
learn what works for you I know people

2279
01:29:54,899 --> 01:29:58,619
who have used to stuff with great

2280
01:29:56,189 --> 01:30:03,449
success okay so he's not saying to skip

2281
01:29:58,619 --> 01:30:05,909
it no I've seen some people crush it and

2282
01:30:03,449 --> 01:30:08,760
have amazing super soil and I've seen

2283
01:30:05,909 --> 01:30:10,289
other people have burnt up shitty buds

2284
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:14,730
with super soil so it's kind of it's how

2285
01:30:10,289 --> 01:30:17,220
you grow it's people are really funny

2286
01:30:14,729 --> 01:30:18,719
about organics we even with my Rocky

2287
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:20,250
Mountain a chiral farming page we kind

2288
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:23,850
of had to take a break with those for a

2289
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:26,189
while we like to put in for informative

2290
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:29,310
posts trying to help the community but

2291
01:30:26,189 --> 01:30:31,049
we're not met with a lot of defiance oh

2292
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:32,640
as soon as you put up I quit posting a

2293
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:34,380
lot of stuff on Facebook as soon as you

2294
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:36,329
put up a helpful thing ten people tell

2295
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:39,329
you why you're stupid and you know

2296
01:30:36,329 --> 01:30:42,029
teaches and you don't have to agree with

2297
01:30:39,329 --> 01:30:43,019
the way I grow right yeah even if I say

2298
01:30:42,029 --> 01:30:45,389
something wrong

2299
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:47,160
sure I mean it's a lot easier for you to

2300
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:48,869
focus on one point I got a lot of stuff

2301
01:30:47,159 --> 01:30:51,300
I got to remember I've actually made

2302
01:30:48,869 --> 01:30:53,010
mistakes on this podcast and I felt

2303
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,050
proud to come back and say hey guys last

2304
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:56,880
week I told you the wrong way I'm sorry

2305
01:30:55,050 --> 01:31:00,720
like Jesse called me he's like you just

2306
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:02,969
said this [ __ ] I did say that I feel

2307
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:05,460
like people are getting too caught up

2308
01:31:02,969 --> 01:31:07,498
this growing style or that growing style

2309
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:11,069
or he grows like this they grow like

2310
01:31:07,498 --> 01:31:18,059
that and it just people need to choose

2311
01:31:11,069 --> 01:31:19,738
their own information science all three

2312
01:31:18,059 --> 01:31:23,099
of us grow different ways you know yes

2313
01:31:19,738 --> 01:31:24,808
you know but we all borrow something

2314
01:31:23,099 --> 01:31:27,150
from each other exactly you've learned

2315
01:31:24,809 --> 01:31:29,400
something from me and I've learned five

2316
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:31,228
things from you and five from yous we're

2317
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:34,198
all still doing the same thing thank you

2318
01:31:31,229 --> 01:31:37,440
I love talking to synthetic growers I've

2319
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:39,388
never grown marijuana synthetically my

2320
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:42,808
background is in commercial agriculture

2321
01:31:39,389 --> 01:31:54,179
I've been millions and millions of GMO

2322
01:31:42,809 --> 01:31:57,269
horrible horrible synthetic plants 30

2323
01:31:54,179 --> 01:31:59,279
acres of glass greenhouses before people

2324
01:31:57,269 --> 01:32:01,590
get to eat but you know there's a

2325
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:03,809
certain point in time that you've got to

2326
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:06,090
kind of figure out what means more to

2327
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:08,190
you is it your money or your morals yeah

2328
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:10,078
I walked away from making $45,000 to you

2329
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:16,379
which is you know it's a good bit for me

2330
01:32:10,078 --> 01:32:17,819
oh no you know walked away from that and

2331
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:21,809
got a part-time job here in town working

2332
01:32:17,819 --> 01:32:23,670
at a hydro store and just grew that's

2333
01:32:21,809 --> 01:32:24,989
what I wanted to do and I couldn't it's

2334
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:27,269
a lot easier to wake up and look at

2335
01:32:24,988 --> 01:32:28,768
yourself in the mirror solutely that's

2336
01:32:27,269 --> 01:32:30,599
why I started a seed company because I

2337
01:32:28,769 --> 01:32:32,219
got tired well that's kind of what led

2338
01:32:30,599 --> 01:32:33,960
to it but that's how I ended up

2339
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:35,729
self-employed I don't want to work for

2340
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:38,368
somebody all day for something I don't

2341
01:32:35,729 --> 01:32:40,440
support exact for a minimum wage and

2342
01:32:38,368 --> 01:32:42,899
hate myself I'd rather be kind of

2343
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:44,819
struggling and really happy have a cool

2344
01:32:42,899 --> 01:32:46,799
job and have a cool job I've got

2345
01:32:44,819 --> 01:32:48,840
everything I want cool ass girlfriend I

2346
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,670
do what I want I got a seed company if I

2347
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:52,739
and I'm not rich I think if I were rich

2348
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:53,819
I'd just be depressed and confused on

2349
01:32:52,738 --> 01:32:55,319
all this money and I wouldn't know if

2350
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:58,889
you guys are my friends because I'm rich

2351
01:32:55,319 --> 01:33:00,210
or cuz you guys are cool as [ __ ] smoke

2352
01:32:58,889 --> 01:33:01,670
all my live resin because I've got it

2353
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:05,119
out to do too much

2354
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:07,069
I think I've got where we are rich we're

2355
01:33:05,119 --> 01:33:08,719
rich this way we make the did we know

2356
01:33:07,069 --> 01:33:10,279
that we're not poisoning people happy

2357
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:11,779
drawing a quality product we're

2358
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:13,670
contributing we're moving it forward

2359
01:33:11,779 --> 01:33:15,859
we're making the cannabis a good thing

2360
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:18,020
instead of a scary thing I walked away

2361
01:33:15,859 --> 01:33:25,969
from a twenty five dollar an hour job

2362
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:30,500
well I walk away they actually told me I

2363
01:33:25,969 --> 01:33:32,569
had to quit smoking weed and said no so

2364
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:34,189
but yes and a lot of people tell you

2365
01:33:32,569 --> 01:33:35,719
that that's wait half years but you have

2366
01:33:34,189 --> 01:33:38,149
to choose the decisions that make ya

2367
01:33:35,719 --> 01:33:39,500
happiness over money is way important I

2368
01:33:38,149 --> 01:33:56,289
don't drink a fifth of whiskey every

2369
01:33:39,500 --> 01:34:05,689
night now oh yeah you can tell one beer

2370
01:33:56,289 --> 01:34:07,850
Wow two beers would crush me you told me

2371
01:34:05,689 --> 01:34:09,049
earlier what is your average harvest

2372
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:12,829
weight per thousand watt light running

2373
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:16,219
organics you know it varies last round

2374
01:34:12,829 --> 01:34:19,309
we ran with the kind of like the style

2375
01:34:16,219 --> 01:34:21,050
Jesse was talking about with just a

2376
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:23,900
bottled nutrient kind of her bottled

2377
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:27,829
organic supplemented with teas we were

2378
01:34:23,899 --> 01:34:32,448
hitting around I see 1.7 pounds per

2379
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:34,670
light this guy's this last grow um which

2380
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:36,649
is what I brought you today was grown

2381
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:39,170
with no bottle of nutrients absolutely

2382
01:34:36,649 --> 01:34:42,429
none I mean this is all fruit juices

2383
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:45,350
plant juices the calcium and I think a

2384
01:34:42,429 --> 01:34:54,230
pretty mild soil too compared to like

2385
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:55,730
TLO amending that's really impressed me

2386
01:34:54,229 --> 01:34:58,079
about that jar together

2387
01:34:55,729 --> 01:35:00,429
[Music]

2388
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:05,170
hold the boat up to the microphone but

2389
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:07,990
it's not loud enough yeah I said we hit

2390
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:09,670
probably 1.2 I'm not done pulling yet

2391
01:35:07,989 --> 01:35:11,590
I'll text you with a final wait and you

2392
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:14,380
can throw it up on a later show but yes

2393
01:35:11,590 --> 01:35:16,510
right now I'm kind of looking at 1.2 but

2394
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:17,680
that's with no bottled nutrients and

2395
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:23,739
these are new strains that I'm running

2396
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:25,539
this favorite bro you know I'm still I

2397
01:35:23,739 --> 01:35:28,689
still feel so like new to the growing

2398
01:35:25,539 --> 01:35:30,100
game you know growing back east and kind

2399
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:34,000
of growing what you have to you get out

2400
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:39,820
here and I guess flow probably be my

2401
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:41,140
favorite take good pictures to Rex

2402
01:35:39,819 --> 01:35:43,359
I think we were talking about that oh

2403
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:47,680
yeah that win is definitely gonna be in

2404
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:49,210
the garden for a long long time yeah

2405
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:50,470
outside of that I've had a pleasure to

2406
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:52,810
run some of your gear I've grown a

2407
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:54,789
grateful dog the heart of gold is

2408
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:58,980
Jeffrey nice I think the heart of gold

2409
01:35:54,789 --> 01:35:58,979
was my personal favorite cool um it was

2410
01:35:59,189 --> 01:36:03,099
[Music]

2411
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:04,720
it's not like you wake up in the middle

2412
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:11,110
of the night you accidentally grab that

2413
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:15,600
to put you back to sleep that's the

2414
01:36:11,109 --> 01:36:15,599
golden there's definitely sativa heavy

2415
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:24,699
so yeah I think about 10 weeks is

2416
01:36:23,409 --> 01:36:25,029
usually what I recommend for the heart

2417
01:36:24,699 --> 01:36:28,389
of gold

2418
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:29,349
I took once it's 76 77 days when it's

2419
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:34,750
nice

2420
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:36,670
I think pearly 72 as far as I go so DJ

2421
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:37,960
shorts been preaching this 11:13 light

2422
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:40,149
cycle so I tried it

2423
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:41,470
oh man Sean had a reaction right away

2424
01:36:40,149 --> 01:36:42,609
I'm glad I decided to go that route I

2425
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:44,560
had a couple of things written down a

2426
01:36:42,609 --> 01:36:45,489
couple of ways to go so I'm glad I went

2427
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,470
that way

2428
01:36:45,489 --> 01:36:50,739
I'll tell you my experience but what did

2429
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:52,840
you think about it confusion man I just

2430
01:36:50,739 --> 01:36:55,319
a little bit of information is a

2431
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,319
dangerous thing

2432
01:36:56,109 --> 01:37:01,869
that's all I have to say about it I see

2433
01:36:59,229 --> 01:37:05,679
I was saying I see more expression the

2434
01:37:01,869 --> 01:37:07,329
plants showed more color um a sativa

2435
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,840
screen that has never really Fox tailed

2436
01:37:07,329 --> 01:37:11,079
on me

2437
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:12,279
kind of made finger e buds um I got a

2438
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:14,800
lot of color I keep saying that the

2439
01:37:12,279 --> 01:37:16,569
color was tremendous on this run but I

2440
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:19,270
feel like it lowered my harvest weight

2441
01:37:16,569 --> 01:37:21,250
by somewhere between 10 and 20 percent

2442
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:22,720
I'm not I haven't cut everything down

2443
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,279
here I've got more to go but I could

2444
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:26,110
tell it diminish my harvest that may

2445
01:37:24,279 --> 01:37:28,899
have been from the cold but I really

2446
01:37:26,109 --> 01:37:31,899
think it was from that light cycle yeah

2447
01:37:28,899 --> 01:37:34,210
we always preach it the most important

2448
01:37:31,899 --> 01:37:36,460
nutrient to our plants is the light and

2449
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:39,489
so we took a full hour and that's we

2450
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:42,399
took 63 hours 65 hours away from our

2451
01:37:39,489 --> 01:37:44,559
plans honestly yeah and one thing I did

2452
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:47,109
notice they finished quickly I probably

2453
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,460
saved two weeks on some of my ten or

2454
01:37:47,109 --> 01:37:50,229
eleven weeks drains they're gonna finish

2455
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:52,210
week nine and they'll be done I I'm

2456
01:37:50,229 --> 01:37:53,739
worried to let them go too long one made

2457
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:55,659
her mouth I can see it kind of getting

2458
01:37:53,739 --> 01:37:58,029
pissy it's like you gotta cut me down

2459
01:37:55,659 --> 01:38:00,699
yeah which is cool I'll cut her but I

2460
01:37:58,029 --> 01:38:04,179
just wasn't ready it's uh it's a neat

2461
01:38:00,699 --> 01:38:06,429
tool and app reading aspect you know if

2462
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:08,680
we were tested across we had made if

2463
01:38:06,430 --> 01:38:09,850
you're looking for FINA I think that is

2464
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:11,760
a good point you know that that's

2465
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:15,220
probably the only time I'll use it again

2466
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:17,350
use that you've got growers and advanced

2467
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:20,090
breeders and people talking about this

2468
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:26,810
so just please don't try this at home

2469
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:28,550
yes stick with 12 12 if you want to get

2470
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:30,170
adventurous if you're if you're kind of

2471
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:32,390
advanced do what you want to do I don't

2472
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:34,100
I don't I don't want to hold anybody

2473
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:35,869
back but be responsible because if you

2474
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:37,250
do go and her about that crop you got to

2475
01:38:35,869 --> 01:38:39,170
do something with that herm down crop

2476
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:40,880
and don't go tryna you did not just make

2477
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:53,239
a seed company you're not called Calypso

2478
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:54,770
seed does not make a seed company grow

2479
01:38:53,239 --> 01:38:56,779
grow them yourself give them to your

2480
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:58,760
friends give free those are free seed

2481
01:38:56,779 --> 01:39:01,309

2482
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:04,220
your friends he warned them and then you

2483
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:26,180
understand hopefully you know all the

2484
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:49,220
breeders are bitching about seven years

2485
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:51,440
or 15 years trained to Kitty's adorable

2486

kitties to full-on take a [ __ ] in the

2488
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:06,560
toilet

2489
01:39:53,420 --> 01:40:08,710
like a human they start tagging that I

2490
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:17,980
region ethics

2491

2506
01:40:57,699 --> 01:41:01,389
thankful that you year if you live in

2507
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:02,829
Colorado go and get the damn castings

2508
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:05,440
because there's people out there who

2509
01:41:02,829 --> 01:41:07,449
just want them so bad and just can't

2510
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:09,969
afford the shipping or they don't have

2511
01:41:07,449 --> 01:41:11,769
access to them it's just such an

2512
01:41:09,969 --> 01:41:12,819
underutilized thing here in town and it

2513
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:14,500
doesn't sound like you need a whole

2514
01:41:12,819 --> 01:41:16,149
bunch you said like a quarter cup yeah I

2515
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:18,159
mean most people are putting in a cup

2516
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:19,479
per gallon these outrageous rates and

2517
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:22,090
you can use 1/4 cup

2518
01:41:19,479 --> 01:41:23,979
I mean if five to ten percent cutting

2519
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:26,680
into your soil mixes just more than

2520
01:41:23,979 --> 01:41:31,029
enough I use like 80 pounds of it on my

2521
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:32,920
six outdoor plants different grow a

2522
01:41:31,029 --> 01:41:34,238
clone grow two clones keep them in cups

2523
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:35,529
for like three weeks you know until

2524
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:38,069
they're starting to get root bound or

2525
01:41:35,529 --> 01:41:40,059
they're pissed off root bound feed one

2526
01:41:38,069 --> 01:41:41,859
consistently with your microbial tea

2527
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:43,270
with the worm castings in it don't add

2528
01:41:41,859 --> 01:41:45,069
that to your other one when you feed it

2529
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:48,430
and pull them out of the cup and watch

2530
01:41:45,069 --> 01:41:49,569
you'll have thicker fingery Bank happy

2531

01:41:49,569 --> 01:41:54,159
have these thin angel hair pasta wispy

2533
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:56,860
roots if you mulch the one that you're

this is what the homepage to look like

2878
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:34,630
and then I drew tabs at the top and then

2879
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:36,460
I was like this is what I want the

2880
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:38,380
second page to look like and he kind of

2881
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:40,659
did my vision it's a work in progress

2882
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:59,500

3007
02:03:05,149 --> 02:03:07,250
to work with a spot that's my big

3008
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:08,989
announcement that I've been kind of

3009
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:12,800
teasing about on social media and stuff

3010
02:03:08,989 --> 02:03:15,439
I want to complement the Colorado Amed

3011
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:17,449
in Springs he made it sound like it was

3012
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:18,769
a big deal to go get your med badge and

3013
02:03:17,449 --> 02:03:20,720
it was a pain in the ass I did have a

3014
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:22,160
couple of things I had a tax issue from

3015
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:24,590
my past that I had to clear up and I had

3016
02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:26,599
to get a noted paper that my child

3017
02:03:24,590 --> 02:03:27,890
support was current and cleaned up but I

3018
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:29,510
already did that because I knew that was

3019
02:03:27,890 --> 02:03:31,220
coming and they never asked for it but

3020
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:32,570
they said that they would they never

3021
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:34,159
asked for those papers I went in there I

3022
02:03:32,569 --> 02:03:36,019
so in Colorado Springs you're able to

3023
02:03:34,159 --> 02:03:37,340
call and make an appointment the hardest

3024
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:39,140
part is getting the appointment call

3025
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:40,369
every day until you get an appointment

3026
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:42,110
because I had to call three times in a

3027
02:03:40,369 --> 02:03:44,210
row they called me back after the third

3028
02:03:42,109 --> 02:03:46,399
one I said an appointment I got there

3029
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:48,260
early she saw I was early she took me

3030
02:03:46,399 --> 02:03:50,509
right when I got there boom she got me

3031
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:53,420
out of there within 30 minutes my full

3032
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:55,100
appointment was 30 minutes giving her

3033
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:56,480
the paper she reviewed the paper and

3034
02:03:55,100 --> 02:03:57,890
it's one lady that's there all the time

3035
02:03:56,479 --> 02:03:59,750
I wish I could remember her name I was

3036
02:03:57,890 --> 02:04:00,860
excited and anxious so I don't even know

3037
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:02,689
what she looks like to tell you the

3038
02:04:00,859 --> 02:04:06,349
truth

3039
02:04:02,689 --> 02:04:08,839
[ __ ] concert boat lady

3040
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:09,980

3041
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,449

3042
02:04:09,979 --> 02:04:12,979
fingerprint which is kind of fun and

3043
02:04:11,449 --> 02:04:14,389
then they run all your background checks

3044
02:04:12,979 --> 02:04:15,769
and then they take a picture of you and

3045
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:16,340
she high-fives you and tells you have a

02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:50,400
current you can prove it as long as your

3063

taxes are good on your small business

3064
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:53,920
they never asked for proof

3065
02:04:52,479 --> 02:04:58,119
I guess they probably could tell this

3066
02:04:53,920 --> 02:05:00,069
body yeah application was 13 pages I

3067

02:05:00,069 --> 02:05:04,750

3069

02:05:12,970 --> 02:05:34,740
medical records just nice

3076
02:05:31,899 --> 02:05:38,559

3077
02:05:34,739 --> 02:05:47,859
but I got mine right before the first

3078

3084
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:10,000
appointment for that okay they do not

3085
02:06:08,439 --> 02:06:11,949
take cash you guys if you ever go into

3086
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:14,409
the Med go get a money order for the

3087
02:06:11,949 --> 02:06:17,949
total yeah that's anything pretty much

3088
02:06:14,409 --> 02:06:19,960
he really that office and Springs isn't

3089
02:06:17,949 --> 02:06:21,909
in a shitty area but parts of Springs

3090
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:23,560
right near like Colorado Springs on one

3091
02:06:21,909 --> 02:06:24,489
side of the street is gorgeous the other

3092
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:28,420
side of the street you're like I don't

3093
02:06:24,489 --> 02:06:30,250
want to [ __ ] park my car off to the

3094
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:32,230
side areas they could be I wouldn't

3095
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:34,149
recognize a miss they could easily be a

3096
02:06:32,229 --> 02:06:35,469
victim of robbery or something not

3097
02:06:34,149 --> 02:06:36,849
saying go do it I'm saying they could so

3098
02:06:35,470 --> 02:06:39,460
it's why is it they don't keep a lot of

3099
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:41,770
cash yeah and my badge alone was 300

3100
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:43,760
bucks and probably do 20 appointments a

3101
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:46,570
day at 150 years

3102
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:49,489
our appointment price going up for that

3103
02:06:46,569 --> 02:06:54,739
50 for the key or 150 for the support

3104
02:06:49,489 --> 02:06:56,960

3105
02:06:54,739 --> 02:06:58,849
upgrading badge is it still like 253

3106
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,840
bucks to go from one to the other like

3107
02:06:58,850 --> 02:07:01,190
you should have just paid that in the

3108
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:02,329

you're doing the right ones you want

3129
02:07:58,699 --> 02:08:02,899
that just go for that key or support if

3130
02:08:00,649 --> 02:08:04,159
if you don't want to be like a manager

3131
02:08:02,899 --> 02:08:05,719
or something if you just want to trim

3133
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:08,650
but if you want to get paid a little

3134
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:10,850
more if you want to have some chance of

that that big one get that support then

3137
02:08:13,479 --> 02:08:19,849
they always have to have a support badge

3138
02:08:16,579 --> 02:08:21,319
on premises so if boss needs to go

3139
02:08:19,850 --> 02:08:22,760
somewhere maybe you can step up and show

3140
02:08:21,319 --> 02:08:24,469
that you can do that [ __ ] that's how

3141
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:26,449
people advance so go on the website

3142
02:08:24,470 --> 02:08:27,590
print out that application read it

3143
02:08:26,449 --> 02:08:29,599
thoroughly before you even start

3144
02:08:27,590 --> 02:08:31,730
printing cuz there's one page that says

3145
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:33,770
if any of this stuff applies to you go

3146
02:08:31,729 --> 02:08:35,750
[ __ ] yourself it pretty much says if you

3147
02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:38,060
did this you cannot get a badge it's

3148
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:41,000
straight up no like just read your

3149
02:08:38,060 --> 02:08:42,950
application now front primarily it's

3150
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,989
kind of the same stuff as getting into

3151
02:08:42,949 --> 02:08:47,869
the military yeah

3152
02:08:44,989 --> 02:08:49,199
no drug felonies no drug felonies is

3153
02:08:47,869 --> 02:08:50,550
their main Wanya

3154
02:08:49,199 --> 02:08:51,359
I should have had the list here but I

3155
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:56,900
didn't realize we're gonna have this

3156
02:08:51,359 --> 02:09:00,779
conversation I mean and it's basically

3157
02:08:56,899 --> 02:09:01,979
common sense at that point yeah so if

3158
02:09:00,779 --> 02:09:04,619
you can if you're in another state or

3159
02:09:01,979 --> 02:09:07,919
one just to clarify like this means like

3160
02:09:04,619 --> 02:09:10,380
to work behind a counter selling herb to

3161
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:13,350
people to selling cannabis legally right

3162
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:15,270
doesn't mean you can't live in Colorado

3163
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:21,090
and can't have three plants or six

3164
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:23,430
plants whatever the state this is just

3165
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:25,409
to work in a regulated job become part

3166
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:27,420
of the industry and right right now I

3167
02:09:25,409 --> 02:09:29,250
hate saying this but it's what I feel

3168
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:30,600
and what I part of why I'm making the

3169
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:32,789
business decisions I'm making say I

3170
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:34,920
think in the future I region etics will

3171
02:09:32,789 --> 02:09:37,409
be able to breed inside of this large

3172
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:39,239
facility that I've just been became

3173
02:09:37,409 --> 02:09:41,369
master grower of and right now if I

3174
02:09:39,239 --> 02:09:42,719
don't make a move like that the way that

3175
02:09:41,369 --> 02:09:44,189
I'm growing in the way that my business

3176
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:46,050
model works I think the industry will

3177
02:09:44,189 --> 02:09:47,759
squeeze me right out I either need to

3178
02:09:46,050 --> 02:09:49,110
join it or get squeezed out of it and

3179
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:50,760
this is my way to join it and not

3180
02:09:49,109 --> 02:09:52,769
disappear I want to be here for the long

3181
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:54,300
haul well I've thought about this I feel

3182
02:09:52,770 --> 02:09:56,910
like I'm selling out a little bit but

3183
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:59,820
I'd rather give then not exist at all

3184
02:09:56,909 --> 02:10:01,019
what I got to do I totally agree yeah so

3185
02:09:59,819 --> 02:10:02,670
all right guys if you get that

3186
02:10:01,020 --> 02:10:05,310
application fill it out if you're not in

3187
02:10:02,670 --> 02:10:06,840

02:10:08,279 --> 02:10:11,789
in person you have to be kind of

3191
02:10:10,109 --> 02:10:13,679
persistent almost be an [ __ ] about it

3192
02:10:11,789 --> 02:10:14,970
because so many people apply every day

3193
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:16,950

3232
02:11:38,250 --> 02:11:43,319
always lines I've been going to the spot

3233
02:11:41,429 --> 02:11:44,579
for a couple of reasons recently mostly

3234
02:11:43,319 --> 02:11:45,840
to talk to the owners out there in the

3235
02:11:44,579 --> 02:11:48,689
bosses and to see if we can negotiate

3236
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:49,739
and also my favorite person the second

3237
02:11:48,689 --> 02:11:51,029
favorite person I have a daughter

3238
02:11:49,738 --> 02:11:52,529
sorry girlfriend your second the

3239
02:11:51,029 --> 02:11:53,939
daughter comes first just kind of

3240
02:11:52,529 --> 02:11:55,050
picking on you but she's out there I go

3241
02:11:53,939 --> 02:11:56,789
out there to visit her and go take her

3242
02:11:55,050 --> 02:11:57,989
launch or just go see what's up and

3243
02:11:56,789 --> 02:11:59,488
doing it's hard for her to get away from

3244
02:11:57,988 --> 02:12:01,589
the counter because they've got business

3245
02:11:59,488 --> 02:12:03,509
it's you're not gonna go and sit down

3246
02:12:01,590 --> 02:12:04,920
behind a counter and be like socializing

3247
02:12:03,510 --> 02:12:06,119
with people you would you would think

3248
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:08,460
that you know you still have to have

3249
02:12:06,118 --> 02:12:10,948
customer service but it's you have 14

3250
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:12,210
people out in the lobby waiting you know

3251
02:12:10,948 --> 02:12:14,698

3252
02:12:12,210 --> 02:12:16,050
want a bud tend I said no I'd rather not

3253

be a budtender I just rather stick with

3254
02:12:16,050 --> 02:12:19,409
being the grower you know cuz it'll be

3255
02:12:17,279 --> 02:12:21,210
downtime for me but I think once in a

3256
02:12:19,408 --> 02:12:22,789
while just for fun and I'll announce it

3257

give you 10% off yeah that's how I got

3265
02:12:47,010 --> 02:12:50,460
my foot in the medical industry I was

3266
02:12:48,630 --> 02:12:52,230
well I started helping transplant

3267
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:53,639
somebody helping somebody transplant

3268
02:12:52,229 --> 02:12:54,839
that had their own shop in too many

3269
02:12:53,639 --> 02:12:56,400
plants that couldn't handle it

3270
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:59,500
I saw him struggling I was like you need

3271
02:12:56,399 --> 02:13:03,109
help he's like you know how I was like

3272
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:04,970
do this he was older than me so I was

3273
02:13:03,109 --> 02:13:06,170
able to work circles around him and he's

3274
02:13:04,970 --> 02:13:07,490
like come back tomorrow and I'll pay you

3275
02:13:06,170 --> 02:13:13,579
and he gave me way more than I expected

3276
02:13:07,489 --> 02:13:15,559
that was for the rest of the week I

3277
02:13:13,579 --> 02:13:20,449
guess that's a point go show that you

3278
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:21,710
can do some work don't know it's the

3279
02:13:20,449 --> 02:13:23,090
weed industry Wyatt right so you're

3280
02:13:21,710 --> 02:13:24,470
gonna think I can show up with my long

3281
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:25,850
hair down I don't need to take a shower

3282
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:28,850
I could put on my Grateful Dead shirt my

3283
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:31,610
[ __ ] up jeans and you can you can't if

3284
02:13:28,850 --> 02:13:33,410
you work you still gotta treat it like a

3285
02:13:31,609 --> 02:13:36,349
real job interview we want you to be

3286
02:13:33,409 --> 02:13:38,090
able to work if I I'm saying we because

3287
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:39,370
I've got my own cannabis business I want

3288
02:13:38,090 --> 02:13:45,140
to seed company I guess I can qualify

3289
02:13:39,369 --> 02:13:46,670
I'd rather you kind of just show up if

3290
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:48,350
somebody would come in and sit at the

3291
02:13:46,670 --> 02:13:50,810
table and not do anything the whole time

3292
02:13:48,350 --> 02:13:52,820
and not show any initiative then they

3293
02:13:50,810 --> 02:13:54,920
probably wouldn't that's why the

3294
02:13:52,819 --> 02:13:56,420
trimmers that were here there were three

3295
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:58,369
trimmers here for like four nights in a

3296
02:13:56,420 --> 02:13:59,690
row and that's kinda stressful to have

3297
02:13:58,369 --> 02:14:01,069
for all three of those people to take

3298
02:13:59,689 --> 02:14:02,989
four nights out of their lives and get a

3299
02:14:01,069 --> 02:14:04,340
trim pot for me with me helping them I

3300
02:14:02,989 --> 02:14:07,069
could have called two or three other

3301
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:08,720
people but I liked and trusted everybody

3302
02:14:07,069 --> 02:14:10,279
here yeah and I could have driven to the

3303
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:11,690
store and came back and nothing would

3304
02:14:10,279 --> 02:14:13,460
have gone wrong that's why I keep the

3305
02:14:11,689 --> 02:14:14,119
people that I keep that's what it's

3306
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:16,310
about trust

3307
02:14:14,119 --> 02:14:18,619
dude be trustworthy you know like and

3308
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:19,970
because you're not if you're working in

3309
02:14:18,619 --> 02:14:22,609
the weed industry industry we want some

3310
02:14:19,970 --> 02:14:24,860
clean people you're around stuff that

3311
02:14:22,609 --> 02:14:33,589
people are consuming and the meed is a

3312
02:14:24,859 --> 02:14:44,689
stickler for deenis you guys have some

3313
02:14:33,590 --> 02:14:46,789
crazy [ __ ] up rules for this there is

3314
02:14:44,689 --> 02:14:49,339
rumor that the podcast will receive a

3315
02:14:46,789 --> 02:14:51,380
cease and desist letter we can continue

3316
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:54,770
to podcast but not under the name I grow

3317
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:57,739
culture nobody anything yet a lot of

3318
02:14:54,770 --> 02:14:59,510
businesses and podcasts and YouTube and

3319
02:14:57,739 --> 02:15:01,670
Facebook and Instagram things have been

3320
02:14:59,510 --> 02:15:03,670
being forewarned at that a business

3321
02:15:01,670 --> 02:15:06,260
called iGrow which is a college

3322
02:15:03,670 --> 02:15:08,750
institution that does college

3323
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:12,020
horticultural stuff is coming after

3324
02:15:08,750 --> 02:15:13,250
people using the iGrow moniker I have no

3325
02:15:12,020 --> 02:15:14,870
problem changing the name

3326
02:15:13,250 --> 02:15:16,789
want to do it slowly if it does happen

3327
02:15:14,869 --> 02:15:19,220
and I kind of want to do it preemptively

3328
02:15:16,789 --> 02:15:21,050
before I actually get a cease and desist

3329
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:23,210
letter in the mail or email to me or

3330
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:25,070
however it's gonna happen I think it'd

3331
02:15:23,210 --> 02:15:26,539
just be responsible and kind I know if

3332
02:15:25,069 --> 02:15:27,829
that's their name and they've got it I

3333
02:15:26,539 --> 02:15:29,090
don't really feel like I want to rip

3334
02:15:27,829 --> 02:15:30,920
them off I just thought it was cute my

3335
02:15:29,090 --> 02:15:32,060
buddy Kevin and I came up with it I was

3336
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:36,079
like it's like I wanted to use the eye

3337
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:37,820
because it's the modern I grow eyes and

3338
02:15:36,079 --> 02:15:39,260

President President Barack Obama plans

3603
02:29:22,559 --> 02:29:28,199
to sign a 1.1 trillion dollar government

3604
02:29:26,190 --> 02:29:30,210
spending bill if it reaches his desk

3605
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:32,159
although he opposed a provision blocking

3606
02:29:30,209 --> 02:29:32,849
the District of Columbia from legalizing

3607
02:29:32,159 --> 02:29:34,350
marijuana

3608
02:29:32,850 --> 02:29:35,930
Jesse's frantically searching his phone

3609
02:29:34,350 --> 02:29:38,640
I may be reading a different article I

3610
02:29:35,930 --> 02:29:42,720
just want to get that [ __ ] conquer -

3611
02:29:38,639 --> 02:29:44,430
congressman's name spokesman Josh

3612
02:29:42,719 --> 02:29:46,379
earnest said Thursday that despite

3613
02:29:44,430 --> 02:29:48,180
reservations Obama is set to sign less

3614
02:29:46,379 --> 02:29:50,519
legislation to fund nearly the entire

3615
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:53,639
government through the end of the budget

3616
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:55,680
year September 30th district voters

3617
02:29:53,639 --> 02:29:57,539
approved an initiative November 4th to

3618
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:59,819
allow possession of up to two ounces of

3619
02:29:57,540 --> 02:30:02,190
pot or up to three mature plants for

3620
02:29:59,819 --> 02:30:04,319
personal use but here we go

3621
02:30:02,190 --> 02:30:06,030
language inserted by Republicans in the

3622
02:30:04,319 --> 02:30:08,549
spending bill would bar the city from

3623
02:30:06,030 --> 02:30:09,870
moving forward with legalization ernest

3624
02:30:08,549 --> 02:30:11,429
says the President believes Congress

3625
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:13,110
shouldn't interfere with the will of

3626
02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:16,079
City voters on marijuana and other

3627
02:30:13,110 --> 02:30:19,050
issues Obama supports statehood for the

3628
02:30:16,079 --> 02:30:21,659
district so they wrote a new budget

3629
02:30:19,049 --> 02:30:23,819
proposal by they looks like the

3630
02:30:21,659 --> 02:30:27,479
Republicans have submitted this right

3631
02:30:23,819 --> 02:30:30,090
but in the wording they also try to

3632
02:30:27,479 --> 02:30:33,510
block the legalization of cannabis in

3633
02:30:30,090 --> 02:30:37,380
the District of Columbia so just in the

3634
02:30:33,510 --> 02:30:38,940
city not in the state correct like you

3635
02:30:37,379 --> 02:30:40,139
know I know it's a district but e'en on

3636
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:41,880
I'm saying it's like it's the whole

3637
02:30:40,139 --> 02:31:01,379
state from what I read it's gonna be the

3638
02:30:41,879 --> 02:31:04,319
whole state Washington DC I was down

3639
02:31:01,379 --> 02:31:09,269
with DC being legalized he says he's

3640
02:31:04,319 --> 02:31:11,729
cool he didn't have to pass that budget

3641
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:13,649
find that [ __ ] name can he go out

3642
02:31:11,729 --> 02:31:17,000
can he just he's the president bro why

3643
02:31:13,649 --> 02:31:17,000
doesn't he just [ __ ] erase that line

3644
02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:20,709
[Music]

3645
02:31:21,469 --> 02:31:26,699
he decriminalize the least before he

3646
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:29,021
gets out you know because he was so

3647
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:31,631
I'll leave it alone I'll leave it alone

3648
02:31:29,021 --> 02:31:33,101
and then the raids and stuff what he was

3649
02:31:31,630 --> 02:31:35,199
here and he's still like there's a war

3650
02:31:33,101 --> 02:31:40,000
on drugs still and this then the other

3651
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:41,561
and you know it's it's one of those

3652
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:45,909
things that I feel like if he's gonna do

3653
02:31:41,560 --> 02:31:47,739
anything that gives him a like on the

3654
02:31:45,909 --> 02:31:49,511
way out it'll be something along that

3655
02:31:47,739 --> 02:31:51,280
line if he can just bring it down to a

3656
02:31:49,511 --> 02:32:02,829
new substance law

3657
02:31:51,280 --> 02:32:04,181
you know he's spokesperson says he

3658
02:32:02,829 --> 02:32:05,289
believes Congress shouldn't interfere

3659
02:32:04,181 --> 02:32:06,489
with the will of City voters on

3660
02:32:05,290 --> 02:32:09,881
marijuana and other issues and he

3661
02:32:06,489 --> 02:32:13,720
supports statehood what it does is it

3662
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:15,699
blocks any any congressional or or City

3663
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:20,199
money being used to implement the

3664
02:32:15,700 --> 02:32:22,690
program so ultimatum yeah we don't need

3665
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:25,030
your money they'll gladly give it to you

3666

02:32:27,761 --> 02:32:33,250
the voters vote for happening like what

3669
02:32:31,030 --> 02:32:35,320

3670
02:32:33,250 --> 02:32:44,470

3672

3673
02:32:46,030 --> 02:32:52,061
your recreational legal cannabis so they

3674
02:32:49,720 --> 02:32:54,520

know I mean fight the good fight guys

3676
02:32:54,521 --> 02:32:58,950
you know what they're doing is it sounds

3677
02:32:57,459 --> 02:33:05,739
like they're encouraging the gray market

3678
02:32:58,950 --> 02:33:07,420
you know a good place to be a Colorado

3679
02:33:05,739 --> 02:33:09,761
that gray market is getting squeezed out

3680
02:33:07,420 --> 02:33:11,050
I know pot super illegal or expensive

3681
02:33:09,761 --> 02:33:12,460
what's not super illegal it's super

3682
02:33:11,050 --> 02:33:14,591
[ __ ] expensive at the dispensaries

3683
02:33:12,459 --> 02:33:15,939
but it seems like from hanging out in

3684
02:33:14,591 --> 02:33:17,351
the shop as much as I have been lately

3685
02:33:15,940 --> 02:33:20,319
there are a lot of people that would

3686
02:33:17,351 --> 02:33:22,659
rather just go they go to destory shop

3687
02:33:20,319 --> 02:33:24,190
from these ARS there are like 12 strains

3688
02:33:22,659 --> 02:33:26,050
on this shot on the shelf at the shop

3689
02:33:24,190 --> 02:33:27,851
you don't get choice honestly in my

3690
02:33:26,050 --> 02:33:30,670
opinion it's too expensive but that's

3691
02:33:27,851 --> 02:33:32,620
because I'm a spoiled [ __ ] I grow my

3692
02:33:30,670 --> 02:33:35,140
own herb I know what it costs I've been

3693
02:33:32,620 --> 02:33:36,730
paying really low prices for several

3694
02:33:35,140 --> 02:33:38,979
years now and to go there and

3695
02:33:36,729 --> 02:33:41,171
double a little more than double what

3696
02:33:38,979 --> 02:33:44,289
I'm used to paying but it's legal but

3697
02:33:41,171 --> 02:33:46,271
and it's for anybody sit in a cushy

3698
02:33:44,290 --> 02:33:47,681
comfy chair and listen to decent reggae

3699
02:33:46,271 --> 02:33:49,061
music they play good reggae there too

3700
02:33:47,681 --> 02:33:51,221
that has nothing to do with me

3701
02:33:49,060 --> 02:33:53,020
you see these cozy little chairs and

3702
02:33:51,220 --> 02:33:54,550
chill out and it's the chill environment

3703
02:33:53,021 --> 02:33:56,290
and if you don't want to wait for your

3704
02:33:54,550 --> 02:33:58,239
dude to show up if you just want to grab

3705
02:33:56,290 --> 02:33:59,381
an eighth on the way home from work if

3706
02:33:58,239 --> 02:34:00,761
you don't want it because deals are

3707
02:33:59,380 --> 02:34:02,079
sketchy in a parking lot and [ __ ] you

3708
02:34:00,761 --> 02:34:04,120
don't want to be doing that anymore

3709
02:34:02,079 --> 02:34:05,620
just go to that it's I could see the

3710
02:34:04,120 --> 02:34:07,601
black and ivory markets just be and I'm

3711
02:34:05,620 --> 02:34:09,971
telling they would be they would be

3712
02:34:07,601 --> 02:34:12,551
totally wiped out I feel if it was

3713
02:34:09,970 --> 02:34:14,109
accessible in every street corner you

3714
02:34:12,550 --> 02:34:16,091
know almost like a damn liquor store

3715
02:34:14,110 --> 02:34:19,659
where there's you know 13 of them in

3716
02:34:16,091 --> 02:34:23,711
town spread out instead of you know 14

3717
02:34:19,659 --> 02:34:25,239
of them out there you guys in states

3718
02:34:23,710 --> 02:34:27,010
that are just about to legalize her that

3719
02:34:25,239 --> 02:34:29,140
are pushing it you got to get on top of

3720
02:34:27,011 --> 02:34:31,961
[ __ ] the day it pops you got to get your

3721
02:34:29,140 --> 02:34:33,940
shop open because you have to start

3722
02:34:31,960 --> 02:34:35,500
making enough money to comply with the

3723
02:34:33,940 --> 02:34:37,601
regulations that are coming because now

3724
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:39,569
that Colorado has set the standard other

3725
02:34:37,601 --> 02:34:41,650
places are just kind of adopting that

3726
02:34:39,569 --> 02:34:43,210
they're just saying Colorado's doing

3727
02:34:41,649 --> 02:34:44,739
this they kind of set it around that

3728
02:34:43,210 --> 02:34:46,479
they're not making the same mistakes as

3729
02:34:44,739 --> 02:34:48,431
well they already have a template you're

3730
02:34:46,479 --> 02:34:49,841
getting what we used to call here was

3731
02:34:48,431 --> 02:34:52,211
the wild wild west that I talked about

3732
02:34:49,841 --> 02:34:54,101
Jesse knows the Wild West real well good

3733
02:34:52,210 --> 02:34:56,409
olders grew the quarter pounds and the

3734
02:34:54,101 --> 02:34:58,841
houses rent other houses grow weed in

3735
02:34:56,409 --> 02:35:00,369
there take that weed to shops and sell

3736
02:34:58,841 --> 02:35:02,021
it to the shop straight up for cash ID

3737
02:35:00,370 --> 02:35:03,820
well yeah the backpack full of pounds if

3738
02:35:02,021 --> 02:35:05,500
I had a variety if I had five or six

3739
02:35:03,819 --> 02:35:08,739
quarter pounds I could sell all of those

3740
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:10,300
quarter pounds for like 700 750 1/4

3741
02:35:08,739 --> 02:35:11,949
pound dude and walk out with cash back

3742
02:35:10,300 --> 02:35:16,260
in the day yeah it was a handful of

3743
02:35:11,950 --> 02:35:18,189
shops here in town and in the area that

3744
02:35:16,260 --> 02:35:25,478
really I guess the only one of them

3745
02:35:18,189 --> 02:35:28,270
survived but um well too but uh you know

3746
02:35:25,478 --> 02:35:30,369
that's they didn't have girl rooms we

3747
02:35:28,270 --> 02:35:32,409
helped me date they got stuff from guys

3748
02:35:30,370 --> 02:35:34,600
like me and Jeff yeah and it's totally

3749
02:35:32,409 --> 02:35:37,059
legal at the time I had a that was all

3750
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:38,950
you know medical and isn't that what

3751
02:35:37,059 --> 02:35:40,840
people just went out and got the red

3752
02:35:38,950 --> 02:35:42,700
cards and they you know that's that's

3753
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:44,409
what they did yeah but in that kind of

3754
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:47,530
squeezed the grey market here did it not

3755
02:35:44,409 --> 02:35:51,280
like in town just because accessible

3756
02:35:47,530 --> 02:35:52,390
when we made our dispensary public we

3757
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:54,070
had a participatory that we kept

3758
02:35:52,389 --> 02:35:55,180
slightly private we didn't let a lot of

3759
02:35:54,069 --> 02:35:56,739
people know about it wasn't a little

3760
02:35:55,180 --> 02:35:59,260
kind of thing in private clubs or

3761
02:35:56,739 --> 02:36:00,939
nothing but eventually we decided let's

3762
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:02,380
take this to the bigger big room in our

3763
02:36:00,939 --> 02:36:05,020
retail store and just kind of show that

3764
02:36:02,379 --> 02:36:08,019
this is what we're doing we drop prices

3765
02:36:05,020 --> 02:36:09,760
in this town dramatically it was four

3766
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:13,870
hundred bucks an ounce for any kind of

3767
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:15,100
kind but for awhile around here ten or

3768
02:36:13,870 --> 02:36:16,510
twelve years ago four hundred bucks an

3769
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:19,920
ounce that Sour Diesel that we smoked

3770
02:36:16,510 --> 02:36:22,360
400 bucks out stood for 28 grams no love

3771
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:27,760
you'd sell it for 60 bucks an eighth and

3772
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:29,890
they'd be three point four and then we

3773
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:32,228
got the shop going and when we first did

3774
02:36:29,889 --> 02:36:33,639
announce us were 350 just to keep us in

3775
02:36:32,228 --> 02:36:35,049
business cuz we were selling out you

3776
02:36:33,639 --> 02:36:36,430
know and then we had we had a big

3777
02:36:35,049 --> 02:36:38,739
outdoor harvest and we dropped down

3778
02:36:36,430 --> 02:36:42,040
bounces down to 320 and then our

3779
02:36:38,739 --> 02:36:43,719
patients were paying 280 and then we

3780
02:36:42,040 --> 02:36:45,340
were seeing better quality because a lot

3781
02:36:43,719 --> 02:36:47,619
of our stuff was outdoor we're growing a

3782
02:36:45,340 --> 02:36:49,148
large outdoor and we saw the competitors

3783
02:36:47,620 --> 02:36:51,189
the two shops that are still around they

3784
02:36:49,148 --> 02:36:52,569
were getting good indoor and stuff I

3785
02:36:51,189 --> 02:36:54,159
couldn't grow enough to keep it on our

3786
02:36:52,569 --> 02:36:56,709
shelves we had a downtown location we're

3787
02:36:54,159 --> 02:36:58,059
banging you so we dropped prices to 200

3788
02:36:56,709 --> 02:37:01,029
bucks an ounce at one point and that

3789
02:36:58,059 --> 02:37:03,670
[ __ ] up the whole town I was getting

3790
02:37:01,030 --> 02:37:05,860
hate mail hate calls death threats like

3791
02:37:03,670 --> 02:37:07,420
people were mad at me because I was the

3792
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:10,030
one I was the face of that shop they

3793
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:11,260
thought it was all me kind of was but

3794
02:37:10,030 --> 02:37:14,110
yeah we pissed off the town and drop

3795
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:15,909
prices now score a good ounce in this

3796
02:37:14,110 --> 02:37:17,470
town for 200 bucks and people still want

3797
02:37:15,909 --> 02:37:19,209
to find cheaper houses they're out there

3798
02:37:17,469 --> 02:37:22,119
but for the good dank it's a dispensary

3799
02:37:19,209 --> 02:37:24,188
price is usually you know depending on

3800
02:37:22,120 --> 02:37:26,140
where you go it's about 450 an ounce

3801
02:37:24,189 --> 02:37:27,530
right now on the spot I think for a good

3802
02:37:26,139 --> 02:37:29,449
day counts

3803
02:37:27,530 --> 02:37:30,860
they got some good urban poison though I

3804
02:37:29,450 --> 02:37:32,721
would if I had to smoke one that's what

3805
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:34,880
I can go for I mean I've thought about

3806
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:36,409
it one more news article I mentioned the

3807
02:37:34,879 --> 02:37:38,060
part about Seth Rogen we may get to that

3808
02:37:36,409 --> 02:37:39,500
we may not you guys Seth Rogen wanted to

3809
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:41,029
come to Denver into a smoke out for his

3810
02:37:39,500 --> 02:37:42,351
new movie they wouldn't let him smoke

3811
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:44,420
that's kind of the quick version you

3812
02:37:42,351 --> 02:37:46,250
can't smoke in a public place anymore he

3813
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:48,379
had to serve tequila shitty alright so

3814
02:37:46,250 --> 02:37:53,209
this one is cool Department of Justice

3815
02:37:48,379 --> 02:37:54,949
ruling okay we'll try to read that one

3816
02:37:53,209 --> 02:37:56,839
we will since you just said that Indian

3817
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:59,120
tribes can legalize pot on their lands

3818
02:37:56,840 --> 02:38:01,190
in the sub headline if tribes can

3819
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:02,840
balance all the potential social issues

3820
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:05,149
it could be a really huge opportunity

3821
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:06,979
says Seattle attorney Anthony Broadman

3822
02:38:05,149 --> 02:38:09,261
whose firm represents tribal governments

3823
02:38:06,979 --> 02:38:10,850
throughout the West so this article was

3824
02:38:09,261 --> 02:38:13,489
published on December 11th it's written

3825
02:38:10,851 --> 02:38:15,069
by Jeff Bernard and NGO SIA was Nakia

3826
02:38:13,489 --> 02:38:17,659
from The Associated Press

3827
02:38:15,069 --> 02:38:19,129
it says the US Department of Justice

3828
02:38:17,659 --> 02:38:21,021
said Thursday that American Indian

3829
02:38:19,129 --> 02:38:22,579
tribes can grow and sell marijuana on

3830
02:38:21,021 --> 02:38:24,170
their lands as long as they follow the

3831
02:38:22,579 --> 02:38:25,780
same federal conditions laid out for

3832
02:38:24,170 --> 02:38:28,340
states that have legalized the drug

3833
02:38:25,780 --> 02:38:30,079
Oregon US attorney Amanda Marshall said

3834
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:31,729
Thursday the announcement addresses

3835
02:38:30,079 --> 02:38:33,170
questions raised by tribes about how

3836
02:38:31,729 --> 02:38:34,970
legalization of pot in states like

3837
02:38:33,170 --> 02:38:38,181
Oregon Washington and Colorado would

3838
02:38:34,970 --> 02:38:39,619
apply to Indian lands only three tribes

3839
02:38:38,181 --> 02:38:41,329
have expressed interest in growing and

3840
02:38:39,620 --> 02:38:42,829
selling marijuana said Marshall who

3841
02:38:41,329 --> 02:38:44,899
co-chaired a group that developed the

3842
02:38:42,829 --> 02:38:47,120
policy one is in California one in

3843
02:38:44,899 --> 02:38:49,819
Washington and one state in the Midwest

3844
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:51,860
that she did not name that's been the

3845
02:38:49,819 --> 02:38:53,840
primary message tribes are getting to us

3846
02:38:51,860 --> 02:38:56,090
as US attorneys Marshall sent from

3847
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:57,500
Portland what will the u.s. as federal

3848
02:38:56,090 --> 02:38:59,120
partners do to assist tribes and

3849
02:38:57,500 --> 02:39:01,399
protecting our children and families are

3850
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:03,351
tribal businesses our tribal housing how

3851
02:39:01,399 --> 02:39:05,750
you help us combat marijuana abuse in

3852
02:39:03,351 --> 02:39:07,730
Indian country or Indian County when

3853
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:09,229
states are no longer there to partner

3854
02:39:07,729 --> 02:39:11,600
with us

3855
02:39:09,229 --> 02:39:20,449
marijuana abuse do you guys see a lot of

3856
02:39:11,601 --> 02:39:24,261
that over here yeah for grams the sister

3857
02:39:20,450 --> 02:39:26,631
hash I don't need that trash that makes

3858
02:39:24,261 --> 02:39:31,011
me laugh because I'm thinking about what

3859
02:39:26,630 --> 02:39:32,449
conical does get abused I was gonna ask

3860
02:39:31,011 --> 02:39:33,829
you how do you feel about that - you

3861
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:36,079
know since they're allowed to do

3862
02:39:33,829 --> 02:39:37,851
everything that they're you know now

3863
02:39:36,079 --> 02:39:40,851
they're they're making money in

3864
02:39:37,851 --> 02:39:43,431
collecting tax for the state but that

3865
02:39:40,851 --> 02:39:46,011
all that land is tax free like I don't

3866
02:39:43,431 --> 02:39:47,961
I'm with that you know like we've

3867
02:39:46,011 --> 02:39:54,079
[ __ ] stolen the whole West from him

3868
02:39:47,960 --> 02:39:58,939
but but if you're gonna sell it to the

3869
02:39:54,079 --> 02:40:00,470
public as like Indian grown herb you

3870
02:39:58,940 --> 02:40:02,239
should at least pay a tax on the land

3871
02:40:00,470 --> 02:40:04,520
that's it's doing that you know I'm

3872
02:40:02,239 --> 02:40:16,761
saying like you for your plot this

3873
02:40:04,521 --> 02:40:18,079
really approaches that I'm sure that's

3874
02:40:16,761 --> 02:40:20,479
the fight they've been fighting for many

3875
02:40:18,079 --> 02:40:22,181
years is they won't let them have any

3876
02:40:20,479 --> 02:40:24,829
kind of businesses on there that's gonna

3877
02:40:22,181 --> 02:40:26,390
prove profitable you know when they open

3878
02:40:24,829 --> 02:40:29,450
a casino or something like that it's not

3879
02:40:26,390 --> 02:40:31,159
on Indian land it's on you know some

3880
02:40:29,450 --> 02:40:34,221
outskirt land that they've had to buy

3881
02:40:31,159 --> 02:40:36,319
like separately in Palin tax on that's

3882
02:40:34,220 --> 02:40:38,479
that's been one of the large arguments

3883
02:40:36,319 --> 02:40:45,409
that I've I've atleast seen over the

3884
02:40:38,479 --> 02:40:51,789
past couple years I'm giving you credit

3885
02:40:45,409 --> 02:40:55,039
just made a point and maybe 4444 done

3886
02:40:51,790 --> 02:40:56,330
episode 44 hop because it sounds like

3887
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:57,950
we're razzing each other we just started

3888
02:40:56,329 --> 02:40:59,989
cos were bros sorry don't get mad at us

3889
02:40:57,950 --> 02:41:01,761
I'm gonna give a [ __ ] wedgie in a

3890
02:40:59,989 --> 02:41:03,140
minute whoa so hard that you can read

3891
02:41:01,761 --> 02:41:06,069
Haynes on his forehead you ever have

3892
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:06,069
that kind just pull it up

3893
02:41:08,670 --> 02:41:12,579
that's gonna be really weird for you

3894
02:41:11,139 --> 02:41:14,170
ladies and gentlemen this is the episode

3895
02:41:12,579 --> 02:41:16,329
with too much information

3896
02:41:14,170 --> 02:41:17,500
yeah all right I'm gonna try to read

3897
02:41:16,329 --> 02:41:18,870
this article with the throw-up that's in

3898
02:41:17,500 --> 02:41:22,329
my house

3899
02:41:18,870 --> 02:41:23,351
marshal warned warned the announcement

3900
02:41:22,329 --> 02:41:24,729
is not a green light to tribal

3901
02:41:23,351 --> 02:41:26,860
authorities and that marijuana is still

3902
02:41:24,729 --> 02:41:28,689
illegal under federal law the US

3903
02:41:26,860 --> 02:41:30,280
government's prosecution priorities

3904
02:41:28,690 --> 02:41:32,351
involve pot related gang activity

3905
02:41:30,280 --> 02:41:34,659
violence sales to kids and trafficking

3906
02:41:32,351 --> 02:41:36,579
will continue she said problems could

3907
02:41:34,659 --> 02:41:38,351
arise for tribes with lands in states

3908
02:41:36,579 --> 02:41:39,789
that still outlaw marijuana due to the

3909
02:41:38,351 --> 02:41:41,710
likelihood that marijuana could be

3910
02:41:39,790 --> 02:41:43,960
transported or sold outside tribal

3911
02:41:41,709 --> 02:41:45,699
boundaries she added Seattle attorney

3912
02:41:43,959 --> 02:41:47,049
Anthony Broadman whose firm represents

3913
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:48,790
tribal governments throughout the West

3914
02:41:47,049 --> 02:41:50,049
said the announcement represents a

3915
02:41:48,790 --> 02:41:53,620
potential for enormous economic

3916
02:41:50,049 --> 02:41:55,359
developer development tool here yeah if

3917
02:41:53,620 --> 02:41:57,101
tribes can balance all the potential

3918
02:41:55,360 --> 02:41:59,620
social issues it could be a really huge

3919
02:41:57,101 --> 02:42:00,159
opportunity I think they'll be able to

3920
02:41:59,620 --> 02:42:01,811
handle it

3921
02:42:00,159 --> 02:42:03,280
there's want to read this one next

3922
02:42:01,810 --> 02:42:04,629
paragraph in the night we can rant on

3923
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:06,970
the part that's the elephant in the room

3924
02:42:04,629 --> 02:42:08,709
but those social issues are monumental

3925
02:42:06,969 --> 02:42:10,659
Indian tribes have been decimated by

3926
02:42:08,709 --> 02:42:12,489
drug abuse Broadman said tribal

3927
02:42:10,659 --> 02:42:14,829
regulations of pot are going to have to

3928
02:42:12,489 --> 02:42:17,440
dovetail with tribal values making sure

3929
02:42:14,829 --> 02:42:21,459
marijuana isn't a scours like alcohol or

3930
02:42:17,440 --> 02:42:23,500
tobacco I'm gonna sound racist maybe

3931
02:42:21,459 --> 02:42:26,799
generalization we all know that natives

3932
02:42:23,500 --> 02:42:29,170
have trouble with alcohol not all of

3933
02:42:26,799 --> 02:42:33,189
them but the ones that do really [ __ ]

3934
02:42:29,170 --> 02:42:35,680
do alcohols a horrible thing that ruins

3935
02:42:33,190 --> 02:42:38,409
tons of lives not just Native Americans

3936
02:42:35,680 --> 02:42:40,750
the problem is that you concentrate them

3937
02:42:38,409 --> 02:42:42,750
in one area and then you look at them

3938
02:42:40,750 --> 02:42:45,819
from afar and then you notice

3939
02:42:42,750 --> 02:42:59,049
similarities and stereotypes just as in

3940
02:42:45,819 --> 02:43:03,159
any race or okay we've seen that it

3941
02:42:59,049 --> 02:43:05,199
works Washington hasn't blown up yet

3942
02:43:03,159 --> 02:43:06,879
once I try to replace the alcohol abuse

3943
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:08,740
on the reservation with some cannabis

3944
02:43:06,879 --> 02:43:10,179
enjoyment work yeah and maybe they're

3945
02:43:08,739 --> 02:43:11,940
the problems that are associated with

3946
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:14,139
alcohol abuse I've got a whole list of

3947
02:43:11,940 --> 02:43:16,960
podcast planned we could talk about for

3948
02:43:14,139 --> 02:43:19,709
five look at Alaska almost in that same

3949
02:43:16,959 --> 02:43:19,709
way I mean

3950
02:43:23,010 --> 02:43:30,728
like Alaska Utah Arizona New Mexico

3951
02:43:27,459 --> 02:43:33,818
Oklahoma Colorado all those tribes like

3952
02:43:30,728 --> 02:43:36,068
I mean really really bad problems or I

3953
02:43:33,818 --> 02:43:38,318
mean not to sound like a dick but I mean

3954
02:43:36,068 --> 02:43:39,340
I've been around a reservation or two so

3955
02:43:38,318 --> 02:43:42,189
um

3956
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:46,449
but yeah no I just I think could be an

3957
02:43:42,189 --> 02:43:50,800
awesome development thing for sure and

3958
02:43:46,449 --> 02:43:52,479
they're [ __ ] right about these taxes

3959
02:43:50,799 --> 02:43:54,789
the tax part here is this tribe selling

3960
02:43:52,478 --> 02:43:56,108
marijuana may not be subject to state

3961
02:43:54,790 --> 02:43:58,330
and local taxes allowing them to

3962
02:43:56,109 --> 02:44:03,850
undercut off reservation sales also

3963
02:43:58,329 --> 02:44:06,728
maybe not taxes at twenty five percent

3964
02:44:03,850 --> 02:44:07,630
of the price of pot also in Colorado but

3965
02:44:06,728 --> 02:44:10,179
Allison Holcomb

3966
02:44:07,629 --> 02:44:12,278
yes a primary drafter of Washington

3967
02:44:10,180 --> 02:44:13,750
State's legalization measure said most

3968
02:44:12,279 --> 02:44:15,158
people in larger states won't want to

3969
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:16,959
drive to far-flung

3970
02:44:15,158 --> 02:44:19,238
reservations to buy pot you're crazy

3971
02:44:16,959 --> 02:44:20,978
dude imagine that Indian dank weed do

3972
02:44:19,238 --> 02:44:22,658
what was it was it here on the podcast

3973
02:44:20,978 --> 02:44:24,068
that we had this statistic where we got

3974
02:44:22,658 --> 02:44:28,869
thirty million dollars just in

3975
02:44:24,068 --> 02:44:30,908
recreational sales that came from out of

3976
02:44:28,870 --> 02:44:32,199
state and then every time I go in and

3977
02:44:30,908 --> 02:44:35,350
talk to the security guard at any

3978
02:44:32,199 --> 02:44:37,329
dispensary taxes [ __ ] taxes I

3979
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:39,609
guarantee you fifty percent of that was

3980
02:44:37,329 --> 02:44:40,809
Texas I'm gonna go kind of fast cuz

3981
02:44:39,609 --> 02:44:42,640
we're approaching an hour the

3982
02:44:40,809 --> 02:44:44,709
combination I said that wrong

3983
02:44:42,639 --> 02:44:46,510
combination sorry I apologize in

3984
02:44:44,709 --> 02:44:48,099
Washington State recently passed a ban

3985
02:44:46,510 --> 02:44:49,930
on marijuana on the reservation and is

3986
02:44:48,100 --> 02:44:51,640
trying to halt state regulated pot sales

3987
02:44:49,930 --> 02:44:53,529
and grows on lands off the reservation

3988
02:44:51,639 --> 02:44:55,599
where it still holds hunting and fishing

3989
02:44:53,529 --> 02:44:58,079
rights so they don't want you growing

3990
02:44:55,600 --> 02:45:06,040
where they can hunt and fish with

3991
02:44:58,079 --> 02:45:07,930
actually a conflict with that or well

3992
02:45:06,040 --> 02:45:09,340
yeah no no I just don't know if there's

3993
02:45:07,930 --> 02:45:11,279
actually anyone that wants to grow in

3994
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:13,180
their hunting grounds it actually says

3995
02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:14,800
Cooper Valley tribe in Northern

3996
02:45:13,180 --> 02:45:16,720
California has battled illegal pot

3997
02:45:14,799 --> 02:45:18,639
plantations on its reservation where

3998
02:45:16,719 --> 02:45:20,619
they caused environmental issues but you

3999
02:45:18,639 --> 02:45:22,809
know that's illegal at any rate there

4000
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:24,399
are 566 tribes around the country

4001
02:45:22,809 --> 02:45:26,408
recognized I'm gonna go fast and scam

4002
02:45:24,398 --> 02:45:27,670
recognized by federal government there's

4003
02:45:26,408 --> 02:45:28,270
gonna be a lot of consulting happening

4004
02:45:27,670 --> 02:45:30,250
yes for sure

4005
02:45:28,270 --> 02:45:31,870
limited resources in a vast amount of

4006
02:45:30,250 --> 02:45:33,478
territory to cover federal prosecutors

4007
02:45:31,870 --> 02:45:36,539
will not prosecute minor cases

4008
02:45:33,478 --> 02:45:39,059
yay tribal policy is based on the so

4009
02:45:36,539 --> 02:45:40,920
called Cole memo named after the Deputy

4010
02:45:39,059 --> 02:45:42,269
Attorney General who wrote it in which

4011
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:43,799
Justice Department said the federal

4012
02:45:42,270 --> 02:45:45,689
government wouldn't intervene as long as

4013
02:45:43,799 --> 02:45:47,129
legalization states tightly regulate the

4014
02:45:45,689 --> 02:45:48,988
drug and take steps to keep it from

4015
02:45:47,129 --> 02:45:51,929
children criminal cartels and federal

4016
02:45:48,988 --> 02:45:52,889
property in all the memo said US

4017
02:45:51,930 --> 02:45:55,279
Attorney's reserve the right to

4018
02:45:52,889 --> 02:45:57,420
prosecute for eight issues sales to kids

4019
02:45:55,279 --> 02:45:59,998
marijuana proceeds going to criminal

4020
02:45:57,420 --> 02:46:01,799
enterprises shipping marijuana to other

4021
02:45:59,998 --> 02:46:07,109
states where it is illegal guys quit

4022
02:46:01,799 --> 02:46:08,759
doing that [ __ ] violence drug driving

4023
02:46:07,109 --> 02:46:10,710
and other health issues drawing

4024
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:12,630
marijuana on public lands and possession

4025
02:46:10,709 --> 02:46:15,658
of marijuana on federal property

4026
02:46:12,629 --> 02:46:17,278
so hopefully eventually they're gonna

4027
02:46:15,658 --> 02:46:19,709
let the Indians the natives you guys the

4028
02:46:17,279 --> 02:46:21,300
natives will be able to grow on their

4029
02:46:19,709 --> 02:46:23,759
land and maybe have their own Indian

4030
02:46:21,299 --> 02:46:24,978
dispensary I think they grow some date

4031
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:29,699
bro that's what they do

4032
02:46:24,978 --> 02:46:31,590
culturals agricultural the people they

4033
02:46:29,699 --> 02:46:33,779
would have the dank I'm sure there would

4034
02:46:31,590 --> 02:46:35,549
may be ones that would abuse it just

4035
02:46:33,779 --> 02:46:37,289
like anywhere else but for the most part

4036
02:46:35,549 --> 02:46:39,118
I bet they would be real respectful

4037
02:46:37,289 --> 02:46:41,399
about it and I'm saying I mean it's if

4038

Seth Rogen I've got two articles here

4055
02:47:43,250 --> 02:47:46,520
there was an article posted on December

4056
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:48,920
8th and then there's a follow-up article

4057
02:47:46,520 --> 02:47:52,069
posted let me click it to read the next

4058
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:53,360
date this one came out December 9th so

4059
02:47:52,069 --> 02:47:56,000
the night of the 8th must have been the

4060
02:47:53,360 --> 02:47:57,920
event Seth Rogen says he will this is

4061
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:00,020
from Ricardo Baca Baca at the Cannabis

4062
02:47:57,920 --> 02:48:01,760
Seth Rogen says he will screen his new

4063
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:03,350
film Monday night in a Denver movie

4064
02:48:01,760 --> 02:48:05,329
theater filled with marijuana smoke and

4065
02:48:03,350 --> 02:48:07,189
hundreds of his fans but well movie

4066
02:48:05,329 --> 02:48:08,450
theater hotbox actually happened while

4067
02:48:07,189 --> 02:48:10,040
Rogen has said he thinks it should

4068
02:48:08,450 --> 02:48:11,720
happen the City of Denver's executive

4069
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:13,910
director of Marijuana Policy thinks the

4070
02:48:11,719 --> 02:48:18,289
screening should obey Colorado law sans

4071
02:48:13,909 --> 02:48:20,809
- marijuana smoke so he planned on

4072
02:48:18,290 --> 02:48:23,330
debuting his new movie at the oriental

4073
02:48:20,809 --> 02:48:24,799
theater and he tweeted about it actually

4074
02:48:23,329 --> 02:48:27,110
he said we're gonna all get stoned in

4075
02:48:24,799 --> 02:48:28,759
the theater and that was kind of a bad

4076
02:48:27,110 --> 02:48:30,140
idea because that can't really happen

4077
02:48:28,760 --> 02:48:31,790
because of the rules here in Colorado

4078
02:48:30,139 --> 02:48:33,559
they are super strict about that kind of

4079
02:48:31,790 --> 02:48:35,060
[ __ ] so first Rogen started tweeting

4080
02:48:33,559 --> 02:48:36,949
about getting high inside the Colorado

4081
02:48:35,059 --> 02:48:39,709
theater with his fans then the host

4082
02:48:36,950 --> 02:48:41,570
venue the SCI Film Center on East Colfax

4083
02:48:39,709 --> 02:48:43,009
Avenue contacted Sony to tell them the

4084
02:48:41,569 --> 02:48:44,420
audience couldn't line up inside their

4085
02:48:43,010 --> 02:48:46,670
space as it would be against Colorado

4086
02:48:44,420 --> 02:48:48,469
law then Sony told the film center the

4087
02:48:46,670 --> 02:48:50,299
evening was no longer happening the

4088
02:48:48,469 --> 02:48:51,859
Kansas cannabis reported that Rogen

4089
02:48:50,299 --> 02:48:53,389
responded via Twitter that a Colorado

4090
02:48:51,860 --> 02:48:55,159
screening would still happen only at a

4091
02:48:53,389 --> 02:48:57,079
different theater the old video is

4092
02:48:55,159 --> 02:49:00,079
acting lame so we got a new one Rogen

4093
02:48:57,079 --> 02:49:01,430
tweeted so where will Rogen land tonight

4094
02:49:00,079 --> 02:49:04,100
and remember this is from a few nights

4095
02:49:01,430 --> 02:49:06,680
ago the oriental theater owner Scott

4096
02:49:04,100 --> 02:49:07,850
libera who dude we've had some rage and

4097
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:09,380
dab parties in the oriental theater

4098
02:49:07,850 --> 02:49:10,880

4099
02:49:09,379 --> 02:49:13,429

4100
02:49:10,879 --> 02:49:15,739

Genetics YouTube channel of me taking a

4102
02:49:15,739 --> 02:49:21,139
fat dab inside the first dab in there as

4103
02:49:18,709 --> 02:49:23,000
far as I know I started that party up at

4104
02:49:21,139 --> 02:49:25,069
the big old dab

4105
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:26,299
he says tonight's video is private and

4106
02:49:25,069 --> 02:49:28,430
closed to the general public and to

4107
02:49:26,299 --> 02:49:32,179
promoters who regularly both the North

4108
02:49:28,430 --> 02:49:33,920
Denver room for a pot friendly comedy

4109
02:49:32,180 --> 02:49:35,540

4110
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:37,700
scheduled to happen there on Monday

4111
02:49:35,540 --> 02:49:40,310
night so I set the oriental theater

4112
02:49:37,700 --> 02:49:41,870
owner of Denver pot shop Denver relief

4113
02:49:40,309 --> 02:49:43,609
and comedy production group sex pot

4114
02:49:41,870 --> 02:49:44,841
comedy told the Cannabis we

4115
02:49:43,610 --> 02:49:47,391
know if there will be any sort of

4116
02:49:44,841 --> 02:49:49,729
consumption or anything I'm gonna skip a

4117
02:49:47,390 --> 02:49:51,800
couple of things we're gonna scroll

4118
02:49:49,729 --> 02:49:53,180
through so he was planning to come and

4119
02:49:51,800 --> 02:49:54,379
watch this new movie which I still

4120
02:49:53,181 --> 02:49:55,880
haven't read the name of they have not

4121
02:49:54,379 --> 02:49:59,270
advertised the name of his movie in this

4122
02:49:55,879 --> 02:50:03,920
article at all it's an interview I think

4123
02:49:59,271 --> 02:50:05,960
so I don't watch TV so I don't see the

4124
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:07,761
commercial sorry so there's no provision

4125
02:50:05,959 --> 02:50:09,590
in amendment 64 for the on premise

4126
02:50:07,761 --> 02:50:11,239
consumption of marijuana Kilroy said

4127
02:50:09,591 --> 02:50:12,681
that could have been put in a minute

4128
02:50:11,239 --> 02:50:13,729
sixty four but it wasn't so the voters

4129
02:50:12,681 --> 02:50:15,471
did not vote for it

4130
02:50:13,729 --> 02:50:16,970
so Kilroy said the Denver Police

4131
02:50:15,470 --> 02:50:18,859
Department and the city's Department of

4132
02:50:16,970 --> 02:50:20,689
excise and license have historically

4133
02:50:18,860 --> 02:50:22,040
contacted businesses advertising pot

4134
02:50:20,690 --> 02:50:24,110
friendly parties ahead of time to talk

4135
02:50:22,040 --> 02:50:25,851
about potential violations we've

4136
02:50:24,110 --> 02:50:27,230
educated people on what the wise said

4137
02:50:25,851 --> 02:50:29,120
Kilroy and we've gotten compliance

4138
02:50:27,229 --> 02:50:30,829
generally but asked if they were aware

4139
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:32,360
of Rogen's event and without even

4140
02:50:30,829 --> 02:50:32,899
mentioning the oriental as a possible

4141
02:50:32,360 --> 02:50:35,000
location

4142
02:50:32,899 --> 02:50:36,591
gilroys office told the cannabis that

4143
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,909
Denver police would reach out to the

4144
02:50:36,591 --> 02:50:40,310
Oriental theaters owners

4145
02:50:37,909 --> 02:50:42,110
sometime Monday so that was the original

4146
02:50:40,310 --> 02:50:45,739
article he was gonna come he was gonna

4147
02:50:42,110 --> 02:50:48,440
puff right so on the next publishing day

4148
02:50:45,739 --> 02:50:50,869
the ninth Jack brown from the cannabis

4149
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:52,761
said his article High Line no weed

4150
02:50:50,870 --> 02:50:55,610
plenty of tequila at the interview in

4151
02:50:52,761 --> 02:50:57,170
Denver with Seth Rogen so there was one

4152
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:59,141
thing everyone could smell Monday night

4153
02:50:57,170 --> 02:51:02,271
at the Denver screening of the interview

4154
02:50:59,140 --> 02:51:04,959
tequila so that sucks dude they had to

4155
02:51:02,271 --> 02:51:08,239
not puff and they had to serve tequila

4156
02:51:04,959 --> 02:51:09,859
what would happen if we replaced every

4157
02:51:08,239 --> 02:51:11,479
dab we've taken on the podcast and

4158
02:51:09,860 --> 02:51:12,860
before the podcast with a shot of

4159
02:51:11,479 --> 02:51:15,079
tequila how do you think our night would

4160
02:51:12,860 --> 02:51:16,940
have gone I probably pissed myself by

4161
02:51:15,079 --> 02:51:18,409
now and thrown up somewhere because

4162
02:51:16,940 --> 02:51:19,670
that's what tequila makes me do now

4163
02:51:18,409 --> 02:51:23,271
would have been really mad and violent

4164
02:51:19,670 --> 02:51:24,379
right yeah honestly you think you give

4165
02:51:23,271 --> 02:51:27,141

4168
02:51:29,181 --> 02:51:35,149

4169
02:51:33,351 --> 02:51:37,489
you're a [ __ ]

4170
02:51:35,149 --> 02:51:43,940
so this guy with my lady pounds the rest

4171
02:51:37,489 --> 02:51:45,500
of the bottle yeah yeah so the article

4172
02:51:43,940 --> 02:51:46,489
goes on this is when I ran into Rogan on

4173
02:51:45,500 --> 02:51:48,290
the top floor of the theater at

4174
02:51:46,489 --> 02:51:50,690
Northwest Denver he was adamant that the

4175
02:51:48,290 --> 02:51:52,610
show was not how he imagined how he had

4176
02:51:50,690 --> 02:51:54,380
imagined at the December 8th event which

4177
02:51:52,610 --> 02:51:56,989
had been hyped by Rogen on social media

4178
02:51:54,379 --> 02:51:58,339
as a 420 friendly affair the city said

4179
02:51:56,989 --> 02:51:59,719
they shut us down if there was any

4180
02:51:58,340 --> 02:52:01,639
smoking he said with the bottle of

4181
02:51:59,719 --> 02:52:03,039
juarez tequila in hand but I can't

4182
02:52:01,639 --> 02:52:06,409
control what you guys do

4183
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:09,500
says Rogan couldn't maybe but a Rogen

4184
02:52:06,409 --> 02:52:11,810
couldn't but maybe the what's that Kadri

4185
02:52:09,500 --> 02:52:13,670
quatre I've never seen that word the big

4186
02:52:11,810 --> 02:52:15,409
ass group of Secret Service asked

4187
02:52:13,670 --> 02:52:17,090
security personnel definitely enforce

4188
02:52:15,409 --> 02:52:19,399
the Colorado clean indoor air rules

4189
02:52:17,090 --> 02:52:20,870
asking several people in my section to

4190
02:52:19,399 --> 02:52:23,149
leave during the screening for using

4191
02:52:20,870 --> 02:52:25,010
vape pens they're also rumoured to be a

4192
02:52:23,149 --> 02:52:26,510
number of undercover police officers in

4193
02:52:25,010 --> 02:52:28,819
the crowd in case there was any smoking

4194
02:52:26,510 --> 02:52:30,139
taking place as this is the [ __ ] that

4195
02:52:28,819 --> 02:52:35,899
happens in Colorado you think you're

4196
02:52:30,139 --> 02:52:37,609
gonna go somewhere a puff theater places

4197
02:52:35,899 --> 02:52:39,350
it does happen and we keep our mouths

4198
02:52:37,610 --> 02:52:42,650
shut about concern like doing it there

4199
02:52:39,351 --> 02:52:44,000
that's kind of true you don't see

4200
02:52:42,649 --> 02:52:46,369
pictures of people standing around

4201
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:47,780
circles and sidewalks you know like it's

4202
02:52:46,370 --> 02:52:49,579
just not something that we take pictures

4203
02:52:47,780 --> 02:52:51,140
of if you're here and you're cool and we

4204
02:52:49,579 --> 02:52:52,670
know you and stuff we'll grab you and

4205
02:52:51,139 --> 02:52:54,529
take you to a place don't be shy well

4206
02:52:52,670 --> 02:52:57,819
you'll definitely come with us you know

4207
02:52:54,530 --> 02:52:59,780
the cops don't go in the mountains here

4208
02:52:57,819 --> 02:53:02,539
spots we found some really cool

4209
02:52:59,780 --> 02:53:04,311
adventures so as the duo took stage

4210
02:53:02,540 --> 02:53:06,500
Rogen started things off by saying [ __ ]

4211
02:53:04,310 --> 02:53:08,060
the police which elicited big cheers

4212
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:10,069
from the pro-pot crowd audience

4213
02:53:08,060 --> 02:53:12,799
questions ranged from actual threats by

4214
02:53:10,069 --> 02:53:14,119
North Korea over the film because Rogen

4215
02:53:12,799 --> 02:53:16,159
having North Korea threatened nuclear

4216
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:18,500
war is not ideal yet we won't even go

4217
02:53:16,159 --> 02:53:19,940
into that part so Rogen made sure to

4218
02:53:18,500 --> 02:53:21,771
correct a question about smoking bowls

4219
02:53:19,940 --> 02:53:25,159
he said first I smoke joints five to

4220
02:53:21,771 --> 02:53:26,870
seven a day on a night that was light on

4221
02:53:25,159 --> 02:53:29,060
both joints and bowls more were left

4222
02:53:26,870 --> 02:53:31,730
simply handing him various pop products

4223
02:53:29,060 --> 02:53:33,680
for later the state is famously that

4224
02:53:31,729 --> 02:53:36,979
famously legalized it most of the weed

4225
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:39,351
smoking so repetitious so repetitiously

4226
02:53:36,979 --> 02:53:40,909
that's a good [ __ ] words took place

4227
02:53:39,351 --> 02:53:43,370
in a side alley next to the theater

4228
02:53:40,909 --> 02:53:45,021
maybe next year Rogen exclaimed the way

4229
02:53:43,370 --> 02:53:45,960
things are trending with pot consumption

4230
02:53:45,021 --> 02:53:50,460
enforcement

4231
02:53:45,959 --> 02:53:51,719
perhaps next year looks even worse yeah

4232
02:53:50,459 --> 02:53:54,119
they're really cracking down we can't

4233
02:53:51,719 --> 02:53:55,769
puff here in Colorado you have to be in

4234
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:57,450
a private house they want you at home

4235
02:53:55,770 --> 02:53:59,579
smoking your pot it's pretty much the

4236
02:53:57,450 --> 02:54:04,770
only place they want you doing it there

4237
02:53:59,579 --> 02:54:06,299
are a few hotels sorry do our favorite

4238
02:54:04,770 --> 02:54:07,800
hotel that we drive past that we see

4239
02:54:06,299 --> 02:54:09,449
that advertising I don't remember the

4240
02:54:07,799 --> 02:54:11,579
name it's in Manitou Springs it's right

4241
02:54:09,450 --> 02:54:13,170
outside of Manitou as we head back from

4242
02:54:11,579 --> 02:54:15,478
the Mont a factor you see the 420

4243
02:54:13,170 --> 02:54:19,680
friendly sign they've taken down to 420

4244
02:54:15,478 --> 02:54:21,000
friendly part they're probably still 420

4245
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:26,489
friendly but they probably had to just

4246
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:31,620
quit advertising such yeah the micro

4247
02:54:26,489 --> 02:54:32,579
tell Micro tell here employment is over

4248
02:54:31,620 --> 02:54:34,440

4252
02:54:40,559 --> 02:54:47,489

4253
02:54:42,149 --> 02:54:50,219
