smoking you guys just heard me take a

71
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,000
fat dab of double og full-spectrum

72

extract from Green Dot labs again it is

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,530
a blend of legend oh gee and sour double

74
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,980
on the package the flavor is described

75
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,259
as pine sour and lemon when I first hit

76
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,419
it I got that pine straight to the face

77
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,979
well the smoke was in my face while it

78
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,559
was in my lungs and as it came out of my

79
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:22,049
mouth I certainly did taste that sour

80
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,849
it was piney and sour coming out and now

81
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,390
that it's been a couple of seconds my

82
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,949
mouth and the room taste and smell like

83
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:32,488
lemons so I will agree that that is a

84
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:35,310
perfect description pine sour and lemons

85
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,800

86
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,959

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,630

return for this podcast I do this

130
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,099
podcast because I was given a gift

131
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,360
I learned the ability the skills the art

132
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,220
of growing cannabis

133
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,770
very quickly it came to me very

134
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,419
naturally I got plants and they flowered

135
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:07,978
and looked amazing I didn't have any

136
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:09,240
problems in my first run I did have

137
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:10,769
spider mites but we got rid of them

138
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,509
pretty quickly and my very first

139
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:14,279
personal grow I had spider my

140
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:16,199
we got rid of them not a big deal I feel

141
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,169
like I've been very blessed with my

142
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,360
ability to cultivate cannabis on the

143
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,129
level on which I am able to do so I've

144
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,810
been able to do it in personal grows

145
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,790
I've been blessed with large commercial

146
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,589
facilities I'm able to travel to

147
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,900
different states and different locations

148
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,969
and see their cultivation facilities and

149
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:35,489
learn how they do things and also offer

150
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,710
help and opportunities to improve their

151
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,870
facilities so I've been very blessed and

152
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:42,239
I also feel like I am very blessed to

153
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,160
have this gift of communication I feel

154
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,170
like I speak pretty well I feel like I

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,450
speak in a way that a lot of people can

156
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,580
communicate with me I feel like the

157
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,409
dudes and hippies they can talk to me I

158
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:53,849
feel like the young ladies can talk to

159
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,470
me I feel like grandma can talk to me I

160
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,360
feel like the gangsters and whoever else

161
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,340
we can all understand the way that I

162
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,139
speak if you're from the East Coast the

163
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,269
West Coast may be from other countries I

164
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,159
think I speak clearly enough that you

165
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:07,109
can understand what I'm saying so I feel

166
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,630
like I used those two gifts and if I

167
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,730
didn't use those two gifts that I was

168
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,550
given whatever you believe in that

169
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,900
creation gave me these gifts and if I

170
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,910
didn't use it it would be disrespectful

171
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,339
to that creation I feel like I would

172
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,230
explode or something I play the drums I

173
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,209
grow cannabis I do a few other things

174
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,680
with great passion and I feel like if I

175
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,779
didn't share that passion with the world

176
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,910
something would go wrong inside of me

177
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,289
physically and/or mentally like the

178
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,939
rubber bands inside that hold me

179
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,430
together would all just start popping if

180
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,350
I did not do this podcast for you so

181
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,759
that's the long way of saying I do this

182
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,070
because I love you because I love

183
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,110
cannabis and I want you to grow the best

184
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,870

185
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,939
obligated to contribute to my podcast or

us can do a lot of things physically

202
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,079
some of us can do a lot of things

203
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,939
spiritually we're all blessed in certain

204
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,769
ways don't feel like you need to share a

205
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,469
blessing with me if it would put you out

206
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,539
in

207
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:31,180
way at all listen to the show for free

209
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,110
great way to show me love and respect

210
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,240

211
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,680

212

217
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,460
telling people and then the show will

218
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:50,199
grow and then more people can grow

219
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,210
better cannabis and there will be better

220
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,640
cannabis for medical patients

221
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,470
recreational patients for everybody to

222
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,899
smoke throughout the country throughout

223
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,490
the world then the price of cannabis

224
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,019
will go down we'll all be growing the

225
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,820
best but on the planet it'll be good

226
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,710
weed everywhere nobody will be sick

227
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,510
everybody will be in a good mood that's

228
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,400
the biggest payment that I could ask for

229
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:11,169

235
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,350
before I read it I want to read a

236
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,240
message from one of my patreon

237
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,360
supporters somebody who I've developed a

238
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,190
friendship with this guy says hey I'm

239
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,990
sorry for the delay and my patreon

240
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,470
renewal I had to wait for a replacement

241
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,060
card and then I got hit by a car so I

242
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,430
was out of commission for a few days

243
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:41,588
there's more to this message but dude

244
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:43,689
you got hit by a car please don't

245
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,670
apologize to me for anything I hope

246
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,980
you're okay if there is anything that

247
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,750
myself or the Irie army or any of the

248
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,060
grow from your heart crew can do for you

249
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,519
you let me know man reach out to me

250
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:57,489
you've got a crushed foot a bruised knee

251
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,379
a pinched nerve in your neck some [ __ ]

252
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,299
up disks sounds like you've got a lot

253
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:03,460
going on a minute says my question is

254
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:05,919
what strain will heal my crush and

255
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:09,250
fractured foot faster and what's good

256
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,439
for overall toes to head pain and relief

257
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,440
I don't know what will help heal your

258
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,360
crush and fractured foot I'd say stay

259
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,830
off of it that is probably the best

260
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,389
thing for that don't put any weight and

261
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,770
pressure on it I'm not the doctor I'm

262
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,679
sure the doc said that plenty of times

263
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:25,480
if it hurts don't do it the part where I

264
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,819
can be helpful is where you ask about a

265
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,129
strain which would be good for pain from

266
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,170
toes to head because you are seeking

267
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,080
relief because everything hurts right

268
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:36,639
now there are a couple of options you

269
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,000
can smoke something that will make your

270
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,889
body go numb and you won't hurt for

271
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,778
or you can also smoke something that

272
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,759
gets you so high you forget that your

273
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:48,028
body hurts those are two great ways that

274
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:50,610
cannabis works the only downside I have

275
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:52,528
experienced to using cannabis for pain

276
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,629
relief in a situation like this is

277
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:56,669
sometimes if you break something or pull

278
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:58,649
something or mess your body up real good

279
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:00,719
in one specific spot or you've got a lot

280
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:02,909
of bruising and a lot of blood flow when

281
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,430
you smoke it may elevate your heart rate

282
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:08,159
it may increase your blood flow which

283
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:11,099
sometimes makes the painful spot throb a

284
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:13,019
little bit extra that may be strain

285
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,259
dependent that is definitely going to be

286
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,850
injury and body and all kinds of

287
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,939
different things dependent there are so

288
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:23,190
many factors here so you may get nice

289
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,680
and baked and wherever you hurt this

290
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,350
foot your discs your neck your back your

291
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,458
neck and your back they may hurt more

292
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,680
than they do now

293
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,719
it may get warm it may get red it may

294
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,078
start throbbing there is just an

295
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,329
increased blood flow to that area now I

296
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,698
don't know if that is going to help heal

297
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:43,469
that area or not by having more blood

298
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:45,240
there you would think maybe by having

299
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,100
more blood move around maybe it would

300
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,778
help it heal also you could think by

301
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,329
having more blood move around in a

302
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:54,439
bruised area it could make it worse

303
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:57,629
again I have zero medical professional

304
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,600
qualifications zero not a doctor so my

305
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:04,198
advice would be to find a really strong

306
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,879
sativa dominant strain smoke that see

307
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:07,919
how that works for you something like a

308
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,990
double dragon or a lemon Jeffrey

309
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,179
something in that real high sativa area

310
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,278
then I would find something more indica

311
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:17,039
dominant something like the Hellfire o G

312
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,809
or the liberation o G then smoke a fat

313
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,789
bowl of that first thing in the morning

314
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:22,739
try that as your first smoke of the day

315
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:24,208
and see how that works for you make sure

316
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,860
that's the first one you've smoked so

317
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,448
you start off nice and fresh your

318
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,190
palates nice and clean your mind and

319
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:31,109
your body are still clear and sore and

320
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,690
you can see what kind of effect each

321
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,190
strain have on your body then you've

322
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,959
done an indica dominant you've done a

323
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,269
sativa dominant let's work our way

324
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,909
towards something more hybrid like maybe

325
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:43,440
try some morning dew smoke a fat bowl of

326
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:46,049
morning dew first thing the next morning

327
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,300
and see what that does for you one of

328
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:49,828
those is going to make you throw up one

329
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,539
of those is gonna make you feel better

330
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:52,459
and one of those you probably won't even

331
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:54,589
notice

332
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,900
then if none of those provide the relief

333
00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:00,080
and comfort you were looking for that's

334
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:02,149
where we turn to CBD you may go to CBD

335
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,129
first I'm not sure which route you want

336
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,870
to take I think I know you from our

337
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:08,210
conversations I'm pretty sure you want

338
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,970
to try these th sea routes first but the

339
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,550
CBD never hurts to try when you do get

340
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,110
your CBD make sure it is from a reliable

341
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:17,329
source I've given that speech enough

342
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,580
times don't buy your CBD from the gas

343
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,160
station don't buy some [ __ ] get a

344
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:25,250
quality CBD product spend as much time

345
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,439
energy effort and money on your CBD as

346
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,330
you do your cannabis and you should have

347
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,740
positive results I guess that's not

348
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,540
accurate money doesn't always mean

349
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,220
quality but do the work put in the

350
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:37,099
effort and you should find a quality

351
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,529
product but again I would recommend find

352
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,870
an indica find a sativa and find a

353
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:44,120
hybrid and smoke on those and see which

354
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,399
one gives you the relief one may make it

355
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,560
throb if you get a nice sativa you may

356
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,059
get so stoned that you forgot your back

357
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,799
even hurts that is one of the magical

358
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:54,409
wonders of cannabis it makes you forget

359
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,329
stuff if you get a nice indica it may

360
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:59,149
make you so relaxed that nothing hurts

361
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:01,490
also both of those have the opportunity

362
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:03,409
to really enhance the pain you may get

363
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,360
so stoned that all you can think about

364
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,069
is that [ __ ] leg and that foot and

365
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,050
your neck your back your neck and your

366
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,879
back that may be the only thing you can

367
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,709
focus on so those are the best

368
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,539
recommendations I can make because it is

369
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,120
going to be strained specific body type

370
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:19,399
specific it is all going to be up to

371
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,529
your body and the flowers that you find

372
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,269
and that is one of my favorite parts

373
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,610
about cannabis also one of the most

374
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,439
frustrating parts about cannabis you

375
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,000
already know that cannabis is going to

376
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,620
help but we have to kind of dial it in

377
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,539
like do you want a sativa do you need an

378
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,039
end because there's a specific Terp or a

379
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,230
specific cannabinoid that helps with

380
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,750
your condition I love that we can go

381
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,940
sour selves since you can't you cannot

382
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,889
die from consuming cannabis you can

383
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,780
smoke as much as you need to to find

384
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:46,789
relief and you can find that level and

385
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:48,500
then it's okay to go a little bit past

386
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:50,059
that level to put yourself in that state

387
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,830
where you almost panic and you feel a

388
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:54,049
little bit of discomfort and then you

389
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,600
know that's what happens when I go this

390
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:58,519
far maybe I take three puffs off this

391
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,290
joint and my neck doesn't hurt maybe I

392
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,569
take four puffs off this joint my neck

393
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:04,519
feels really good that fifth puff I

394
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,360
start getting a little bit giggly by

395
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,980
number six oh [ __ ] I need

396
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,419
call a friend for help you got to learn

397
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,278
how to do that and learn how to get

398
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,899
there but once you learn how to dial in

399
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,059
that medicine you really know how to

400
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,159
take care of yourself with your medicine

401
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:19,289
you know exactly how often to hit that

402
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:22,289
bowl how hard to hit it how many puffs

403
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:24,088
to take I know about every this often I

404
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,708
need about this big of a dad to keep my

405
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,750
body in my mind right where I want them

406
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,879
I think it's about an hour at every hour

407
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,159
so I want a pretty decent-sized chunky

408
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,778
dab and it's just ideal I don't if I

409
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,360
don't get my dab every hour I'm gonna

410
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:38,009
survive but in an ideal world if I just

411
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,350
could whip out the rig and pull a fat

412
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:41,639
dab every hour I'd take a decent dab I

413
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,259
think it's come down to about every

414
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,269
three or four hours because of stupid

415
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,338
reality and stuff but you know we

416
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:48,690
understand how to dose ourselves we

417
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,579
don't have to get a bottle that says

418
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,410
every six hours take one of these pills

419
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:53,699
now you go to the dispensary and you get

420
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,199
as much as you need and when it's time

421
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,420
to take your medicine you take it if

422
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,579
your budget allows unfortunately sorry

423
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:00,990
some folks aren't able to do that and if

424
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:02,159
you're not in a medical state is that's

425
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,299
not an option but that is one of the

426
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,708
great things about cannabis you're not

427
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,109
gonna die from it and you get to learn

428
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:09,239
your dosage you can find your I always

429
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,889
say that my first dab is medical the

430
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,350
first step makes all the back pain go

431
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:15,750
away it makes my brain unscramble the

432
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:18,240
second dab that might be it might be

433
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,860
heavily medicated myself that third dab

434
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,089
that's recreational we're just having

435
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,199
fun with the third one now I'm just

436
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:23,430
hanging out with Mike trying to talk

437
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,969
some [ __ ] trying to ramble into a

438
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:26,309
microphone

439
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,190

will be here when you're better keep

451
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,490
listening to the show and get some good

452
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,899
flowers and just smoke on it bro and if

453
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,579
the flowers don't get you nice and

454
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,528
medicated maybe it's time to move up to

455
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:00,239
dabs and if dabs aren't available in

456
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:02,639
your area that's when we start playing

457
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,679
with edibles if you're eating edibles I

458
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,599
think you're an experienced cannabis

459
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,540
consumer but I'm gonna say this one time

460
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,000
go lightly and then work your way up you

461
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:13,859
cannot uh need those edibles once the

462
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,119
milligrams are in you all you can do is

463
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,269
ride that [ __ ] out

464
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,219
so start lightly maybe ten milligrams if

465
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:21,808
you're a bigger dude maybe twenty

466
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,400
punch it down wait for some relief

467
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:26,338
you're either gonna feel it or not in

468
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,500
about 45 to an hour and 15 decide from

469
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,509
there do I need more or not maybe smoke

470
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,919
a bowl at that point if you smoke a bowl

471
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:33,210
and have that edible in you they're

472
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,890
gonna blend in together they're gonna

473
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,509
kick each other off you may get the

474
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,220
relief you need you're just gonna have

475
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:39,690
to experiment with what's available I

476
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,860
don't know if you've got a dispensary

477
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,320
around you I don't know if you're an

478
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,759
illegal or a medical state but I'm sure

479
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,740
you're a grown-ass man and you can

480
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,150
figure out how to get the medicine that

481
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,620
you need hopefully you've got a good

482
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,570
friend who's got your back while you're

483
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:52,949
on one foot and while your neck your

484
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:55,408

535
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,539
I don't per se have a question about

536
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,700
growing but my question is what got you

537
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,920
into growing that is a very good

538
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,110
question it goes on to say what pitfalls

539
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,539
did you have upon your grow career and

540
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:53,879
what did you use as motivation to keep

541
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:56,009
pushing forward when life didn't go as

542
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,260
you planned and then last but not least

543
00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:00,299
I'm going to become a patreon supporter

544
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:02,490
within the week and I'm curious what you

545
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:05,039
recommend from your line very dense

546
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,140
nighttime potent as a high calyx to leaf

547
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,450
ratio height isn't an issue much love

548
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,360
and respect from my brother from another

549
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,430
mother but we share the same holy flower

550
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,719

566
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:55,649
question I didn't just plant that in

567
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:59,160
there let's get to the main part of this

568
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:01,680
email here my question is what got you

569
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,560
into growing that's a really good spot

570
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,650
to start what got me into growing I have

571
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,569
been around cannabis for as long as I

572
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,180
can remember when I was a little kid I

573
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:14,669
can remember my uncles and my family

574
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,500
members just smoking a joint at a family

575
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,360
gathering if there was a party if there

576
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,940
was an event if I went somewhere with my

577
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,799
uncle rest in peace to my uncle Eric but

578
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,930
he would always be the one it made that

579
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,519
face to everybody you know when your

580
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,110
stoner friends just look across the room

581
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,789
and you make the big eyes or you shrug

582
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:31,229
your shoulders and that means I think

583
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,269
it's time to burn one dude do you agree

584
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,829
with me and of course everybody [ __ ]

585
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:36,869
agrees because when my uncle Eric made

586
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:38,609
that face everybody knew it is time to

587
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:41,219
go smoke a [ __ ] joint so I've been

588
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:43,649
around ganja or cannabis or weed in some

589
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,909
way shape or form as long as I can

590
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:49,729
remember I can remember about fur

591
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:52,039
grade approximately that on the back

592
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:53,778
patio of our little house maybe a little

593
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:57,348
apartment that we had one of those

594
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:59,179
little wooden planter boxes and one of

595
00:21:57,348 --> 00:22:01,548
my uncle's was teaching somebody who

596
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:04,099
lived at my house how to grow weed in

597
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:05,778
those little planter boxes and I'm

598
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:07,460
pretty sure this was first grade I had

599
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:09,440
to be about seven years old because I

600
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,700
remember the building in which we lived

601
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,739
at the time I could see the backyard

602
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,840
very well I remember the neighbors and

603
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:16,909
know the time so it's about first grade

604
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:18,408
so I was about seven years old and my

605
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:20,028
uncle and somebody else are teaching

606
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:23,059
each other how to grow weed and my

607
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:24,829
little back patio there and later on in

608
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:27,739
the day somebody was telling somebody

609
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:30,048
what to do and I had to chime in and say

610
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:32,058
no you're telling them wrong I remember

611
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,778
what Eric said Eric said to do it like

612
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:35,028
this

613
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:37,009
so everybody looked at me like oh [ __ ]

614
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:38,989
little man's been paying attention he

615
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:41,419
kind of caught on he might know what to

616
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:43,038
do and I always loved this smell of weed

617
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:44,450
I was just a little kid but I loved it

618
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,548
and I knew that when everybody hung out

619
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,019
and smoked weed it was always chill but

620
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:49,608
I knew that when people drank I could

621
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:51,919
see at a young age than when people

622
00:22:49,608 --> 00:22:53,178
drank my family got [ __ ] silly and

623
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,499
out of control when they would drink but

624
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:56,749
when they would smoke they'd all just

625
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:59,118
chill out and it was a much better vibe

626
00:22:56,749 --> 00:23:01,009
so as I got older I started watching

627
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:03,199
everybody else around me smoke and then

628
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:04,819
one day my buddy Chris was like you want

629
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,109
to hit this and I was like yes and I

630
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,908
just acted like I'd been doing it for a

631
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:09,048
million years and I took a hit off of

632
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:11,599
his pipe and I was like that's why

633
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:13,489
everybody does this like this is it was

634
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,658
time for this [ __ ] to happen and I'm

635
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:17,028
pretty sure that I'd been getting a

636
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,679
contact buzz just being around my uncles

637
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,148
being in their cars being in their

638
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,710
little dad a little you know all the

639
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,868
stoner dudes have that one room or they

640
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,190
smoke and they just let me hang out in

641
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:26,808
the room because I was a cool little kid

642
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,210
and they wanted me to be like them and I

643
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:31,700
[ __ ] em now but that's where I learned

644
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,409
it so eventually one day my buddy Chris

645
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,989
is like smoke this with me and I smoked

646
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:38,659
and I loved smoking at that point but

647
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:40,098
shortly after that I moved to Colorado I

648
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:42,289
was just a kid so I had to move to

649
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:43,519
Colorado my family moved here started

650
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:45,048
kind of a they started a new business

651
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,479
here I went to a new school I had to

652
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:49,579
establish all new friends here and I

653
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:52,460
moved to Colorado in the middle of the

654
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:55,189
winter and it was snowy and miserable

655
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,869
and all I got to do was meet my neighbor

656
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,820
across the street who took me to school

657
00:23:56,868 --> 00:24:00,439
and all I did was go to school every day

658
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:02,599
and then come home and then do my home

659
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,190
and go back to school because it was so

660
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,049
cold and shitty when I moved here and I

661
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,970
hated it because I did not know what how

662
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:10,399
to dress or how to survive in this cold

663
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,410
and I also didn't know where to get any

664
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,450
weed and my neighbors in my neighborhood

665
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,009
definitely were not little smokers or

666
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,740
stoners or weed heads they were

667
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:21,079
definitely more square folks eventually

668
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,910
I turned them into stoners but I did not

669
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:24,019
know where to get weed at the time but

670
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,880
I'd been watching the kids at school

671
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:27,319
paying attention to who like might look

672
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,940
like their stone or might smell like

673
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:30,710
their stone or whatever it might smell

674
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,330
like they got some weed on him started

675
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,490
paying attention and then I joined a

676
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:36,559
band and then one day we went camping

677
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,809
and that was when everybody was like hey

678
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,190
are you cool and I was like [ __ ] I'm the

679
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:41,929
coolest [ __ ] you know and I'm

680
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,309
like we thought so and they all busted

681
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,890
out their weed maybe a few other things

682
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:48,710
and I smoked down and I missed it I

683
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:50,930
missed it so much so I started buying a

684
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,490
lot of weed around here I found the

685
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,350
people you could buy the herb from and

686
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:57,980
unfortunately they weren't the most

687
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:59,599
reliable responsible friendly honest

688
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,190
people sometimes your bag would not

689
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,689
weigh even [ __ ] close to what it was

690
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:06,080
supposed to weigh but sometimes it would

691
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:08,120
and then I started uh maybe buying so

692
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,439
they wouldn't sell to some people and

693
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:10,819
some of my friends were afraid to

694
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,200
approach some of these people because of

695
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:14,659
their appearance but I'm from California

696
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,130
and those guys have the good weed the

697
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,630
guys that were my friends were afraid of

698
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,830
I know that they got the good weed so I

699
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,480
just hit him up I was like I know I'm

700
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:22,369
from California bro you guys always had

701
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,539
the good weed in California ah you guys

702
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:24,859
got the good weed out here too and

703
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:26,329
they're like we got the good weed ese

704
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:28,699
and I was like I want to buy a lot of it

705
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:30,470
and so first they sold me a quarter and

706
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,640
then I bought a lot of quarters and so

707
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,230
they are like you need to buy an ounce

708
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,910
so I started buying a lot of ounces and

709
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,140
all my friends were getting weed from me

710
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,690
because they wouldn't mess with those

711
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,370
guys so like that's not our crew and so

712
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,870
I was like I'm not worried about those

713
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:43,189
guys I'd go buy they're from them and

714
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:45,139
then sell to all the hippies and then go

715
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,720
back to them and eventually as doing

716
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,730
larger quantities so by this point I am

717
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,289
deeply immersed in the cannabis game and

718
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,549
the statute of limitations has got to be

719
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:54,529
gone for all this cuz I'm on a good

720
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:56,509
ramble totally incriminating myself here

721
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:58,579
I just got deeply immersed into the

722
00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:01,150
cannabis industry the cannabis game the

723
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:03,589
business then through my music

724
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,110
connections and being in a band I ended

725
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:09,139
up moving to another state deeper into

726
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:10,729
the Midwest from Colorado I was a choice

727
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,810
that I made to be in this band and it

728
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,880
was a really good decision

729
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,679
one day while in this

730
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,040
location I was at a friend's house and

731
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,440
my eyes were hit by this really familiar

732
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,750
light spectrum I went whoa what what is

733
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,059
that and went oh he's got a grow light

734
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,039
up there and at this point I had had a

735
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:30,109
little bit of experience helping other

736
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,539
people run gardens but I'd never ran a

737
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:33,979
garden by myself I'd been around it

738
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:35,839
since I was a kid so whenever I saw

739
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,309
plants I was just enthusiastic and my

740
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,230
friends would always want to show off

741
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,879
and show me their grows so I'd been in

742
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,410
several grows and been around it and I'd

743
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,780
done a few little chores and things but

744
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:47,330
I'd never really been super hands-on and

745
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:49,099
so at the end of the evening I let

746
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:51,500
everybody leave and I politely told my

747
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:53,599
buddy I go hey your metal-halide light

748
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,069
hit me right in the face when I was

749
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,230
doing this part of the day and he goes

750
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:59,179
oh [ __ ] so you saw my lights and I go

751
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,950
yet no worries he goes no dude if you

752
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,779
saw the lights maybe you can help me and

753
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:06,140
he took me into his grow space and he

754
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:08,119
had a problem and I was quickly able to

755
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,620
diagnose that problem I think it was

756
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:11,389
from being around the plants when I was

757
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:13,250
a little kid with my family I think I

758
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,990
learned how to identify that problem

759
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,329
from then and it stuck in my head is

760
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,950
like a seven and eight year old kid so

761
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:20,480
we corrected my buddy's problem and he's

762
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,130
like hey I've got to go out of town for

763
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,630
a couple of days next week

764
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,400
kind of a surprise mission didn't know I

765
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,200
had to go I need somebody to take care

766
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,970
of these plants can you do it and as

767
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,039
like I got you bro so he leaves town I

768
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,610
took care of his plants they came out

769
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,529
amazing

770
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:35,629
stellar he had to stay gone longer than

771
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:37,220
anticipated and when the dude came back

772
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,780
he was really anxious to get to his

773
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,160
plants this was before we had all this

774
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:41,720
internet stuff where I could just send

775
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,100
you a picture with my phone every day

776
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,450
and I don't think we would have been

777
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:46,159
comfortable doing that because of our

778
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:49,250
location and because of the time frame

779
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,690
but he came home and he was amazed he's

780
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,650
like bro my plants have never looked

781
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,509
this good before

782
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,250
and he told me he'd give me a little bit

783
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:57,769
of the crop for helping him he gave me a

784
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:59,240
nice portion of that crop for helping

785
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:00,680
him and then I showed him how to trim

786
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,269
even better because I'd been a trimmer

787
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,890
was one I think we all start off as

788
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:05,059
trimmers you start trimming and then you

789
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,710
earn the respect he showed that you

790
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,569
could do it but I've been trimming a lot

791
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,180
by then so I showed him how to trim real

792
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:13,970
nicely so I was proud of myself at that

793
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,710
point then we will fast forward several

794
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,809
years because this story is getting long

795
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,730
I found some friends who were trying to

796
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:22,099
open a dispensary in my neighborhood

797
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,349
they had a lot of great ideas they were

798
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:26,329
older folks so they were missing a

799
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:27,569
younger hipper element that could

800
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,949
actually hit this

801
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:30,929
and put the word on the street that

802
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,700
there was a dispensary out and maybe I

803
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,920
could put some younger hipper vibes into

804
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,049
the dispensary so I started going to

805
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,400
this place and it was just an office

806
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,109
where you would go in and he would

807
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,519
consult with the weird guy and he would

808
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:44,309
recommend product and you would leave

809
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,740
this man quickly realized that I knew

810
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:48,809
more about cannabis than him so he asked

811
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,849
me to transplant plants with him the

812
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:52,559
next day and I didn't realize that that

813
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:54,839
was basically my application for

814
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,629
becoming an employee with his dispensary

815
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:00,179
he hired me to be the first budtender

816
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:02,280
then he hired me to be a helper in the

817
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,080
garden then I told him one day that we

818
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:06,089
could improve the grow by doing a few

819
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,460
things and he kind of laughed at me and

820
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:10,319
I said no it would work so he threw some

821
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,539
plants at me and told me go home and

822
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,639
show me so I went to the store about a

823
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:17,519
very small setup and I built a very

824
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,680
small grow in my house and then I grew

825
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,240
product that was better than his product

826
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,180
and he had been growing for quite a few

827
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,039
years I loved those plants I loved being

828
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,230
around the plants I love being near the

829
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:30,329
plants and then I got to take that

830
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,009
product to the dispensary and people

831
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:34,470
would come into the store and they would

832
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:35,849
buy the flowers that I grew and they

833
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,710
would take it home and they would smoke

834
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:39,480
it and they would come back two or three

835
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,910
maybe a week later and they would tell

836
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,069
me man I smoked that stuff that you grew

837
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:46,019
and whatever pain was in my foot or in

838
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:48,509
my back or in my neck or my neck and my

839
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:50,220
back that pain went away and the first

840
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:52,259
time I met these people they would look

841
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,450
sad and in pain like their life wasn't

842
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:56,819
as good as it could be and then I drew a

843
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,950
product that they smoked it and they

844
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:59,460
felt better they could put their cane

845
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:02,039
away

846
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,380
I had a friend leave without his cane he

847
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:06,809
showed up with his cane and we medicated

848
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,150
him so heavily he got up and walked away

849
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:11,039
and had to come back and laugh I forgot

850
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,290
my cane dude and he didn't realize how

851
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,789
profound that was like you left your

852
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:16,559
cane here because of cannabis you were

853
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:18,509
able to stand up and walk away and

854
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,399
giggle and he'd been a grouchy old

855
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:22,470
[ __ ] for several years he's gone now

856
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,210
love you bro rest in peace but it's

857
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,339
funny as [ __ ] that that old man forgot

858
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,840
his cane and giggled about it because he

859
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:30,509
was a crotchety old dude and we smoked

860
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,129
him into oblivion and he smiled and he

861
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:33,779
forgot that life sucked for him for a

862
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,510
few minutes he was able to enjoy himself

863
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:38,160
he put away all that [ __ ] he forgot

864
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:39,839
about his car wreck he forgot about his

865
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,990
divorce he forgot about his pain and

866
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,178
suffering and he in

867
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,250
life and that happened because of a

868
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:47,920
product that I took some time to nurture

869
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,259
and grow and that nurturing of that

870
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,390
plant nurtured me I feel better for it

871
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:54,190
it's some focus it slows my brain down

872
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,530
it makes me forget about whatever is

873
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:58,539
hurting me whatever is paining me so

874
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:00,339
then I grow that and then I get to smoke

875
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:02,470
it with my friend and I get to watch him

876
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:04,569
feel better then imagine how many people

877
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,789
I have smoked with I was a grower I was

878
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:08,970
a budtender I had the only dispensary

879
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:11,529
here in my city for like two years

880
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,990
imagine how many people's lives I got to

881
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:16,329
touch I got to make their quality of

882
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,519
life better by growing a quality product

883
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:20,319
and also by spending a moment with them

884
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,750
not as a but as a good bud tender then

885
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,240
you didn't just here's an eight I want

886
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,890
fifty bucks it was how are you like as

887
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,440
soon as you walk into my bud room how

888
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:31,270
are you are you okay are you like I knew

889
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,679
my people by first names I knew about

890
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:34,869
their families I knew why they were

891
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:36,730
smoking so I could ask you know how's

892
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:38,500
that foot has that broken foot feeling

893
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,360
any better is that sciatica healing up

894
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,380
and remember what I sold you last time

895
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,479
did it work for you

896
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,070
here and this was really cool back that

897
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,390
back then in the dispensary we could

898
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,490
smoke in there so I would oftentimes

899
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:50,230
have a bowl or a joint so it's a hey

900
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,609
this is the new [ __ ] take a puff off of

901
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,558
this and they'd smoke it and you could

902
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:56,199
immediately watch their pain or their

903
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:58,178
anxiety just melt away a little bit so

904
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,860
that was I'm rambling a lot because I

905
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:01,690
have a lot of passion for this but I

906
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:04,419
guess that is the bottom line of why I

907
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:06,308
got into this and why I started growing

908
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,170
I was buying product from dispensaries

909
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:10,240
and buying products and it wasn't up to

910
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:13,420
par I didn't like it I knew I could do

911
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,339
better and then the owner and grower at

912
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,840
this dispensary challenged me he said if

913
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:18,939
you think you can do it as good as me go

914
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,459
ahead and do it I knew that if I took my

915
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,080
passion and my education and some books

916
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,509
and some time and energy that I could

917
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:27,549
create an amazing product and I did that

918
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:30,670
and I have never looked back I've looked

919
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:33,250
at improving my garden my grow knowledge

920
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:35,320
my grow skills every single day what I'm

921
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,240
able to share on here is minimal I know

922
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,250
a lot of stuff but I just have to be

923
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,929
able to put it into a show so I learned

924
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,119
something every day don't think that I

925
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:45,640
have ever stopped learning that's when

926
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,979
you burnout that's when you fail so that

927
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,419
is what got me into growing I started

928
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,130
growing because of the demand for

929
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,870
cannabis I didn't like paying for it I

930
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,840
didn't like the quality and then I was

931
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:56,759
challenged somebody said you can't do

932
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,439
as good as me and when you say that to

933
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,509
me I kind of have to show you that yes I

934
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,160
can especially when it came to anything

935
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:04,289
involved in cannabis because I was a

936
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,480
giant weed nerd I thought I was a weed

937
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:07,409
expert and so I had to just grow the

938
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,049
best weed ever

939
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:12,000
and then I saw the results I saw little

940
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:14,519
old ladies not feel like [ __ ]

941
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,039
I saw athletes with broken knees able to

942
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,720
do athletic [ __ ] again I saw guys with

943
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,579
mental conditions they can't form a

944
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,069
complete sense able to calm down and

945
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:24,869
have a conversation and actually achieve

946
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:26,789
a relationship and have friends and

947
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:29,189
girlfriends so I've seen a lot of great

948
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:30,420
results from cannabis that's what got me

949
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,519
into it and that is what kept me there

950
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,140
in one word bro the answer to that is

951
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,480
passion I'm sorry it took me 20 minutes

952
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,370
to get to that point so now there is

953
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,769
more to this question what pitfalls did

954
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:42,719
you have upon your grow career and what

955
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:45,359
did you use as motivation to keep

956
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,289
pushing forward when life didn't go as

957
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,349
you planned

958
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:51,839
I do life will never go as planned it

959
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:53,969
will go kind of the way it should you

960
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,220
can kind of foresee the future and try

961
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:58,230
to hope and prepare for the best but but

962
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,390
life will never go as planned and

963
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,430
accepting that and being able to flow

964
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:05,070
with that is one of the biggest

965
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:06,690
challenges and obstacles to overcome but

966
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:09,360
once you've accepted the fact that you

967
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:11,130
have zero control over this life you

968
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,570
don't have any control over tomorrow you

969
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,670
don't have any control over the other

970
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,800
people all you can really control is

971
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:19,019
what you do and what you put out and how

972
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,420
you react and respond to things once you

973
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:24,000
accept that and understand that it is so

974
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:26,760
much easier to just relax and enjoy life

975
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,610
so there have been a lot of pitfalls as

976
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,340
a cannabis grower we've always had to

977
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:34,680
worry about legalities pitfalls I have

978
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,840
driven up to houses that may allegedly

979
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,629
have had nine to twelve lights in that

980
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,820
house and possibly somewhere between 75

981
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:43,769
to 100 plants and I may have seen a

982
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,480
bunch of red and blue lights in front of

983
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:47,429
that house and you just keep going like

984
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,650
you don't know that house even existed

985
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:52,649
you just drive right past it what did I

986
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:55,050
lose there 9 to 12 lights bulbs ballast

987
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:57,690
hoods [ __ ] nutrients equipment

988
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:59,610
measuring equipment and also however

989
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:02,010
many [ __ ] plants were in the room and

990
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:03,720
that house is gone it's not in my name

991
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,310
it's in somebody else's name all the

992
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:07,049
utilities are in the homeowners name

993
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:08,059
it's just a rental but you just keep on

994
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,920
driving alleged

995
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:11,299
you don't even stop so that house is

996
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,730
gone that is one of the pitfalls and

997
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,620
being a cannabis grower also it messes

998
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,690
with relationships because when cannabis

999
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,609
was not legal to grow you had to have

1000
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,590
alibis and stories of why you've always

1001
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:23,390
got to go home every 12 hours and water

1002
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,840
some [ __ ] plants you got to have an

1003
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,549
alibi

1004
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,590
of why nobody can come to your house

1005
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,630
because it smells like a giant skunk and

1006
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,640
diesel fuel factory you've got to have

1007
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,170
alibis why nobody can use their restroom

1008
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:35,900
because that's where there are no filter

1009
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:38,510
and all the water equipment is it's the

1010
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,889
being a grower can mess up relationships

1011
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,540
you have to have an alibi of why you

1012
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,889
can't hang out with anybody for like two

1013
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,599
weeks because you're trying to trim a

1014
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:46,069
crop and you can't have anybody help you

1015
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,869
because nobody knows about it

1016
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,340
you just got to disappear and trim all

1017
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:50,869
this [ __ ] and get it dried and cured you

1018
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,780
can't ignore it because it's wet weed

1019
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:56,359
and that stuff messes up your mind your

1020
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,890
relationships your scheduling it kind of

1021
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,180
gives you a little bit of paranoia it'll

1022
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,670
make you a little bit weird in your head

1023
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:03,649
so that's one of the major pitfalls also

1024
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,090
you've got the risks of getting raided

1025
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,980
and all that sort of [ __ ] in the back of

1026
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:09,710
your mind at all times that's a pitfall

1027
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,480
so there are things like that been a

1028
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,099
major pitfall I talked about that

1029
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,809
dispensary that I had with a bunch of

1030
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:17,420
friends Mike was my assistant budtender

1031
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:19,369
I was basically the manager and [ __ ]

1032
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,809
I ran that [ __ ] and then one day the

1033
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:22,699
city came in and they said hey guess

1034
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:25,309
what you can't do this anymore

1035
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:26,809
we had established a very functional

1036
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:29,659
business with standard operating

1037
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,949
procedures and flows and employees and

1038
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:32,690
we had a lot of things happening the

1039
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:35,119
community was relying on us to supply

1040
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,780
medicine I was relying on that place for

1041
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,519
a paycheck

1042
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:40,070
we were doing a lot of things together

1043
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:42,409
and then suddenly one day it was gone so

1044
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,780
that was a major pitfall everybody had

1045
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:47,690
to reestablish themselves after being

1046
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,519
the major force of one dispensary no

1047
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,500
other dispensary would hire me because I

1048
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,210
was already attached to one place I had

1049
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,159
a reputation they all thought I was

1050
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,599
coming to sabotage them or do something

1051
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:59,210
wrong when honestly I just needed

1052
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,829
employment so I had to reestablish Andry

1053
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,099
figure out my life and figure out my

1054
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:05,179
position and I have no complaints or no

1055
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:06,710
problems with that because I really

1056
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:08,569
think that that helped me grow it helped

1057
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,980
me move on I think being stuck at that

1058
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:11,690
one dispensary being in that one

1059
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,880
position I would have been in that one

1060
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,320
position forever I would have just ran

1061
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,210
that place and I would still be there

1062
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,130
doing the same old thing I think that

1063
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,720
change encourages growth so I'm glad

1064
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,800
that that happened in a way but that was

1065
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:23,809
a major pitfall

1066
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,190
I didn't have my place of employment I

1067
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:27,799
didn't have my place for a community

1068
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:29,269
that wasn't only where I sold cannabis

1069
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,250
where I worked that was where I saw

1070
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:33,559
people I got to see the medical

1071
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,239
marijuana community we had such a nice

1072
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:37,699
community here that a member of our

1073
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:39,619
medical marijuana community got in big

1074
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:42,230
trouble and had to go to court and as

1075
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:44,210
show support we had about 30 to 50

1076
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:46,280
members of our medical marijuana

1077
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,920
community show up at his court case

1078
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,870
every single day to go show support for

1079
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,789
this man and they were all people that

1080
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:54,949
came to our dispensary that had all

1081
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:56,480
developed a relationship as friends so

1082
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:58,609
that was what we were doing for the

1083
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,469
community I missed that that was gone

1084
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,930
I had to reinvent that around here we

1085
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:04,639
had to reestablish so we have had a lot

1086
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:06,799
of great pitfalls in the cannabis

1087
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,889
industry so those are a couple of great

1088
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,200
examples of pitfalls I have had timers

1089
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:14,569
fail I have had equipment fail that

1090
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,849
always happens then here's my favorite

1091
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:19,340
part it says what do you use as

1092
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:21,139
motivation to keep pushing forward when

1093
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:25,010
life didn't go as planned

1094
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:27,679
sometimes it wasn't always easy to be as

1095
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,710
positive and to stay motivated as it has

1096
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:32,599
become but now I'm a grown man I'm 40

1097
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,360
years old I've got 40 years worth of

1098
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,860
experience to look back and say hey

1099
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,329
shit's been worse than this you've had

1100
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,190
worse struggles than this you've had

1101
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:42,619
bigger problems than this and if you

1102
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,960
haven't you at least have more skills

1103
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:46,670
and tools to understand how to deal with

1104
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,440
the [ __ ] that's coming at you so I just

1105
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,450
think that I try to stay positive by

1106
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,679
knowing I've been through this and if I

1107
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:53,359
haven't been through this when I get

1108
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,519
through the other side of whatever the

1109
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,769
struggle is I'm going to have a lot more

1110
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,079
skills I'm going to know how to solve

1111
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:02,030
that problem for next time I just think

1112
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,230
that basically what doesn't kill me

1113
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,330
makes me stronger

1114
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:07,219
and if you don't keep learning every day

1115
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:09,139
what are you doing and if you don't keep

1116
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:11,269
moving every day all you're going to do

1117
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:13,879
is collect dust and nobody needs to sit

1118
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:16,579
there and get dusty so I just use every

1119
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,550
day as motivation every mistake is

1120
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:21,980
motivation I have killed so many plants

1121
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:24,170
some on purpose some on accident but

1122
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:26,869
every plant that I killed I made sure to

1123
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:29,030
learn why I killed it how I killed it

1124
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:31,909
and how not to do that dumb [ __ ] again

1125
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,950
so I think every mistake every pitfall

1126
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:35,480
instead of using it as all I made a

1127
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:37,250
mistake I use it as a whoop

1128
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,409
probably shouldn't do that again and I

1129
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,000
try to laugh at a mistake sometimes that

1130
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:42,828
can be frustrating to some people you

1131
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,298
just laughed at a major mistake yeah

1132
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:45,798
what do you want me to do flip the table

1133
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,389
over and kick some [ __ ] or would you

1134
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:49,969
rather me laugh and go look how bad I

1135
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:52,818
[ __ ] a bad up like we've got a really

1136
00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:56,179
serious opportunity in life every day -

1137
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:58,219
laughs - smile - love or you can kick

1138
00:39:56,179 --> 00:40:00,169
some [ __ ] you can be angry you could be

1139
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:02,358
mad at some [ __ ] it's all a decision

1140
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,680
just choose the right one and we all

1141
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,869
know what to choose and if you're on a

1142
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,000
bad channel change the channel so at

1143
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:09,798
this point in life what motivates me and

1144
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,289
what keeps me going when life doesn't go

1145
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:15,588
my way is knowing that life is never

1146
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:17,239
going to go your way there are millions

1147
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:18,798
of people on this planet I didn't Google

1148
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:20,629
to find out how many there are so

1149
00:40:18,798 --> 00:40:23,358
[ __ ] many people on this planet and

1150
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:25,910
how can we expect it to go all of their

1151
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,440
way none of us want the same [ __ ] maybe

1152
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:28,639
a little bit we all want peace we all

1153
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,440
want to get laid we all want to eat some

1154
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,000
food but maybe we all want to get laid

1155
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,470
by the same person and that just creates

1156
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,530
a problem right there so how can we all

1157
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:38,149
get our own way how can we be so selfish

1158
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,280
to expect that the world is going to go

1159
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,500
our way we can set ourselves up for

1160
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,150
success in small ways we can make our

1161
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,969
bubble function the way we need it to

1162
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:49,220
but just realizing and believing that I

1163
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:51,169
can't control anything but me and

1164
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:54,230
sometimes I don't even have full control

1165
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:56,420
over that that makes it so easy to just

1166
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:58,608
get over dumb [ __ ] and realize that most

1167
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,440
of it is dumb [ __ ] yes I have had some

1168
00:40:58,608 --> 00:41:03,739
struggles this year I had I lost an

1169
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,780
uncle who was very close to me but I am

1170
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:08,118
still here and I can't just let that

1171
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,130
kill me as well I've got to push on I've

1172
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:12,048
got to make him proud I've got to make

1173
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,608
myself proud I've got a lot of stuff to

1174
00:41:12,048 --> 00:41:14,838
do trust me I miss my uncle and I love

1175
00:41:13,608 --> 00:41:16,639
him I wish he was still here I wish we

1176
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:18,440
could [ __ ] smoke a joint and go see a

1177
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,239
concert together but what can I do

1178
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,010
I've just got to live on I've got to be

1179
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,989
stronger from that and now guess what

1180
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:25,579
when if anybody else in my life passes

1181
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:27,199
I'm a little bit stronger and I've got a

1182
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:29,390
little bit more skill to deal with

1183
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,399
losing somebody that I love so just keep

1184
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:33,469
learning get stronger every single
