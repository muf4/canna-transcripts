00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:05,469
slightly dabbed out it's been a

27
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,658
beautiful day last night was an amazing

28
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:10,688
night I got to see the legendary reggae

29
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:13,030
band Israel vibration in Denver at the

30
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:15,099
Ogden Theatre I've talked about it

31
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,599
before the roots radix was there the

32
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:18,908
roots radix is of course the backing

33
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:21,280
band for Israel vibration they were

34
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,930
solid Israel vibration was solid and on

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,650
fire

36
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,630
unfortunately I feel like it's probably

37
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,490
getting close to the end for that band

38
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:30,099
this might be one of their final tours

39
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:31,899
um just a little rant about Israel

40
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:34,118
vibration Israel vibration is a Jamaican

41
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,150
reggae band that actually met in an

42
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,409
orphanage for children with polio so

43
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,909
there were three members of Israel

44
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:41,680
vibration all three of them had polio

45
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,920
several years ago one member left the

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,140
band and now they're only two dudes left

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,820
um it is my opinion that one dude looks

48
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,200
like he has done touring the look on his

49
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:52,658
face during the show just looks like

50
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,920
he's struggling ah the polio was getting

51
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,270
to him it's kicking his ass the other

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,460
guy looks like he's doing pretty good he

53
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:59,289
gets around quite well the one guy looks

54
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,368
like he made that he I don't think he

55
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,719
wants to tour anymore it looks like the

56
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:03,250
other dudes dragging him out on tour

57
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:05,019
he's like you can't be Israel vibration

58
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,430
without both of us so I need you to come

59
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:08,409
with them that's kind of what it looks

60
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,849
like to me so I may actually catch his

61
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:11,229
real vibration again tonight just kind

62
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:12,310

one episode let's get into some business

188
00:05:56,218 --> 00:06:02,158
here on the last episode we talked about

189
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:03,689
some more issues with pesticides and a

190
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:06,389
dispensary so I'm pulling up the article

191
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:08,639
right now this article comes from the

192
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:11,668
cannabis this one of course is written

193
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,379
by David McCoy oh sorry David mcgowa and

194
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:15,389
Ricardo Ibaka I tried to make that all

195
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:17,218
into one name they're from the Denver

196
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,168
Post and of course the cannabis the

197
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:20,699
headline says nature's cure of Denver

198
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:22,589
recalls pot products containing

199
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,569
pesticides now let's get right into the

200
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,129
article it says a second marijuana

201
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,259
business in Denver in just over a week

202
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:30,209
has voluntarily recalled its products

203
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,180
because they contain a pesticide not

204
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:34,560
allowed for use on cannabis Denver

205
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,629
health officials announced the recall by

206
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,728
nature's cure which also is known as

207
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,439
Colfax pot shop Wednesday after tests

208
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:42,909
found high levels of a pesticide that

209
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,160
cannot be legally legally used to

210
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,780
the crop the recall extends to all of

211
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,250
the company's plant material as well as

212
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:50,409

218
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:04,000
at Colfax pot shop after inspectors

219
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,439
found pesticides in cannabis the shop

220
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,240
had grown and sent to a facility for

221
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,709
processing into various forms of

222
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,480
marijuana infused products that facility

223
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:15,609
Mahama has also been the source of its

224

225
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,879

227
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,569

228
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:24,579

back your money they may give you a

258
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:36,429
store credit for a product but whatever

259
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,469
you do do it you do not want to smoke

260
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,848
this pesticide

261
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:41,349
alright consumers are urged to destroy

262
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,599
the product or return it to the place of

263
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,129
purchase is what the article says it is

264
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,960
the second business this month to issue

265
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:48,580
a recall of its marijuana over concerns

266
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,680
that potentially dangerous pesticides

267
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,600
were used to cultivate the plants the

268
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:54,939
other true cannabis issued a recall on

269
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,379
October 13th after test determined three

270
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,450
disallowed pesticides

271
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:01,210
to grow plants that were later processed

272
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,000
into marijuana infused products or mi

273
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,379
peas as with Colfax pot shop plants

274
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,940
grown by true cannabis and sent to

275
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,529
mahatma for processing were found to

276
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,270
contain the pesticides health officials

277
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:11,829
said there have been no reports of

278
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,169
illness associated with any of these

279
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,300
recalls you guys in my opinion it's

280
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:18,849
gonna take a long time for health

281
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:20,889
effects to be noticeable from smoking a

282
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,870
pesticide like this I am NOT a doctor

283
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,189
I'm not a scientist but these are the

284
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,139
kinds of things that you smoked them

285
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,060
today and you don't notice it until

286
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:29,590
you're twenty years down the road and

287
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,750
you've got some [ __ ] up tumor in your

288
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,250
lung you've got some weird cancer you've

289
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,679
got something in your mouth that grew

290
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,899
from this pesticide that you smoked some

291
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,250
of these things will not affect you some

292
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:41,110
of these things will go into your body

293
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,580
and affect your body in really crazy

294
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,330
ways and they will affect future

295
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,910
generations of your family so be aware

296
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,530
of what your can consuming you guys and

297
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:52,209
I don't think that people are going to

298
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:54,039
start reporting these illnesses for a

299
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,060
very long time maybe somebody did smoke

300
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,559
something with a little too much

301
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:58,750
pesticide on it they got sick right away

302
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,859
but that's very uncommon these plants

303
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,830
have been through the drying and curing

304
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,750
phase they've been trimmed you can't see

305
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,700
smell or feel this [ __ ] on there it's

306
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,590
got to be lab tested to find it I'll

307
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,180
continue with the article MIPS often

308
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,129
contain much higher concentrations of

309
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:13,629
pesticides than dried plants process for

310
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:15,759
smoking because of the method used to

311
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:18,399
extract THC and other cannabinoids from

312
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,590
the plan also pesticide levels dissipate

313
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,169
quickly in dried marijuana while amounts

314
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,090
found in MIPS typically do not and he

315
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:28,059
says that is extremely accurate when you

316
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:30,070
make hash if you take a bud a plant that

317
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:32,469
has been sprayed with pesticides and you

318
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,230
make hash with it sometimes we can see

319
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,210
the pesticide floating on the top of the

320
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,620
hash we can see a little sheen sometimes

321
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,389
we can see this little greasy layer

322
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,190
sometimes we'll make a batch of hash and

323
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,929
let it finish and then you can touch the

324
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,570
top of it and you can feel on your

325
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:50,049
fingers a little oily layer of neem oil

326
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,520
or style it oil or whatever type of oily

327
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,799
product was applied to the plants

328
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,809
botanical oils sometimes you can see

329
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:57,219
that floating on top of the hatch and we

330
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:58,599
don't there's it's hard to get out of

331
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,830
there you guys it's gonna make your hash

332
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,379
taste like that you're gonna be

333
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,000
consuming it stop spraying your plants

334
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:05,559
with [ __ ] that's I think the point

335
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,730
here anyway I will continue with the

336
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,989
article because I feel like I've gotten

337
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,970
myself off-track

338
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,289
the recalls of fourth announced by the

339
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,879
Denver Department of Environmental

340
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:16,089
Health since it began cracking down on

341
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:18,379
pesticides last spring quarantine a

342
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,269
100,000 plants the worries about

343
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,860
pesticides and marijuana are the result

344
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:24,199
of federal laws that deemed the drug

345
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,700
illegal and as a result safety tests

346
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,920
have not been done on the chemicals when

347
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,590
soup isn't specifically ingested on

348
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,449
marijuana marijuana can be classed as

349
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,580
either food or a drug because of various

350
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,070
ways it can be consumed federal law

351
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,540
deems it a drug state agriculture

352
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,010
officials have proposed a rule that

353
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:42,079
would limit the number of pesticides

354
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:44,059
allowed for use in growing marijuana to

355
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,129
about seventy five of the least harmful

356
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:48,139
the rule would allow manufacturers of

357
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:49,759
pesticides among the improved products

358
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,309
to petition the government to let

359
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,899
marijuana growers use its chemical the

360
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:56,059
company would have to first approve the

361
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,750
pesticide is safe to humans and the

362
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:58,909
environment

363
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,769
currently growers can use more than 200

364
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:02,779
pesticides the state says has warning

365
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:04,819
labels so broad they using the product

366
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:06,980
on cannabis would not violate federal

367
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,530
laws that require chemicals to be used

368
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,180
only as directed you guys when you open

369
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,139
up any pesticide there's that little or

370
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,969
when you buy the bottle there's that

371
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:15,620
little booklet attached to the back all

372
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,000
you have to do is pop that open and

373
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,340
unfolds and there are a bunch of rules

374
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,200
and regulations in there it tells you

375
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,759
how you can apply that pesticide it says

376
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,070
what it can be used for it says what

377
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:28,429
type of crops it can be used on it has

378
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:30,470
got a window of re-entry listed on there

379
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:32,389
it will say if you spray this product do

380
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,490
not re-enter this room for up to four

381
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:36,259
hours or if you do enter the room be in

382
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,539
proper equipment use a ventilator use

383
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:40,580
some type of covering there will be a

384
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:42,949
lot of things written on there if you do

385
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,650
not use that pesticide the way that that

386
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:48,710
direction label says to use it you are

387
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:51,289
in violation of federal law if a farmer

388
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,330
in an agricultural business is caught

389
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:55,490
using those pesticides improperly he

390
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,790
will be fine he will face a federal law

391
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,680
his farm will face penalties this is

392
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:02,149
serious stuff I did not realize how

393
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,620
important this wasn't how serious this

394
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,779
was until I had a little bit of training

395
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,700
from the Colorado Colorado Department of

396
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,799
Agriculture so you guys pay attention to

397
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,780
those warnings in a serious [ __ ] you may

398
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,039
not notice how much risk you are putting

399
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:14,959
yourself in when you're using these

400
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,789
pesticides I recommend that you go and

401
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,320
read about each pesticide that you're

402
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:19,730
using read about each ingredient in

403
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,650
there find out what it's derived from

404
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,730
find out what it's going to do to you in

405
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:24,559
small concentration

406
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,120
find out what it's going to do to you in

407
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,519
large concentrations find out what

408
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,289
you're exposing yourself to read about

409
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,509
what you're putting on your medicine

410
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:34,579
you're spraying people's it may be

411
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:35,779
recreational marijuana it may be medical

412
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,340
marijuana either way

413
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,539
find out what you're spurring on the

414
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,340
stuff that you're giving to the people

415
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:41,750
that you care about if you're taking

416
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,700
money for a product if you're giving

417
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,259
this product is a medical treatment you

418
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,700
need to take pride in it it is your

419
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,649
responsibility to make sure that no

420
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,480
[ __ ] goes into your customers or

421
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,399
your patients your clients whatever you

422
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,139
want to call them their lungs and bodies

423
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,939
should be treated like a temple and it's

424
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:58,309
your responsibility that their cannabis

425
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,110
is clean and safe so that's your job as

426
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:01,849
a grower so read about all the

427
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,649
pesticides I'm gonna continue and read

428
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,600
the last line of the article it says

429
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,340
despite the allowance state officials

430
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,080
have said they do not endorse the use of

431
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,610
pesticides on marijuana because there is

432
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:15,050
no data to ensure consumers are safe uh

433
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,000
it would be nice if we did not have to

434
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:19,419
use any pesticides at all on growing

435
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,799
cannabis but it is very unrealistic

436
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:23,929
there are pests everywhere we were

437
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,849
building a new facility our grow

438
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,679
facility is it's basically the desert

439
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,670
it's a rocky desert it is in Pueblo West

440
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,919
Colorado outside of the facility there

441
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:36,409
are lizards there are snakes there are

442
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:39,349
tarantulas there are spiders there are

443
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,879
centipedes and we have built this

444
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,040
facility from the ground up it's a

445
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,559
sealed facility and still occasionally I

446
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,629
will have to escort a baby tarantula out

447
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:49,879
of the building or chase down a lizard

448
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:52,309
out of the building it's hard to keep

449
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,830
[ __ ] out of buildings insects are much

450
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:57,259
smaller than these tarantula the pot

451
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,730
pests are much smaller than tarantulas

452
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:00,679
and lizards so keeping them out of there

453
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,879
well sometimes require some sort of a

454
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:03,559
pesticide of course we're gonna finish

455
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,669
the building and make well seal it up a

456
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:06,559
little bit better but I mean it's hard

457
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:08,360
to keep [ __ ] out as my point so we need

458
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,189
some type of pesticide we need some type

459
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,409
of prevention we need some type of

460
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,120
integrated pest management system that

461
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:15,949
will keep the bugs away and a lot of

462
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,929
times that requires some sort of a

463
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,520
bottled pesticide if you're gonna use it

464
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:21,019
you guys be responsible go to the

465
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,579
Department of Agriculture read about

466
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:24,710
what you're using and learn what you are

467
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,330
applying to your plants because I'm

468
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,550

some snap and peel can I almost shatter

478
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,990
it snaps a little more than it shatters

479
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:49,099

elected a new prime minister who seems

507
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:46,159
to be on our side you guys this article

508
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:48,289
comes from vice news it was written by

509
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,000
Rachel Brown the headline says Trudeau

510
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:52,459
held the best thing that's ever happened

511
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,799
to Canadian weed and the article goes

512
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,879
like this

513
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:57,229
Justin Trudeau hasn't even been

514
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:59,629
officially sworn in as Prime Minister

515
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,430
yet but as far as marijuana advocates

516
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:04,730
are concerned his promise to fully

517
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:06,440
legalize it as sorry his promise to

518
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,960
fully legalize it is as good as

519
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,910
fulfilled Potts legal wrote Marc Emery

520
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,710
Canada's so-called Prince of pot the day

521
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,290
after Trudeau and his Liberal Party won

522
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:16,700
the federal election by a landslide one

523
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:18,649
of mr. Trudeau's official declaration

524
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,830
should be the war against cannabis

525
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,390
culture in Canada is over by securing a

526
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,069
majority government the Liberals are

527
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,950
poised to move quickly on their pledge

528
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,960
to legalize regulate and restrict and

529
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,299
restrict access to marijuana for

530
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,000
recreational use which Trudeau has built

531
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:37,519
as a top priority though the incoming

532
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,859
Prime Minister has yet to specify what

533
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,569
exactly let legalizations would look

534
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:43,129
like and it could take years for it to

535
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:45,109
come to fruition things are already

536
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,430

00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:41,158
pretty sure I was reading an article now

559
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,808
let's find where I was where was I

560
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,280
the morning after the election stocks

561
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:46,319
soared for three of the country's top

562
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,538
medical marijuana producers some

563
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,428
cannabis companies Canobie Canada began

564
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:52,140
trading publicly last year after Health

565
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,700
Canada started issuing licenses to

566
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,559
companies for the country's estimated

567
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,288
forty thousand registered medical

568
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,970
cannabis users one study suggests there

569
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:02,548
are two point three million marijuana

570
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,569
users in Canada that's an oddly worded

571
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:05,908
statement there at the end of that

572
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:07,798
paragraph the current medical marijuana

573
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:11,190
industry is believed to be worth between

574
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:12,990
80 and 100 million dollars it's believed

575
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,570
to be one of the best regulatory systems

576
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,099
in the world and is highly regulated

577
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:19,399
Erin Saul's an analyst with Dundee

578
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:21,869
Capital Markets told the Financial Post

579
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,169
that it could balloon to five billion

580
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:26,158
dollars if the market is fully legalized

581
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:27,929
it feels like they're missing a couple

582
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:29,700
short words here like those and hands

583
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:31,350
and some spots that's weird anyway the

584
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,690
Canadian marijuana space could be set

585
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:35,908
for another revolution salt said Bruce

586
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,880
Linton CEO of tweed the largest of

587
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:40,530
Canada's 26 licensed cannabis producers

588
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,659
told vice news in a previous interview

589
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:45,000
that the medical marijuana industry can

590
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:47,280
only benefit under a new legal regime as

591
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,769
it will likely facilitate the production

592
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,470
for recreational marijuana similarly to

593
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:54,389
the way things unfolded in Colorado I

594
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,279
would think that for licensed producers

595
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,780
which are large regulated and under

596
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,269
controlled shipping and accounting

597
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,039
procedures what which are large

598
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:03,410
regulated and under controlled shipping

599
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,940
and accounting procedures would be

600
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,890
first choice for delivery because that's

601
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,960
the first methodology to gain control of

602
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,220
the supply chain said Layton those

603
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,440

604

606
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,899
without licenses from Health Canada are

607
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,300
looking forward to a fully legalized

608
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,370
industry earlier this year Health Canada

609
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:24,470
threatened to send some RC its Royal

610

Smitherman Ontario's former Health

Minister analysts have suggested that a

642
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,140
fully legalized marijuana industry could

643
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,450
attract investors from the alcohol and

644
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,740
tobacco industries last month addiction

Canadian Medical Association Journal

647
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,380
urging whichever party forms government

648
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:38,960
to move away from cannabis prohibition

649
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,430
but also retain control over the supply

650
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,340
and sale of recreational marijuana

651
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:45,080
should it become legalized a frequently

652
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:46,759
cited be concern with legalization is

653
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,159
that it will allow the rise of big

654
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:51,309
cannabis similar to big tobacco and big

655

alcohol these powerful multinational

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,170
little consideration of the impact on

659
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,340
public health the article states you

660
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,560
guys that's something that we kind of

661
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:06,049
overlooked here when we started writing

662
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:08,809
all of our marijuana laws in Colorado in

663
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:11,690
California we kind of forgot that big

664
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,429
cannabis would take over and I see it

665
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,330
happening that's what's happening here

666
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,920
in Colorado if you don't have there

667
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:19,419
tons of shops here that were mom-and-pop

668
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,310
shops guys like myself with some

669
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,170
dreadlocks and some growing skills but

670
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:24,970
grow our hearts out open up a shop and

671
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,279
get [ __ ] going but then all of the new

672
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,140
regulations have pushed people in that

673
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,759
realm out because it is so expensive to

674
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,259
open up a shop it's so expensive to

675
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:33,940
afford all of the security it's so

676
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:37,150
expensive to pay for all the licensing

677
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,920
then only rich dudes that don't know

678
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,300
anything about cannabis can own

679
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,100
dispensaries now that is not a hundred

680
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:43,450
percent troop that is a lot of what I

681
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:45,159
saw happen there are a lot of people

682
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,840
that held on a lot of people that

683
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,600
persevered and made it in the industry

684
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:51,250
but very few of them survived big shout

685
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,439
out to Scott reach for making it that

686
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,970
dude made it from the beginning killing

687
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,340
it because if you want to be a cannabis

688
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,019
entrepreneur find out who Scott reaches

689
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:01,059
and read about that dude learn how that

690
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:02,829
dude did it and you'll realize that you

691
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,480
can do whatever the hell you want I'm

692
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:05,919
gonna continue with the article in

693
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,599
August you know said his new government

694
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,009
would look into pardoning Canadians

695
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,409
serving time in prison for marijuana

696
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:13,269
related crimes after he repeals the laws

697
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:16,420
in the Criminal Code this dude's gonna

698
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:18,190
go and release Canadian serving time in

699
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,110
prison for marijuana related crimes

700
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,250
their new prime minister is awesome you

701
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:22,599
guys could you imagine if we got a

702
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,009
president like this in America

703
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,329
I mean it's highly unlikely but could

704
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:27,339
you imagine if that should happen it

705
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:30,220
would be so amazing if our president

706
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:32,049
actually if our government actually

707
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,539
governed us in a way that we found

708
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:35,710
favourable instead of governing us in a

709
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,440
way that we all feel like we're getting

710
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,880
ripped the [ __ ] off and it's only

711
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,650
benefiting one percent of our nation

712
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,510
it'd be amazing if they actually felt

713
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,830
some compassion for us right there's one

714
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:46,750
more paragraph in this article you guys

715
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:48,639
I will continue there has been many

716
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,519
situations over history when laws come

717
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,950
in that overturn laws come in that

718
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,629
overturned previous convictions he said

719
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,759
at a campaign stop in Vancouver and

720
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,610
there will be a process for that that we

721
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,839
will set up in a responsible way you

722
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:03,069
guys also make sure you follow the lady

723
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,049
that wrote this article or isn't it her

724
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:07,839
name is Rachel Brown she's on Twitter at

725
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:12,039
Rp underscore Brown brown with an e at

726
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:13,750
the end so Canada has basically

727
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:15,940
legalized cannabis this new Prime

728
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,779
Minister Trudeau Justin Trudeau I hope

729
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,910
I'm saying that right

730
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:20,829
well Justin Trudeau says that when he

731
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,720
gets into office he's gonna do what he

732
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:24,609
can to make cannabis legal you know I

733
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,860
heard him say I didn't hear him he said

734
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:29,439
in an article that I read there was an

735
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:30,719
18 months of him taking office he would

736
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,240
legalize cannabis

737
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,610
um I did some looking I did some thinkin

738
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,819
18 months after this dude takes office

739
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:45,329

741
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:49,829
Canada will have legalized cannabis if I

742
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,210
