main topics in the cannabis community

66
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,118

complications to heart

78
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,759

house look a little bit better

171
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,800
totally acceptable home owner activity

172
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,719
it's nothing weird nothing odd

173
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
but i noticed it because i am a

174
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
cultivator

175
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,839
and i thought there's probably bugs in

176
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,279
those bushes i wonder where all of the

177
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,599
bugs are going to go

178
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,679
so that prompted me to step up my

179
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,120
pesticide regimen i mixed up a pump

180
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,079
spray or a one gallon it looks like a

181
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
deck sprayer

182
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,519
uh it's made for spraying your deck with

183
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,280
like bleach or finish or something

184
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,799
i mixed up that one gallon sprayer with

185
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,038
some pesticides that

186
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,478
i'm certified by the colorado department

187
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,000
of agriculture let me talk about this

188
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,079
for one moment

189
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,439
i have been certified by the colorado

190
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,758
department of agriculture and the

191
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,399
colorado state university

192
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,400
to be a train the pesticide train the

193
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,439
trainer certified so that means i can go

194
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,120
to your

195
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,038
commercial grow facility whether it's

196
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,000
cannabis or tomatoes or whatever your

197
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,399
farm is

198
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,519
and i can teach your lead cultivator to

199
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,839
train your staff

200
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,519
about proper pesticide application and

201
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,359
handling and safety

202
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,639
so i understand pesticides quite a bit i

203
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,319
understand what i should and should not

204
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,439
be using where and where i should not be

205
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,959
using it

206
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,560
safety protocols i understand what i'm

207
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,839
doing so when i talk about pesticides i

208
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,038
don't think i'm willing nearly with

209
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,000
anything

210
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,519
i am a little bit ocd a little bit crazy

211
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,800
about pesticide

212
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,639
safety and all that [ __ ] because i've

213
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,520
been trained and i feel like i should be

214
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,400
um kind of a role model and also when

215
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,159
you're me

216
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,519
the white guy with dreadlocks grown weed

217
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,439
people look for flaws

218
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,198
so my pesticide regimen has to be on

219
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,680
lock has to be safe has to be approved

220
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,199
by

221
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,478
the department of agriculture i got to

222
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,759
keep my [ __ ] together when it comes to

223
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,318
that because people want to find

224
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,080
reasons to pick at you so i did mix up

225
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,600
an approved pesticide

226
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,079
that you can spray outdoors of your

227
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,639
residential area just a very light basic

228
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,478
uh

229
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,680
from the [ __ ] store down the street

230
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,879
just from the hardware store it's not

231
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,560
gonna hurt anything

232
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,879
uh but it will get rid of the bugs that

233
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,360
may come from those plants so i did a

234
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,959
little

235
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
uh a perimeter spray i've been trying to

236
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,918
think of the word perimeter for the past

237
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,359
minute before it was time to say that

238
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,198
i did a nice perimeter spray i just

239
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
mixed up a pump sprayer and walked

240
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,439
around the house and just gave it a nice

241
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
spray

242
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,639
right at the base where the house meets

243
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,638
the the dirt or whatever just right

244
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,918
where the corner is there just

245
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,400
give it a little spray just a little

246
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,680
dale gribble a little uh little rusty

247
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,000
shackle for it if you will went around

248
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,079
the whole

249
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
house and just gave it a little blast

250
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,120
and then i mixed up a different

251
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,800
pesticide for the plants inside

252
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,399
and i gave them a little blast i went a

253
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
little bit harder than i normally would

254
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,679
have usually i spray

255
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,120
on a monday and then on thursday and

256
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,478
then i'll skip a monday and spray on

257
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
thursday and monday and then skip the

258
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,120
thursday

259
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,318
do two sprays monday and thursday but i

260
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,240
skip a day

261
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,240
uh so i don't do too many spray

262
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
applications every monday and thursday

263
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,800
but i

264
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,079
skip after two i skip the third one i

265
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,360
hope that makes sense the way i set it

266
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,279
so anyway

267
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,800
i sprayed outside because where are all

268
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,239
of those bugs going to go my neighbors

269
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,680
cut down their shrubbery

270
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,360
there's got to be some kind of bugs in

271
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,038
there whether it's beetles or

272
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,199
some kind of thrips or so i don't know

273
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,598
what could be in their aphids probably

274
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,360
those are common around here outdoors so

275
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,439
i could have gotten some aphids on me

276
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,479
in my grow wherever i didn't want that

277
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,240
to happen so

278
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,598
i put a little pesticides in the air to

279
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,519
make sure that that [ __ ] didn't happen

280
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,120
then we treated the inside so if you see

281
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,639
your neighbors what i'm getting at

282
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,840
is if you see your neighbors doing

283
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,680
something if they're cutting down the

284
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,679
trees cutting down the bushes

285
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,598
doing outside landscaping or gardening

286
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,000
that you think may disrupt

287
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,959
the uh populations of insects that are

288
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,720
living there that

289
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,638
have decided to take residents in those

290
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,080
trees bushes shrubs flowers whatever

291
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,000
they're disrupting

292
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,598
maybe you want to make some precautions

293
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,079
go outside and just spray the outside

294
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:17,598
with

295
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,038
uh whatever pesticide you feel

296
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,079
comfortable that you feel you may need

297
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:21,839
to spray with there's

298
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,439
some people spray anyway for spiders and

299
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,038
[ __ ] like that so it doesn't look weird

300
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,560
if you're out there just spraying

301
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,399
at spider season where i am there's

302
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,519
[ __ ] all kinds of weird bugs so you

303
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,560
just go out there and spray it wouldn't

304
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,240
look weird at all

305
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,320
and then go inside and spray your plants

306
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,278
with the regular pesticide you would use

307
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,959
for your garden

308
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,958
something that you are that's approved

309
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,718
that you uh don't feel like you have

310
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,718
uh problems what's the word i'm looking

311
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,599
for ethical problem spraying on your

312
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,879
plants

313
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,480
um so um also clean up

314
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,120
your house while you're at it if there's

315
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,320
like uh old wood pile or some [ __ ] back

316
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
there there could be a [ __ ] snake in

317
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,560
that [ __ ] but also there could be a

318
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,399
bunch of bugs living in there just

319
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,879
waiting for you to disturb to disturb

320
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,480

00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,199
they're going to [ __ ] invade

324
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,480
so go clean up all the weird areas

in those bushes maybe it's time for you

328
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,559

i can't even think of the right words

358
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,839
right so i'm on the spot trying to talk

359

i'm certified with pesticides uh shout

361
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,399
out to theo walker she is who trained me

362
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,479
so

363
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,440
uh some credentials there but my

364
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,240
pesticide

365
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,000
regimen is i spray pesticides i've got a

366
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,519
variety of different pesticides of

367
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,559
different levels on the shelf i know

368
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,399
that i can mix

369
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,838
some things together and i cannot mix

370
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,519
some things together so

371
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,959
i've got a monday spray and a thursday

372
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,959
spray they're usually not the same

373
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,799
things but i kind of rotate

374
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,239
so let's say there are five products and

375
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,519
i'll spray on monday i'll spray one

376
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
product on tuesday i'll spray a

377
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,560
different product

378
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,838
all right thursday sorry skip the next

379
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,278
day which would be the monday but then

380
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,640
on the next thursday i'll spray a

381
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,240
totally different product

382
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,838
so i just work my way down the list

383
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,639
until i'm back to the start that way the

384
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,720
pests

385
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,720
never have the opportunity to build any

386
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,120
resistance to what i'm spraying them

387
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,480
uh if every day i you walk into the grow

388
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,919
room and i throw a left hook

389
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,519
my left hook is weak i should never

390
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,039
throw a left hook anyway if i throw a

391
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,519
left jab at your face

392
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,519
by day four or five you're either gonna

393
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,799
be fine with taking a jab to the face or

394
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,159
you're gonna have a good block

395
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,838
one of the two will happen the spider

396
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,399
mites will become the same way if every

397
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,079
day

398
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
you punch them with that left jab right

399
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,639
in the face they're gonna walk in

400
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,759
they're gonna dodge it they're gonna

401
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,360
take it on the face or they're gonna

402
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,439
block it it's not gonna bother them

403
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,039
so if you throw a left hook on day one

404
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,399
throw that [ __ ] right cross on day

405
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,000
two and they kick them in the balls on

406
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,120
day three they have no idea what the

407
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,440
[ __ ] to do so if you hit them with

408
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,278
different pesticides in rotation

409
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
different modes of action at the same

410
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,799
time they cannot

411
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,799
build resistance they can i guess but

412
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,519
not as quickly not as easily it's not as

413
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,439
likely

414
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,200
so i spray pesticides i've got a few

415
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,240
products that i rotate

416
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
i do mix different pesticides

417
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,519
together if you understand what you're

418
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
doing if you don't see any adverse

419
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,839
reactions

420
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,320
uh there shouldn't be a problem in

421
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,880
mixing certain pesticides i'll mix

422
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,600
um a chalky pesticide i'll put that into

423
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,360
the

424
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,879
solution first and shake the [ __ ] out of

425
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,360
it to where it's emulsified

426
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,039
then i'll add an oilier a more oily

427
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,879
sticky pesticide in there

428
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,399
and shake it to where they're emulsified

429
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,919
and then i feel like the

430
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,240
powdery one is spread through the water

431
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,479
and the sticky one works as like a uh

432
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
um i can't think of the word it helps it

433
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,079
stick to the plant there's a word a

434
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,759
wedding agent i said the word in my head

435
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,120
and then it got away from me but

436
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,559
um there's like a wetting agent that

437
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,720
will help it stick to the plants a

438
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,559
little bit better which is that sticky

439
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
uh this sticky like something like

440
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,319
evergreen is a little bit more sticky

441
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,759
evergreen or azimax is stickier and

442
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,278
that'll help your plants stick there's a

443
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,159
word that i really want to say in my

444
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,759
brain

445
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,278
will not say it's something like cocoa

446
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,919
wet it's the same [ __ ] that cocoa wet

447
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,159
does

448
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,399
hydro something anyway i gotta move on

449
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,399
from that or my brain will get stuck

450
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,440
all right so i do mix a few pesticides

451
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
together

452
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,839
um the reason is you want to do that's

453
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,880
different modes of action maybe like

454
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,440
one pesticide will make the bugs forget

455
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,200
to eat and then the other pesticide will

456
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,040
actually has a beneficial bacteria that

457
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,720
will make a mushroom grow inside of that

458
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,559
bug and that mushroom explodes and that

459
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,000
bug is dead at that point

460
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,838
there are things like that you can do so

461
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,120
you can really attack these bugs from

462
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,560
different angles also

463
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,240
one of the most important things to do

464
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,319
is understand the pests that you are

465
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,440
going to face what bugs are going to be

466
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,040
in your grow

467
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,279
we're all going to deal with spider

468
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,879
mites thrips aphids fungus gnats white

469
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,078
flies those are things you can almost

470
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,078
[ __ ] count on

471
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,838
if you're outdoors you're gonna get uh

472
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,759
caterpillars you're gonna get all kinds

473
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,880
of weird random [ __ ] outdoors you better

474
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,639
prepare for that

475
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,958
so think about what's coming to your

476
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,039
grow in your area indoors like i said

477
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,599
fungus gnats white flies

478
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,120
thrips spider mites be prepared for

479
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,959
those things apply a preventative

480
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,200
pesticide on a schedule

481
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,559
that will make those bugs not want to go

482
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,519
there something real simple like

483
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,599
evergreen

484
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,720
uh every couple of days every few days

485
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,440
once a week will make it

486
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,360
undesirable for spider mites something

487
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,320
else you could do put a fan on the floor

488
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,839
pointing up

489
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,200
the bugs don't want to deal with the fan

490
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,399
pointing up their whole idea is to get

491
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,759
there and colonize if you're blowing

492
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,958
them up in the air as they try to land

493
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,759
they get pissed off they don't want to

494
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,679
be there

495
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,078
make it undesirable for the pests which

496
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,919
you think may decide to invade

497
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,838
your grow space something like a fungus

498
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,679
gnat don't let the soil get super wet

499
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,959
they want to be there in this super

500
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,159
wet soil um a sticker spreader what's

501
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,759
the other word for like something that

502
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,120
sticks and spreads a product

503
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,559
all right it'll come to me and then i'll

504
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,000
[ __ ] yell it out at like five in the

505
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,359
morning i'll wake up in a [ __ ] sweat

506
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,198
and i'll come record it for you and just

507
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,919
say that word over the mix here

508
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,240
um so uh hit them with different angles

509
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,078
uh know what pest you're going to attack

510
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,079
that's very important because you can't

511
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,039
just go spraying somebody i see it on

512
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,039
social media

513
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,799
what what can i spray for bugs i don't

514
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,399
know what [ __ ] bugs do you have

515
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,159
it's way better if you know what bugs

516
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,639
you're going to spray for

517
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,039
white flies you might want to use uh a

518
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,839
bt a bacillus thuringiensis right treat

519
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,439
for that

520
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,600
with the white flies fungus gnats i

521
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,480
might do evergreen and the soil i might

522
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,399
do

523
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,680
what's in gonads what's that bacteria

524
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,639
that's in gonads it could be the same

525
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,958
thing honestly

526
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,480
i would do like a botanic garden max

527
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,919
soil dredge or something like that if i

528
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,360
had too many fungus gnats

529
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,198
for spider mites we're gonna start

530
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,720
mixing things and hit multiple different

531
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,319
products at the same time

532
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,560
so it's all about which pest you are

533
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,360
trying to attack and prevent

534
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,799
then know the steps know the steps of

535
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,919
taking care of your bugs

536
00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:00,240
and i am not the uh pest management the

537
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,838
pesticide expert the [ __ ] i am not

538
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,639
the bug lady there are people that are

539
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,320
way better

540
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,799
at handling pests than i am i'm just

541
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,160
telling you uh my method is prevention

542
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,679
prevent prevent prevent if you're

543
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,278
applying the proper pesticides they

544
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,719
won't want to be there

545
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,879
when you go into flower hopefully the

546
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,720
room is right the room is clean also

547
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,159
change clothes between grows if you work

548
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,680
at another grow if you go to your

549
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,319
friends grow if you go to the grocery

550
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,759
store

551
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,760
if you have an outdoor grow and an

552
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,679
indoor grow change clothes between those

553
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,600
grows that will help you out

554
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,278
that is prevention change shoes change

555
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,480
your hat if you've got dreadlocks

556
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,320
figure out how you're going to not

557
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,680
contaminate one grow to the other girl

558
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,519
with your dreadlocks maybe you got some

559
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,519
spider mites fungus gnats thrips

560
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,959
maybe somebody tagged along for the ride

561
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,320
have a hat keep your dreads up in the

562
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,599
hat when you get to another grow

563
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,278
take your dreads out of that hat put

564
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,959
them in another one do the best you can

565
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,919
to be preventative i know there's a lot

566
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,319
going on

567
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,599
but this is important to keep bugs out

568
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,959
of the grow it's more important to keep

569
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,320
the bugs out of the commercial grow than

570
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,838
the personal grow

571
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,440
you're not allowed as many products in

572
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,120
that commercial grow and they're so much

573
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,360
more at risk so

574
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,560
prevention is number one then scouting

575
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,800
in my opinion

576
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,599
scouting for bugs is your next step pay

577
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,198
attention

578
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,879
are you looking for problems are you

579
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,719
pulling off a leaf do you have

580
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,639
yellow sticky traps do you have hanging

581
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,639
cards do you have something to

582
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,079
indicate some sort of indicator hey bro

583
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,680
there are bugs in here or is your

584
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,599
indicator when you walk in you go

585
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,039
holy [ __ ] there are spider mites in here

586
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
if you added some sort of indicator

587
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,360
something to give you a hint

588
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,639
you would have known we could have

589
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,320
stepped up our preventative we could

590
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,759
have made it not a preventative we could

591
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
have gone into attack mode we could have

592
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,759
made it

593
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,198
eradication mode so prevent scout once

594
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,680
you see you've got a bug problem

595
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,439
identify the bug i've talked about that

596
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,479
we can treat wrong and mess up the

597
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,639
plants more

598
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,399
and not do any good spend money on the

599
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,560
application on the product

600
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,720
time on the application [ __ ] up the

601
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,239
plants uh piss the plants off more not

602
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,519
even apply the right thing and the bugs

603
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,399
are still there tomorrow and you're just

604
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,959
pissed off

605
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,360
identify the bugs get the appropriate

606
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,000
product for those bugs

607
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,919
you're going to have to decide what kind

608
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,360
of products you want to use how nuclear

609
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,919
are you going to go

610
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,680
i always try to follow a department of

611
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,000
ag guidelines for my personal grow as

612
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,838
well

613
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,599
just make it a habit sometimes you got

614
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,639
to go a little bit harder plants to come

615
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,480
in from

616
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,759
if i get a clone from another source at

617
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,558
this point i will treat it with

618
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,480
something

619
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,240
uh something [ __ ] nuclear because i'm

620
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,000
not letting any new bugs come in on

621
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,759
clones ever again i [ __ ] up i've done

622
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,599
that more than once

623
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,199
not gonna happen again it's my fault i

624
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,119
need to prevent that so

625
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,798
um make sure that you're treating with

626
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,759
the level of pesticide that you feel

627
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,440
appropriate

628
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,519
if you've got spider mites that are

629
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,759
making webs and [ __ ] on your plants

630
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,599
some [ __ ] hippie soap some like

631
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,440
pesticides some safer soap isn't going

632
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,678
to do it you need a real pesticide you

633
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,679
need to step it up think about that

634
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,200
think about the level of pesticide you

635
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,400
need to use and what you're comfortable

636
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,679
with using

637
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,320
so then attack from all angles and be

638
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,519
persistent is the next method of attack

639
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,918
i've got written down

640
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,079
once you've identified your pest find

641
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,919
how to get rid of it what is that pest

642
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,000
reproductive cycle how long do the

643
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,640
babies last how long do the adults last

644
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,919
how do they eat what do they enjoy then

645
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,440
[ __ ] that all up

646
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,520
don't give them the opportunity to

647
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,558
reproduce if they lay eggs and reproduce

648
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,558
in three days

649
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,558
spray every other day so they never get

650
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,279
the opportunity for their babies to keep

651
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,279
living

652
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,678
get on top of them learn their life

653
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,440
cycle learn what pesticide eradicates

654
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,240
them you can easily go to google and you

655
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,200
can type

656
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,000
uh fungusnet eradication pesticide

657
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,519
application

658
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,519
and it will show you six or seven

659
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,000
different not only like specific

660
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,160
products

661
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,839
it'll show you like evergreen uh

662
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,720
bacillus thuringiensis products but

663
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,399
it'll show you

664
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,319
a product and it will also show you

665
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
active ingredients and then you can look

666
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,038
for products with that active ingredient

667
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,720
based in it

668
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,400
find two or three of those things maybe

669
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
there's one product with two or three

670
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,759
things

671
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,880
uh and then attack those bugs with that

672
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,879
on a strategy

673
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,640
if you can get multiple pesticides so

674
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,840
that you can hit them on monday with

675
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,440
that [ __ ] jab

676
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,678
hit them on thursday with that right

677
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,000
cross then on monday morning again kick

678
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,679
them right

679
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,119
in the balls and then when they think

680
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,798
they're going to stand up again on

681
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,239
thursday you stomp right on their neck

682
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:03,839
with another pesticide and [ __ ]

683
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,440
destroy them don't let them come

684
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,199
that is don't let them come that sounded

685
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,919
worse than it was supposed to don't let

686
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,759
them thrive

687
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,440
that's what i really meant somebody edit

688
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,240
that [ __ ] i'm not gonna

689
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,360
um anyway destroy those bugs in there

690
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,599
get them with multiple

691
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,599
methods of attack multiple pesticides

692
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,279
mixed together or on a rotation so they

693
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,959
can't develop a resistance

694
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,480
knock them the [ __ ] down as quickly as

695
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,919
possible have a

696
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,519
plan have a schedule understand

697
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,600
what you're spraying what are you

698
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,480
spraying why are you spraying it

699
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,439
because i'm spraying this product

700
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,599
because

701
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,720
it's got this main ingredient which is

702
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,038
effective on

703
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,319
this pest which i have in the grow that

704
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:43,759
that's what you should be able to say

705
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,399
why are you spraying this because i have

706
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,558
mites

707
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,559
was that product designed to kill spider

708
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,440
mites yes it is okay that's a very good

709
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,440
first start

710
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,720
now what is your schedule of spraying it

711
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,000
because you spray it once

712
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,679
you're going to kill the spider mites

713
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,440
the adults that are alive now but eggs

714
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,320
are going to hatch in two to three maybe

715
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
four days

716
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,200
then you got a whole new spider mite

717
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,679
infestation so we need to get back in

718
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,919
there

719
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,720
and spray in two to three maybe four

720
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,480
days to stop

721
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,319
those new mites and guess what we got to

722
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,759
do it again but now the mites are

723
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,279
probably building resistance because we

724
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,640
hit them with three left jabs if you're

725
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,720
using the same product

726
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,240
switch it up use a different product get

727
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,679
that right crossing there so

728
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,038
you've got to be diligent you've got to

729
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,679
have a strategy you've got to have a

730
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,759
plan

731
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,519
and there has to be a reason when we go

732
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,200
to treat pests this isn't just like kind

733
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,240
of fly by the seat of our pants this is

734
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,960
when strategy

735
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,159
and thinking ahead three or four weeks

736
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,679
really comes into play

737
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,919
you've really got to think about it

738
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,320
ahead i try to stress how important it

739
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,360
is to think ahead when you're growing

740
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,038
and some people

741
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,719
still don't understand but maybe now

742
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,000
that i've said think three or four weeks

743
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,279
ahead when you're dealing with pests

744
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,798
maybe you actually understand those

745
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,558
pests when you think they're gone by the

746
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,798
way

747
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,319
they're not gone they're not gone yet

748
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,918
never think they're all the way gone

749
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,720
because that's when they come back when

750
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,120
you get

751
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,200
relaxed and lazy on the pesticides

752
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,479
that's when they reappear

753
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,480
all right i'm not sure how long i've

754
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,679
been going but i do feel like i can

755
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,360
probably answer this

756
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,600
message here this one comes from our

757
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,279
friend red eye let's segue into the

758
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,798
email portion of the show

759
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,639
our friend red eye sent me a message

760
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:11,679
that says you got me thinking about the

761
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,360
bottleneck

762
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,519
theory could we be causing this by

763
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,000
breeding hybrids to hybrids

764
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,879
um and then he says like my concern is

765
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
eventually

766
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,520
too many background genetic variation uh

767
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,359
shout out to my buddy red eye this is a

768
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,279
very good question

769
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:29,038
so what red eye is talking about is the

770
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,480
bottleneck theory

771
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,960
and this is something as a cannabis

772
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,839
breeder with limited space

773
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,038
that i have to worry about excuse me i

774
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,119
do feel like i have a kombucha burp

775
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,319
coming i apologize for that

776
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,158
i'm just trying to get it out of the way

777
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,038
there we go let's move forward so

778
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,640
bottleneck

779
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,798
uh bottleneck theory that would be

780
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,559
basically to where when we were breeding

781
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:49,918
that everything becomes the same thing

782
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,678
it starts to look the same smell the

783
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,880
same because we've used all the same

784
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,159
genetics

785
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,440
um and that is happening a little bit

786
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,559
in cannabis because my response to him

787
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,600
directly was uh yeah for 10 years it was

788
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,399
all kush

789
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,279
so for about 10 years everybody was just

790
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,360
breeding kush

791
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,399
everything at the dispensary everything

792
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,359
on the street

793
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,640
was og kush skywalker kush bubba kush

794
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,079
ghost kush

795
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,440
uh something og some sort of banana og

796
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,798

797
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,159
there's wiz khalifa og

798
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:28,798
snoop og kanye west og

799
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,919
there was all kinds of cushes and ogs

800
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,558
and they were all just

801
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,919
breeding inbred stuff to the other stuff

802
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,240
just so they could say they had their

803
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,960
own

804
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,440
cush crosses so for about 10 years yeah

805
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,679
it was

806
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,000
all kush brother all of it was kush you

807
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,640
could go to every dispensary in la

808
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,599
every dispensary in norcal and it was

809
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,280
kush kush

810
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,519
kush og kush kush og uh skywalker kush

811
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,480
moon dancer kush dog [ __ ] kush kitten

812
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,240
liquor kush

813
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,919
it was all there you could get it all

814
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,960
and then in colorado the trend followed

815
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
right along there were a bunch of

816
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,319
dispensaries on broadway

817
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,320
where it was just a bunch of different

818
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,319
kush then for five years

819
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,079
excuse me for the word slurring there

820
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,158
for five years maybe even more

821
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,599
uh maybe the past five or ten years it

822
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,320
has been cookies

823
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,839
everything has been bred to cookies

824
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,439
everything has got cookies in it

825
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,158
somewhere along the line

826
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,759
a lot of the [ __ ] has got kush and

827
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,200
cookies in it to be quite honest with

828
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,359
you those are some

829
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,400
kush cookies possibly has cush in it too

830
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,359
i'm not going to debate what's in the

831
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,080
cookies with you

832
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,959
at this point but uh yeah for a while

833
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,279
everything

834
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,480
was kush and cookies and then kem would

835
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:36,000
show up we'd have

836
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,880
uh chem 91 chem 4 kim d kim's sister

837
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,558
uh some street chem dog that was in a

838
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,120
lot of [ __ ] for a long time and then we

839
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,278
had

840
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,798
a lot of crosses that were kim kush

841
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,558
cookies

842
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,000
all of it was kim kush cookie so yeah

843
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,158
there is a little bit of bottleneck

844
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,400
happening and you see it now uh

845
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,480
in a lot of the dessert named strains

846
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,320
those are all cookie derivatives

847
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,480
with like a kush background with some

848
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,918
sort of other sativa in there to boost

849
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,400
up the buzz to it to boost up the

850
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,480
product

851
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,440
productivity to make it commercially

852
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,519
viable

853
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,679
so yeah it was all for a while it was

854
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,519
all kush then we got a lot of cookies

855
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,919
you'd get some kim show up in the mix

856
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,200
there uh then it was all kush chem

857
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,600
cookie crosses

858
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,240
and then like i said then it became all

859
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,038
dessert

860
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,640
named stuff like uh pastry and dessert

861
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,038
named things that like i keep saying

862
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,000
were really heavily influenced by

863
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,720
a lot of the girl scout cookies line a

864
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,038
lot of that

865
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,319
is done by hype a lot of that is done by

866
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,079
market demand

867
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,439
a lot of that is done because it's what

868
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,079
is available

869
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,679
um there's a demand for that when

870
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,519
cookies was popular if you had girl

871
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,159
scout cookies they would buy that

872
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,319
if you were a free market uh retailer

873
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,960
you had girl scout cookies or anything

874
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,158
else

875
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,159
if you just went down the list of

876
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,760
strains you had available i'll sell you

877
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,799
this i'll show you this i got girl scout

878
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,558
cookies nobody heard

879
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:53,839
anything after you said girl scout cook

880
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,879
is like just shut up and give me the

881
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,439
cookies bro

882
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,400
so everybody had the girl scout cookies

883
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,080
and then

884
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,919
people were breeding to it because they

885
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,359
all had it so then everything became

886
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,000
crossed with the cookies i'm not mad

887
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,439
about it

888
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,880
some of the cookie crosses are great

889
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,200
i've made a couple of my own there's the

890
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,640
cookie stomper there's the burning spear

891
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,400
uh there's coffee cake which we've

892
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,840
talked about in the past i didn't forget

893
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,200
you brother my friend that's emailing me

894
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,558
i've just been overloaded

895
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,000
but there are a lot of cookie crosses

896
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,359
out there i love the girl scout cookies

897
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,079
it was [ __ ] amazing

898
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,079
uh but i got tired of it because

899
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,199
everywhere i went that's all anybody was

900
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,199
growing smoking

901
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,038
selling [ __ ] trying to get me to

902
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,038
smell posting pictures of it

903
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,119
it was just cookies cookies cookies and

904
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,879
i love it but at the same time like how

905
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,319
many times can you smoke the same

906
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,000
[ __ ] strain so

907
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,000
for a while it was just cookies just

908
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
cookies uh now cookies is in

909
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,278
everything i'm not mad about it but all

910
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,359
the strains now have

911
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,119
somewhere down the line there's cookies

912
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,519
in the mix which means when i breed to

913
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,678
it

914
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,359
i've got to breed to something without

915
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,720
cookies in it which is what i really try

916
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,798
to do i try

917
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,278
i fall into it sometimes i did use the

918
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,440
biscotti to make the soccer souffle but

919
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,359
shout out to my buddy matt i don't know

920
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,558
uh what social media handle name to use

921
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,000
for you today shout out to my buddy

922
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:05,759
friendlyfire farms

923
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,599
uh he threw me the biscotti cut i used

924
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,599
that to make the saka souffle

925
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,439
i was a great plant and i like matt and

926
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,278
he left me that plant he had to move

927
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,720
and he donated that plant to the arsenal

928
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:15,759
i felt like it fit

929
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,038
it was a little bit different than

930
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,720
everything else i have it does have

931
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:19,919
cookies in it the biscotti does have

932
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,519
cookies in it that's what i bred the

933
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,038
soccer souffle with

934
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,639
i try not to follow those trends you

935
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,960
guys i really try to breed outward and

936
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
do different [ __ ] from everybody else

937
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,000
but i love that [ __ ] plant so i had

938
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,159
to breed with it but that's why you see

939
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,839
me using like the platinum tangy

940
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,278
and uh just totally different things the

941
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,399
blueberry cookies i'm using things that

942
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,079
not everybody use

943
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,440
blueberry cookies as [ __ ] cookies and

944
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,720
that one see where we're going

945
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,320
there's cookies and everything so i've

946
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,000
got to be careful when i breed with

947
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,519
things to not double up on the cookies

948
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,440
the kush the chems

949
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,440
because those are in a lot of the

950
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,720
popular crosses so yes

951
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,960
bottleneck theory is quite popular and

952
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,240
in my theory it's basically all hybrids

953
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,000
at this point unless you're getting some

954
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,599
crazy land race sativa

955
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,519
if you're flying to another continent

956
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,119
and they're pulling sativa seeds out of

957
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,480
their sativa buds that are growing right

958
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,479
now and showing you look this takes

959
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,240
[ __ ] 24 weeks to flower

960
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,319
uh most of the time you're not getting

961
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,079
true sativas most people don't have the

962
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,000
time patience space

963
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,079
patience is the key word there to grow a

964
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,798
real sativa i'm talking 14

965
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,158
16 weeks or more you got to go 14 or 16

966
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,398
weeks to impress me to

967
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,919
to get me to call you like super real

968
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,959
sativa most of what i breed

969
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,679
i say is sativa leaning it's all hybrids

970
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,120
honestly

971
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,880
uh there's a lot of indica a lot of

972
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,439
sativa in there to make the combinations

973
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,360
happen

974
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,038
it's all hybrids now you guys it has all

975
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,439
been hybridized together

976
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,798
and it is all working toward bottleneck

977
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,679
theory that is an absolute

978
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,359
uh possibility but luckily there are

979
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,880
there are a lot of breeders that have no

980
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,398
idea about this sort of a thing and

981
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,919
they're going to breed themselves into a

982
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,439
circle into a trap and they don't have

983
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,360
anywhere to go with their genetics with

984
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,558
their breeding with their programs

985
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,918
they haven't thought ahead they haven't

986
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,319
thought about mendel charts they just

987
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,840
haven't put a breeding program on paper

988
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,359
on a spreadsheet haven't thought about

989
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,678
any of that for the future

990
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,439
luckily there are breeders who are a

991
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,000
little more educated who care a little

992
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
bit more

993
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,038
i'm not bashing the other uh style of

994
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,399
breeder

995
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:09,599
those guys are just doing it the way

996
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:10,639
that they're doing it they're doing it

997
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,199
the way they're doing i'm gonna do it

998
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,120
this way

999
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,798
and hopefully i can prevent the

1000
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,199
bottlenecking and my breeding

1001
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,639
