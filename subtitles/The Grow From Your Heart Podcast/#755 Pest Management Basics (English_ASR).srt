44
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,118
remind you that we are approaching the

45
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,438
4th of july here in my neighborhood we

46
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,438
play a game which i like to call gun

47
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,359
shots or fireworks

48
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,438
quite often we hear some bang some boom

49
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,200
some pops and at this time of year you

50
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,039
just wonder was that gunshots or

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,560
fireworks and you place your bets

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,560
oftentimes you never find out who's the

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
winner or not my point is if you hear

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
some bang some pops and booms play along

55
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,879
try to decide with me were those

56
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,039
gunshots or fireworks you never know

57
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,438

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,120
on i do have a lot to talk about in this

86
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,000
podcast i've got an email here in front

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,080
of me

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,680
which i get very often i don't answer

89
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
this question enough because this is a

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
big podcast so i did put this one

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,400
together for you the question is very

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,318
simple it says i have a spidermite

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,840
problem i could read you a lot more of

94
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,318
the email but i think that gets us right

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,479
to the point let's jump into something

96
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,479
that is very important for any cannabis

97
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,238
grower of any level if you're brand new

98
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,840
at growing if you're experienced it

99
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,158
growing if you're somewhere in between

100
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,080
there integrated pest management is

101
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,560
something that should be on your radar

102
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,080
on your mind in your standard operating

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,158
procedures that should be part of your

104
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,319
method part of the method to your

105
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,158
madness we are going to get invaded by

106
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,000
bugs at some point you may have not

107
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,519
gotten bugs at this point i'm going to

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,598
knock on wood for you and hope that you

109
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,840
don't get them but the chances are

110
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,919
someday you're going to get bugs and i

111
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,080
would like you to be prepared understand

112
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,158
how to eradicate them also understand

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,599
how to prevent them so let's get into an

114
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,359
integrated pest management podcast the

115
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,598
main question is about spider mites but

116
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,840
with any pest any bug

117
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,479
um almost most problems in life i like

118
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,640
to say set yourself up for success when

119
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,399
it comes to bugs spider mites thrips

120
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,199
fungus gnats almost any pest we can

121
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,959
think of prevention is key if we can

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,800
prevent them from getting in there have

123
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
some sort of security system in place a

124
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,639
standard operating procedure that will

125
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,879
make things a lot easier so if you're

126
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,720
not already doing some sort of

127
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,279
preventative program to make sure the

128
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,960
bugs don't come now may be a good time

129
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,198
to start thinking about it think about

130
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,879
it this way when [ __ ] goes down would

131
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,720
you rather have security guards there

132
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,079
waiting to break up the rumble the might

133
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,199
battle the might orgy because that's

134
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,599
what's going to happen it's going to be

135
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,360
a mite picnic and then a mite orgy do

136
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,280
you want security guards there already

137
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,040
those security guards could be either a

138
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,359
spray application or those security

139
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,759
guards could be other beneficial insects

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,080
but would you rather have security on

141
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,520
standby or would you have to rather have

142
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,918
to call the cops and wait for them to

143
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,519
show up which could be for you to spot

144
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,839
the problem and then start applying a

145
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,680
pesticide or maybe even to have to order

146
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,439
the predator bugs from an insectiary

147
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,038
wait for them to come distribute them

148
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,199
wait for them to develop population and

149
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,038
start eradicating your bugs prevention

150
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
is key i would rather have security on

151
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,439
hand i don't want to have to wait for

152
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,840
those bugs or sprays to arrive so

153
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,399
prevention is key what are you doing in

154
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,839
your room to make sure that no bugs get

155
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,918
into your room there are a lot of things

156
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,679
you can do if you've got cracks in the

157
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,359
walls seal those cracks up with some

158
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,800
caulk if you've got a window or

159
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,319
something where things can get in get

160
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,160
some tape over that get some sort of

161
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,240
sealer think of all the ins and outs in

162
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,320
your grow space and seal all of that

163
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,240
stuff up keep in mind it gets cold

164
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,800
outside it gets hot outside in your grow

165
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,400
room that's the most perfect environment

166
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,079
for most of the bugs that we're gonna

167
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,319
face that's why they thrive so well in

168
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,478
our grow room we're providing the

169
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,800
perfect temperature the perfect vpd we

170
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,318
give water at a very specific interval

171
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,000
and the bugs love that rhythm if the

172
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,879
plants are happy the bugs are probably

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,959
happy as well so it's outside the bugs

174
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,639
can feel and sense that there's warmth

175
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,000
in that other room they can smell those

176
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,439
great terps in that other room and

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,639
they're like hey guys it's cold and

178
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,639
shitty we're out here living in a

179
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,840
[ __ ] rose bush let's go party in

180
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,360
there where the weed plants are and all

181
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,279
the spider mites just find one little

182
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,038
crack in the wall one little gap in the

183
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,399
window they congregate into your weed

184
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,478
plants where it's [ __ ] beautiful it's

185
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,079
jamaica and they're all day long you got

186
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,159
it at just the right temp just the right

187
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,000
vpd they go make a little hammock up on

188
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,919
one of your plants they start eating

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
then they start breeding then they take

190
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,599
over so they know that it's there let's

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,800
prevent them from coming in let's think

192
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,639
about ways that these bugs get into our

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,000
grows a lot of times like i just

194
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,519
mentioned they come in through the

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,879
cracks in the walls sometimes they're

196
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,799
already there many of these bugs are

197
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,240
very common if there are plants around

198
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
they're already there but how do they

199
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,759
get into the grow if they're not already

200
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
in the space a lot of times they will

201
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,038
come

202
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,159
in your soil many people blame a

203
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:56,719
specific brand of soil or soilless mix

204
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,880
for having bugs in it

205
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,800
every brand can have bugs in it i don't

206
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,159
care if it's ocean forest i don't care

207
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,520
if it's pro mix i don't care if it's

208
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
roots organics

209
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,038
all of those bags of dirt have the

210
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,598
potential to have bugs in them i've

211
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,199
gotten bugs in every bag of dirt every

212
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,519
brand there's been no brand that has

213
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,598
been bug free let's talk about this

214
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,159
people claim i bought ocean forest and

215
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,680
got bugs in it i bought roots 707 it got

216
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,759
bugs in it i bought the other brand

217
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,038
whatever it is it doesn't matter yes of

218
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,038
course there's bugs in there it's

219
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:28,318
[ __ ] soil it's soilless mix it's dirt

220
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,719
it's very desirable for bugs also it is

221
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,439
made stored and kept in a place where

222
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,840
those bugs are very readily available

223
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,360
you can't blame any specific brand for

224
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,239
giving you bugs

225
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,080
all of the bags of soil are kept and

226
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,079
most of them are made very near each

227
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,758
other then they're sent to a warehouse

228
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,680
they're all kept in a warehouse together

229
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,919
do you think the bugs go hey let's just

230
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,598
go into this one bag let's just the bugs

231
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,279
are not brand loyal is what i'm trying

232
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,120
to say they don't care about they can't

233
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,038
see the cool coloring on the roots or on

234
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,959
the fox farms bag they don't know those

235
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,878
fish are even printed there those bugs

236
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,799
go wherever they can go to find a party

237
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,400
to get some warmth to get some food they

238
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,240
want to eat and they want to breed just

239
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,000
like you they're going to go into every

240
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,680
bag that's available you just bought a

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,399
bag that had bugs in it and it happened

242
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,240
to be whichever brand you chose so if

243
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,959
you've gotten a bag of soil that had

244
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,199
bugs in it it wasn't the maker of that

245
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,799
soil's fault that soil went to a

246
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
warehouse it stayed in a warehouse

247
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,918
possibly outdoors there's a very popular

248
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,639
grow supply center in colorado springs

249
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,038
they keep all of their soil outdoors if

250
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,120
there's there are bugs in one bag

251
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,958
they're going in every bag they're gonna

252
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,560
overload that one bag all the food all

253
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,319
the hiding places the hotel will be

254
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,239
booked they're gonna go somewhere else

255
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,240
which is the next bag over it may be a

256
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,080
different brand it may be the same brand

257
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,799
all the brands are gonna get bugs they

258
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,680
get transferred and the same trucks

259
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,000
the roots organics the fox farms the

260
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,919
tuper the [ __ ] everything it came on

261
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,320
the same truck why wouldn't the bugs

262
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:59,679
travel from bag to bag so don't blame

263
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,399
any specific brand for getting bugs into

264
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,079
your grow that is your responsibility as

265
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,480
the farmer as the lead grower as the

266
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,800
head cultivator as the head [ __ ]

267
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,480
in charge it is your responsibility to

268
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,120
make sure that bugs don't make it into

269
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,360
your grow inspect the soil treat it with

270
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,159
the pesticide treat it with the

271
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
uh

272
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,199
treat it with a predator bug if that's

273
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,040
what you've got to do but be

274
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,879
preventative inspect your soil it is

275
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,799
your job to make sure that doesn't get

276
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,879
in there treat everything like there is

277
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,958
bugs there are bugs on everything that

278
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,320
comes in there's bugs in the soil let's

279
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,239
talk about the next way they come in

280
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,320
they come in on plants are you bringing

281
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,639
in clones are you getting cuttings from

282
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,680
a friend that is a great way to bring in

283
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,039
bugs

284
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,120
all of your friends are going to say

285
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,439
dude my grow is clean i don't have

286
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,360
anything the person that claims to have

287
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,040
the cleanest grow is usually the person

288
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,200
with the worst bugs they just haven't

289
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,879
found them yet so when you get a clone

290
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,959
or a plant or a cutting from a friend to

291
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,278
make sure it is treated that's the best

292
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,518
way to bring unwanted bugs into your

293
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,039
grow room all right here's a side note

294
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,639
that i'm going to totally derail my

295
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,919
train of thought and try to throw this

296
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,078
in it's not on my notes but i just

297
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,399
thought about this we build very nice

298
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,639
grow rooms indoors we put really good

299
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,000
lights in there we put ducting in there

300
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,039
we clean everything up hopefully

301
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,639
hopefully you're cleaning your grow

302
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,639
space clean that [ __ ] up dude i'm

303
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,039
talking to myself too we build these

304
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,838
really nice controlled environments i do

305
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,078
not find it wise i would not recommend

306
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,040
to move our ganja plants that we have in

307
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,278
our indoor area outdoors for sunshine

308
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,519
during the day and then back inside i

309
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,799
would not recommend that if that is

310
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,639
something you choose to do if that's

311
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,039
your main strategy that's cool but if

312
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,838
that is your main grow space where you

313
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,599
mainly intend to have the plants indoors

314
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,440
i wouldn't contaminate it with the

315
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,480
outdoor plants the minute you put those

316
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
plants outdoors they're gonna get

317
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,360
trespassers they're gonna get stowaways

318
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,958
you're going to bring them into your

319
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
grow space they're going to find places

320
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,479
to hide in there it's jamaica like we

321
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,399
talked about earlier it's perfect

322
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
environment in there some of the bugs

323
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,078
might hop off that plant and stay in the

324
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,600
room the next time you carry that plant

325
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,359
outside so now you've kind of

326
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
contaminated that indoor grill with

327
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,278
outdoor bugs you just brought the bugs

328
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,040
in the reason we really built that room

329
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,200
was to isolate everything and keep that

330
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,120
plant safe from all of those outdoor

331
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,600
bugs we've got a perfect room in there

332
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,919
so i don't recommend moving your plants

333
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,360
from indoors to outdoors that is not and

334
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,439
then back in that's not something i

335
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
would recommend have indoor plants or

336
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,720
have outdoor plants i understand you're

337
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,159
going to do light depth and some [ __ ]

338
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,320
like that is going to happen but my

339
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,480
general recommendation is if you've

340
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
built a nice indoor grow room have a

341
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,278
nice indoor grow room that you've never

342
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,799
contaminated with those outdoor plants

343
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,039
what i was getting to before that i want

344
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,120
to get back on track is when you get new

345
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,199
plants new clones from a friend make

346
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,600
sure you isolate those plants don't take

347
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,680
those right into general population you

348
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,200
can put if you get a clone a small plant

349
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,120
you can put it in the windowsill for a

350
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,800
couple of days take it out of the window

351
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,519
treat it with whatever pesticide you

352
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,359
choose to use something i use something

353
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,440
strong when [ __ ] comes in if i get a cut

354
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,440
from anybody if it was from one of my

355
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,279
best friends if it was from my mama if

356
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,360
it's from my girlfriend or a complete

357
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,240
stranger i'm going to treat that clone

358
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,320
the same it's contaminated in my mind it

359
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,440
is contaminated it's got mites thrips

360
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,600
spider fungus gnats powdery mildew it's

361
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
got herpes it's got all this [ __ ] you

362
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
could imagine i'm gonna treat it and

363
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,278
keep it away from my plants for seven to

364
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,360
ten days until i'm sure that that plant

365
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,679
is clear then it gets to go into general

366
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,839
population i cannot risk bringing [ __ ]

367
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,000
in and destroying a grow i got spider

368
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,079
mites from a very reputable grower and

369
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,600
they were the most ferocious [ __ ]

370
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,919
spider mites i've ever seen they did

371
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,079
some damage slowed me down we recovered

372
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,159
however they did [ __ ] me up i learned my

373
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,199
lesson there i talk about mistakes i've

374
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,799
made

375
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,720
trusting a very reputable popular grower

376
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,399
[ __ ] me over i got a clone that was

377
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,839
riddled with mites i brought it right in

378
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,440
and before i noticed we're [ __ ] all

379
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,440
right we're talking about how bugs come

380
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,519
in bugs come in on

381
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,000
you the soil they make it in in the soil

382
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,399
bugs come in and other plants bugs also

383
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,240
come in on you your clothing your shoes

384
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,919
your dreadlocks yes i'm holding up my

385
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,000
own dreadlocks i'm guilty i'm talking

386
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,120
about it myself my dreads go to my

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
calves you guys i don't know if you've

388
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
seen recent pictures i posted on the

389
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,839
gram

390
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,000
my dreadlocks i'm six foot five i'm six

391
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,000
foot five tall and my dreadlocks touch

392
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,919
my calves i got quite a bit of hair i do

393
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,360
have a dedicated grow area hat i keep

394
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,120
the dreads tied up

395
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,360
try to keep the just trying to mitigate

396
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,120
problems there but you do bring you

397
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,039
travel the bugs around through your

398
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,278
shoes your pants your shirt your

399
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,799
dreadlocks your long hair whatever you

400
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,120
may be wearing that's a great way to

401
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,759
move bugs around also we've talked about

402
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,200
it before the dog will bring bugs into

403
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,958
your grow room i don't prefer to have

404
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,440
the dog in there that's man's best

405
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,039
friend but be my best friend upstairs

406
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,560
we'll hang out in the backyard stay out

407
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,958
of my grow space

408
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,599
so the bugs make it in in a variety of

409
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,159
ways it is our responsibility to

410
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,920
minimize those ways for those bugs to

411
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,559
get in it's your responsibility like i

412
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,719
said it's we're farmers we're growing an

413
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,799
agricultural product we've got to keep a

414
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,959
farmer's mindset in mind and that means

415
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,240
we're battling pests and insects at all

416
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,000
times

417
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,639
unfortunately some of the pests that we

418
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,799
are battling are nearly or are actually

419
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,720
microscopic so we can't even see them so

420
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,078
we've got to pay attention to the plants

421
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
we've got to keep a good eye on the

422
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,479
garden and see what that garden is

423
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,720
telling us and be ready to react as soon

424
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,320
as we see a problem based on an insect

425
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,199
now the reaction part is where people

426
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,278
really mess up they see a small problem

427
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,679
and they want to do something freaking

428
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,759
crazy to solve that problem and they

429
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,319
overkill the small problem and cause a

430
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,559
bigger bigger problem by panic mode i

431
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,399
talk about panic mode grower panic mode

432
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,919
you see that little issue and you've got

433
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,278
your plants are at risk and now you just

434
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,639
[ __ ] everything up because you went into

435
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:43,519
panic mode and didn't think things

436
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,278
through

437
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,198
think about what you're going to do when

438
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,278
you get those pests start thinking now

439
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,519
how nuclear do i want to go how gentle

440
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,759
do i want to go how abrasive or toxic do

441
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,839
i want to be with the pesticides which i

442
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,360
choose to use that is up to you i will

443
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
make recommendations i'll give you

444
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,519
product names but

445
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,639
i do not judge you

446
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,360
based on the pesticides you choose to

447
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,159
use in your garden i do judge you if you

448
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,480
use a product too late in the fl on the

449
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,879
flowering stage or in flowering stage

450
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,440
and there are residual chemicals left

451
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,278
behind that can cause harm to a consumer

452
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,720
i will judge you for that

453
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:25,439
if you use a pesticide correctly and

454
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,079
properly at the right interval duration

455
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,000
dilution application rate you're safe

456
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,838
about it i will not judge you for any

457
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,519
product you choose to use if you're

458
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,519
doing it safely and correctly that's

459
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,198
what the products are for that's what

460
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,759
we're we've got a goal we've got a

461
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:43,439
product to protect i understand but it

462
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:46,159
is your uh your prerogative how toxic

463
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,920
how gentle how what what products you

464
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,600
want to use some things are pretty

465
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,919
[ __ ] rough some things are really

466
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,440
fluffy and gentle people want to stick

467
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,439
to the word organic i always say

468
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,040
remember that cyanide is organic and

469
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
just a couple of drops of that will kill

470
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,198
you so don't let the word organic be too

471
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,519
much of a buzzword when it comes to pest

472
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,719
eradication just because a product is

473
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,519
organic

474
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,920
doesn't mean that it is safer less

475
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,360
harmful to a human body less harmful to

476
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,078
the environment than a product that

477
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,480
doesn't have an organic stamp on it also

478
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,159
with that same thing being said

479
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,399
an organic product

480
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,719
does not have to be considered less

481
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,278
effective than a non-organic product for

482
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,600
the right situation that organic product

483
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,480
may wipe out your [ __ ] problem on the

484
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,079
same

485
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,879
in the same battlefield in a different

486
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:35,120
situation that non-organic product may

487
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,958
be exactly what you need it's all about

488
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,399
situation it's all about understanding

489
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,559
it's all about the pest you're trying to

490
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,720
attack a lot of it is based on the phase

491
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,958
of growth which these plants are in i

492
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,278
want to get back to where i was it is up

493
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:50,719
to you to decide the level of

494
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,240
abrasiveness toxicity how powerful how

495
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,320
potent you want to go with your

496
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,959
pesticides do your research on the

497
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,440
products you are thinking about using

498
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:02,078
read the msds sheets see what's in there

499
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,160
read the active ingredient read

500
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,159
is it toxic is it poisonous what does it

501
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,759
do to the environment read about that

502
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,240
product do you want to spray that on

503
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,759
flowers that you're going to consume

504
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,439
if you're the only one consuming it

505
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,879
spray whatever the [ __ ] you feel you're

506
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,880
safe with doing if you're going to give

507
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,640
it to other people keep them in mind

508
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,919
spray something that is safer maybe

509
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,160
stick with something with a shorter

510
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,520
half-life something um let's talk about

511
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
half-life somebody asked me about this

512
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,798
in an instagram live feed lately

513
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,120
recently

514
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,720
half-life when i spray a product over a

515
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,119
certain duration it is going to break

516
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,759
down 50 and that product will not be

517
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,279
available on the plants anymore it ah i

518
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,919
don't know the exact science it

519
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,079
biodegrades it breaks down it disappears

520
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,480
uh the sun breaks it down the wind

521
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,199
breaks it down the rain breaks it down

522
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,640
the the availability of that product on

523
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,960
the plants

524
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,960
dilutes dissipates again i'm not

525
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,480
completely qualified to teach this but

526
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,000
i'll teach you the way that i know it

527
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,919
when you spray that product on there

528
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
it's a hundred percent over a certain

529
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,240
amount of time it breaks down to 50

530
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,880
percent then over at that time again it

531
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,038
breaks down to 25 percent then over time

532
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,840
you get 12 and a half percent then over

533
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:12,640
time again you get 6.25 then eventually

534
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,879
down to 3.12 percent keeps breaking

535
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,120
half-life understand the half-life of

536
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,600
the product you are using also

537
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,678
understand the re-entry interval of the

538
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,839
product you are using that is when you

539
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,080
apply a product in a grow space how long

540
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,240
do you have to wait to safely enter that

541
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,918
grow space again now i want to group

542
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,240
these two things together

543
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,400
take your half-life and your re-entry

544
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,038
interval and if you're growing indoors

545
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,360
increase those drastically because in an

546
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,279
outdoor environment we've got the sun

547
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,879
the sun will break down those chemicals

548
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,119
those products those agents the

549
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,360
ingredients in the pesticide spray and

550
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,038
they won't last as long on the plant

551
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,038
they will disappear they'll be gone

552
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,279
basically in a shorter amount of time

553
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,519
because like i said earlier the wind the

554
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,240
sun the rain those things get rid of

555
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,079
those products indoors we've got caustic

556
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,759
grow lights that are nowhere near as

557
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,759
powerful as the sun they're not breaking

558
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,759
the chemicals down as quickly so they

559
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,319
will be there longer we don't have the

560
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,640
same ventilation indoors so your

561
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,359
half-life and your re-entry interval

562
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,720
basically need to be doubled indoors

563
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,719
some people aren't going to follow that

564
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,079
some people think i'm crazy

565
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,319
as somebody who is trained by the

566
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,558
colorado department of agriculture it's

567
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,399
my responsibility to make sure i say it

568
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,160
what you do with that info is up to you

569
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,919
you're a grown-ass [ __ ] adult have

570
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,960
fun do your thing pimpin all right the

571
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,400
next thing i want to talk about i'm

572
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,038
going out of order on my notes here but

573
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,320
i feel like this is very important um

574
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,679
protective personal equipment ppe

575
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,038
personal protective equipment i don't

576
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,840
know what order i set it in the first

577
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,759
time but protect your protect yourself

578
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,519
with the proper personal protective

579
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,679
equipment you guys when you buy a

580
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,440
pesticide there's a little booklet on

581
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,798
the side of the bottle that's not a

582
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,120
story about the guy that made the

583
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,519
pesticide that's not a comic book that

584
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,519
is actually the instructions and a bunch

585
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,918
of tips about that product it will tell

586
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,279
you if that product is if you can drink

587
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,640
it it'll tell you if it's dangerous

588
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,558
it'll tell you if it's toxic it'll tell

589
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,400
you if it'll [ __ ] kill you it will

590
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,240
tell you the personal protective

591
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,080
equipment that is recommended for that

592
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,079
product most of the time they're going

593
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,079
to want you to wear six millimeter or

594
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,319
thick is it millimeter or milliliter

595
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,960
millimeters these are solids milliliters

596
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,678
or liquids you want six millimeter or

597
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,038
thicker nitrile gloves most pesticides

598
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,480
are going to ask you to wear long

599
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,440
sleeves we don't want you to get any

600
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,839
pesticide on your skin most of the time

601
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,880
pants cover your feet with shoes a lot

602
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,359
of the time they're going to want to

603
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,919
mask some sort of a respirator every

604
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,839
time we want some sort of eye protection

605
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,320
what you do from there will be probably

606
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,000
pesticide specific but

607
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,000
i recommend putting on the personal

608
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,359
protective equipment before you get the

609
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,038
pesticides

610
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,279
what if and i don't know where you work

611
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,038
i don't know where you grow but what if

612
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,798
the person that managed that pesticide

613
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,158
before you didn't put the lid on it all

614
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,839
the way and you just naturally grab it

615
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,919
the next move to do with the pesticide

616
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,918
is to give it a shake then measure some

617
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,759
out what if you're just moving doing

618
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,000
your thing you got joe rogan in your ear

619
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,079
maybe i'm in your ear jam in the podcast

620
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,919
you grab that bottle you give it a shake

621
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,319
if you or the person before you didn't

622
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,799
put that lid on all the way pesticide is

623
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,960
now flying out of that bottle if that

624
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,038
pesticide gets in your eye you could be

625
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,558
[ __ ] you could be really [ __ ] you

626
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:21,919
could have some big problems it's gonna

627
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,240
burn it's gonna suck but you could have

628
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,159
long term damage let's have our personal

629
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,759
protective equipment on before we even

630
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,080
touch the pesticides it sounds like

631
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,839
overkill which is what i want i want

632
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,279
overkill i want you to be safe i don't

633
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,119
want you to get sick i don't need you

634
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,720
contaminated i want you to live through

635
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,719
this we're growing cannabis let's not

636
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,400
get [ __ ] hurt growing cannabis we

637
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,839
want to smoke some urban chill out not

638
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,159
end up in the [ __ ] hospital so

639
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,158
personal protective equipment is very

640
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,000
important let me get back on track here

641
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,640
and keep my notes here

642
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,640
the products you decide are up to you

643
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,600
the applications you decide to use are

644
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,440
up to you many people will choose to use

645
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,240
predator insects if that's what you

646
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,759
choose to do that is up to you it's all

647
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,720
up to what you want to do in your grow

648
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,440
that's one of the best parts about

649
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,079
growing weed you get to s to decide what

650
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,840
you want to do one important thing

651
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,759
though is monitoring that grow and

652
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,918
keeping an eye out for bugs how are you

653
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,519
going to know if bugs there are there

654
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,919
are you scouting personally do you have

655
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,158
a crew scouting occasionally do you walk

656
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,759
in and just blindly grab it a leaf

657
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,280
occasionally i don't even know what

658
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,200
plant i just touched i know i just go

659
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,798
right there and i took a leaf and i'm

660
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,400
going to inspect this leaf very

661
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,558
carefully i'm going to look at the top

662
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,159
of it i can tell a lot by the top uh no

663
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,720
powdery mildew it doesn't look like any

664
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,480
chew marks no thrip [ __ ] looks good flip

665
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,240
it over do i see any spider mites do i

666
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,720
see any fungus gnats do we see any white

667
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,919
flies if that leaf is cool probably

668
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,360
pretty good i won't pull another one i

669
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,440
don't need to i've seen all the info i

670
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,119
need but i will go in there sometimes

671
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,720
twice a day in my personal grow and just

672
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,639
give it a good scouting how does [ __ ]

673
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,880
look are there any bugs

674
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,038
one thing i want to talk about is

675
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,400
yellow sticky traps and the blue sticky

676
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,240
traps those little cards you guys like

677
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,000
to use i love them i highly recommend

678
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,038
them those are great products

679
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,679
however those are not any way to

680
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:08,000
eradicate or remove a bug what those are

681
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,400
there for is to show you that there is a

682
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,319
presence of a pest they do not do

683
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,400
anything to get rid of a bug a bug has

684
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,399
to land on that [ __ ] yellow card for

685
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
it to do anything how many of the bugs

686
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,600
do you think oh look a yellow car let's

687
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,000
jump right into it most of them don't do

688
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,519
that those are there to show you some of

689
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,038
the bugs that are in here were stupid

690
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,558
enough to fly onto the yellow car there

691
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,558
are probably a lot more and you should

692
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,399
think about it a lot of them come with

693
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,079
like a grid they've got squares printed

694
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,080
on there that's so that during the

695
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,158
morning you can count basically get a

696
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,319
good visual count how many bugs per

697
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,640
square there are two bugs per square

698
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,158
they're five bugs per square they're 20

699
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,159
per square we're really stepping our

700
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,159
[ __ ] up check again at lunch see how

701
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,760
many there are see over the day how many

702
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,278
bugs progress do you need to do

703
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,960
something about it or is it an

704
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,119
acceptable amount of bugs what's cool

705
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,440
with you a few fungus gnats and a big

706
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,199
grow that's fine a bunch of fungus gnats

707
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,880
and a small grow [ __ ] that we got to do

708
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,038
something it's up to you but those

709
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,600
yellow sticky traps are not any source

710
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:06,000
of eradication they are alerting their

711
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,719
notification it's not doing anything but

712
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,400
telling you there are bugs here

713
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,600
now let's talk a little bit about things

714
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,559
we can do

715
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,000
to get rid of and prevent pests and our

716
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,158
grow of course the fir some of the first

717
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,839
things we can do come with standard

718
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,360
standard operating procedures i guess

719
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,918
the first thing is building a proper

720
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,599
room seal that room up are all the gaps

721
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,759
from outside sealed or all the gaps from

722
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,119
the other room sealed are you clean when

723
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,119
you're going in do you have a standard

724
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,879
operating procedure do you have grow

725
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,879
room clothes do you have grow room shoes

726
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,960
do you have grow room a grow room hat

727
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,559
for your dreadlocks are you stepping on

728
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,159
one of those mats that's got the cleaner

729
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,798
in it to clean up your shoes do you put

730
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,360
on booties do you wear a scrub jacket to

731
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,960
go in there or a lab coat or scrubs to

732
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,879
go in there what are you doing to

733
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,919
prevent the bugs the next thing we can

734
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,000
do is i think defoliation is a great way

735
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,559
to minimize all of the problems in the

736
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,960
grow if we defoliate

737
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,720
i basically describe the leaves as like

738
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,759
hotels and hammocks for the plants it's

739
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,759
where the plants are chilling that's

740
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,119
houses and hotels they're on the leaves

741
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:06,879
they're not chilling out on the stocks

742
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,558
mostly maybe if you got a lot but

743
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,640
they're on the leaves if there aren't

744
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,558
too many leaves there aren't too many

745
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,720
places for bugs also that's less

746
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:15,918
opportunity for powdery mildew get that

747
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,600
[ __ ] out of there you don't need all

748
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,278
those leaves that's going to lead to

749
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,439
problems people say that the leaves are

750
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,880
the source of food and the solar panels

751
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,240
for the plants dude there are so many

752
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,600
leaves in there you could take some out

753
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,278
don't worry you don't have to worry

754
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,399
about the food we're feeding the [ __ ]

755
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,079
plants through the roots we're giving

756
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
them very expensive nutrients they're

757
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,199
eating and they're getting the best

758
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,720
light that they can take off some of

759
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,640
those leaves so the light can get to the

760
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,278
buds that you want to get big and fat

761
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,559
defoliate that will help you prevent bug

762
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,919
problems also turn up the fan i think if

763
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,839
you turn up some fans and have some

764
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,679
airflow in there the bugs don't want to

765
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,678
be around as much also one thing i will

766
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,880
notice though if the bugs do if the

767
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,159
spider mites start getting out of

768
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,520
control they use those fans as like um

769
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,120
it's kind of like a hang glider they

770
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,558
climb up to the top of the plant and

771
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,839
they catch the wind off the fan and they

772
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,440
drop a web

773
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,199
and they blow from this plant right over

774
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,000
to the next one they use the fan to do

775
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,919
it

776
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,839
so have the fan in there so that they

777
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,919
can't colonize they can't establish a

778
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,439
presence but once they do get present

779
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,840
you might want to slow down that fan to

780
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,720
keep them from traveling around

781
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,639
so

782
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,640
much now another thing we can do to

783
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,360
prevent some bugs is to just make an

784
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,120
undesirable environment for any bug that

785
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:26,079
may show up any pests that may come

786
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,278
around let me give a quick disclaimer 99

787
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,119
of what i'm going to tell you is going

788
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,278
to be for an indoor grow outdoor growing

789
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,678
is a whole new beast we'll touch on that

790
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:36,240
not very much now i said create an

791
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,679
undesirable environment for the bugs

792
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,359
i've said before that we're creating

793
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,200
jamaica in our grow space we've got the

794
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,519
perfect vpd the temp is great the

795
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,440
humidity is great just enough wind to

796
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,798
make it comfortable we don't disrupt it

797
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,120
there's no predators in there unless

798
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,200
you've introduced some so let's make an

799
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,599
environment that is undesirable for

800
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,679
these bugs maybe occasionally you can

801
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,278
just mist the plants with water they

802
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,000
don't like water a lot of the bugs don't

803
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,480
want to hang out if it's too humid

804
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,159
90 of our bugs are going to be on the

805
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,679
underside of the leaf the top of the

806
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,360
leaf you don't have to spray it they're

807
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,640
going to be on the bottom so come from

808
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,479
the underside of the plant with your

809
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,840
little mister with your spray bottle and

810
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,440
just start at the bottom and work your

811
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,119
way up under the plant lift up the

812
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,679
leaves as you go and spray the underside

813
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,599
make it undesirable if you want to add a

814
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,600
product you can put in some sort of

815
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,918
insecticidal soap or you can step up

816
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,240
your game and start actually using a

817
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,880
pesticide as a preventative there is no

818
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,200
problem and i highly recommend using a

819
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,720
spray application of pesticides on a

820
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,480
weekly basis to keep bugs at bay

821
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,000
so some of the first steps are to prep

822
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,839
the room the next step is to have a

823
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,159
standard operating procedure so that you

824
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,359
don't bring bugs in through the soil

825
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,679
through your plants or through your

826
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,240
clothes then we start creating an

827
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,159
undesirable environment for the bugs a

828
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,000
little bit of defoliation a little bit

829
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,880
of wind maybe some moisture on the

830
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
leaves maybe i recommend start applying

831
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,399
a foliar fed pest application some sort

832
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,038
of pesticide targeted for the bugs you

833
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,558
know you are going to get in your area

834
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,119
i would recommend doing preventative

835
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,200
sprays on a weekly basis rotate your

836
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,678
products then if you do see a pest

837
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,919
problem start to arise then increase the

838
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,440
interval the amount of sprays increase

839
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,919
the amount of spray that you put in the

840
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,038
mix then maybe start doing rotations of

841
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,960
a stronger pesticide more frequently

842
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,879
now i do recommend a rotation of

843
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,919
pesticides because these bugs will

844
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,600
develop a resistance to pesticides think

845
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,679
about if i walked in your grow space

846
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,918
every day and tapped you on the shoulder

847
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,600
and threw just a shitty left jab at you

848
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,679
by day three you're going to block that

849
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,879
left jab here go here comes the jab tap

850
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,480
you on the shoulder you're going to turn

851
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,960
on your block will already be up you'll

852
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,960
be ready to block my left jab no problem

853
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,558
if i came in there on day four tapped

854
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,240
you on the shoulder through a vicious

855
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,678
right cross you're not going to be ready

856
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,440
for that [ __ ] it's going to get you

857
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,600
we've got to do that to the spider mites

858
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,960
also they do learn they do start to

859
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,199
build up resistance they are

860
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,880
evolutionary creatures they will say oh

861
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,519
you sprayed evergreen on me three days

862
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,960
in a row watch this day four the bugs

863
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,558
that live from the first three days of

864
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,159
evergreen they're gonna lick their arm

865
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:07,519
and they'll go ah

866
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,120
evergreen and they're just gonna look at

867
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,398
you like they're [ __ ] crazy they're

868
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,319
gonna eat up the evergreen and get

869
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,319
stronger from it so i recommend a

870
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,319
rotation of products i will go through a

871
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,918
list of products that i do recommend

872
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,000
once again nobody pays me they're just

873
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,840
[ __ ] that [ __ ] that i know that works

874
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,440
let's talk about

875
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,599
some of the pests that you will

876
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,120
encounter in your indoor grow let me do

877
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,798
that disclaimer once again this is going

878
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,038
to be mostly indoors i'm an indoor

879
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,639
grower i do have a greenhouse a couple

880
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,960
of greenhouses what did i say that got

881
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,720
some greenhouses going but most of this

882
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,759
is indoor stuff what bugs are we going

883
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,679
to get indoors and our garden most

884
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,599
commonly we are going to see spider

885
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,038
mites the dreaded spider mites spider

886
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,359
mites are scary a lot of people think

887
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,679
they're a huge deal uh it's a [ __ ] up

888
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,599
situation depending on the stage of

889
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,759
growth which you are in but spider mites

890
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,759
are very easy to get rid of if you are

891
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,759
patient have a strategy and understand

892
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,919
what you are doing and you're not lazy

893
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,839
about it you cannot be lazy in the grow

894
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,320
the bugs will take over if you get lazy

895
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,278
they'll start [ __ ] challenging you

896
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,359
basically you're going to see the

897
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,519
two-spotted mite

898
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,519
the real problem is the russet might if

899
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,639
you've got russet mites that changes

900
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,038
everything

901
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,278
i do uh consulting my consultation

902
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,038
includes pest eradication in your grow

903
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,119
if you've got russet mites i do charge

904
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,720
you another level to get rid of those in

905
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,158
a commercial grow it's more expensive it

906
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,798
takes a lot more work it's a lot more

907
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,360
strategy a lot more cooperation from the

908
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:32,000
team so we've got spider mites uh

909
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,599
another thing you may see are thrips

910
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,880
people get scared of thrips people have

911
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,398
a lot it takes them a long time to

912
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,480
identify that it's actually a thrip

913
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,319
issue thrips are easy we can definitely

914
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,798
get rid of thrips aphids you may see

915
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,319
aphids in your grow aphids of all colors

916
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:45,679
aphids have become like [ __ ] skittles

917
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,038
they're every color now through

918
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,200
evolution and through

919
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,278
regional evolution i guess it is there

920
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,720
are aphids of every [ __ ] color you'll

921
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,278
see them they're not a big deal we can

922
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,120
get rid of those as well uh fungus gnats

923
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,960
are very common in a grow environment

924
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,199
those are very very easy to get rid of

925
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,360
not very problematic but they can lead

926
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,120
to other problems they can be

927
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,278
if you've got a small problem plus

928
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,439
fungus gnats those two together compound

929
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,200
a problem very well another common issue

930
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,000
is white flies a lot of people get white

931
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,319
flies indoors and outdoors those are

932
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,240
very easy to eradicate another big issue

933
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,960
that's not a bug per se but does happen

934
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,359
quite often is powdery mildew especially

935
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,440
here in colorado we get huge temperature

936
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,678
swings temperature spikes

937
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,759
last year in the winter we had negative

938
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,880
17 degree temperatures try keeping your

939
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,398
grow room warm inside with the wall

940
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,240
right here and then on the other side of

941
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,479
that wall it's [ __ ] negative 17

942
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,599
degrees there's snow packed up against

943
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,038
the walls and you're just trying to

944
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,558
balance the [ __ ] out in the rooms

945
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,000
there's condensation raining from the

946
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,918
[ __ ] ceiling it's very interesting at

947
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,798
that time of year we do get powdery

948
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,120
mildew from that show so be prepared

949
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,119
um let's talk about outdoor outdoors is

950
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,719
totally different you guys i am not

951
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,038
super experienced with the outdoor but

952
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,558
outdoor uh you may experience birds

953
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,879
birds could be problematic i've seen

954
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,558
birds steal buds just fly down and pinch

955
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,559
little pieces of the weed off the weed

956
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,720
plant all season long and just destroy

957
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,798
plants uh deer deer will come and eat

958
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,319
your whole [ __ ] plant i've seen bears

959
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,558
come i haven't seen them personally i've

960
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,639
seen instances where bears have come and

961
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,319
stolen plants from the grow

962
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,080
bunnies are notorious if you got too

963
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,398
many rabbits they'll eat the [ __ ] out of

964
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,558
your plants um in colorado we get these

965
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,639
caterpillars we get moths they land in

966
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,639
the plants they lay eggs and those turn

967
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,720
into these orange caterpillars those

968
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,159
things have [ __ ] ruined so many crops

969
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,480
of people that i know so you're gonna

970
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,760
get a lot of outdoor bugs

971
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,159
one though another thing we should think

972
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,000
about outdoors is thieves we get a lot

973
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,760
of thieves especially here in colorado

974
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,839
especially here in pueblo people love to

975
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,519
steal your outdoor weeds so if you're

976
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,278
gonna plant outdoor weed plant one for

977
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,038
the crook one for the bugs one for the

978
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:48,640
bunnies and then maybe you'll get one

979
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,319
for yourself also

980
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,880
i'm hoping you get the best i'm being

981
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,678
optimistic uh i've done a full episode

982
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,440
on bud washing if you do grow outdoors

983
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,038
your outdoor weed may be very dirty

984
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,960
there may be some bugs in there i've

985
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,200
done an episode on bud washing maybe

986
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,880
check out the bud washing episode that

987
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,640
may be a good episode for rinsing off

988
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,559
your outdoor weed a lot of people are

989
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,399
that's really controversial i think it's

990
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,000
a good show check that out i digress

991
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,158
let's get more into

992
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,679
integrated pest management we've talked

993
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,360
about the bugs that we're going to face

994
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,840
we're going to face spider mites thrips

995
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,000
aphids fungus gnats white flies possibly

996
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,599
powdery mildew there are other things

997
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,159
that a lot of the grow books talk about

998
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,319
that do pop up honestly mealy bugs and

999
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,519
scales and [ __ ] like that is a very very

1000
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,439
uncommon i've been growing for a

1001
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,919
thousand years it feels like i've never

1002
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,278
seen a mealybug or a scale so

1003
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,080
we're not going to worry too much about

1004
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,278
that let's talk about now about options

1005
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,879
on how to

1006
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,880
get rid of these bugs we've talked about

1007
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,360
ways to kind of prevent them let's talk

1008
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,760
about ways to get rid of them i am a

1009
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,678
commercial ganja grower i like to grow

1010
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,558
in large warehouses with large plants

1011
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,919
with a lot of toys the way that i prefer

1012
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,240
in my method

1013
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,278
to get rid of and prevent bugs is a

1014
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,200
rotation of pesticide applications and a

1015
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,359
spray method sprayed pesticide

1016
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,038
applications are my favorite a lot of

1017
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,798
people out there don't agree with that

1018
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,639
they don't want to smoke pesticides they

1019
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,000
don't want to smoke chemicals but

1020
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,838
everything is chemicals if you

1021
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,039
understand that and i understand that

1022
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:14,799
you may not want to consume some

1023
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,679
pesticides but we've got to do what

1024
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,359
we've got to do to keep the bugs away to

1025
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,079
protect our investment to make sure that

1026
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:25,119

00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,320
product that i produced

1049
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,079
so not only am i professionally and

1050
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,320

1051
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,880

that these products are safe so one of

1054
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,598
my big jobs in the facility is to make

1055
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,160

at the correct time to get rid of bugs

1058
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,480
but also not contaminate any of the

1059
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:37,519
product to where it could be problematic

1060
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,519
for anybody who may consume the buds the

1061
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,759
edibles the concentrates anything that

1062
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,519
comes out of my grow i am responsible

1063
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,119
for that my name is on that product if

1064
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,280

1065
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,720
from it will tell you the number where

1066
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,640

1067
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,078
colorado and if you know the numbers and

1068
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,598
you know the right facilities you know

1069
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,680

me for

1074
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,679
so i know i do talk a lot about the

1075
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,358
business side of commercially producing

1076
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,759
cannabis it's a big investment it's a

1077
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,759
lot of responsibility but please never

1078
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,920
feel like i've forgotten about the

1079
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,960
patience about the consumers about the

1080
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,599
people that sparked this passion for

1081
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,760
large-scale cannabis production in me i

1082
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,599
grow cannabis to make people feel better

1083
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,520
i breed cannabis to make people feel

1084
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,760
better that is the overall goal of this

1085
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,159
here i have not lost sight of that goal

1086
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,160
i am involved in a lot of things i have

1087
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,559
gone very far from the original route of

1088
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,598
this project but i know that the

1089
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,159
original

1090
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,800
the whole mission the intent is to make

1091
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,559
people feel better and i know that

1092
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,160
giving you a pesticide on your product

1093
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,078
is not going to make you feel better i

1094
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,559
want you to live longer healthier

1095
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,640
happier and i can't do that if i poison

1096
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,320
you with the [ __ ] pesticide so one of

1097
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,480
my big things is to make sure that we

1098
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,480
are doing this ethically and responsibly

1099
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,480
that is something i take good pride in

1100
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,559
so i do talk about sprayed applications

1101
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,800
a lot of people are not into the sprays

1102
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,320
that is cool do your thing how are you

1103
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,480
keeping the bugs away if you're not

1104
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,720
using a sprayed application a lot of

1105
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,039
people will choose to use predator

1106
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,439
insects they get other bugs that do not

1107
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,358
harm the plants but they do eat the bugs

1108
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,599
that are there and the grow so you can

1109
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:18,799
get things like lace wings

1110
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,280
swarovskis persimilis hypoaspis miles

1111
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,200
rove beetles assassin beetles things

1112
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,800
like that and you buy them and they come

1113
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,960
in the mail and you release them in the

1114
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,039
grow and those will go and act just like

1115
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,400
predators on the wild they'll eat all of

1116
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,639
your [ __ ] spider mites all your

1117
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,320
fungus gnats a lot of people do choose

1118
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:36,400
to use ladybugs

1119
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,160
let me talk about ladybugs briefly

1120
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,720
i think they're lazy they're cool if

1121
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,239
there's like bugs are right here a

1122
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,759
ladybug may go over here and eat it but

1123
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,598
if there's a bug over here and a ladybug

1124
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,839
over here ladybug's not going anywhere

1125
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,599
to [ __ ] eat it in my experience

1126
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,440
you'll spend money on ladybugs you'll

1127
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,800
release them into grow into the grow

1128
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,000
you'll take a bunch of pictures because

1129
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
they're gorgeous you'll find a couple

1130
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,599
that are humping there's always ladybugs

1131
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,960
humping uh you'll find them up on the

1132
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,240
tops of the plants you'll take a great

1133
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,440
bunch of great photos and you'll turn

1134
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,118
off the lights and you'll go to your

1135
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,639
business and you come in the next day

1136
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,000
half the ladybugs will be dead they flew

1137
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:07,759
into the [ __ ] light they flew into

1138
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,599
the fan they flew into the blower

1139
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,119
ladybugs are pretty but they are not the

1140
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,680
smartest [ __ ] creature on the planet

1141
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,240
they're suicidal they're kamikaze they

1142
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,598
don't last very long they stink ah they

1143
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,838
die they land on the floor and they

1144
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,680
stink in my opinion that smell from the

1145
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,599
dead ladybugs is terrible then you gotta

1146
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,919
sweep them all up uh and it's kind of a

1147
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,480
waste of money i would recommend a more

1148
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,800
aggressive more effective predator ah

1149
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,079
californicus swarsky that may be the

1150
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,519
same thing they changed the names on

1151
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,440
these bugs and i can't keep the latin

1152
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,800
names all straight in my mind i order

1153
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,800
them honestly and i can remember the

1154
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,200
names that i order the swarovskis the

1155
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,000
kookamarus the californicus the

1156
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,919
hypoaspis miles green lacewings rove

1157
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,679
beetles um what's the other one that i

1158
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,599
said assassin beetles

1159
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,919
those are all great predator beetles or

1160
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,920
predator bugs but

1161
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,320
just like a pesticide what i'm about to

1162
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,240
say applies to predator insects and

1163
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,440
pesticides you've got to have the

1164
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,159
correct

1165
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,358
eradication device for the correct

1166
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,759
problem

1167
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,000
if you go releasing the wrong bug for

1168
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,599
the wrong bug they may never meet up but

1169
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,159
if you know what you're what bugs you're

1170
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,160
facing and you do the right research

1171
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,239
you can find the correct bug to go in

1172
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,159
there and get that bug right away the

1173
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:19,439
problem is in my opinion with the

1174
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:22,559
predator bugs is that you've got to

1175
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,639
build up populations on the same hand it

1176
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,719
does take time effort and energy to

1177
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,559
spray a pesticide and that does do some

1178
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,078
stress to the plants if you're letting

1179
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,920
out bugs the plants barely know that

1180
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,359
those bugs are there but it does take a

1181
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,720
little while for that army to get out

1182
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:37,039
there and start doing work so you've got

1183
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,879
your toss up there you're 50 50. let's

1184
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,639
talk about another way to get rid of

1185
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,320
bugs in our grow

1186
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:44,960
many people forget that a lot of the

1187
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,200
bugs we face are not on the leaves of

1188
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,119
the plant they actually live down in the

1189
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,118
soil the cocoa the medium that's where

1190
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,480
they go you may see them pop up

1191
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,920
occasionally and show you that they're

1192
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,880
there but they're living down in the

1193
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,639
soil so a soil dredge is another very

1194
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,400
effective way to get rid of many of the

1195
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:01,759
bugs we face

1196
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,160
oftentimes

1197
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,960
if we've got a bug if it's thrips spider

1198
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,279
mites fungus gnats white flies a lot of

1199
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,960
the time my first reaction is to

1200
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,400
defoliate let's just get rid of some of

1201
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,000
these leaves clean up the bottoms take

1202
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,920
off a bunch of leaves that's going to

1203
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,318
help us out that's the first step then

1204
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,639
the next step let's do a soil dredge of

1205
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,400
the appropriate product if i've got

1206
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:23,598
let's just say if i've got fungus gnats

1207
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,280
i would use

1208
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,519
15 to 30 milliliters of evergreen per

1209
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,880
gallon of water as a soil dredge i would

1210
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,239
run that right through the pot right

1211
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,240
through the soil until i get a little

1212
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,318
bit of runoff that way i know that all

1213
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,000
that soil in there has now been poisoned

1214
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:39,279
any fungus gnats in there are going to

1215
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,400
get poisoned they're going to die

1216
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,040
they're not going to want to live in

1217
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,160
there now the next move i would spray

1218
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,480
the plants with 15 to 30 milliliters per

1219
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,639
gallon of evergreen it's down there in

1220
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,639
the soil let's get it up top also that

1221
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,239
way we killed everything if there are

1222
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:55,920
bugs on the leaves they're going to run

1223
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,078
to the soil looking for refuge guess

1224
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,680
what poison down there if there are bugs

1225
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,599
in the soil they're going to run up to

1226
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,598
the leaves looking for refuge guess what

1227
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,200
poison up there let's get them let's get

1228
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,480
them on all levels let's not give them

1229
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,838
anywhere to hide

1230
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,440
and one thing i want to talk about is

1231
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:11,279
fungus gnats those are there because

1232
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,519
you're over watering if you stop over

1233
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,200
watering the fungus gnats will stop

1234
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:16,800
coming around so those should be easy to

1235
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,439
get rid of fungus gnats quickly how do

1236
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,079
you get rid of fungus gnats defoliate um

1237
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,519
do a soil dredge of either i would just

1238
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,839
say evergreen let's just start off right

1239
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,318
with evergreen you could use azetrol as

1240
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,000
a max but i think evergreen or pyganic

1241
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,318
which is a very similar product reduce

1242
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,880
the dosage of the pyganic though

1243
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:37,679
give it a soil dredge defoliate soil

1244
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,519
dredge foliar feed repeat in three days

1245
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,960
fungus gnats are gone bro if you do it

1246
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,280
right the fungus gnats will be gone

1247
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,559
maybe repeat a third time the plants are

1248
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,640
gonna look a little bit stressed if you

1249
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,599
hit them with that much oil three times

1250
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:52,159
but your [ __ ] bugs will be

1251
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,318
gone all right where are we

1252
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,000
um let's talk about what we can do

1253
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:57,440
things are really

1254
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,480
all right another thing we need to talk

1255
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,440
about is what phase of growth are our

1256
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,880
plants in if we're in veg we can do a

1257
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,039
lot of things to the plants if you're

1258
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,119
just starting to flower your options are

1259
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,119
slimming out if you're in flower your

1260
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,358
options for spray applications become

1261
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,800
very thin keep in mind that people are

1262
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,880
going to consume this we don't want to

1263
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,960
put a product on here that is not going

1264
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,519
to the half-life is not going to come up

1265
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,639
by the time we consume this product so

1266
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:24,400
keep that in mind you don't want to

1267
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,598
taste it you don't want to smoke it you

1268
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,960
definitely don't want it in your

1269
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,640
concentrates

1270
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,240
imagine if i sprayed something on your

1271
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,239
buds and you taste it in the buds

1272
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,399
imagine if i put those buds in a

1273
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,639
extraction device of any kind we're

1274
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,720
concentrating the pesticide that shitty

1275
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,199
flavor as well your dabs are going to

1276
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,799
taste 20 times worse than the flowers

1277
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,480
taste so

1278
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,119
think about the stage of growth you are

1279
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,199
in and adjust your pesticide application

1280
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,358
accordingly something i like to do in a

1281
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,519
commercial grow i just said we focus on

1282
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,078
spray applications yes as soon as i see

1283
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:58,318
bud set guess what i do i release a [ __ ]

1284
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,480
ton of predator bugs so i've got sprays

1285
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:03,838
all the way up to about day 14 maybe day

1286
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,679
20 then by day 21 i've got an army a

1287
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,599
bunch of boxes of predator bugs to

1288
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,639
release into the entire grow so i switch

1289
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,720
it over to predators later in the season

1290
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:15,440
so i start off my grow season with spray

1291
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:18,719
applications once i get buds i do switch

1292
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,720
over to the predator bugs then i have an

1293
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,480
arrangement with the insecury we

1294
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,559
basically set up a subscription service

1295
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,800
to where those bugs come every week

1296
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,159
every two weeks as needed until i tell

1297
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,079
them that we have harvested then they

1298
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,078
stop sending them they just show up in a

1299
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,200
box that says live bugs i just start

1300
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,760
putting them out as soon as they get

1301
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,399
there build that population keep those

1302
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,319
problem bugs away

1303
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,480
those predators do need to be planned

1304
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,000
for they need to be planned ahead you do

1305
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,838
need to get them there it's going to

1306
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,838
take you if you're new with ordering

1307
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,679
from the insectiary it may take you two

1308
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,759
weeks to get your first batch but after

1309
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,919
that you'll be in the rotation they may

1310
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,520
have to breed more bugs for you

1311
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,039
sometimes they're making the amount of

1312
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,159
bugs they sell these people know what

1313
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,838
they're going to sell they're making

1314
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,679
that amount they got to step up the

1315
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:04,318
program to get you your order in two

1316
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,399
weeks so be prepared also keep in mind

1317
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,318
delivery time also keep in mind

1318
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,880
somebody's got to disperse all of these

1319
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,719
bugs which is cool because you can just

1320
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,200
do the whole room or you can really

1321
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,879
focus on problem hot spots

1322
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,279

1323
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,880

1456
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,039
certified which means i can go to a

1457
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,318
commercial grow whether it's a farm

1458
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,358
whether it's a weed grow if it's

1459
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:52,159
tomatoes if it's soy and i can train the

1460
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,799
crew and the lead grower in safe

1461
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:57,920
pesticide management application

1462
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:00,160
handling and education i am certified by

1463
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,159
the university and the department of ag

1464
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,920
to do this i've got paperwork so i am

1465
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,000
qualified to give this pesticide

1466
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,000
information something i want to touch on

1467
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,079
right now is all of the products i

1468
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,480
recommend all of the method methodology

1469
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,480
i've recommended is legal here in

1470
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,960
colorado in a commercial grow i think

1471
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,400
actually azimax may have been banned

1472
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,559
recently

1473
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,880
but most of the products i recommended

1474
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,040
are legal and safe here in the state of

1475
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,960
colorado i don't know where you are i

1476
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:29,199
don't know the laws we have to work with

1477
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,119
the colorado marijuana enforcement

1478
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,960
division the colorado department of

1479
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,440
public health and environment the

1480
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,039
colorado department of agriculture and

1481
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,039
probably other entities that i'm not

1482
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:41,039
even aware of they've got to approve

1483
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:43,679
every pesticide that we use on our

1484
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:47,199
products so make sure that the products

1485
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:49,598
you are using are approved by your state

1486
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,279
regulators i don't know what state

1487
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,838
you're in i don't know what products

1488
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,599
you're using don't blame it on me you've

1489
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:58,000
got to do that work i'm telling you what

1490
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,519
i use what i recommend don't let me ruin

1491
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,559
your license don't let me [ __ ] up your

1492
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,039
plans

1493
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,400
don't get in trouble because of me

1494
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:08,400
also i try in my personal grow to stick

1495
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,720
to those sta same standards that are

1496
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,318
held by the commercial grow

1497
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,439
sometimes i'm a little bit more strict

1498
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,279
but also

1499
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,800
full disclosure when i get new clones in

1500
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,559
i spray it with [ __ ] that i will not

1501
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,400
even tell you because it's not going to

1502
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,599
be consumed it's going to become a

1503
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,920
mother plant it's going to get cloned

1504
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,599
out a bunch of times and then 90 of what

1505
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,838
i grow is not consumed it's turned into

1506
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,240
seeds so people aren't smoking most of

1507
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,199
it so that's a different argument right

1508
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:32,959
there

1509
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,558
know those laws and rules and i've got

1510
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,838
the word quarantine written down because

1511
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,000
that was something i already touched on

1512
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,838
but i wanted to segue into it now when

1513
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,920
you do get new clones new plants make

1514
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,199
sure you treat them so that they can be

1515
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,358
quarantined don't put them in the

1516
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,879
general population keep them safe all

1517
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,960
right let me review my notes make sure

1518
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,318
we've covered everything i talked about

1519
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,760
ways to make sure you don't get bugs

1520
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,279
into the room i talked about

1521
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,599
preventative sprays i've talked about

1522
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,519
preventative predatory bugs i've talked

1523
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,119
about ways to eradicate those bugs if

1524
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:00,159
you do see them if you do see bugs in

1525
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,000
your grow

1526
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,799
it's time to step up your pest

1527
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,440
application keep in mind rotation and

1528
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:11,839
keep in mind bugs do build resistance

1529
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:14,240
also multiple modes of attack understand

1530
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:16,558
how each pesticide works

1531
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,639
some pesticides make the bugs forget to

1532
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,119
eat some make them forget to breathe

1533
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:22,719
some pesticides grow a mushroom inside

1534
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,960
of the bug and the mushroom takes over

1535
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:26,799
the bug and they explode understand the

1536
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,519
method of attack if you can get two

1537
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,119
modes of attack in a mixture

1538
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,838
there's nothing wrong with spraying two

1539
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,280
pesticides at the same time on your

1540
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,358
plants if

1541
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,200
if you understand what's in both of

1542
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:40,719
those bottles some things you can't

1543
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:42,960
spray together some things will have

1544
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:45,118
negative reactions but most of the time

1545
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,440
you can mix one two maybe even three

1546
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,920
pesticides together and blast the [ __ ]

1547
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,000
out of that crop maybe do a tester spray

1548
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,000
don't hit the whole crop at first but

1549
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,599
you can mix things

1550
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,599
all right i think that does wrap up my

1551
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,880
integrated pest management episode you

1552

you've got that notification you got to

1604

get over there and buy the bad

1605
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:44,480
[ __ ] but that is one way to

1606
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:45,679
cheat and get an update on stocks you

1607
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,199
don't have to click on every one of them

1608
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:49,440
and see if it's sold out or not i

1609

apologize that the website does that

1610
