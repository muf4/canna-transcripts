79
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:52,750
very brief moment of silence for a very

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640

126
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,719
Simon and Franco and Ariane it's a

127
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,910
magical friendship and it is a huge loss

128
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,400
to the cannabis community to lose a man

129

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,839
unscrew I'm unscrewing it as I do it

168
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,430
there's a nice mesh

169
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:19,179
in here this is where your ground flower

170
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:21,519
ends up it says to grind it course to

171
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,310
leave it one direction for a find grind

172
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,918
to flip it upside down and grind it that

173
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,350
way for a finer grind and then of course

174
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,359
it's got this little screen here to are

175
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,639
on the bottom you can actually catch the

176
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,919
Keith if you're a Keith kitchen kind of

177
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,240
guy you can put that in your bowls or

178
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,469
you can put that on your joints or you

179
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,379
can do whatever you want with your Keef

180
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,880
there's a lot of uses for it um that

181
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:45,009
kind of puts me on a side rant you guys

182
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,079
this is called a pollen catch is what

183
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:49,389
this portion of the grinder is but thief

184
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,159
is not pollen people that call Keef

185
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:54,310
pollen you are wrong

186
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,370
pollen comes from male plants there is

187
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,540
no pollen in your female plants unless

188
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,000
something went horribly wrong

189
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,550
so you are not catching pollen that is

190
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,709
Keef those are mainly trichomes that you

191
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,000
were gathering on the bottom there you

192
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,829
can gather those up and put them on a

193
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,449
bowl or you can put them in a joint or

194
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:12,279
if you're gonna wrap a little bit out of

195
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,949
wax around the joint you can also put

196
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,138
that Keef on the outside of the wax it

197
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,910
is very potent that's basically

198
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,759
trichomes that have fallen off of your

199
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,919
buds but it is not pollen so please quit

200
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,478
calling that pollen REO let's get back

201
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,279
to this grinder one thing I do like

202
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,870
about this grinder is it is super light

203
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,848
I've got another grinder that I carry in

204
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,129
my backpack it is really heavy

205
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:35,978
this one has replaced the backpack

206
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:37,839
grinder it's got these really one thing

207
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:39,969
I complain about grinders is they get

208
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,929
stuck a lot once you get some material

209
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,030
in there they start getting a little

210
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,910
sticky they don't want to turn this one

211
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:47,319
has little um I want to call them just

212
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,360
finger indentions they're just little

213
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,800
grip ease for your fingers tore it's not

214
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,419
gonna get stuck I know that I will

215
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,740
always be able to spin this grinder

216
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,199
because of the little finger grip ease

217
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,689
on here my sharp stone grinder it got

218
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,339
stuck it's still stuck [ __ ] it I'm never

219
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:03,310
gonna get it undone I'm not gonna try

220
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:05,319
now I've got a chop shop grinder to use

221
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,699
and it will not get stuck I can rely on

222
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,620
this

223
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:09,759
I am going to put a couple of flowers in

224
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,579
here and we're gonna smoke a joint

225
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,219
together but uh before I do that I've

226
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:16,990
already got one tiny complaint about

227
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,030
this grinder and the only complaint I

228
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,220
have is that it's too small this thing

229
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:23,559
is probably three inches in diameter and

230
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,750
I've got two Nuggets sitting here that I

231
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,269
plan on rolling into one joint I'm gonna

232
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,829
have to grind both of my buds separately

233
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:32,350
because they will not fit in this

234
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:34,899
grinder that may not be everybody's

235
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,519
problem everybody may not have giant

236
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:39,220
buds or too much weed for their grinder

237
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,139
but for a guy like myself I'm gonna have

238
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,729
to put I'm have to run this grinder

239
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:44,769
twice just to get these buds ground up

240
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,970
some kind of semi breaking up this first

241
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:48,699
but there's a stem in the middle I'm

242
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,620
taking out but now I've got this grinder

243
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,450
is the top portion is pretty full I'm

244
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,950
putting the little lid on I'm gonna give

245
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:58,150
it a grind into the mic so you can hear

246
00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:00,400
it that's all it took this weed is

247
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,919
pretty much ground-up ready to roll into

248
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,209
a joint give it a couple more twists I'm

249
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:06,099
gonna take the top off now I'm just

250
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,810
gonna put the other nug in here gotta

251
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,509
give it a little pre break what I'm

252
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:13,539
grinding up is called Burning Spear this

253
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:15,159
is Girl Scout cookies the forum cut of

254
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:18,279
Girl Scout cookies pollinated by a

255
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,649
reversed grateful dog so it's forum

256
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:23,589
cookies to grateful dog this was a

257
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:25,209
feminized seed that I grew I did not put

258
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,430
these seeds out to the market I gave a

259
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,980
few of them to spent from the garden of

260
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:31,569
Weeden for his birthday one year and he

261
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,820
is the only one that got seeds I'm

262
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,680
pretty sure he gifted a couple of those

263
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,810
to another grower friend because I saw

264
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,219
pictures of him so spin Seng that one

265
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:42,789
dude are the only people that really got

266
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,800
seeds of this it smells very Girl Scout

267
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:47,980
cookie Z but once you start grinding it

268
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,379
it releases a Kindle

269
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,940
[Music]

270
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,980
dirty feet sort of a thing so it's like

271
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,530
if it's kind of like if you hid your bag

272
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,060
of Girl Scout cookies weed and a dirty

273
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,370
sock in a good way

274
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:01,659
it's so funky I like it so I've got it

275
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:06,330
nice and ground up here in this Chop

276
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:08,409
Shop grinder which I like the grind the

277
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,379
consistency and texture that it grounded

278
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:13,449
is perfect for a nice joint it's not too

279
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,279
too fine it's not too coarse I actually

280
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,960
did it the normal way it says for a

281
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,370
coarser grind to flip it upside down it

282
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,129
did not do that

283
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,990
so now let's see I stuck two papers

284
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:24,519
together select oral fat joints and then

285
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,720
I made myself a little tip here so I'm

286
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,639
gonna put that in here

287
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,820
they dump the dope into here and give it

288
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,980
a twist and a lick

289
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,780
then we're gonna smoke a joint together

290
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,580
while we do a podcast you guys I'm gonna

291
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,539
lick it twist it you won't hear me

292
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,540
rambling while I lick it

293
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,379
twist gotta tuck that corner the key to

294
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:48,960
rolling a good join is just getting that

295
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:53,320
first corner tuck there we go I'm gonna

296
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,700
give it a lick right now one thing I do

297
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,370
think I'm crazy I like the outside I

298
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,110
don't like the gummed part I feel like

299
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,299
you just drag that guns-part around and

300
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,009
you waste it my joints tend to stick a

301
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:04,659
lot better if I lick the outside and

302
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:07,000
moisten that gum and don't lick it off

303
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,829
with my job all right before I light

304
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,500
this joint I should conclude my grinder

305
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:15,820
review Chop Shop grinder review it's a

306
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:18,370
little bit small but the small size is

307
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,590
okay because of how light it is this is

308
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,500
a much better backpack grinder it ground

309
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:25,570
my weed perfectly fine um I like the

310
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,399
little pollen catch that is actually a

311
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,810
Keeffe catch on the bottom here it came

312
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,639
with a little scooper so that when I do

313
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:33,309
have a nice collection I can scoop it up

314
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,710
um I'm going to say I approve of this

315

topic is going to be it's kind of a

335
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,290
double topic it's mail selection and

336
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,689
starting a breeding project I got

337
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:21,069
multiple emails about mail selection and

338
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,570
breeding projects I'm gonna choose two

339
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,050
of those emails and read them to you and

340
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,010
then we will also talk about pollen

341
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:29,679
storage and we'll talk about another

342
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:37,750
product so let's light this joint and it

343
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:40,359
will read an email I taste really good

344
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,919
I don't smoke a whole bunch of flower so

345
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,930
when I do light a big joint has some

346
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,789
weed that I grew it was dried and cured

347
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:52,959
perfectly and trimmed by me oh it's a

348
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:54,339
real treat oh it burns nicely I did a

349
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,480
good job you guys I wish somebody was

350
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,480
here to pass this joint to

351
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,289
okay we're gonna smoke this joint and

352
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:05,708
reading the email the email goes like

353
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:08,409
this

354
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:09,789
I Ross to Jeff I discovered your podcast

355
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:11,620
a couple of months ago and I become an

356
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,208
avid fan you present a perfect balance

357
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,120
of friendly personality and real

358
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:18,669
information many in fact I'd say most

359
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,769
cannabis podcasters do too much of one

360
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:22,719
or the other like many of your fans my

361
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:25,419
only problem is wanting more episodes

362
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,560
and for them to be longer I'm working on

363
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:28,120
the longer episode you guys I hope

364
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,099
you've noticed that the last episode was

365
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,778
a lot longer and when mike is here the

366
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,009
episodes get really long so I'm trying

367
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,009
to make them a little bit longer for you

368
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,930
this joint is just hitting like a champ

369
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,589
you guys I'm gonna keep puffing on it

370
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:46,359
whole areas cloudy already anyway the

371
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:48,129
email goes on to say I particularly

372
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,110
enjoy hearing all about your breeding

373
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:51,519
projects I was wondering if you might be

374
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,680
able to talk on the show about how you

375
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,750
would go about starting a small breeding

376
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,609
project from the ground up because it's

377
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,679
something I'd really like to explore in

378
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,839
the future I'd like to know about your

379
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,338
strategy for choosing strains or for

380
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,410
choosing traits and strains you want to

381
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:07,269
cross and how you keep a male you like

382
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:09,490
such as Solomon going for multiple

383
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:13,600
breeds and how long the process form

384
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:15,250
ideal idea to stable seeds takes also I

385
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,350
run the mom Department at a large

386
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,578
dispensary in Denver and because I have

387
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,379
limited space to work with

388
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:22,419
I have started using bonsai techniques

389
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:24,519
such as root pruning to keep the mom

390
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:26,318
small with this technique they live

391
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,929
fairly happy in a two gallon pot

392
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:31,509
indefinitely staying around a foot or

393
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:33,519
two tall so far my oldest is about a

394
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:35,620
year old and her clones still root and

395
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,058
produce healthy plants I was wondering

396
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,068
if you have any knowledge or experience

397
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:41,039
with this method that you would want to

398
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:43,838
share with someone who is trying it out

399
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,750
honestly um teach me that method please

400
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,459
because my mother plants grow so quickly

401
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,958
that I have to put them into larger pots

402
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,969
and this sounds like something that

403
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,558
would benefit me because I try to keep a

404
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,220
large amount of mother plants and I

405
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:59,230
don't have a lot of space so please send

406
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,180
me your tech on this share that with me

407
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,089
and I will talk about it more on the

408
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:05,979
show for other listeners so the email

409
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:07,779
goes on to say lastly I was hoping you

410
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,990
could give this dad amateur a few tips

411
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:12,360
on not coughing so hard after

412
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,839
thanks for all the great podcasts they

413
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,159

414
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,930
Jessica she actually says PS you can use

415
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,179

416
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:24,059

handle and I am now following you there

418
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,559
thanks for the email let's go over a

419
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:29,819
couple of those things real quick first

420
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,588
off thanks for the compliment you

421
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,970
started the email by complimenting me I

422
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:35,040
do appreciate that

423
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,839
I do need to learn more about your

424
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,969
mother plant tech but then you said you

425
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,370
were hoping that I could give you a few

426
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,950
tips on not coughing so hard after dabs

427
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,440
I am going to reveal some Jedi secrets

428
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,930
for you first off if you're coughing a

429
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,420
lot your nail may be too hot let that

430
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:53,489
nail cool go for some low temp dabs you

431
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:55,799
probably know that already so I'm going

432
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,399
to teach you some Rasta Jeff tricks here

433
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:02,458
I take gigantic dabs I know that a lot

434
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:06,120
of my lung health and how large my dabs

435
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:08,189
can be how able how my ability to take

436
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,810
large dabs directly correlates with my

437
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,060
level of hydration that's what I'm

438
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:14,399
trying to say if I don't drink enough

439
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:16,588
water and I get dry my lungs get sore

440
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,838
and I cannot take the dabs that I desire

441
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:21,150
to take it hurts so I have to stay

442
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,000
hydrated I have to drink plenty of water

443
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:26,939
the more water I drink the bigger dabs I

444
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,950
could take that is the truth also I have

445
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,290
to exercise my lungs and allow my lungs

446
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,709
time to rest your lungs are they need

447
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:33,750
rest

448
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,708
they're like a giant muscle they expand

449
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,850
and contract I don't know that they're

450
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,899
really a muscle but they work that way

451
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,339
they get bigger they get smaller they

452
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,389
grow you breathe in you breathe out

453
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,430
you're putting a lot of work on them

454
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:42,870
they need some time to rest I when I get

455
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:44,189
up I need to breathe for a little bit

456
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,509
before I take some dabs I have to get

457
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,709
the lungs going I have to get the heart

458
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:49,708
rate moving I got to get the blood

459
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:52,588
moving I do some breathing so then it's

460
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:54,509
time to dab I do not do like a pre dab

461
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,310
breathe exercise I just breathe

462
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:58,230
I like to let the lungs wake up let my

463
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:01,859
body get breathing then I'll take my

464
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,720
first dab if my first dad makes me want

465
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,828
to choke I can control my body I said

466
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,679
this to a friend I've said this to a

467
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:09,480
couple of people most of us if you get

468
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,309
like a leg twitch or a leg cramp or a

469
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,959
lay H or if your foot itches or

470
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:14,459
something you don't just fall on the

471
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,929
ground and start twitching and you don't

472
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,269
go out of control and you don't just

473
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:20,189
give up like if maybe your children do

474
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:21,990
that I've seen kids do it it's [ __ ]

475
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,569
hilarious but we don't do that as adults

476
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,209
so why would we let

477
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:27,558
lungs be out of control like you've got

478
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,429
control of your unless you're sick or

479
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:30,888
something I'm not trying to make fun

480
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:33,230
anybody but a normal human being a

481
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:35,089
normal adult person myself I would not

482
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,519
accept my leg just walking out from

483
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,869
underneath me that's not tolerated so if

484
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,120
my leg starts to get a cramp or

485
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:43,129
something I use my mind and I control my

486
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,109
legs and I say stand still [ __ ]

487
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,630
so I do the same thing with my lungs you

488
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:49,908
guys if I'm about to choke my lungs are

489
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,830
mine I do not have to let my lungs do

490
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:53,389
this rapid expansion and whoo-hoo-hoo

491
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:56,500
and make me choke and turn purple and

492
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:58,788
feel like [ __ ] when I'm about to cough I

493
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,038
breathe in as hard as I can you feel

494
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:03,378
that tickle you go your body goes your

495
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,298
chest does this instant move when I feel

496
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:08,089
that coming I breathe in as hard as I

497
00:18:05,298 --> 00:18:10,158
can and now I've just changed my lungs

498
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:11,119
mind it wanted to cough but it's like oh

499
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,860
he's I'm busy

500
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,538
I can't coffee coz he's got me inhaling

501
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:18,378
and then as soon as I get that breath as

502
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:20,869
far in me as I can I push out I parsed

503
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:22,609
my lips and I push my my smoke goes out

504
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:26,028
at this point I push out as hard as I

505
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:28,038
can but through parched lips I talked

506
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:29,509
about this in the past episode I keep my

507
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:31,669
lips kinda together to keep that air

508
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:34,099
coming out slowly so now there's

509
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:36,110
pressure on my lung but I'm not blowing

510
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:38,898
out all that smoke at one ridiculous

511
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:41,479
time and that's keeping my lung busy and

512
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:43,579
I can't I'm so busy focusing on that

513
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,399
breath that my lungs will not twitch I

514
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:48,980
am Jedi mind-trick myself I'm yoga

515
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:51,229
breathing I am Lamaze breathing and I'm

516
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,019
just tricking my body into not being

517
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,778
able to cough by keeping it busy there's

518
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:58,399
a guy by the name of wim HOF who teaches

519
00:18:56,778 --> 00:19:00,440
a lot of breathing techniques and a lot

520
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:02,839
of body healing technique just through

521
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,788
breathing a lot of yoga is based on

522
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:08,178
breathing a lot of meditation is based

523
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:11,720
on breathing um Lamaze is all breathing

524
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:13,970
I feel like if these things can get you

525
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,009
through huge situations in life women

526
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,110
use Lamaze to get through childbirth I

527
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:20,599
delivered a child I'm a father my child

528
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:22,369
was born at home I delivered that kid I

529
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,168
saw the kind of breathing that mama had

530
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:26,058
to do to not lose her [ __ ] it was the

531
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:27,889
only thing she had she could scream at

532
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:30,158
me she could have faith in whatever she

533
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:32,388
has faith in and she could breathe and

534
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,590
breathing is the one thing I could

535
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:36,990
physically see you

536
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:38,249
through the pain and the the challenge

537
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,888
of having a child so breathing is

538
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:42,298
magical control your breath that's what

539
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,678
I'm trying to say dolet you don't let

540
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:44,878
your legs run out from underneath you

541
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,070
you don't let your hand punch you in the

542
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:48,658
face you don't let your lungs spaz out

543
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:49,798
and cough just take a big breath

544
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:51,960
sometimes you got to go in through your

545
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:53,999
nose sometimes you got to go in through

546
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,340
the mouth you'll figure it out it's all

547
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:58,440
about just tricking your lungs and then

548
00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:00,148
once you get that huge powerful breath

549
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,249
going in and out just repeat that

550
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:03,869
feeling and it'll only take two or three

551
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:05,399
breaths to get your lungs to not even

552
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,408
want to choke anymore and once you get

553
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:09,148
good at it you'll be able to control it

554
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:11,909
a lot I'm not sure if what I'm doing to

555
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:14,099
myself is good for my body but I'm sure

556
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:16,110
that the violent coughing fits that you

557
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:18,628
get when you take too big of a dab are

558
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:20,819
not good for your body either so I am

559
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:22,980
probably saving myself some stress I

560
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:25,378
think that your lungs only get so many

561
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,269
expansion and contractions and inhales

562
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:28,648
and exhales and so many coughs before

563
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,999
something starts to go wrong there like

564
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:32,099
any car part or whatever if they're

565
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:34,499
gonna blow out and so I'm just trying to

566
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:36,628
get as many miles on my lungs as I can

567
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,490
without blowing them out that's what I'm

568
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:40,439
trying to do I think a lot of what I

569
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,720
learned the breathing technique came

570
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,210
from a man by the name of Sergio Herrera

571
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,278
I shout out to Sergio Herrera and Sergio

572
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,278
jr. when I was a youngster I took a

573
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:52,288
karate class instructed by master Sergio

574
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:54,450
Herrera and he taught us a lot about

575
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:56,128
breathing and now I'm remembering how

576
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,200
far back I've been using breathing

577
00:20:56,128 --> 00:21:00,898
techniques to calm my body and my mind

578
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,190
when we would run out of breath he would

579
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:03,778
work us the construct of the karate

580
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,700
instructor would work you until you were

581
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:06,960
exhausted and they would make you

582
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,399
control your breath he would make you

583
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,200
breathe in as deeply as you could

584
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:12,268
through your nose

585
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,830
and once you've got your lungs are

586
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:15,419
filled with their your chest is fully

587
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:16,829
expanded you feel like you're full he

588
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:18,809
would tell you breathing a little more a

589
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:19,980
little more and you just have to like

590
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:22,589
force in a little breath through your

591
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,358
nose and you're just trying to suck in

592
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:25,589
this last bit of air and then once he

593
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:27,778
thinks you're full and he's satisfied

594
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:29,249
until you cannot blow all the way out

595
00:21:27,778 --> 00:21:30,538
and he would make us blow out and he

596
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:32,519
would say there's more in there blow it

597
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:34,108
out and he'd be trying to for sure like

598
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:35,579
you'd be squeezing weird muscles to

599
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:38,220
force your lungs to push out that last

600
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:39,358
bit of air and your body would make

601
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,399
weird noises because you're trying to

602
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:42,509
push air out that's not there and then

603
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:44,189
he would immediately make you breathe

604
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:47,639
right in again as hard as you can now go

605
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:49,200
deep and that was how I would slow my

606
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:50,969
heart rate and my breathing and get

607
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,940
control get my composure again when I

608
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,710
was in a spar or a karate tournament or

609
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,330
a match and my heart rate my mind were

610
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,129
getting away or my breathing was getting

611
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:00,868
away that was their way to recenter and

612
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:03,118
it works it only takes two or three of

613
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:06,689
those five of those and you were on top

614
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:08,699
of your game all over again so the trick

615
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,710
to not coughing is control your lungs be

616
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,239
a Jedi about it keep your lungs busy

617
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,889
your lungs can't freak out and start

618
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:15,538
coughing if you're controlling them and

619
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:17,278
your mind and your lungs are stuck

620
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:19,470
together you're just focused on that

621
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,028
breathing that in and out the only

622
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,999
things you got to do breathe in breathe

623
00:22:21,028 --> 00:22:25,739
out so I do want to answer more of your

624
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:27,629
breeding question but I've got another

625
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:29,369
email that I want to read and I will

626
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:31,288
answer both of the questions kind of at

627
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:33,028
once so I'm finding the other email it's

628
00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:35,069
here in my phone I promise this email

629
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:36,329
has a lot of stuff going on so it'll

630
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:38,460
take me a second to get through it but

631
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:39,658
it goes like this and by the way just in

632
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,159
case you're wondering I'm a little more

633
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,389
than halfway through this joint I've

634
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,139
been puffing it when you don't hear me

635
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:48,748
talking and I'm getting well medicated

636
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:50,099
alright this email goes like this hey

637
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:51,600
Ross and Jeff how's it going I've been

638
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:53,730
listening to your podcast for a while

639
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,189
now and I have a few questions on

640
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:58,169
breeding I'm out here in Colorado just

641
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:01,619
doing it I have a new tree of life high

642
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:04,769
CBD strain going I had 100% germination

643
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:06,988
and 50% male to female ratio pretty

644
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:09,028
solid I'd say I was wondering when

645
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:12,149
selecting a male to use for pollination

646
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:13,589
as the father what do you look for that

647
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:15,148
is a very good question I'm gonna talk

648
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:17,398
about that in just a second but I want

649
00:23:15,148 --> 00:23:19,348
to get through your email you also say

650
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:22,589
do you do any testing on the leaves to

651
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:23,939
find CBD or THC content and he also

652
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:25,798
mentions that he's obviously

653
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,009
looking for the lowest THC possible as

654
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,869
to keep them under the point 3 percent

655
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:33,298
THC so if you want your plants to

656
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:37,979
qualify as hemp in Colorado they have to

657
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:39,628
test at less than 0.3 percent THC or

658
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,589
they are considered cannabis and you

659
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:42,569
can't sell them

660
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:45,359
you can't sell that flower as hemp flour

661
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:46,678
and it it has to be grown in a

662
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,658
completely different environment with

663
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,580
completely different licensing and if it

664
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:52,409
tests too high if you grow your hemp at

665
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:54,538
a hemp farm and it tests too high in THC

666
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:56,909
it must be destroyed so he's trying to

667
00:23:54,538 --> 00:24:00,119
breed and he's trying to keep it low THC

668
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:02,309
high CBD the email goes on to say is

669
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:04,528
there any truth and having males growing

670
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:06,690
next to females could make the females

671
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:09,000
hermie I heard that recently somewhere

672
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,379
so he's asking if having males grow next

673
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,778
to the females will make the females

674
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:14,548
herb no that will not make the females

675
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:16,528
herm if you have males near your female

676
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:18,628
plants I feel like the females know the

677
00:24:16,528 --> 00:24:20,069
males are there and they get stickier

678
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:24,449
and the trichomes get a little thicker

679
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:26,490
and it's like I think the female plants

680
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,649
can smell the males or they can feel a

681
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,480
pheromone or a hormone in the air and

682
00:24:28,648 --> 00:24:33,388
they get a little horny or and they show

683
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,278
more signs of wanting pollen so know I'm

684
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,500
having a male plant near your female

685
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:40,169
plants will not make the females herm

686
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,450
but what will happen is the males will

687
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:44,159
pollinate the females and it will not

688
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,500
take much pollen and it will not take a

689
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,940
lot of time so the females won't herm

690
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,579
they will seed because they were

691
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,169
properly pollinated now you say when

692
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:54,210
breeding when is the best time to hit

693
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:56,639
the ladies with pollen I'm gonna talk

694
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,950
about that here and more of my breeding

695
00:24:56,638 --> 00:25:01,918
rant when I combined the two emails with

696
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,179
one answer oh and I just realized that I

697
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,639
skipped right over your part about

698
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,070
asking about testing um I do not do any

699
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:10,500
testing on the leaves to find CBD or THC

700
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:12,298
content however that is a very useful

701
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,308
option that is available from our

702
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:16,250
friends at steep hill labs so if you

703
00:25:14,308 --> 00:25:18,690
want to do that I highly encourage that

704
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,538
that will give you an idea but it will

705
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,159
not give you the exact potency but it'll

706
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:24,869
give you an idea of what the ratios will

707
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,028
be so you can have the leaves tested

708
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:29,219
once again I would recommend steep hill

709
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:31,349
labs for that they can also do early

710
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,769
testing to tell you if your plants from

711
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:36,689
seed are males or females so I'm going

712
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:37,798
to continue with the email where was I

713
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,269
it also says

714
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,038
will they need six to seven weeks to

715
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:43,048
fully mature I'm gonna talk about that

716
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,419
in a little more detail in just a couple

717
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:47,278
of minutes ah you also go on to say I

718
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,278
have a lot of testing to be done on my

719
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:53,548
10 female fille nose 5 cherry yf3 and

720
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:56,398
five cobblers testing to begin at day 43

721
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:59,970
of flower to day 56 / phyno to find that

722
00:25:56,398 --> 00:26:01,469
highest CBD content and lowest THC

723
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,999
content good luck with your phenyl

724
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,249
hunting their phenyl hunting is always

725
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:07,889
fun I love doing a nice you know huh I

729
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:16,080

739
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:37,199
able to listen via iTunes you can get a

740
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,460
hundred episodes if you're listening

741
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,100

take you to the podcast to the best of

747
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:54,238
my knowledge there should be 100

748
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:56,939
episodes available there which will get

749
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:58,619
you all the way back to we're at 174 so

750
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,980
you'll get all the way back to about 75

751
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:04,048
which that's a lot of content however if

752
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,019
you do want the old stuff I plan on

753
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:09,628
putting the older episodes back into the

754
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:11,190
feed just read wrapping them is kind of

755
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,329
like new episodes I'll add a new intro

756
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,369
I'll talk to you a minute let you know

757
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:16,829
it's a repeat it'll put the old episodes

758
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:18,839
back if you're impatient and you don't

759
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:23,189
want to wait for that send me an email

760
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:25,949
and I will consider sending you the

761
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,350
files for older episodes I don't know

762
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,609
how many I can do at a time if I get

763
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:31,888
several people that want them together

764
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:33,418
I'll try to send them in chunks so if

765
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:35,878
there are a few of you that want those

766
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:37,080
old episodes in chunks send me an email

767
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:38,730
and I'll try to get them out to you guys

768
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:40,888
maybe this will get something going but

769
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,929
I do intend on putting them back into

770
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:44,758
the feed so like starting a round

771
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:47,340
episode 200 was kind of my idea we'll

772
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,960
get 200 episodes out and then maybe once

773
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:51,000
every two weeks or once a week on a

774
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,200
Thursday we'll just plop in well

775
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,029
episode I don't think I'm gonna start

776
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,880
with one cuz one was terrible but we'll

777
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:58,349
do like episode old episodes in not

778
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,000
perfect order but we'll do them in

779
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:02,219
chronological order but we may skip a

780
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,480
few so there there will be a way to hear

781
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,160
old episodes and if you're really dying

782
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,099
to hear those first few send me an email

783
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,110
we'll figure it out he goes on to say

784
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:11,969
all I do is garden and listen to podcast

785
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:13,679
and it was funny to hear the ones you

786
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,600
listen to were all the same ones I

787
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,610
listen to all the comic podcasts for

788
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,139
sure except bill burr is at the top of

789
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:21,990
my list and you had him down at the

790
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,680
bottom of yours yeah bill burr is a bit

791
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,779
much for me

792
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,580
he gets aw I know it's funny that I'm

793
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:28,259
sitting here doing a podcast by myself

794
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,480
but to listen to Bill burr rant by

795
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:32,490
himself on a podcast sometimes isn't my

796
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,319
favorite thing and he talks about [ __ ]

797
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,880
that I don't I'm not a sport he talks a

798
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,799
lot about goddamn sports and I don't

799
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,060
care about football at all so that's why

800
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,220
I don't listen to Bill burr as much as

801
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:43,710
some people I kind of religiously listen

802
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,779
to Rogan Doug Benson Joey cocoa Diaz

803
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,059
those are a lot of my favorites also

804
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:49,529
I've been listening to a podcast that I

805
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,079
think you guys would enjoy let me give a

806
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:53,369
shout-out to my friend bone Ellis she's

807
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,919
been getting a shout out in the past few

808
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:57,689
podcast but she's been reciprocating on

809
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:02,000
her show she does a great podcast about

810
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:04,259
cannabis her show is called the spliff

811
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,750
podcast and I know that I say the word

812

815
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,250
cottonmouth from smoking this whole

816
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:16,169
joint so I'm probably saying it even

quick drink so I'm gonna press pause and

833

834
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:56,370
going to rant a long time about starting

835
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:58,639
a breeding project and selecting a good

836
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:58,639
male

837
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:24,308

smoked that whole joint while we were

841
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,779
talking but something made me want to

842
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:33,400
take some dad's while I was taking a

843
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:34,569
break so I took a couple of dabs you

844
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,538

845
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:39,639
feel super good so let's get back to the

846
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:41,259
podcast you guys that asked for longer

847
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,640
episodes are truly gonna get what you've

848
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:44,558
been asking for in this podcast because

849
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,419
I've been going for 30 minutes now and

850
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,308
we're just about to get to the main

851
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:50,559
topic the main topic of course is

852
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:52,990
breeding setting up a breeding area and

853
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,158
also selecting your males and we'll talk

854
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:58,029
a little bit about selecting your

855
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,049
females for your breeding project all

856
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:00,369
right the first thing I should talk

857
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:03,220
about when you're gonna start a breeding

858
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:04,869
project is books or the books come into

859
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,730
play books are the first thing before

860
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:08,259
you do anything with cannabis before you

861
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,849
start growing before you start breeding

862
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:12,429
before you start doing anything with

863
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:14,288
weed you should read about it read about

864
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:16,269
growing be prepared know what's coming I

865
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:17,379
know you listen to a podcast it's all

866
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:19,869
about weed but I can't tell you

867
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,250
everything if you bought a basic grow

868
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:23,229
book and read it from beginning to end

869
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,460
and then started growing weed you would

870
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,839
be prepared for all the [ __ ] that's

871
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,419
coming and he wouldn't be in scramble

872
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,908
mode so books get some books read about

873
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:32,320
breeding ah just read the basics of

874
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:34,570
breeding two books that I can really

875
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:37,149
recommend are the cannabis breeders

876
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:39,668
Bible by Greg Greene that is available

877
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:42,730
online in a PDF for free so you have no

878
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:45,490
excuse go online type in cannabis

879
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,308
breeders Bible it'll pop up as a PDF in

880
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,048
google go read that also I truly

881
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:51,819
recommend a book that I'm pulling up on

882
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:53,769
my phone here it is called it's just

883
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:56,379
simply marijuana botany by Robert

884
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:57,940
Connell Clark I highly recommend both of

885
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,100
those books if you're going to do any

886
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,080
breeding if you want to read further

887
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:05,079
about cannabis growing I also recommend

888
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:08,349
anything for more Jorge Cervantes I also

889
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:10,240
like let's grow a pound I also like all

890
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:12,939
of the Ed Rosenthal Crowe books the ed

891
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,759
Rosenthal Oaksterdam course guide is a

892
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,490
great grow book in my opinion but start

893
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,529
with the cannabis breeders Bible then

894
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,359
move on to marijuana botany and you will

895
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:24,548
have a great basic understanding of

896
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,558
cannabis so once you have an

897
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:28,869
understanding of cannabis and a kind of

898
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,410
an idea for breeding you need to build a

899
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:32,019
grow

900
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:34,810
room or use your existing grow room for

901
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:36,639
a breeding area so a breeding room is

902
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:39,069
just like any other grow room you need a

903
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,600
grow light you need it sealed up you

904
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:43,389
need a sealed room so that when it is

905
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:45,969
dark a light seal is what I mean when it

906
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:47,680
is dark you cannot have any light coming

907
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:50,740
into that room so whenever you choose to

908
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,289
have your dark period for 12 hours at a

909
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,480
time there can be no light interruptions

910
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:56,500
no light leaks so you need a room with a

911
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,680
light on a timer

912
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,059
you need a controllable dark time you

913
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,830
need to be able to get water to that

914
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:05,889
room and you need to be able to get old

915
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:08,829
air out and fresh air into that room if

916
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:10,690
you already have a grow room it probably

917
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:12,639
can be used just like it is the only

918
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,529
thing you need to consider is pollen

919
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,420
that room is going to get filled with

920
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:19,470
pollen and wherever you were ducting

921
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,940
your exhaust pollen is going to go out

922
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:24,069
there so if you have an outdoor garden

923
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,680
and your ducting your your grow room

924
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:28,779
outside you may be blowing pollen right

925
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,210
into your outdoor garden if you have

926
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:33,220
another grow room that's in flower you

927
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:35,410
need to control where that pollen goes a

928
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:39,039
good way to keep tabs on pollen is water

929
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:41,860
water deactivates pollen you need to

930
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,519
find a way to either spray yourself your

931
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:47,619
plants both for Paul and control if you

932
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,059
use Paul if you get pollen in one room

933
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:50,679
you're going to the other flower room

934
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:52,210
you need to hose yourself down and you

935
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,710
need to spray down the female plants

936
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,860
that you don't want pollinated and

937
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,630
that'll keep the pollen away from them

938
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:01,509
so basically you need a grow room with

939
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,910
at least a 600 watt light or larger

940
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:06,789
people think people will say that you

941
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:09,309
can grow with the 400 or a 250 or an LED

942
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:10,989
or a t5 but I think a 600 watt light

943
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:12,820
isn't the smallest I would use for

944
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:14,799
breeding because I want strong healthy

945
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,600
plants with strong healthy seeds if

946
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,060
you're looking for an affordable way to

947
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:20,769
set up a breeding area and you don't

948
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:24,639
have a lot of space or a lot of funding

949
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:27,579
you can use a 5x5 or a 3x3 grow Hut I

950
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,918
like to use the 5x5 grow hut with a 600

951
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:32,230
watt or a thousand watt light the 600

952
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,359
watt light is plenty of light for a 5x5

953
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,159
Hut trust me in the summer I'll put a

954
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,630
600 in there in the winter I'll put a

955
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,789
thousand in there because of course you

956
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,200
can you can cool it much more easily in

957
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:42,759
the winter the rooms are cold anyway

958
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,989
because it's freezing outside so

959
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,510
just use that thousand watt light to

960
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:47,589
keep everything warm take advantage of

961
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,960
your surroundings guys that's what I

962
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:52,120
think I'm saying so get a five-by-five

963
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,990
Hut put a 600 watt light in there I like

964
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:58,150
to put a ducted hood in my Hut's so I've

965
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:00,189
got a five by five hut with a ducted I

966
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,930
think it's like the extra Sun six or the

967
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,820
Daystar six something like that just a

968
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:05,230
basic hood in there and it's got six

969
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,230
introducting coming off of both sides

970
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:10,329
and there is a hole for the ducting on

971
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,369
each side of the hut so that ducting

972
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:14,949
goes out of each side of the hut and on

973
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:16,989
one end I've got a blower with a carbon

974
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:18,219
filter so the air comes through the

975
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,559
carbon filter too through the blower

976
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:23,109
through the ducting into the hut over

977
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,969
the light out of the light out of the

978
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:27,340
hut and then it just blows that air into

979
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:28,989
the room I basically blows it into

980
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,789
another room for me is where I have it

981
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:33,039
running but what that does is it keeps

982
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:35,170
the light the heat from the light never

983
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,659
gets to go into my grow Hut so it kind

984
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:40,059
of keeps my hut a little bit cooler also

985
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:42,039
there's a six inch hole on the roof of

986
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:45,279
those grow huts I get a six-inch

987
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:48,159
Hydrofarm a blower and just set it on

988
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,840
top of the hut extracting air so it

989
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,819
sucks air out and when you zip up the

990
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,200
hut it kind of caves in a little bit

991
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,720
because of all the pressure but that's a

992
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,519
good thing because it's sucking air in

993
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:59,439
through the bottom it's sucking in fresh

994
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,300
air constantly and shooting out hot

995
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,039
stale air from the top all the time and

996
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,140
heat rises so I'm pulling in cool air

997
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,059
from the bottom of the room that the hut

998
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:08,889
is in and it's just shooting that air to

999
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:11,500
the top so I'm always having circulation

1000
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:13,599
in there I've got a light run in the

1001
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,909
light is being cooled so you've got two

1002
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,440
blowers you got a reflector with a light

1003
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:19,329
in it you've got a little bit of ducting

1004
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,460
and a five by five Hut that's basically

1005
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:23,980
all you need and you can set up a

1006
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,900
breathing room it would be helpful if

1007
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,119
you could have a separate space for your

1008
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,710
mail plant to start flowering and so

1009
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,269
that you can keep your males and females

1010
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,699
apart until the ideal time for

1011
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:35,380
pollination but it's not absolutely

1012
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:37,839
necessary if you're breeding for

1013
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,670
personal seed production if you keep the

1014
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,760
plants apart for a little longer you're

1015
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,860
able to make a lot more seed is mainly

1016
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,690
the reason for doing that so something

1017
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:49,930
else I want to mention I talked about

1018
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:52,480
pollen control pollen control is hugely

1019
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:54,460
important for flowering plants plants

1020
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,750
that are flowering from about from the

1021
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,340
time they show the hairs you guys call

1022
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,929
probably those are pistols those are

1023
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,970
calyx pistols from the times those are

1024
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:04,009
shown from the time those appear that

1025
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:06,649
plant is able to receive pollen and

1026
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:08,330
produce seeds so if your plants have

1027
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,019
pistols you need to keep pulling away

1028
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:12,049
from them

1029
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:13,789
vej plants cannot be pollinated do not

1030
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:16,190
worry about vege plants so if you have

1031
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:18,050
veg plants they'll be just fine but

1032
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,119
before you put them near flowering

1033
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,590
plants rinse them off with water any

1034
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,650
pollen that got on them will be

1035
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,850
deactivated you'll be just fine

1036
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:28,070
also if you've been in your garden and

1037
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:29,420
your garden has pollen in it and you've

1038
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,039
been messing with pollen or have you

1039
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,809
been pollinating your plants don't go to

1040
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,099
your friend's house that grow because

1041
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:35,900
you don't want to [ __ ] up their garden

1042
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,549
and seed their whole garden don't go to

1043
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,309
the gross store don't go to the

1044
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:42,890
dispensary change clothes take a shower

1045
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:44,630
be proactive don't [ __ ] up someone

1046
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:46,879
else's garden with your pollen and if

1047
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,349
you do have a male plant outside pay

1048
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,570
attention to who else is growing around

1049
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,579
you and you may be [ __ ] up someone

1050
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,780
else's garden just be be aware try to

1051
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:55,819
pay attention to what's going on like

1052
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,200
that alright so we talked about getting

1053
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,760
your room built we talked about Paul and

1054
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:00,859
control and how important Paul and

1055
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,110
control is let's talk about nutrients

1056
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:05,090
when you were breeding basic nutrients

1057
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,559
can be used for your males and females

1058
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,630
just your basic flowering newts

1059
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,159
I wouldn't use real heavy bloom boosters

1060
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,180
or anything like that it's not really

1061
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,129
necessary

1062
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:14,299
keep your nitrogen your phosphorous your

1063
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,340
potassium in there keep some

1064
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,260
carbohydrates come in maybe add a little

1065
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:21,050
bit of amino acids for healthy seeds but

1066
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:24,320
basically your basic feed is going to be

1067
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,400
just fine for your seeded plants all

1068
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,870
right so we've got a little breeding

1069
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,119
room bill and we know what to feed our

1070
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:30,889
plants now I feel like it's time to talk

1071
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,109
about selecting your plants for a

1072
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:35,779
breeding project a big part about

1073
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,010
breeding is having a goal in mind you

1074
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,810
need to have kind of an idea of what

1075
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,640
you're trying to create with your

1076
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:42,949
breeding project are you trying to make

1077
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,599
seeds for yourself so that you can keep

1078
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:46,730
growing in the future with fresh seeds

1079
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,559
are you trying to breed new strains are

1080
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,210
you trying to take a strain that is okay

1081
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,429
and improve it are you trying to

1082
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,769
backcross something have a goal in mind

1083
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:57,589
I think about what you're trying to

1084
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:59,329
create or you're trying to improve as a

1085
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:01,400
breeder it's your job to improve the

1086
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:04,069
cannabis plant and not go backwards if

1087
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:07,130
this seeds that come out of your

1088
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:08,750
breeding project are not better than the

1089
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,150
buds that they came from

1090
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,219
you can throw

1091
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,500
entire project away and start another

1092
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:16,838
breeding project you were trying to make

1093
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,338
something better all right so let's talk

1094
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:20,259
a little bit about selecting females

1095
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:21,869
something you will get from the books

1096
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,390
that I did not talk about earlier are

1097
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:27,849
charts you may want to learn about a lee

1098
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:30,400
arts and Mendel charts there are a lot

1099
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:31,900
of different charts to use they are very

1100
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,778
helpful if you're trying to target

1101
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,789
specific traits use charts if you're

1102
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:39,130
trying to create new crosses to see what

1103
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:40,359
you can do with your favorite strains go

1104
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,760
ahead and throw some pollen and see what

1105
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:45,338
happens but make sure you test those

1106
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,710
seeds very well before you give them out

1107
00:39:45,338 --> 00:39:49,150
to anybody all right something else I

1108
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,829
want to talk about is using stable

1109
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,809
females a lot of people will get a clone

1110
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:54,400
and they'll say hey I've got this plant

1111
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:57,460
I want to breed to it they'll get a male

1112
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,318
they put some pollen on it always grow

1113
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,750
out a new clone at least two or three

1114
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:04,210
times before you breed with it I like to

1115
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,849
put my females through a rigorous stress

1116
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,740
test before I breed with them I will put

1117
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:10,568
my female plants into flower I'll let

1118
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,489
them flower for seven to ten days and

1119
00:40:10,568 --> 00:40:14,980
then I will completely [ __ ] up the timer

1120
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:16,868
in the grow room on purpose and my goal

1121
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:19,269
is to try to make these plants

1122
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:21,099
hermaphrodite by stressing them with

1123
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:22,960
light stress by disrupting their photo

1124
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:25,568
period I'll turn the light on

1125
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,298
I'll go from 1212 and then I will turn

1126
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:30,548
it off for 24 hours and then I will turn

1127
00:40:28,298 --> 00:40:32,318
it on for 24 hours and then I'll put it

1128
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:34,538
back on 1212 and I'll pay attention to

1129
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:37,119
the plants some plants will herm with

1130
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:39,190
that much disruption some of them take a

1131
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,230
little more so I'll [ __ ] with them again

1132
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,450
I'll turn the light on for 24 hours

1133
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,909
again and then turn it off for 12 hours

1134
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:47,139
then turn it on for 6 or 8 hours then

1135
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:49,358
we'll go right back to the normal

1136
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:52,028
flowering cycle and I'll do this

1137
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,980
throughout the bloom phase and by day 35

1138
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:55,900
if something hasn't herbed I will

1139
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,429
consider it probably strong enough to go

1140
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,349
into a breeding project of course I'll

1141
00:40:57,429 --> 00:41:00,460
finish it out but I want to kind of [ __ ]

1142
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:02,230
with these plants and see if they're

1143
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,900
hermaphrodite or not on me from messing

1144
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,309
with them and causing them stress

1145
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,950
because the people that buy seeds are

1146
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:10,809
going to mess up and I want the progeny

1147
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:12,608
that comes from my breeding projects to

1148
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:14,410
be a little bit foolproof because I want

1149
00:41:12,608 --> 00:41:15,759
to give people a head start and not make

1150
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:18,159
them struggle from the beginning

1151
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,329
alright so use females that are tested

1152
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:21,429
that are trusted that you've grown

1153
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:23,530
several times I like to use females that

1154
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:25,000
have desirable traits that I love

1155
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,070
that I think I can make a little bit

1156
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,230
better breeding is kind of like cheffing

1157
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,640
you're about to put ingredients from the

1158
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,260
male plant with ingredients from the

1159
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,819
female plant together you're gonna stir

1160
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,050
them up and then you're gonna grow that

1161
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,300
and you're gonna have a cake and that

1162
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:39,280
cake is your finished buds so keep that

1163
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,960
in mind when you're making across you

1164
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,690
want a female that's got a good node

1165
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,970
structure that the inner node spacing is

1166
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:47,590
not too far apart on the main stalk you

1167
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:50,049
want a female that flowers and a good

1168
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,460
amount of time I like 70 day plants

1169
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,320
honestly a lot of people like plants

1170
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,539
that are done in 60 days I feel like a

1171
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,660
70 day flowering plant has a lot of time

1172
00:41:55,539 --> 00:42:00,550
to get the good quality sativa style THC

1173
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:02,139
buzz that I like the indica plants don't

1174
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:04,120
give me that head buzz that I like so a

1175
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:06,429
little longer plant something that

1176
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:09,009
smells real good and something that just

1177
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:10,750
grows real well and is desirable to

1178
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:12,850
smoke that's a female plant that you

1179
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:15,699
want to breed two plants with the water

1180
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:18,039
resin usually produce offspring with a

1181
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:20,230
lot of resin so the more resinous your

1182
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:23,860
female plants the more likely you are to

1183
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:26,230
produce resin a offspring so basically

1184
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,940
your favorite females are great for

1185
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,740
breeding everybody knows by now what a

1186
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:33,250
good female plant looks like that should

1187
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:35,469
be easy to find so have a goal find a

1188
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,119
female plant you can use more than one

1189
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,399
female in a breeding project there's

1190
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,289
nothing stopping you from putting I do

1191
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,019
several females in a room at one time I

1192
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:46,329
grow them kind of big and then I'll put

1193
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:49,719
you know I do probably six I like to do

1194
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:52,079
six seven gallon pots per thousand watt

1195
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:54,609
light and I fed them up to about just

1196
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,289
between me and waist-high I'm six foot

1197
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:59,320
five so I'm gonna say that's probably

1198
00:42:56,289 --> 00:43:01,389
about you know 20 24 to 28 inches tall

1199
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,640
bedroom about that tall and then I like

1200
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:05,319
to flower them and then when it's time I

1201
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:07,659
like to give up pollen and I get plenty

1202
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:10,030
of seeds from each plant sometimes each

1203
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:11,739
of those six plants under one light will

1204
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:14,769
be a different strain if I'm creating

1205
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:16,329
something new I will do six different

1206
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:18,869
plants and they're just to see what I

1207
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:21,400
can create and I'll run all of those six

1208
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:23,139
new crosses myself to see what I've

1209
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,599
created and if it's something that I

1210
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:27,699
love I will fill a light with just one

1211
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,769
strain and repeat the process and make a

1212
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:31,269
bunch more seeds so that we can put them

1213
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:32,920
to the market or we can just do whatever

1214
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:34,780
needs to be done with them so the first

1215
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,220
time I cross it I just do a whole bunch

1216
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,849
of plants in there and then I find the

1217
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:40,449
best

1218
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:43,930
that new products the best cross of that

1219
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:45,429
new project and I repeat those so it's

1220
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,960
kind of a process of elimination you

1221
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:50,078
guys the things that you see come to

1222
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,150
market from me is a very small portion

1223
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,400
of what I create I honestly don't

1224
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,170
continue a lot of things I'll so those

1225
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,088
six that I put under one light

1226
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:59,769
I'll put six different girls under there

1227
00:43:58,088 --> 00:44:02,619
I'll use one male and pollinate those

1228
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:04,959
maybe two or three of those will get

1229
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:07,119
repeated and the rest will get abandoned

1230
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,400
and I won't make more of that cross so

1231
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,079
you can put multiple females in the room

1232
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,269
for breeding and you can make multiple

1233
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,039
different crosses if you're making seeds

1234
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:16,568
for yourself that's a really fun way to

1235
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:19,960
do it then you can find a whole bunch of

1236
00:44:16,568 --> 00:44:21,659
great new things now I'm going to do a

1237
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,519
little bit of talking about male

1238
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:27,429
selection I did an entire podcast about

1239
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:29,108
selecting males episode number 121 of

1240
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:31,118
the girl from your heart podcast is all

1241
00:44:29,108 --> 00:44:33,578
about male selection if you want a

1242
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,900
really in-depth podcast about choosing a

1243
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:37,900
male for breeding check out episode

1244
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,880
number 121 it will give you a lot of

1245
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,099
information but if you don't want to go

1246
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,619
back and listen to that one here is the

1247
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:46,539
short course for this episode I choosing

1248
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:49,539
a male is very important because I think

1249
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:51,969
the male will provide a lot of the aroma

1250
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:53,859
a lot of the structure and a lot of the

1251
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:55,900
general health of the plant the pest

1252
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:58,239
resistance the mold resistance a lot of

1253
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,979
that is going to come from your male so

1254
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,769
something I look for in a male plant is

1255
00:44:59,978 --> 00:45:05,078
structure the way the plant is shaped is

1256
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:07,028
going to predict a lot of what your

1257
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:08,710
females are your offspring I'm sorry

1258
00:45:07,028 --> 00:45:11,440
your progeny are going to be shaped like

1259
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,478
so if you want a sativa dominant plant

1260
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,849
that gets kind of tall that grows really

1261
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:18,068
tall colas you want a male that gets

1262
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:20,140
tall and has really tall colas if you

1263
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:22,900
want a short stout indica dominant plant

1264
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:25,960
you want a male that grows short and

1265
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,809
stout and squat and it shaped the way

1266
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,099
you want it so think about what you want

1267
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,319
out of your breeding this is where

1268
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:33,640
having a goal comes into play so

1269
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:35,889
structure is important to me

1270
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:37,929
I like closed closed tight node

1271
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:38,469
structures so when that stem starts

1272
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:40,748
growing

1273
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:43,539
I want a set of branches to come out and

1274
00:45:40,748 --> 00:45:45,159
I want about you know an inch and then

1275
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:46,989
another set of branches coming out and

1276
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:49,509
then like an inch and then more branches

1277
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:51,099
nice close tight internodal spacing

1278
00:45:49,509 --> 00:45:52,900
that's something I really like

1279
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:56,019
another thing to really pay attention to

1280
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,700
is the aroma of my mail plants I like to

1281
00:45:56,018 --> 00:45:59,348
rub the stem with my fingers and then

1282
00:45:57,699 --> 00:46:01,719
smell my fingers and see what it smells

1283
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:04,568
like a plant that has a fruity smell is

1284
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:06,488
going to make fruity progeny when I am

1285
00:46:04,568 --> 00:46:08,469
breeding I kind of lean towards the more

1286
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:10,690
fuelie more funky sort of smelling

1287
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:12,338
things I have a male plant that smells

1288
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,170
like puke or vomit

1289
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:23,219
that is a great male for breeding I

1290
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:23,220
think it passes on all the time but

1291
00:47:04,259 --> 00:47:11,079
that's a golden goat if they call it

1292
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,359
arise the male that I have chosen from

1293
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,759
that is known as King Solomon because he

1294
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,078
is the king I know what he looks like

1295
00:47:15,759 --> 00:47:19,568
nine weeks into flower

1296
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:21,789
he keeps dumping pollen nine weeks into

1297
00:47:19,568 --> 00:47:23,829
flower that plant could probably go ten

1298
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:25,749
or eleven weeks no problem and stay nice

1299
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:26,829
and healthy with the way I feed it it

1300
00:47:25,748 --> 00:47:29,558
would look wonderful

1301
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:32,440
I know what my plants do so pay

1302
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,269
attention to the color that is going to

1303
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,009
pass on to your progeny if it turns

1304
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:38,318
orange if it turns purple if it turns

1305
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:41,769
yellow that is going to happen to the

1306
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:43,420
offspring so also speed of development

1307
00:47:41,768 --> 00:47:46,209
is something that I pay a lot of

1308
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:49,659
attention to I do not want the male

1309
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:52,420
plants that start flowering early if I

1310
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:55,358
get a 10 pack of seeds hypothetically

1311
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:58,568
five of those seeds will be males I do

1312
00:47:55,358 --> 00:48:00,489
not want the first two to show me that

1313
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:02,498
they are males and start dropping pollen

1314
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:04,679
I would like the third or fourth one is

1315
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:07,108
most likely going to be the plant that I

1316
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:09,838
choose for breeding maybe the fifth one

1317
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:12,389
but probably not and I'll explain why

1318
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:15,328
the plants that flower too early and

1319
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:17,429
right away are going to be too dominant

1320
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:19,710
in the breeding cross they're going to

1321
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:21,719
pass on way too much of their traits and

1322
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:24,119
they are not going to allow enough of

1323
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:27,568
the female traits to come across in the

1324
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:29,789
offspring so I eliminate the early

1325
00:48:27,568 --> 00:48:31,588
flowering males the male's that start

1326
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:34,318
dumping pollen the soonest they usually

1327
00:48:31,588 --> 00:48:37,019
get cold from my garden so I'm paying

1328
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:39,599
attention to how long it takes these

1329
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:41,400
plants to show me that they're males how

1330
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,650
long it takes for the male pollen sacs

1331
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,480
to start dropping and also how long it

1332
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:47,490
takes for the pollen sacs to open and

1333
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,679
start dropping pollen those are things

1334
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:51,629
I'm really paying attention to I also

1335
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,568
like to pay attention to how much pollen

1336
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,950
comes out and how long my plants will

1337
00:48:54,568 --> 00:48:58,650
keep dumping pollen those are things

1338
00:48:55,949 --> 00:49:00,210
that really matter to me I think a lot

1339
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,160
of pollen is important because I make a

1340
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:03,960
lot of seeds I like a plant that will

1341
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,279
keep going so that I can keep tapping it

1342
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,588
every couple of days and get some more

1343
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,710
pollen out of it if I need to I like a

1344
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:12,509
nice robust male a lot of times I'll try

1345
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:15,929
to find a male that looks very similar

1346
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:17,700
to a female that I like so if I got a

1347
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:19,588
ten pack of seeds and there was a female

1348
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:21,269
in there that I really liked it was the

1349
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:23,279
perfect female out of the ten pack I

1350
00:49:21,269 --> 00:49:25,289
hope for a male that has the same shape

1351
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,269
and the same characteristics as that

1352
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:28,769
female because I know that's gonna kind

1353
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:31,500
of pass on those traits that I'm looking

1354
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:32,940
for so something that I do not like out

1355
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,489
of a breeding plan is something that

1356
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:37,470
gets really tall something that starts

1357
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:39,509
stretching and has a lot of inner node

1358
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:41,338
space it's going to make too much fiber

1359
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,530
it's gonna be more hemp than cannabis

1360
00:49:41,338 --> 00:49:45,179
you're gonna get a big stretchy plant

1361
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,040
that's something I try to stay away from

1362
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:48,568
if you've got a male that is just

1363
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,219
shooting above the canopy of all the

1364
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,900
other plants just pull that one out

1365
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:55,139
because it's gonna create problematic

1366
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,880
progeny alright so mainly you want a

1367
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:59,190
male with a good structure that smells

1368
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,588
good it produces trichomes that grows

1369
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,780
the way you want it usually if you get a

1370
00:50:01,588 --> 00:50:05,369
10 pack and you get five males you're

1371
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,269
gonna want that third or fourth male is

1372
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,190
gonna be your breeder

1373
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:10,798
that's my intuition that's usually what

1374
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:12,809
I've noticed so find the traits to that

1375
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:14,309
one kind of notice that look for one

1376
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:16,470
that looks like a female that you like

1377
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:18,600
and then you should have yourself a nice

1378
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:20,489
quality male plan

1379
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:23,279
make sure that it dumps plenty of pollen

1380
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:26,819
make sure that it produces nice big fat

1381
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,769
flower clusters you want big tight fat

1382
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,450
male flowers you don't want big fluffy

1383
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:32,400
sparse male flowers you want it to have

1384
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:35,250
a you want it to look like a big cola of

1385
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,510
male flowers the more male flowers the

1386
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:38,190
better that means you're gonna pass on

1387
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:42,030
that trait and you're gonna produce big

1388
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:44,130
fat female buds so fat male clusters are

1389
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:45,780
going to be a super desirable trait

1390
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,849
another thing you should not breed with

1391
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:51,180
you guys any plant that has ever shown

1392
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:54,150
any sign of hermaphrodite breed with any

1393
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:56,940
hermaphrodites if it shows bananas ever

1394
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:58,559
do not breed with it alright so now we

1395
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:00,960
know how to select females we know how

1396
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,150
to select males here is something else I

1397
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,909
want to talk about if you were breeding

1398
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:07,829
to narrow down specific traits if you

1399
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:10,469
want your progeny to look like a certain

1400
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:13,289
thing then it is a good idea to select

1401
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:14,639
one male if you've got a female and

1402
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:16,769
you've got a male and you're trying to

1403
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,049
get this part of this male on this part

1404
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:22,199
of this female into your cross it is

1405
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:25,620
wise to use one male plant however if

1406
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:28,289
you want to open up the breeding and see

1407
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:32,309
what you can create it's always fun to

1408
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:34,889
use multiple males of the same cross so

1409
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:36,389
if you have got let's let's just say

1410
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:39,719
arise if you're trying to breed with a

1411
00:51:36,389 --> 00:51:41,639
rise if you want to make a rise to let's

1412
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:44,489
what did I do arise - arise - lemon scum

1413
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:47,039
I call it a Firefly so you take a rise I

1414
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:50,039
made a rise to lemon skunk I used one a

1415
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:52,559
rise male to one lemon skunk female

1416
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:55,289
because I knew what I wanted I wanted to

1417
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,750
put this robust growth from a rise this

1418
00:51:55,289 --> 00:52:00,420
Cola size from a rise and this node

1419
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:03,300
structure and this thick branching into

1420
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:05,579
this really flavorful yet kind of wispy

1421
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,470
lemon Scott cross that I have so that

1422
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:09,449
was my goal so I knew that I wanted King

1423
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:11,459
Solomon by himself to pollinate that

1424
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:14,819
lemon skunk because my goal was the

1425
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:18,179
cross of those two however if I wanted

1426
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:20,430
to see what I could create without

1427
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:22,019
narrowing it down and since I plan on

1428
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:24,269
selling these seeds and putting it to

1429
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:26,099
market I wanted it to be a very close

1430
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:27,539
representation I wanted to be able to

1431
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:29,670
predict what I was making is what I'm

1432
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:32,119
saying if I wanted to open up the

1433
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:34,369
breeding and kind of create some chaos I

1434
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,170
but multiple arise males in there I

1435
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:38,839
would grow out a bunch of her rice seeds

1436
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:41,150
and I would find four males and then I

1437
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:44,480
would put those four males in with

1438
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:46,610
whatever female plants I chose to and I

1439
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,349
would use the pollen from all four of

1440
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:50,059
those arise males and that's called an

1441
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:52,940
open pollination and what that's going

1442
00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:54,829
to do it is going to show a lot of

1443
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,170
different phenotypes because now I've

1444
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:58,969
got four different fathers in there so

1445
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,460
I'm going to get a lot of recessive

1446
00:52:58,969 --> 00:53:04,189
traits from that male wine that I would

1447
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:06,079
not have brought out by using one male

1448
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,220
so if you want to narrow down traits if

1449
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,860
you're trying to narrow down your

1450
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:11,869
breeding it get specific traits out use

1451
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,700
one male if you're trying to open up the

1452
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:16,190
breeding and find new cool [ __ ]

1453
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:19,129
use multiple males and that is called

1454
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:21,380
open pollination for the multiple male

1455
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:23,809
method or for the single male method you

1456
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,910
can use one female or you can use

1457
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:27,739
multiple females however you do it the

1458
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:30,049
thing is when you do harvest keep all of

1459
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:32,269
those seeds very well labeled and be

1460
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:34,010
honest with everybody about the work

1461
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:35,960
that you did people that are growing the

1462
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:38,840
seeds that you create deserve to know

1463
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,400
exactly what they're getting alright

1464
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,440
that's enough talk about selection I

1465
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,510
feel like I got you through choosing

1466
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,400
your males and choosing your females now

1467
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:48,170
let's talk a little bit about timing

1468
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,119
your breeding project let's talk about

1469
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:53,150
the male pollen drop and the female

1470
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:56,029
ovulation times male plants like to drop

1471
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:58,220
their pollen sometime between day 14 and

1472
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:00,590
day 21 it could start a little bit

1473
00:53:58,219 --> 00:54:02,719
earlier I have never seen it start

1474
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:05,809
earlier than day 12 or 13 but around day

1475
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:07,309
12 or 13 usually 14 or 15 those male

1476
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:09,409
pollen sacks are gonna open up and

1477
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:11,389
pollen is going to start coming out of

1478
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:14,329
those male plants I've never seen it

1479
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:18,079
start any later than day 21 it rarely

1480
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:20,509
takes that long female plants are able

1481
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,340
to receive pollen as soon as they have

1482
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:23,660
pistols as soon as you see those little

1483
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,430
white hairs sticking up out of your

1484
00:54:23,659 --> 00:54:28,039
female plants they are able to receive

1485
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:30,679
pollen however the ideal time for them

1486
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:34,639
to receive pollen is not until around

1487
00:54:30,679 --> 00:54:36,679
day 25 to 32 if they received pollen too

1488
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:39,109
early you're not going to get a lot of

1489
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:40,549
seed if you pollinate too early your

1490
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:42,829
plants are really little there's not a

1491
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:45,060
lot of space for a seed to develop there

1492
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:46,710
are not a lot of bud sites so there's

1493
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:48,960
you just don't have as many seeds if you

1494
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:50,940
wait too long your calyx pistols missed

1495
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,309
their prime the plants are no longer

1496
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,500
ready to breed and you will not make as

1497
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:57,650
many seeds as you wish you would have so

1498
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:01,559
if you hit the pollen on to the females

1499
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:04,800
between days 25 and 32 you will get the

1500
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:07,769
most out of your pollination okay now

1501
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,840
here is a big part of breeding the

1502
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:11,940
timing of breeding is a huge challenge

1503
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:14,910
your male plants are going to start

1504
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:17,070
dropping their pollen around day 15 your

1505
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:20,579
female plants are not ready for pollen

1506
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:23,370
until around day 25 to 32 so the trick

1507
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:26,190
is you need to keep that male plant away

1508
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:28,380
from your female plants for about 10

1509
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,300
days while there if you start them at

1510
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,820
the same time you got to keep them apart

1511
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,160
for about 10 days or you're not going to

1512
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,660
get as many seeds as you want so there

1513
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:38,940
are a few ways to do this you can either

1514
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:41,549
keep your male in another area to where

1515
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,159
the pollen can't get to the females you

1516
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,870
can start your females a little bit

1517
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,239
early you can start flowering your

1518
00:55:45,869 --> 00:55:49,980
females 10 days before your males that

1519
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:51,750
way there are ten days ahead that way

1520
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,820
when the male starts dropping pollen you

1521
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:55,050
can just they'll be timed up you can get

1522
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,690
the females ten days ahead

1523
00:55:55,050 --> 00:56:00,090
there'll be twenty five days into flower

1524
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:02,579
when your male is fifteen days into

1525
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:04,200
flower that'll give you a week window to

1526
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:06,299
get the pollen onto the plants and

1527
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:08,549
hopefully you can time it up perfectly

1528
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,140
hopefully you ran your male plant at

1529
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,580
least one time before you bred with them

1530
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:13,619
and you know how long it's going to take

1531
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:15,179
for him to start dropping pollen and it

1532
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:16,949
makes this math equation a little bit

1533
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:19,500
easier you need him to be dropping

1534
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:22,739
pollen when your plants are 25 to 32

1535
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,630
days into flower another thing you can

1536
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:26,699
do is you can collect the pollen in a

1537
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:29,400
jar and you can apply it to the plants

1538
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:31,349
at the perfect time one good thing about

1539
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,820
having the pollen in a jar is that if

1540
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:34,769
you are running a normal crop that you

1541
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:37,260
don't want to seed everything you can

1542
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:38,789
pull one plant aside you can take it to

1543
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:41,160
another area and you can just use a

1544
00:56:38,789 --> 00:56:43,110
q-tip and dip that q-tip into the pollen

1545
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:45,059
you can apply it to a couple of bud

1546
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:46,620
sites that you want to pollinate mark

1547
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:49,590
that branch so that you know it got

1548
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:51,119
pollinated let it so let them let that

1549
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:52,769
plant sit for a little while let that

1550
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,309
pollen soak in let it do what it needs

1551
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:55,920
to do

1552
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:57,420
then get a sprayer and spray that plant

1553
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,860
off with water and it will deactivate

1554
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,200
all of the loose palm

1555
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:03,210
then go to your grow room and spray

1556
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:04,980
hopefully you cleaned your clothes to go

1557
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:06,570
to your grow room and spray all of those

1558
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,179
plants with water before you return that

1559
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:10,860
plant to the grow room and you should be

1560
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:13,049
able to make just a few seeds for

1561
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,059
yourself if you're very careful you must

1562
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:16,830
be very careful and you'll get better at

1563
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:18,119
this as time goes on but it's an idea if

1564
00:57:16,829 --> 00:57:20,190
you've got that jar of pollen sitting

1565
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:21,929
there the options are endless

1566
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:24,030
you can pollinate one plant you can

1567
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:27,389
pollinate the entire crop I've always

1568
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:29,370
got a jar of pollen on hand so let's

1569
00:57:27,389 --> 00:57:30,690
talk about pollination you guys there

1570
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:32,639
are a couple of really easy ways to

1571
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,679
pollinate your plants you have a male

1572
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:36,269
plant that is dropping pollen and you've

1573
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:38,219
got female plants that are ready for

1574
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:39,989
pollen you can either take the male

1575
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:42,449
plant right into the Grove where the

1576
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:44,579
females are and give it a nice shake and

1577
00:57:42,449 --> 00:57:46,469
just watch that cloud of dust come out

1578
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:49,170
of it all that pollen is now airborne

1579
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:50,939
it's going to land on your females every

1580
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:54,059
piece of pollen that touches a pistol

1581
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,530
will now be absorbed it'll become a seed

1582
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:58,349
that you have just pollinated your

1583
00:57:55,530 --> 00:58:00,269
plants you can set that male plant in

1584
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:02,579
front of a fan and just turn the fan on

1585
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:05,280
and watch it blow pollen all over your

1586
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:08,519
female plants you can cut the plant down

1587
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,860
and carry it into the room and you can

1588
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:12,690
actually smack it up against the female

1589
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:16,680
plants if you want I have done and seen

1590
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:18,720
this done and it works last time I had

1591
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:20,159
my I had my male plant way too big the

1592
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:21,809
last time I did a breeding project there

1593
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:22,949
was no moving it because if I would have

1594
00:58:21,809 --> 00:58:24,750
moved it pollen would have gone

1595
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:27,179
everywhere I did not want to waste that

1596
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:29,579
much pollen I had a small area of

1597
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:31,889
females I walked over to the male plant

1598
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:34,139
and I cut a branch off of the male plant

1599
00:58:31,889 --> 00:58:35,519
and when I cut it a little bit of pollen

1600
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:37,710
came out because of the scissor click

1601
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:40,259
but I held the branch I gave it a cut

1602
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:42,720
and I walked that branch over to the

1603
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:44,220
females and I held it just a couple of

1604
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,959
inches above the female plants and I

1605
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:48,299
gave it a nice shake and you could just

1606
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,949
see the cloud of pollen come out I gave

1607
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,470
it another shake and then I flicked it

1608
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:54,719
just you know just a flick just like

1609
00:58:52,469 --> 00:58:57,449
that and tons of pollen came out it

1610
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:59,429
probably took one medium-sized branch to

1611
00:58:57,449 --> 00:59:01,379
pollinate an entire white worth of

1612
00:58:59,429 --> 00:59:02,699
plants of course I used two or three

1613
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:05,880
branches because I wanted to make sure

1614
00:59:02,699 --> 00:59:07,500
to get enough pollen in there so you can

1615
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,630
either move the male plant to the room

1616
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,969
and leave it alive and give it a shake

1617
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,760
and let it pollinate naturally you can

1618
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:14,319
put a fan

1619
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,360
in front of it and blow it around I've

1620
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,860
actually seen guys hit the fan with the

1621
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,300
male plant so well that way it hits it

1622
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:21,970
it just [ __ ] explodes pollen

1623
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:24,250
everywhere ah you can cut a branch off

1624
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:26,109
and carry the branch to the room also

1625
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,940
another thing that you can do if you've

1626
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:29,470
got a jar of stored pollen and I'm gonna

1627
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:31,179
teach you how to store pollen next if

1628
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:32,829
you've got a jar of stored pollen all

1629
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:36,219
you've got to do is take that stored

1630
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:38,440
pollen and I just stick my hand my

1631
00:59:36,219 --> 00:59:39,669
gloved hand into the jar of pollen I've

1632
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,590
got a rubber glove on I just put the

1633
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:43,329
hand right in there and now my glove has

1634
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:45,100
pollen stuck to it and I'll just go and

1635
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,929
kind of sprinkle above the plants and

1636
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:49,239
just touch the plants and they will get

1637
00:59:46,929 --> 00:59:51,519
pollinated by that you could put some in

1638
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:53,469
your hand and blow it if you want all

1639
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,659
you need to do is get that fancy dust

1640
00:59:53,469 --> 00:59:58,179
that fairy dust that pixie dust all over

1641
00:59:55,659 --> 01:00:01,059
the pistils of your girl plants and they

1642
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:03,549
are now pollinated you know the plants

1643
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:05,320
are pollinated because when that pollen

1644
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:07,720
touches it will take very few minutes

1645
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,820
but the white hairs that you guys talked

1646
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:12,009
about the pistils everyone calls them

1647
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:13,809
hairs the pistils will start to curl up

1648
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:15,490
and turn brown that's how you know

1649
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:17,590
they've been used they are now

1650
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:19,179
pollinated they'll start to shrivel up

1651
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:20,650
and get weird sometimes the leaves will

1652
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:22,989
do funky things when the plants get

1653
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,639
pollinated it's all plant specific but

1654
01:00:22,989 --> 01:00:27,279
you'll definitely see the pistils get

1655
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:29,199
brown and curved and withered and

1656
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:33,519
they'll look like they expired nothing's

1657
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:36,309
wrong that is exactly what you want so

1658
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:39,009
let's see those seeds are going to take

1659
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:41,349
about 40 to 50 days to get ready

1660
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:46,510
from pollination so if you pollinate on

1661
01:00:41,349 --> 01:00:49,210
day 25 around day 65 to 75 your seeds

1662
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:51,070
will be ready grow it just like normal

1663
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:52,599
keep feeding it like you normally do

1664
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:55,120
don't give it as much boosters I talked

1665
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:56,589
about that earlier still flush because

1666
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,389
there's going to be material that will

1667
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:01,329
be turned into hash we'll talk about

1668
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:03,449
harvesting your seeds I should talk

1669
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:06,269
about collecting and storing pollen

1670
01:01:03,449 --> 01:01:09,099
before we get to harvesting your seeds

1671
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:12,039
pollen collection is very easy you've

1672
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:15,099
got that male plant it's growing you can

1673
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:17,349
either set a plate just a white dinner

1674
01:01:15,099 --> 01:01:18,819
plate underneath your plant as long as

1675
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:21,009
you don't have any fans blowing or

1676
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,480
blowers blowing it around the pollen

1677
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,520
will fall directly out of the plant

1678
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,480
gravity will take it right down and it

1679
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:28,940
will gather on that plate

1680
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,530
you can use a mirror you can use I used

1681
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:32,450
an old drum head one time I'm a drummer

1682
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:34,460
I put a 22 inch kick drum head

1683
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:35,989
underneath my mail plant and all the

1684
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,760
pollen that fell landed inside the kick

1685
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:40,429
drum head so once you've got all that

1686
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,170
pollen gathered do not let it get wet if

1687
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:43,460
water touches that pollen it's [ __ ]

1688
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:46,250
it's over it's useless

1689
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:48,530
once the pollen falls onto the plate or

1690
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:52,130
the drum head or whatever it lands on -

1691
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:53,420
I used my ID or a credit card and I just

1692
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:56,599
scooped it up into a nice little pile

1693
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:59,240
and then I let it dry you need the

1694
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:01,519
pollen to get completely dry if there

1695
01:01:59,239 --> 01:02:02,719
are little male flowers that fall in

1696
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:04,130
there when you're collecting the pollen

1697
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,719
pick those out because they have

1698
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:07,550
moisture and they'll [ __ ] up your pollen

1699
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:09,199
they will make that pollen inactive

1700
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:12,350
it'll get funky it'll get chunky it

1701
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:13,789
won't be any good so if you're patient

1702
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:16,039
and you've got the room and the time

1703
01:02:13,789 --> 01:02:17,690
just put something underneath your male

1704
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:19,460
plant and let it drop pollen and then

1705
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:21,050
you can collect it that way naturally if

1706
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:22,909
you don't have the space and you're not

1707
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:25,970
that patient or maybe you want to get

1708
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:28,279
more pollen more quickly an easy thing

1709
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:30,799
to do is I like to cut the branch off

1710
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:33,050
the plant and then I hold it over the

1711
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,480
plate and I just tap it with my finger

1712
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:38,359
right directly on to the plate and then

1713
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,559
you get a lot of pollen just Falls you

1714
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:41,989
can use a mirror you can use a

1715
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:44,090
Tupperware dish something glass is ideal

1716
01:02:41,989 --> 01:02:46,189
because this it doesn't stick as well

1717
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:48,590
and it doesn't get static so if you've

1718
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:53,179
got like a mirror or a big dinner plate

1719
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:54,829
or a sushi plate is ideal cut the branch

1720
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:57,230
off hold it over the sushi plate in a

1721
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:59,750
room with no wind and away from all your

1722
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:02,179
female plants just tap I use tap tech is

1723
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:03,920
what I call it just tap that that that

1724
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:05,539
pollen right out of the branch just tap

1725
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,190
it right onto the plate right under the

1726
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:10,329
mirror and just let it dry and then

1727
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:13,039
scoop it up and put it into a glass jar

1728
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:15,679
it is a good idea to put a silicate

1729
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:18,409
package in there not above it a pack you

1730
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:20,539
do not want to keep it humid you want a

1731
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:22,608
silicate pack that will dry it out you

1732
01:03:20,539 --> 01:03:24,769
want it as dry as it can get

1733
01:03:22,608 --> 01:03:27,739
pull all the male flowers out get it in

1734
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:29,679
a jar and let it get completely dry and

1735
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:33,319
then if you want to store that pollen

1736
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:34,549
just put it in a cool dry dark place a

1737
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,980
lot of people like to put it in the

1738
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:39,619
refrigerator I do not do that I've got a

1739
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,478
filing cabinet that is in a basement I'd

1740
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:43,400
put it in there it stays in the back of

1741
01:03:41,478 --> 01:03:45,618
the filing cabinet it's cool it's dry

1742
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:48,048
and it's dark and that pollen stays good

1743
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:50,059
for a long time I have used that pollen

1744
01:03:48,048 --> 01:03:53,088
six months after I've stored it and it

1745
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:55,069
has been completely viable another good

1746
01:03:53,088 --> 01:03:56,088
way to catch pollen is a pollen

1747
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:57,798
collection bag

1748
01:03:56,088 --> 01:04:00,018
my friends at Oort solutions on

1749
01:03:57,798 --> 01:04:01,400
Instagram sent me these bags I don't

1750
01:04:00,018 --> 01:04:03,798
know what this material is made out of

1751
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,719
it's a thick paper it is almost like a

1752
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:07,909
filter it feels like a filter for maybe

1753
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:09,858
a thick coffee filter but they made a

1754
01:04:07,909 --> 01:04:11,929
bag out of it and it's got a little

1755
01:04:09,858 --> 01:04:14,900
clear plastic window in it so you can

1756
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:17,328
see inside but what this bag is for I'll

1757
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:19,969
you slide it over this would probably

1758
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:22,009
fit if you drew a small male plant you

1759
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:23,659
could almost fit the entire male plant

1760
01:04:22,009 --> 01:04:25,670
in there if you trimmed off the lower

1761
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:28,248
branches and just use that one main cola

1762
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:30,739
you could fit an entire plant or a large

1763
01:04:28,248 --> 01:04:32,598
branch in there that would probably be

1764
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:34,818
the top cola of one of my plants would

1765
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:36,318
fit right inside there then you seal it

1766
01:04:34,818 --> 01:04:38,568
at the bottom with either some tape or a

1767
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:41,028
rubber band and when it starts to

1768
01:04:38,568 --> 01:04:43,099
pollinate the pollen cannot get out of

1769
01:04:41,028 --> 01:04:45,289
the bag but the air can flow through the

1770
01:04:43,099 --> 01:04:46,519
bag so that the plants will live they

1771
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:48,950
don't die because they're still getting

1772
01:04:46,518 --> 01:04:50,629
light and air but when the plant starts

1773
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:52,578
to drop its Paul and you can watch the

1774
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:53,900
pollen come out and the pollen doesn't

1775
01:04:52,579 --> 01:04:55,548
go anywhere it stays right inside the

1776
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:57,349
bag so once you feel like you've got

1777
01:04:55,548 --> 01:04:59,150
enough pollen or like that plant is

1778
01:04:57,349 --> 01:05:02,028
expired and it's gonna quit making

1779
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:04,460
pollen you can cut the branch and then

1780
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:06,018
open the bag up and take the bud out or

1781
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,818
the branch of the plant take that out

1782
01:05:06,018 --> 01:05:09,768
give it a good shake before you take it

1783
01:05:07,818 --> 01:05:11,719
out and then all of your pollen will be

1784
01:05:09,768 --> 01:05:14,868
contained inside that bag and you can

1785
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:16,309
pour that into a jar or whatever type of

1786
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:18,559
container you're gonna keep it in and

1787
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:20,749
then pull out the male flowers get your

1788
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:23,239
silicate pack in there and now you have

1789
01:05:20,748 --> 01:05:26,328
got pollen that you gathered on your own

1790
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:29,028
and a bag also this bag works in Reverse

1791
01:05:26,329 --> 01:05:31,789
if you want to pollinate one branch of a

1792
01:05:29,028 --> 01:05:33,018
plant so you have that jar of pollen you

1793
01:05:31,789 --> 01:05:34,729
take your plant like I talked about

1794
01:05:33,018 --> 01:05:37,129
earlier take it to a safe place with no

1795
01:05:34,728 --> 01:05:39,558
wind use a q-tip or a paintbrush dip it

1796
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:42,259
into your jar of pollen paint that on to

1797
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:44,569
a bud then you put this bag over it and

1798
01:05:42,259 --> 01:05:46,519
then that will prevent that pollen from

1799
01:05:44,568 --> 01:05:48,978
getting into the rest of your grow room

1800
01:05:46,518 --> 01:05:51,588
so it works as a catch or as sort of a

1801
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:52,939
pollen condom it's a great device if you

1802
01:05:51,588 --> 01:05:53,389
guys are interested in one they do not

1803

1811
01:06:10,449 --> 01:06:15,230
alright so that is how you collect your

1812
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:17,210
pollen storing pollen I told you how to

1813
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:19,969
do that just keep it in a cool dry dark

1814
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:21,380
place now let's talk about harvesting

1815
01:06:19,969 --> 01:06:23,329
your seeds you guys I've been going for

1816
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:25,070
an hour and six minutes and honestly my

1817
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:26,829
voice is starting to get tired so I'm

1818
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:30,470
gonna start going a little more quickly

1819
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:33,110
harvesting seeds is very easy just like

1820
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:35,419
any other harvest about 14 days before

1821
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:37,280
you begin harvesting start flushing your

1822
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:40,070
plants all you have to do is feed your

1823
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,810
plants clean pH balanced water for the

1824
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:44,090
last ten to fourteen days of your

1825
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:46,369
flowering cycle and your plants your

1826
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:48,230
buds will taste much better when you

1827
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,489
smoke it yes I know we're growing seeds

1828
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:51,500
right now but there is going to be

1829
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:53,029
material left over you may want to roll

1830
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,949
a joint you may want to turn it into

1831
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:57,530
extracts you may want to make edibles

1832
01:06:54,949 --> 01:06:58,909
out of it so please do flush it flushing

1833
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:01,340
is free I don't know why people don't

1834
01:06:58,909 --> 01:07:03,649
flush it's 14 days that you don't have

1835
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:05,990
to use nutrients water is going into the

1836
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:08,090
plants anyway it's [ __ ] flush I don't

1837
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:10,519
get why people don't do that so 14 days

1838
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:12,110
before harvest start flushing 2 or 3

1839
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:14,119
days before you chop down the plants go

1840
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:16,039
in the grow room and pull off all of the

1841
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:17,839
large leaves any big leave with the PD

1842
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:19,429
eleni leave that's in the way go ahead

1843
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,769
and take it off the plants are gonna get

1844
01:07:19,429 --> 01:07:22,909
harvested they do not leave they do not

1845
01:07:21,769 --> 01:07:25,969
need those leaves

1846
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:28,309
so at harvest time here is how I do it

1847
01:07:25,969 --> 01:07:30,500
this is what works for me I like to chop

1848
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:33,079
down the entire plant I like to hang

1849
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:35,210
that plant upside down I put a label on

1850
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:37,039
it so I know exactly what plant that is

1851
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:39,949
I look right the date on it so I know

1852
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:42,980
what day I chopped it down I like to let

1853
01:07:39,949 --> 01:07:45,259
the plants hang upside down until they

1854
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:46,880
are crispy dry you guys were pulling

1855
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:49,370
seeds out of here we're not gonna dry

1856
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,800
and cure this bud let it get crispy dry

1857
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:53,989
sometimes if you let it get too dry

1858
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,760
seeds will start falling out of it so

1859
01:07:53,989 --> 01:07:57,649
what I like to do is put something

1860
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,380
underneath each plant I leave them far

1861
01:07:57,650 --> 01:08:02,539
enough apart to where if I've got strain

1862
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:04,940
a and strain B and seeds fall out I know

1863
01:08:02,539 --> 01:08:06,190
that those seeds are not gonna mix I'll

1864
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:08,920
put a

1865
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:11,619
or a box or some sort of catch container

1866
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:13,030
underneath the plants to catch any stray

1867
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:14,318
seeds that fall out sometimes I don't

1868
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,970
even care about the stray seeds that

1869
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:17,859
fall out because I have so many that I

1870
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:19,630
don't even worry about it I sweep them

1871
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:22,239
up and they go in the trash sometimes

1872
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:24,520
they get given away as mystery seeds to

1873
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:26,588
friends but hang the plants upside down

1874
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:28,359
let them dry let them get crispy once

1875
01:08:26,588 --> 01:08:30,429
the plants get nice and dry and crispy I

1876
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:32,859
cut them into sections that are more

1877
01:08:30,429 --> 01:08:35,440
manageable and I put them in a long

1878
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:37,660
tubberware container and I just let them

1879
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:39,519
dry even further if I've got a whole

1880
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:41,769
bunch of strain a I will put all of

1881
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,900
strain a into one container if it fits

1882
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:46,029
and then I put on some rubber gloves and

1883
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:47,710
honestly I just start mushing up the

1884
01:08:46,029 --> 01:08:50,109
buds with my fingers and it just starts

1885
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:51,730
crumbling it just starts falling apart

1886
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:54,310
and you can just hear the seeds come

1887
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:55,649
raining out the seeds just come falling

1888
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:58,600
out of the buds if you did it correctly

1889
01:08:55,649 --> 01:09:00,818
so cut down the plants let them dry

1890
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,469
until they're crispy cut them into

1891
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:04,449
manageable sections put them in a

1892
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:06,548
container either a pie plate a

1893
01:09:04,448 --> 01:09:07,928
Tupperware container some sort of thing

1894
01:09:06,548 --> 01:09:09,969
that when the seeds fall out it's not

1895
01:09:07,929 --> 01:09:11,739
gonna roll away start crushing it up

1896
01:09:09,969 --> 01:09:13,359
wear some gloves crush it up you're

1897
01:09:11,738 --> 01:09:14,979
gonna hear the seeds come out now you're

1898
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,989
gonna have little stems you're gonna

1899
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:19,358
have dried bud material and you're gonna

1900
01:09:16,988 --> 01:09:22,119
have seeds you can throw all the stems

1901
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:23,469
away put all the seeds in a jar and then

1902
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:25,329
you've got a bunch of bud material that

1903
01:09:23,469 --> 01:09:27,310
you can either make edibles out of you

1904
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:30,759
can give it to a friend you can extract

1905
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:33,009
it you can smoke it I personally like to

1906
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:34,500
make hash with my material that comes

1907
01:09:33,009 --> 01:09:36,609
from my seeded plants because I think

1908
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:38,289
something happens to the plant when he

1909
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:40,179
gets seated in the oil that comes from

1910
01:09:38,289 --> 01:09:43,088
it I like to make BHO the hash oil that

1911
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:45,850
comes from it seems to get me a little

1912
01:09:43,088 --> 01:09:48,250
bit better of a high a different high it

1913
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:49,929
feels like it does something that normal

1914
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,640
hash doesn't do when it's made from

1915
01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:52,210
plants that were not seated that's just

1916
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,130
my opinion

1917
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:55,929
so that's how you harvest your seeds

1918
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:58,600
basically cut down the plants let them

1919
01:09:55,929 --> 01:10:00,039
dry put it over a container and crumble

1920
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:02,170
the seeds out hopefully you get a bunch

1921
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:05,319
of seeds hopefully you have big round

1922
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:07,359
tiger-stripe seeds something that I like

1923
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:08,829
to do that you may want to do when you

1924
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,569
think the seeds are getting close to

1925
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:13,269
ready you'll be able to see them in the

1926
01:10:10,569 --> 01:10:15,279
buds there's nothing wrong with going to

1927
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:17,679
a lower part of the plant and popping

1928
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:19,359
out one seed every now and then and

1929
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,930
investigating it until you think it's

1930
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:21,609
ready it's

1931
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:23,530
better to ruined one or two seeds and

1932
01:10:21,609 --> 01:10:26,380
cut down the whole plant early and ruin

1933
01:10:23,529 --> 01:10:28,509
everything so about 30 days after

1934
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:29,920
pollination I'll go in there and I'll

1935
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:31,810
just pull out one of the seeds it's

1936
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,550
probably gonna be white it's probably

1937
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:35,230
gonna be small it's probably not gonna

1938
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:38,380
be ready but now I've got an indicator

1939
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:40,599
of where I am I want to wait until the

1940
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:41,980
seeds that I pull out are hard you want

1941
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,960
to be able to put it on a table I'm

1942
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:45,549
sitting at a wooden table that's a

1943
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,289
wooden table I want to set the seed on

1944
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:49,539
this table and push with my finger as

1945
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:51,699
hard as I can and I don't want that seed

1946
01:10:49,539 --> 01:10:53,289
to crack that's how I know they're ready

1947
01:10:51,699 --> 01:10:54,489
don't push as hard as you can you guys

1948
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:56,439
don't hurt yourself but you want to be

1949
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:58,539
able to push nice and hard on that seed

1950
01:10:56,439 --> 01:11:00,279
and it you don't want them to crack if

1951
01:10:58,539 --> 01:11:02,350
they're white if they're soft they're

1952
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:04,389
not ready you want big fat fluffy

1953
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:06,430
tiger-stripe seeds some seeds that I

1954
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:08,710
make do not ever get a tiger strike they

1955
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:10,180
turn this gray color they are ready not

1956
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:12,250
all seeds are gonna get a tiger strike

1957
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:13,930
what else do I need to talk about you

1958
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:15,909
guys the people that asked for a long

1959
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:17,560
podcast you're welcome I'm an hour and

1960
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:19,569
11 minutes in and I have still got a

1961
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,710
little bit of material I want to thank

1962
01:11:19,569 --> 01:11:21,759
you guys for listening to this long

1963
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:23,079
episode I know I'm trying to get

1964
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,730
rambling I'm starting to get tired my

1965
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:27,340
voice is worn out so I'm gonna keep

1966
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:29,589
going storing seeds is very easy I just

1967
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:31,690
keep my seeds in a mason jar I keep them

1968
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:34,210
sealed and I keep them in a cool dry

1969
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:36,579
dark place they're actually in a very

1970
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:38,680
similar place to where I keep my pollen

1971
01:11:36,579 --> 01:11:41,680
so now you've got a bunch of seeds the

1972
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:44,650
next thing to do is to grow them out one

1973
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:48,100
thing I want to mention is please do not

1974
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:50,109
sell untested seeds that's [ __ ] up

1975
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:52,810
don't do that if you make some seeds

1976
01:11:50,109 --> 01:11:54,189
grow them germinate them write down how

1977
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:56,020
many you started right down the

1978
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:58,359
germination rate if you don't get at

1979
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:00,190
least a 70% germination rate try two or

1980
01:11:58,359 --> 01:12:02,019
three times if you don't get at least a

1981
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:03,939
70% germination rate something's wrong

1982
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:07,390
with the seeds they do not need to be

1983
01:12:03,939 --> 01:12:09,819
sold don't sell untested seeds flour

1984
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:12,460
them all the way to the end if they are

1985
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:14,559
hermaphrodites don't sell them if they

1986
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:17,350
are not quality seeds that make quality

1987
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,730
plants do not sell them if seven out of

1988
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:19,930
ten of those plants that come out of

1989
01:12:18,729 --> 01:12:21,969
there are not something you would be

1990
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:24,490
proud of smoking and be proud of posting

1991
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:26,470
a picture of all over Instagram do not

1992
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:28,359
put that seed line out there are better

1993
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:31,000
seeds out there you can throw seeds away

1994
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:33,039
it is okay you can grow them yourself if

1995
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,760
you want to that is fine but please do

1996
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:36,550
not put them in

1997
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:38,289
hands of unsuspecting growers you can

1998
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:40,659
give your seeds away to your friends if

1999
01:12:38,289 --> 01:12:42,430
you tell them hey dude I haven't tested

2000
01:12:40,659 --> 01:12:44,529
this hey dude I'm not sure what this is

2001
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:46,090
gonna do you can give those away but

2002
01:12:44,529 --> 01:12:48,759
please do not try to make any money off

2003
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:50,170
of untested seeds don't mislead people

2004
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:54,190
with what you're giving them that is

2005
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:57,310
wrong also if you like I said a minute

2006
01:12:54,189 --> 01:12:59,829
ago it's okay to toss something if you

2007
01:12:57,310 --> 01:13:01,450
make a cross if you take pollen and put

2008
01:12:59,829 --> 01:13:02,979
it on this plant and you make a bunch of

2009
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:06,399
seeds and you grow a hundred of those

2010
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:07,989
seeds and they are not way improved on

2011
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:09,670
what you started with if the buds that

2012
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:11,409
come out of that are not better than the

2013
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:13,630
buds that came from the original female

2014
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:15,430
plant you did not do any justice to that

2015
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:19,119
breeding project you need to get rid of

2016
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:21,490
it don't don't make C don't keep seeds

2017
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:24,130
just it out of pride don't be prideful

2018
01:13:21,489 --> 01:13:25,989
don't be arrogant get rid of some [ __ ]

2019
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:27,730
that is not contributing to making

2020
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:28,479
cannabis a better plant that's not what

2021
01:13:27,729 --> 01:13:30,729
we're here for

2022
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:32,649
don't be afraid to toss bad stuff if

2023
01:13:30,729 --> 01:13:35,139
you're wasting time growing shitty seeds

2024
01:13:32,649 --> 01:13:37,210
you were cock-blocking yourself from

2025
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:39,220
growing good seeds you could throw away

2026
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:41,260
that bad [ __ ] you could plant more you

2027
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:43,480
might find fire that's something that I

2028
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:44,619
really wanted to talk about all right so

2029
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:46,419
you got a bunch of seeds that you made

2030
01:13:44,619 --> 01:13:48,250
yourself the next step is to grow them

2031
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:50,380
and find out what you made that's always

2032
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:52,420
the funnest part right there so plant a

2033
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:54,159
bunch of seeds see what comes from it

2034
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:56,260
see if you made a whole bunch of freaks

2035
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:58,119
see if you just made the next chem dog

2036
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:00,280
you never know what you could have made

2037
01:13:58,119 --> 01:14:02,109
until you grow it so draw it out see

2038
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:04,719
what you've got if you're just making

2039
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:06,339
seeds for yourself you can stop or you

2040
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:08,890
can keep going the next step would be to

2041
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:10,869
make an f2 which would be to find a male

2042
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:13,090
and a female that have the perfect

2043
01:14:10,869 --> 01:14:14,920
traits and breed them together and then

2044
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:17,319
you'll make more seeds those seeds are

2045
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:18,609
called f2 you'll find the perfect male

2046
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:20,649
and the perfect female out of those

2047
01:14:18,609 --> 01:14:22,479
breed those together again those will be

2048
01:14:20,649 --> 01:14:24,729
your f3s the seeds come at it there will

2049
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:27,219
be the f3 the idea then is to keep going

2050
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:30,039
all the way to f5 and once you get to f5

2051
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:32,650
every seed that you crack will come out

2052
01:14:30,039 --> 01:14:34,390
looking like a clone of the other one

2053
01:14:32,649 --> 01:14:35,949
you'll have exactly what you want nailed

2054
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:37,630
down of course if you're just making

2055
01:14:35,949 --> 01:14:38,920
these seeds for your own personal garden

2056
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:40,510
you can stop right here where you are

2057
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,310
with this original cross and you can

2058
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:43,900
have fun growing that and then you can

2059
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:46,480
cross those seeds two more and you can

2060
01:14:43,899 --> 01:14:47,439
cross those two other things but the

2061
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:50,709
options are

2062
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:52,238
endless once you get this far alright I

2063
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:53,529
think I've got one more part to talk

2064
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:54,968
about I'm gonna press pause and take a

2065
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:57,519
DAB in a drink and when I get back I'm

2066
01:14:54,969 --> 01:14:58,600
going to talk about keeping male plants

2067
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,630
and then we're gonna wrap up this

2068
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:02,980
podcast

2069
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:05,980
okay I'm back let's do a quick talk

2070
01:15:02,979 --> 01:15:07,959
about keeping male plants around I keep

2071
01:15:05,979 --> 01:15:11,289
male plants just like I keep a female

2072
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:13,810
mother plant I like to keep it in a semi

2073
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:16,210
large pot a five gallon or bigger if you

2074
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:19,180
can keep it in an air pot or a root pot

2075
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:20,710
that is ideal the reason for that is to

2076
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,960
keep the plant from getting root bound

2077
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:24,670
and I feel like the root pots kind of do

2078
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,170
a little bit of root pruning for me so

2079
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:27,609
the plants won't get root bound because

2080
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:29,980
when they do get root bound you'll start

2081
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:32,170
seeing stress problems and some plants

2082
01:15:29,979 --> 01:15:35,259
like to try to auto flower if they do

2083
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:38,050
get root bound so I like a big pot I

2084
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:40,390
like a nicely aerated soil or a soilless

2085
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:43,239
mix maybe makes a little bit of cocoa in

2086
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:45,130
there it's ideal to keep your mother or

2087
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:46,479
father plants this as a father plant is

2088
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:48,400
what I would call this it's ideal to

2089
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,579
keep your mother and father plants under

2090
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:53,589
either 18 6 or 24 hours of continuous

2091
01:15:51,579 --> 01:15:57,119
light one thing that I have shifted to

2092
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:59,920
that I learned from DJ shor I run a 19-5

2093
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:03,340
cycle for my mother and father plants I

2094
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:05,649
feel like 19 hours on gives them plenty

2095
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:07,630
of time for growth and the five hours

2096
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:09,369
off gives everything time to rest I

2097
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:10,869
think everybody wants time to sleep the

2098
01:16:09,369 --> 01:16:13,390
plants want to sleep and also my

2099
01:16:10,869 --> 01:16:15,609
equipment needs some rest so I think the

2100
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:18,070
five hour break is good for everything

2101
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:19,779
I like the shorter rest period because

2102
01:16:18,069 --> 01:16:21,279
that way I know that none of my plants

2103
01:16:19,779 --> 01:16:23,649
are going to decide that they're gonna

2104
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:25,389
try to flower and then I get to keep my

2105
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:26,769
mother plants and father plants forever

2106
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:28,600
because if you do keep a plant for a

2107
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:30,670
long time if it's around for a long time

2108
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,860
the hormones move around sometimes it'll

2109
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:35,020
get old and it will try to flower on you

2110
01:16:32,859 --> 01:16:36,939
if you give it some darkness sometimes

2111
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:39,280
plants will try to OTO flower on you if

2112
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:42,460
they get rootbound so I try to keep them

2113
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:44,139
under the nineteen hours on five hours

2114
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:46,300
off you can do eighteen six or you can

2115
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:48,489
do 24 hours on all three of these

2116
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:50,079
options will work just depending on the

2117
01:16:48,488 --> 01:16:52,539
strain that you've got and what your

2118
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:56,140
goal is so I like to keep it in a large

2119
01:16:52,539 --> 01:16:57,909
pot good soil keep it on a vegetative

2120
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:59,860
light cycle and then something that I

2121
01:16:57,909 --> 01:17:00,920
like to do is I take a lot of clones

2122
01:16:59,859 --> 01:17:03,769
from it and I like

2123
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,929
to prune it very often and I also keep a

2124
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:08,239
backup of my male plants somewhere else

2125
01:17:05,929 --> 01:17:09,800
in a totally different location so that

2126
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:12,799
if something does go wrong with King

2127
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:15,230
Solomon at the a location there's a

2128
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,420
clone of King Solomon at the B location

2129
01:17:15,229 --> 01:17:20,000
just because he's my prized male so as

2130
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:21,920
long as you keep your plant in a large

2131
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,840
pot with good soil under a vegetative

2132
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,670
light it should continue to veg

2133
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,550
indefinitely you should be able to take

2134
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:30,500
clones off it fit forever I would feed

2135
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:32,960
my mother and father plants just basic

2136
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,448
vegetative nutrients give them grow a

2137
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,948
and grow B or whatever grow nutrients

2138
01:17:35,448 --> 01:17:39,049
you're using maybe a little cow mag

2139
01:17:36,948 --> 01:17:41,678
occasionally and I like to feed them

2140
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:44,480
kelp products and before I take clones

2141
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:47,630
between 12 and 24 hours before cutting

2142
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:49,968
clones I like to spray my plants with a

2143
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:52,279
kelp product may be liquid karma or

2144
01:17:49,969 --> 01:17:54,619
something like that but mix up some

2145
01:17:52,279 --> 01:17:56,269
liquid karma adjust the pH and foliar

2146
01:17:54,619 --> 01:17:58,130
spray your mother or father plants

2147
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:00,170
before taking clones is some great

2148
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:02,060
advice the email that I read at the

2149
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:03,800
start of the show actually said that the

2150
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:06,170
listener keeps their mother plants in

2151
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:08,179
two gallon pots and keeps them about two

2152
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:10,190
feet tall and does some root pruning so

2153
01:18:08,179 --> 01:18:12,440
I'm hoping that we get a reply from them

2154
01:18:10,189 --> 01:18:14,629
and they are going to teach us how to do

2155
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:14,839
that and I will teach you guys how to do

2156
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:17,840
that

2157
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:20,000
in a future episode ladies and gentleman

2158
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,529
my throat and my voice are burnt out so

2159
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,630
it is time for me to wrap up the show

2160
01:18:21,529 --> 01:18:26,359
before I go I want to tell you about a

2161
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:28,880
service called patreon patreon is a

2162
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:30,589
service that will allow my listeners to

2163
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,480
make a financial contribution to the

2164
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:34,310
podcast I'm not trying to get rich off

2165
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,559
this podcast I'm not asking anybody to

2166
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:38,449
pay for the podcast this podcast will

2167
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,070
always be free because it comes from my

2168
01:18:38,448 --> 01:18:42,589
heart and I want everybody that listens

2169
01:18:40,069 --> 01:18:44,929
to grow better cannabis but if you feel

2170
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:47,000
like this episode was worth a dollar or

2171
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:48,289
two dollars or however much you feel

2172
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,969
like it was worth if you would like to

2173
01:18:48,289 --> 01:18:52,698
make a contribution all you have to do

2174
01:18:49,969 --> 01:18:54,319
is go to patreon.com slash girl from

2175

01:18:57,529 --> 01:19:01,340
you can contribute as little as one

2179
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:03,260
dollar and I honestly don't think there

2180
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:05,449
is a limit on how many zeros you type in

2181
