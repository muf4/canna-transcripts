64
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,870
still working with stitcher to resolve

65
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:23,389
the technical issues that happen

66
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,849

00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,079
some people some episodes randomly will

68
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,569
not play for people the only people

69
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,580
experiencing the technical issues are

70
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,949
people who are listening to the podcast

71
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,500
through the stitcher application on an

72
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:38,569
Android device sometimes it works for

73
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,889
you sometimes it doesn't I'm not sure

74
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,419
what's causing it we thought we had it

75
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,889
narrowed down we corrected a couple of

76
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:45,409
things it has done it again

77
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:47,329
I will keep working at getting that

78
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:49,370
resolved if you can't listen to the

79

almost gone because it is so delicious

109
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,909

110
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,530
straight isolated crystals he brought me

111
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:54,349

Terps and he also brought me a sample of

113

the two combines so I've got the Terps

114
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,450
I've got the crystals and then I've got

115
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,840
the saucy mixture put together at a

116
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:06,469
beautiful ratio you guys the mixture

117
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,270
smells like cupcake frosting and cookie

118
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:10,250
dough and then we need to take a dab of

119
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,230
it it tastes like you just took a big

120
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,060
bite of cookie dough with cupcake

121
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:15,619
frosting on it and then when you blow it

122
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,449
out it smells like somebody's baking

123
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,120
fresh cookies in the room it smells like

124
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:22,370
warm chocolate chip and cinnamon cookies

125
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,310
filling the room this concentrate is

126
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,019
excellent it is super smooth I took a

127
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,339
couple of gigantic dabs there was no

128
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,349
throat tingle there was no

129
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:32,869
heaviness on the exhale super smooth

this this stuff tastes amazing the only

135
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:45,289
problem is that it is almost gone I've

136
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,019
probably got one or two dabs before this

137
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,270
stuff is extinct so bro come back with a

138
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:52,969
bigger jar and let's uh let's make a

139
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:54,859
deal all right you guys I'm obviously

140
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,540
loving these cream dabs grown and

141
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,850
extracted by a local farmer hey bro

142
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,129
great work I truly do appreciate it in

143
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,110
fact this episode is gonna be really

144
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:04,579
long so I've got all the opening

145
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,620
business covered I'm gonna press pause

146
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:08,449
I'm gonna take a dab probably the last

147
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,569
two dabs of this cream and when I get

148
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:12,949
back I will give a long lesson on drying

149
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:16,370
and curing your freshly harvested

150
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:18,709
cannabis plants all right podcast rolled

151
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,538
I am back I am well medicated I am well

152
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:22,538
hydrated and I am ready to talk about

153
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:25,939
drying and curing your freshly harvested

154
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:27,740
cannabis plants now let me do a quick

155
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:29,899
update from the last episode in the last

156
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,340
episode we talked about harvesting your

157
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,870
plants we talked about cutting them down

158
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:34,788
we talked about hanging them in a room

159
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,100
upside down in a climate-controlled room

160
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:39,889
one thing I failed to mention you should

161
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:50,180
only hang one crop in a space at a time

162
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:51,769
to prevent remoisturize encountered in a

163
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,329
fresh crop and lock that in the same

164
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:55,279
room because what you're doing is just

165
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:57,019
introducing a whole bunch of moisture

166
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,579
into that room and it's just gonna go

167
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:00,079
into the other plant so you're going to

168
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:02,029
re moisten the other plants and make

169
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,649
them take longer and now you've got to

170
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:06,888
kind of restart your dry and cure

171
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:08,989
process so one one crop at a time is

172
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,129
ideal hanging in the room that's

173
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,470
something I should have mentioned on the

174
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:14,389
episode before and I didn't remember to

175
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,030
mention that so now we are up to speed

176
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,430
now let's actually get into drying and

177
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:22,519
curing our freshly harvested cannabis

178
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:26,240
plants now after spending four weeks and

179
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,889
veg eight to ten weeks and flower you

180
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,410
really don't want to mess these plants

181
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:33,620
up at the very end here curing is a very

182
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,990
critical process curing you can make the

183
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,788
most delicious buds taste like total

184
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,340
[ __ ] from drying and curing them

185
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:41,629
improperly you can ruin the entire crop

186
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:42,259
at this point don't get too scared

187
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:44,209
because I'm

188
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,039
guide you through not ruining it but

189
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:48,409
keep in mind that this is one of the

190
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,840
most critical parts in the growing

191
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,800
process this is a huge process and a lot

192
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:54,469
of things can go wrong

193
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,139
if you don't pay attention so take your

194
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,650
time and pay attention and don't rush to

195
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:02,539
smoke your new crop you've waited what

196
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,489
what do we say about 14 weeks probably

197
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,470
is what we did the math on 120 days

198
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,960
you've grown these plants for 120 days

199
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,210
is about how long it takes why not wait

200
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,279
a couple of days longer until they are

201
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:15,169
perfect before you start smoking it so

202
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,869
let's get it actually drying and curing

203
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,550
these plants now the last grow episode

204
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,319
was a harvest episode and it left us

205
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,509
with our plants hanging upside down in a

206
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,759
room with proper temps proper humidity

207
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:28,189
and minimal light now we've been waiting

208
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,719
for the sticks for our plants to snap

209
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:31,670
we've got plants hanging upside down

210
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,860
they've been deal Eve we're just waiting

211
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,830
for the right humidity within the plants

212
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,629
for the sticks to pop the sticks should

213
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,430
snap we're waiting for him to snap but

214
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:42,769
not explode when you grab a branch of

215
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,170
the plant and you just bend it you want

216
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:46,579
it to sound kind of like that you don't

217
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,750
want it to go Shh

218
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,250
you don't want it to explode with

219
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,199
dryness you don't want it to fall apart

220
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,259
and you don't want it to be gummy or

221
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,719
rubbery or bendy you don't want it to to

222
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:59,149
bend you want it to snap and pop so the

223
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,860
stick should snap ah the bigger sticks

224
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:03,349
and larger plants are going to take a

225
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,910
little bit longer the skinnier sticks

226
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,530
and smaller plants are obviously going

227
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,960
to dry more quickly because they don't

228
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:11,779
hold as much moisture also if you took

229
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,609
off Leslie for more relief they're going

230
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:14,750
to dry more quickly without the leaf and

231
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,610
they're going to take a little longer

232
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,839
with that extra leaf on there because

233
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,819
it's going to hold more moisture

234
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,009
there'll be more moisture in the room

235
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:24,860
just more moisture overall to deal with

236
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:27,560
so we're waiting for is those sticks to

237
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,990
snap when the sticks snap that's when

238
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,479
the container curing process begins I

239
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,370
use two different methods for this based

240
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,259
on crop size don't forget that I run

241
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,370
commercial grows and a commercial

242
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,809
setting we do things a little

243
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,060
differently than we would do in a home

244
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,529
setting I'm used to pulling down 50 or

245
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,019
more pounds in a commercial environment

246
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,250
you don't want a bunch of jars you don't

247
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,899
really have the space for a bunch of

248
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,940
jars you don't have the manpower to open

249
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,980
a bunch of jars all day so we do things

250
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,590
a little differently in a home grow it's

251
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,220
not as many pounds it's less jars so I

252
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,139
use jar technique and

253
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,019
grow but let's talk about the way I

254
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:03,059
would do it in a commercial grow in a

255
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,009
commercial grow I'll chop the largest

256
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,649
stalk and naked stems out of the plants

257
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:10,049
and place the buds still on sticks into

258
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,039
large Rubbermaid containers so you've

259
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,649
got a big plant

260
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,969
you've lollipop tup probably 12 to 18

261
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,409
inches of it so you've got some naked

262
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,870
sticks right that's what I mean by naked

263
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:21,000
sticks the the shaved legs and that main

264
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,159
big stalk I'll cut all of that out and

265
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,899
that goes to waste and a commercial grow

266
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,289
that's actually got to be weighed and

267
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:30,870
documented as removed waste so now I've

268
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:32,250
got two piles one pile is naked sticks

269
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,509
that need to be documented as waste

270
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,669
they'll be chipped up and thrown away

271
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:37,259
then there's another pile that's the

272
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:39,629
usable product of the sticks with buds

273
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,360
up it they need to be trimmed those buds

274
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:45,000
still on the sticks get put into the

275
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,409
Rubbermaid containers untrimmed now

276
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,090
here's something to keep in mind

277
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:50,399
carefully label your Rubbermaid

278
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,519
containers do not label the lids never

279
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,409
label lids in a facility and a home grow

280
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,049
don't label the lids lids are

281
00:09:55,409 --> 00:10:00,600
interchangeable label the container so

282
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:02,849
chop the sticks out put the good usable

283
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,290
buds into the Rubbermaid container don't

284
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,389
squish them in there too tight fill it

285
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:07,679
up pretty well but don't cram anything

286
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,699
in there you need some air space in

287
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,139
there and you don't want to smash

288
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,390
anything and if it's too tightly pressed

289
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,490
together it'll get funky it'll start to

290
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:15,929
smell bad Moisture will get trapped in

291
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,700
there and you'll start to get that stale

292
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:19,620
ammonia smell and that's what we were

293
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,540
trying to avoid with proper drying and

294
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,940
curing so I would go through and remove

295
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,409
all of the sticks get all the good buds

296
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,240
into the containers and then once they

297
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:29,129
are all completed I would go through and

298
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,019
put the lids on every container at that

299
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,789
point I would have everything labeled it

300
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,919
all be sitting open and then when we're

301
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:36,629
done with every plant that's gonna get

302
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,189
been that day that's when I start

303
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:40,019
putting the lids on and sealing up the

304
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,640
containers now I feel like I haven't

305
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,620
described these containers properly

306
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:47,069
these Rubbermaid containers are like the

307
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,860
size of maybe a laundry basket they're

308
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:54,510
about three feet wide I guess and then

309
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,009
maybe a foot or so wide I know I said

310
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:58,588
wide but three feet long and a foot or

311
00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:00,600
so wide and then probably about eighteen

312
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:03,270
maybe twenty inches deep they're the one

313
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,649
that you uh use for packing or you just

314
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,329
put a bunch of clothes in there just a

315
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:07,559
bunch of bullshit's the one when the

316
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,030
kids come to the front door and they're

317
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,750
trying to sell candy for church like I

318
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:11,579
got some candy

319
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,049
would you like to read some money and

320
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,340
they got the big Rubbermaid container

321
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,889
that's the container I'm talking about

322
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,879
it's just like a moving box or something

323
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:21,330
is what it looks like a storage

324
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:23,159
container we can fit three or four large

325
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,840
plants in those containers from the

326
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,129
commercial grow so I guess I should have

327
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,210
mentioned that a little earlier but it

328
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:29,549
just dawned on me that I did not

329
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,960
describe these containers in any way so

330
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:33,870
now let's talk more about what happens

331
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,150
to these plants once they are put into

332
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,490
this container and the lid is put on

333
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,559
them they need to be opened and rotated

334
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,389
every day until they're dry enough to

335
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,919
seal up without risking any mold

336
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,539
development the first day is always

337
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,490
scary when you seal them up and then

338
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,610
leave overnight that is always a scary

339
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,470
feeling until you get there the next day

340
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,879
don't be afraid to leave them open if

341
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,170
you feel like they're a little too moist

342
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,549
if you cut them down and get them in the

343
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:58,709
bin and realize aw [ __ ]

344
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,269
a couple of these are too wet don't be

345
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,980
afraid to leave those open open

346
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:03,960
overnight you would rather leave them

347
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,639
open and get them a little too dry then

348
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,889
close them up and get them a little

349
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,740
funky a little funky doesn't go away a

350
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:12,120
little too dry we can work with so you

351
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,649
seal them up you put the lids on them

352
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,120
and then you might want to check on them

353
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,709
before you leave for the day make sure

354
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,060
that nothing needs to be rotated nothing

355
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,250
needs to be flipped around nothing needs

356
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,109
to be left open like I said if it needs

357
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,389
to be left open leave it open don't be

358
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,889
afraid then you're gonna leave you're

359
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:27,360
gonna come back the next day you're

360
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:29,490
gonna have a bunch of sealed containers

361
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,550
they need to be popped open immediately

362
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:35,339
I would pop them open for four maybe six

363
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:37,139
maybe seven hours and check on him while

364
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,780
they were sealed a lot of the moisture

365
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,220
that was inside those sticks

366
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:42,750
reconstituted throughout those buds and

367
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,100
a lot of moisture built up in that

368
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,779
container you're gonna find a lot of

369
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,330
spongy and wet buds when you come in in

370
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:50,279
the morning that's expected don't worry

371
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,570
it'll be okay you're gonna leave it open

372
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,509
and get some of that [ __ ] out of there

373
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,950
that's the idea you want to open it up

374
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,240
every day and let that stuff out of

375
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,220
there when they start getting dry again

376
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,659
some of the sticks might not even snap

377
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,089
again some of them may have remoisten

378
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,529
where they don't snap that that means

379
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:06,390
you may have gone just a little bit too

380
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:08,250
early but it's not bad because we can

381
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:10,199
get that moisture out you don't want it

382
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,850
to get too dry so you're gonna pop them

383
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,650
open you're gonna see how what they are

384
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,940
leave them open you may just want to

385
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:17,338
leave them open for an hour if they're

386
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,740
real dry an hour is fine four to six

387
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,769
hours is not uncommon on the first day

388
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,198
if you chop those plants down or if you

389
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,850
into those plants a little bit too early

390
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:28,588
they may be really wet and you may have

391
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,239
to leave them open for four to six maybe

392
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:31,949
the whole shift of eight to ten hours

393
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,839
they may have to stay open that's not

394
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:35,878
uncommon try not to cut them down and

395
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,470
put them into the bins so early next

396
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,579
time but you'll be okay this is

397
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,139
something you're gonna have to dial in

398
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:42,539
with your facility and with your

399
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:44,938
technique so the duration of burp time

400
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:48,178
is going to decrease as slowly as the

401
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:51,298
buds dry these bins are going to sit in

402
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:53,970
a room ideally that is at fifty percent

403
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:55,828
humidity and seventy degrees until you

404
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,079
have time to trim them I run a

405
00:13:55,828 --> 00:14:00,149
humidifier and a dehumidifier at the

406
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,578
same time and they're both set at 50%

407
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:04,739
humidity so if that room gets to fifty

408
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:07,498
five percent humidity that dehumidifier

409
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:09,629
kicks on immediately if it gets to forty

410
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:11,579
five percent the humidifier comes on

411
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:13,499
immediately I don't get out of that ten

412
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:14,758
degree range and it stays pretty close

413
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,139
with both of those machines and they're

414
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,659
fighting each other they pretty much

415
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:21,028
just stay on all the time so I've got

416
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:22,889
these buds they are in containers they

417
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:25,708
have not been trimmed yet and they still

418
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:27,990
need to be burped on a daily basis the

419
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:29,578
first thing the dry and cure manager or

420
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,589
the trim team manager should do when

421
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:33,388
they get to the grow is pop open these

422
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:35,850
bins and see what type of situation

423
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,619
you've got they should be getting drier

424
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,600
and more smokeable and they should start

425
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:42,329
smelling more like dank cannabis every

426
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,699
day that fresh green wet smell should be

427
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:46,948
going away but you're going to have to

428
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:49,258
pop them every day and pay attention to

429
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:50,998
how long they need to be opened like I

430
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,399
said that first day you're gonna get

431
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:55,409
four to six hours maybe the second day

432
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,629
four to six hours maybe the third day

433
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:59,219
four hours maybe the fourth day three

434
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,959
hours then maybe you're gonna have to

435
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,399
pop them open for an hour every day and

436
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,008
see what's going on and check it out

437
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,639
eventually you won't have to open them

438
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:07,860
anymore

439
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,720
once you've gotten them to about 65%

440
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,850
humidity inside the container

441
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,278
consistently you don't have to burp it

442
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,860
that is cured where you want it and it's

443
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:19,259
also in that room with 50% humidity so

444
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,209
it's gonna stay about 50% humidity and

445
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,639
it won't get less than that and they can

446
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:26,068
the containers hold moisture in there so

447
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,509
it's gonna stay above 50% trust me so

448
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:29,488
while you're drying and curing inside

449
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,220
those bins be sure to burp the bins

450
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:34,709
every day and rotate the buds to prevent

451
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,200
mold and funky aromas until they get dry

452
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,179
enough to leave alone do

453
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,830
be afraid to take the buds and pick them

454
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:41,870
up right outside of the container and

455
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,550
flip him over and send it back in so all

456
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,529
the buds that were on the bottom are now

457
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:47,209
on the top and do that you can do that

458
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:50,120
once or twice a day if you feel like you

459
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,440
need to if they are really wet something

460
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,720
I want to keep stressing is if they are

461
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,700
too moist don't be afraid to leave the

462
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,440
lid off the containers and tell the buds

463
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,150
are nice and dry and you feel

464
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,590
comfortable closing them up and you're

465
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:02,959
sure there's not going to get any mold

466
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:05,149
in there because if you leave it closed

467
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,910
for too long or you bend these buds too

468
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:10,970
early you're going to create an ammonia

469
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:12,469
type funky terrible smell inside your

470
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,570
buds they're not going to burn well

471
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,460
they're gonna taste terrible they're

472
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,110
gonna smell funky and it's not gonna be

473
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,970
desirable and you're not gonna be able

474
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,009
to sell it at your dispensary or however

475
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,170
you plan on selling it so one problem

476
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:26,569
you may run into if you leave it closed

477
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:28,639
too long is funky aromas the only thing

478
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,010
you can do to fix that is try to air it

479
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,139
out just leave it open let it dry try to

480
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:35,059
let that smell go away and it's probably

481
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:37,879
not going to you've probably gone too

482
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:39,619
long so make sure not to seal it up for

483
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,139
too long and make sure not to seal it up

484
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,310
when it's too moist another problem you

485
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,500
could run into during the drying and

486
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:48,139
curing process as the buds could get too

487
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,809
dry if your buds get too dry in those

488
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:53,569
containers a trick you can do is to go

489
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:56,389
pull a few leaves from your growing

490
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,250
plants if you've got a flower room you

491
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:59,779
probably need to be foliate a little bit

492
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,879
and pull some plant pull some leaves off

493
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:05,299
those flowering plants anyway so go get

494
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:07,519
I would say 4 to 6 large leaves per

495
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:10,519
Rubbermaid container is more than enough

496
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,619
to rehydrate some semi-dry buds in one

497
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:14,629
of those containers we tried to put too

498
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:17,838
much in there and it made it really wet

499
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,060
really quickly so 4 to 6 leaves is more

500
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,948
than enough to remove an an entire

501
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,289
Rubbermaid container if you left it open

502
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,390
just a little bit too long if you got it

503
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:27,649
down into that Colorado crunch zone then

504
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,970
you've done [ __ ] up and you might not

505
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,680
be able to fix it but we'll talk about

506
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,720
that a little bit later in the episode

507
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,360
but if you didn't go too far just grab

508
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,759
four or five maybe six leaves throw them

509
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,799
in the container and seal it up for just

510
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,809
a few hours then go check on it that

511
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:44,089
moisture will reconstitute the buds and

512
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:45,799
give you a second chance I would not

513
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:48,169
recommend using anything other than

514
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,180
cannabis leaves maybe Boveda packs

515
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:53,450
Boveda packs however you like to say it

516
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:55,610
the Boveda packs uh come in 62% humidity

517
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,460
you can use those if you'd like although

518
00:17:55,609 --> 00:18:00,919
I do not prefer them myself I think they

519
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,990
make a weird flavor in my cannabis buds

520
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,870
I think that using the leaves of the

521
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,240
same plant is the best idea alright so

522
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:10,429
that is basically the commercial grow

523
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,000
version of drying and curing your

524
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,039
cannabis plants on a large scale now I'm

525
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,049
going to take a giant dab and when we

526
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:20,269
get back we will talk about drying and

527
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:40,220
curing your cannabis on a smaller scale

528
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:42,440
for the home grower all right podcast

529
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,019
well let's get back into this dry and

530
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,000
cure episode the home grow or the

531
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:48,980
connoisseur version of drying and curing

532
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,329
your final product is a little bit

533
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,039
different than the commercial grow

534
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,589
version but it's basically the same idea

535
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,029
we want to slow down the drying process

536
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:58,099
we want to get those buds to feel nice

537
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:00,079
and sticky you want them to smell nice

538
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:02,869
and sweet we wanted to burn nice and

539
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,899
smooth so this is how I would dry and

540
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:09,319
cure my product in a small connoisseur

541
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:11,450
batch in a smaller grow a home grow or a

542
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,369
boutique grow or maybe something I was

543
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,950
going to enter into a competition if

544
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:18,500
this was going into a cup this is how I

545
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,210
would cure my product the main

546
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,849
difference is that I would not be using

547
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:26,329
the gigantic Rubbermaid containers I

548
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:28,369
would use quart sized widemouth glass

549
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:30,679
jars I don't want to use bigger jars I

550
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:32,059
feel like maybe too much moisture gets

551
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,350
stuck in there you have the same

552
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,480
conditions that you create in those

553
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:37,969
Rubbermaid containers I like the smaller

554
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,789
more focused jars another note before we

555
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,990
get too far make sure you label each jar

556
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:45,259
if you're working with more than one

557
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,299
strain label the jars not the lids lids

558
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:49,009
are interchangeable be careful with this

559
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:51,970
please if you're working with different

560
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:55,549
phenotypes label the jar whatever arise

561
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,839
phenotype to arise phenotype 3 if you're

562
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:58,879
running a pack of seeds or whatever

563
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,569
label the jars so that you know what

564
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,460
you're working with

565
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:05,159
basically everything up to the point of

566
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,019
the sticks snapping is the same we're

567
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,450
waiting for the sticks the snap once the

568
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:13,379
sticks snap that's when we can start the

569
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,480
jar curing process for Jar Tech I would

570
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,460
take the snappy sticks and chop off

571
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,259
every bud into a bucket just get all

572
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,360
those buds off the sticks into the

573
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,379
bucket throw those sticks away get rid

574
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,329
of them do whatever you do with them

575
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,910
compost them shred them up toss them

576
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:28,859
those are done then I hand trim the buds

577
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,450
I'll do another episode all about hand

578
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:33,059
trimming the buds I don't like trim

579
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,410
machines and I don't like wet trim but

580
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,210
I'll talk about that in the trimming

581
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,920
episode that is coming up so I trimmed

582
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,230
the buds they should be dry enough by

583
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,390
now to knock off most of the leaves with

584
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,920
your thumbs and thumb nails so trim them

585
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,160
up pretty closely with your thumb then

586
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,509
put the trimmed buds into the glass jars

587
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,779
that we talked about the wide mouth

588
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:55,529
quart-size mason jars fill those jars

589
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:58,559
about 75 to 90 percent full if your buds

590
00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:01,139
are fluffier if your buds are bigger

591
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,269
you're only gonna be able to get 75% in

592
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,130
there because of all the air space I get

593
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:07,769
it it makes sense if you've got smaller

594
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,930
buds you can put up to 90% in there but

595
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:11,819
do not press them down into the jar and

596
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,470
don't overpack them and don't squish

597
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,200
them in you just want them lightly

598
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,779
sitting in there now once the jar is

599
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,480
full I add the lid and I set a timer I

600
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:23,849
like to check my buds about four hours

601
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,279
after being sealed up for the first time

602
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:28,289
this first check lets me see how much

603
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,180
moisture is trapped in my butts if the

604
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:32,609
inside of the jar is extremely humid

605
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,470
I'll just leave that lid off for an hour

606
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:36,509
or more and the commercial grow we were

607
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,150
talking about four to six maybe eight

608
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:42,269
hours maybe even 10 hours those are much

609
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:44,220
larger plants much larger batches and

610
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:46,079
much larger containers there is much

611
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,630
more moisture in there so for these

612
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,539
smaller jars I only want to leave it off

613
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,340
for a little bit at a time these smaller

614
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,859
batches can get away from you quite

615
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:57,869
quickly so pay more attention so open it

616
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:59,699
up see how humid it is if it's really

617
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:01,559
humid and really squishy you're gonna

618
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,330
want to leave it open for an hour maybe

619
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,009
a little bit more just keep checking on

620
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:07,409
it and do not forget about it set

621
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:09,930
another timer if the humidity has not

622
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,490
made the buds squishy again I'll leave

623
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,019
the jar open for only like fifteen to

624
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,009
thirty minutes to let the moisture out

625
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:16,139
and then

626
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:17,879
old funky air out of the jar and then

627
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,180
it'll kind of refresh with fresh air in

628
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,100
there

629
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,950
then I'll reseal the jar and let it sit

630
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:25,469
for another four to six hours I set a

631
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:28,080
timer for this then in four to six hours

632
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,089
I pop that jar and I gently stir the

633
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,490
buds around and check the aroma that

634
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:36,769
comes out of there what I'm looking for

635
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:40,049
when I smell is an aroma of ammonia or

636
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:41,549
funk or just you'll notice it your nose

637
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:43,319
will crinkle up and your eyes will make

638
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:45,990
a weird squint you'll go [ __ ] I [ __ ]

639
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:48,659
up I'm looking for that aroma I'm hoping

640
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,299
that's not present it shouldn't be also

641
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,330
I'm looking to see if it smells less wet

642
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:56,909
has it gone from that wet juicy hey

643
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:58,349
smell two more of that cured chronic

644
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,850
smell that I'm looking for because it'll

645
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:02,250
start doing it quickly and then it will

646
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:03,959
improve over time so I'm cracking the

647
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,839
jar open I'm looking to see how much

648
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,329
humidity is in there um I stir him

649
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:12,149
around if the buds seem damp or extra

650
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:14,099
spongy at this point I'll dump him out

651
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,780
of the jar and let him sit for a few

652
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:18,480
minutes until that excess moisture

653
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:20,369
evaporates you don't want the buds super

654
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,410
soggy and sealed in a jar you don't want

655
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:24,989
the buds super wet and press together in

656
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,850
a jar if they still feel wet and spongy

657
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,200
on the outside I'll dump them out and

658
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:30,629
let them sit out for a few minutes until

659
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,460
they feel dry on the outside but when

660
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,440
you squeeze them they're mushy still a

661
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,120
little bit you just want them dry on the

662
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,160
outside wet on the inside is what you're

663
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,379
going for at this point if the buds are

664
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,390
sticking together then I dump them out

665
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,490
completely and let them dry more before

666
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,100
putting them back in now we want a

667
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:49,049
little bit of moisture in these buds the

668
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:51,240
little bit of moisture is going to make

669
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,279
the drying and curing process happen but

670
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,009
we don't want enough moisture to cause

671
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,259
mold and funk so we burped the jar about

672
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:00,299
every 4 hours to make sure we don't seal

673
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:02,849
too much water in the jar for too long

674
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:05,069
we let some of the curing process happen

675
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:06,689
by opening the jar letting that old gas

676
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,939
out that contains the chlorophyll that

677
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,350
contains the sugars that gas evaporates

678
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,840
out of the jar we replace it with fresh

679
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:14,519
air we seal it back up then when we seal

680
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,069
it it's allowed to restart the curing

681
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,720
process it'll start deteriorating and

682
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:20,909
eating up more of that chlorophyll more

683
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,110
of those excess minerals and sugars

684
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,480
inside of there and they will start

685
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:27,479
evaporating out of your buds you'll get

686
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,309
them out so let's get back on track here

687
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,440
after the first couple of days you can

688
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:34,019
slowly increase your burp intervals as

689
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,059
the buds get drier you may only need to

690
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:38,039
open these jars up every six to eight

691
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,750
hours after a little bit and the time

692
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,299
that you leave them open will also

693
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,220
decrease so maybe after a few days you

694
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,539
pop it open every eight hours maybe you

695
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,740
pop it open right before you go to work

696
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,119
you leave it open while you're brushing

697
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,620
your teeth and getting your shoes on and

698
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,939
then you close it up and you leave you

699
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,799
come back from work and then you pop it

700
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,900
open it's probably been 10 hours by now

701
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,099
pop it open again stir the buds around

702
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,019
make sure nothing's gone funky if

703
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,089
nothing's gone funky just leave it open

704
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:02,369
for five minutes let that air exchange

705
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:03,689
in there seal it right back up then you

706
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:05,699
can go ten hours and you know you're

707
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,230
safe at ten hours see what happens at

708
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,940
eleven hours see what happens at twelve

709
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,400
hours just start stretching it every day

710
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,470
by the end of two weeks you'll just be

711
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,850
popping these jars open once a day

712
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,230
you'll check it out you'll give it a

713
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:18,119
good smell and you'll say that is so

714
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,970
close and then you can close it back up

715
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:24,329
by the end of two weeks these buds will

716
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,150
be beautifully beautifully cured so the

717
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:30,210
bud should be sticky on the outside and

718
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,380
spongy but not dry and crumbly they

719
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,910
should almost have a little bit of

720
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,590
squeeze a little bit of give to them and

721
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:37,050
then stick to your fingers this

722
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:39,209
shouldn't fall apart and just crumble up

723
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:41,190
like a lot of the Colorado dispensary

724
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,660
bud does unfortunately and the reason

725
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,250
for that you guys is because it's

726
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,779
sitting on the Shelf out there all day

727
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,880
they're opening up those jars and

728
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,710
showing it to you all day that stuff is

729
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,840
just getting dry so that's the problem

730
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,730
with the Colorado crunch I apologize for

731
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,079
that the Grover's work hard to get it

732
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,730
proper and then it's sent to the

733
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:59,069
dispensary and left in those jars and

734
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,559
the bud tenders don't do us justice so I

735
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:02,939
apologize so on day one I chopped the

736
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,759
buds off the sticks and I trim them up

737
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,990
then I filled the jars about 90% full

738
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,089
then I seal the jar

739
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,009
I checked the jar in about four hours I

740
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:12,689
opened it long enough for the excess

741
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:14,670
moisture to come out of the jar that

742
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,070
could be a little while that could be a

743
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,810
short amount of time it kind of depends

744
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:20,669
on how wet the buds were when you jarred

745
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:23,129
them up then I check it again in about

746
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,789
four hours I shuffled the buds if I feel

747
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,290
that's necessary it's likely necessary

748
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:30,569
then I check again in four to six hours

749
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:32,250
and leave open as necessary if they're

750
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:34,139
getting too sticky again I'll dump them

751
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,480
out you'll want to check as soon as you

752
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,040
wake up the next day the burr process

753
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,230
will slow down over the next few days

754
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:41,399
you want it to take as long as possible

755
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,589
without a lie

756
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,509
mildew to develop you want to slow it

757
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:47,039
down the longer it takes the better the

758
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:48,599
more time that it takes for that

759
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,490
moisture to come out the more

760
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,889
opportunity you have for chlorophyll to

761
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,990
be removed the only thing to worry about

762
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,120
very similarly to the rubbermaid

763
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,579
technique is trapping too much moisture

764
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:02,129
in your containers for too long and

765
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:04,980
causing yourself mildew or funky flavors

766
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,540
if you locked your buds up in these jars

767
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,640
long enough to where you got like white

768
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,839
MOLLE webbing growing on there and it

769
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,390
looks like some cotton coming out you

770
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,279
[ __ ] up and didn't pay any attention

771
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:16,110
throw that away if your jar is starting

772
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,970
to get an ammonia smell you've sealed it

773
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:20,519
up too long you've got to open it more

774
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,289
frequently and longer next time you may

775
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,700
be able to save it but it's unlikely the

776
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:25,409
only thing you can do is leave it open

777
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,380
and let it dry out and hopefully that

778
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:31,200
smell will go away so don't leave it

779
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,850
closed too long don't let mildew happen

780
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,920
don't let that funky smell happen once

781
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:36,659
you're past the first few days you'll

782
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,360
kind of be out of the mildew danger zone

783
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:42,360
but still be careful also keep your jars

784
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,399
in a cool dark place while you're curing

785
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,869
your buds but also don't leave them

786
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,110
somewhere where you're going to forget

787
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:51,509
about them also here in Colorado I'm

788
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:53,539
running a swamp cooler in the main

789
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:55,920
portion the living area of my house

790
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:57,839
don't go dump your buds on the table

791
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,340
near the swamp cooler this is not going

792
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,199
to do you any good this is going to

793
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:04,259
reconstitute them and make them wetter

794
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,058
think about wetter is that a word anyway

795
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:08,190
think about the environment where you

796
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:09,569
were drying and curing your products if

797
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,120
you're gonna dump them out on the table

798
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:14,369
and an attempt to get them more dry make

799
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:16,769
sure that the room is drier than the

800
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:17,969
butt or it's not going to work just keep

801
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:19,500
that kind of stuff in mind you guys

802
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,870
think about your environment think about

803
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,000
your products so I feel like we've got a

804
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:27,119
basic understanding of how to cure our

805
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,640
buds now let's get into the technical

806
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,250
talk about why we do it and what's

807
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,620
technically happening securing your buds

808
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,509
properly makes your buds burn and smoke

809
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:39,209
smoothly and it also brings out the best

810
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:41,420
flavors and aromas proper drying and

811
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:44,279
curing will also increase your potency

812
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,539
now why why does that happen because

813
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,359
your buds contain chlorophyll

814
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:51,059
chlorophyll is what gives your buds that

815
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,678
harsh smoke and hay like flavor that

816
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,659
burn your throat kind of funky flavor

817
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,048
that's from too much chlorophyll that's

818
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,058
from

819
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:59,249
excess minerals in the plant that could

820
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:02,190
also be from an improper flush but it's

821
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:04,019
usually from an improper cure so curing

822
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,970
the buds will remove chlorophyll and

823
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,700
increase your potency at the same time

824
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,730
the only way to remove chlorophyll is by

825
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,889
turning it into a gas sealing our moist

826
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,659
buds in a jar creates an environment

827
00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:18,808
that will break down the chlorophyll and

828
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,840
turn it into a gas darkness moisture and

829
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:24,599
oxygen will create a bacteria within the

830
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,548
jar that bacteria will break down the

831
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,558
sugars and leftover minerals created by

832
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:30,749
the decomposition of the chlorophyll and

833
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,970
it will turn into a vapor that can

834
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:34,230
escape the jar when you pop it open that

835
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,298
was what I was talking about earlier

836
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,099
when I said we pop open the jar and let

837
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:39,839
the chemical reaction happen now this

838
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:41,638
process is going to make your bud burn

839
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,558
smoother it's going to take make it

840
00:29:41,638 --> 00:29:46,648
taste better it's gonna bring out the

841
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:48,298
proper aromas the proper terpene profile

842
00:29:46,648 --> 00:29:50,788
that you're looking for and it's also

843
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:53,999
going to increase the overall potency of

844
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:55,888
your finished product now if you really

845
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:58,108
want to nerd out and dial this in and

846
00:29:55,888 --> 00:30:00,599
create a connoisseur product find

847
00:29:58,108 --> 00:30:02,249
yourself a hygrometer that fits inside

848
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,168
of your mason jar there are a couple

849
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:05,548
available that fit right inside the

850
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,840
mason jar you can press it up to the

851
00:30:05,548 --> 00:30:09,418
front of the jar where you can read the

852
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,368
display without opening the jar find

853
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:14,429
yourself hygrometers that will fit in

854
00:30:11,368 --> 00:30:16,648
the jar and here are some suggestions on

855
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:19,528
when to open and close your jars and how

856
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:22,199
to dial them in perfectly if your buds

857
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:24,989
feel wet or if they are above 70%

858
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,239
humidity if the little display on that

859
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:30,028
hydrometer inside of your jar reads

860
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:33,419
above 70% humidity you need to dump

861
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:37,409
those buds out of the jar and let them

862
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:39,299
dry until they get to 65 to 70% humidity

863
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:40,769
now when you dump them out and you leave

864
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:42,269
them somewhere that's not by the fan

865
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:44,190
that's not by the swamp cooler that's

866
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:45,269
not by the air-conditioner that's not by

867
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,429
something that's going to drastically

868
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:49,919
affect the rate of their drying

869
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:51,749
don't forget about them set a timer and

870
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,700
go find them some of you are a little

871
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:55,079
obsessive you're definitely not gonna

872
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,940
forget some of you are gonna take a

873
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,038
couple of dabs and go play fortnight and

874
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,080
your buds are gonna dry up to [ __ ] don't

875
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,450
let that happen to you guys so if they

876
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:05,490
are too humid dump them out let them dry

877
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,880
out a little bit get them down to 65 to

878
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:10,859
70% humidity now if your buds feel moist

879
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,080
the touch if they're sticky and wet to

880
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:14,579
the outside of the buds and the display

881
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,519
reads sixty-five to seventy percent

882
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:19,439
humidity pop the lid off of that jar for

883
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,809
fifteen to thirty minutes and let a

884
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,670
little moisture evaporate out if you

885
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:24,419
think they need longer than fifteen to

886
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,120
thirty minutes

887
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,529
let them go longer but like I said don't

888
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,119
start playing for tonight and start

889
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:31,740
building [ __ ] and shooting people and

890
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,289
forget about them because you don't want

891
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,210
them to get too crunchy so fifteen to

892
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:38,970
thirty maybe forty five minutes maybe an

893
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:40,410
hour seal them back up set yourself a

894
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,819
timer to remember to check on them in a

895
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:45,300
little bit and now you can go play

896
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:48,149
fortnight and relax now your goal is 60

897
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:50,549
to 65% humidity you want that hydrometer

898
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:54,000
to read between 60 and 65 percent

899
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:56,519
humidity and you want them dry but not

900
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,430
crunchy they're gonna feel squishy and

901
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:02,190
sticky hopefully but they're not wet you

902
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,990
just want them dry but not crunchy you

903
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,789
might need to let your buds sit out for

904
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,890
a little bit before you roll a joint if

905
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:10,680
it's cured perfectly the display will

906
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,570
say 60 to 65% you may need to take a

907
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,740
couple of buds out of there and set them

908
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:14,939
I just sent them right here on the front

909
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,289
of my computer if I'm gonna roll when

910
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,910
it's a little warmer right there - so

911
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:19,559
dumb chill they're not like in the path

912
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,519
of the fan or anything just let them

913
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,809
chill right here that's what I'm gonna

914
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:23,220
roll a joint within a few minutes and

915
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:25,019
just let them sit there you know just

916
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,190
just for a little bit just maybe if I'm

917
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:27,480
gonna go to lunch and come back and

918
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,190
smoke a joint I'll set them out right

919
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,269
before I go to lunch and then you go to

920
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,590
lunch and then you come back and then

921
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:33,809
they grind up nice and fine and they're

922
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:36,720
still sticky they're still juicy and

923
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:38,429
then your joint burns super smoothly and

924
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,680
if your joints not burning super smooth

925
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,600
then you probably have too much moisture

926
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,150
in there and you got to let it dry and

927
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:47,459
cure just a little bit longer now if you

928
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,259
hit that 55 percent or lower mark you're

929
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,180
entering what I call the Colorado crunch

930
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:53,069
area and your buds are gonna burn too

931
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,960
fast and you're also losing weight if

932
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:56,730
you're working with more than a quarter

933
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,410
pound there and you're drying it up you

934
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,789
risk losing you know a quarter of an

935
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,310
ounce or whatever depends on how much

936
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:05,129
you let it dry so if your buds get too

937
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:07,019
dry don't add anything funky to

938
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,990
rehydrate them the only thing I would

939
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:12,299
use are fresh cannabis leaves and a

940
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,710
little bit goes a long way so take them

941
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:16,019
out when the moisture comes back and

942
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,819
don't let those leaves mold up in there

943
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:21,150
and [ __ ] up your crop check on them

944
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:22,769
frequently if you put wet leaves inside

945
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:24,900
of either your curing jars

946
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:27,150
or your packs or your [ __ ] turkey

947
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,160
bags however you do it make sure you

948
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,890
take them out and don't leave them for

949
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,740
too long check on them after an hour one

950
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,630
hour is more than enough go check on it

951
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,400
set yourself a timer don't get stuck

952
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:41,910
doing an Instagram live video and forget

953
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,900
to check on your buds all right so it's

954
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,670
gonna take a little bit for your

955
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,769
hydrometer to measure the humidity in

956
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,779
the jar but it's gonna get you a pretty

957
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:51,329
good idea of when to open and close

958
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:53,308
those jars and it's gonna give you some

959
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:55,379
actual data to go by you'll be able to

960
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:56,730
squeeze those buds and feel how wet they

961
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,860
are and you'll be able to compare that

962
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,240
number or that moisture to the number on

963
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:02,579
the hydrometer and you'll go oh that's

964
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,069
what 65% feels like that's what's Jeffs

965
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:06,449
trying to get me to so that gives you

966
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:08,940
something to work with it's a little bit

967
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,679
of a cheater but if you're using one

968
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,450
hygrometer you're gonna have to seal it

969
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,128
into the jar for a few minutes and wait

970
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:16,230
for it to get to where it needs to be

971
00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:18,000
enough it's jumping real fast go ahead

972
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,349
and pull it out leave that jar open that

973
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,340
means it's really humid in there and

974
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,378
that you're just gonna seal it up and

975
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,869
cause problems all right so we've got a

976
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:26,279
little tiny hydrometer in our jars we're

977
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:30,149
watching the numbers we're trying to get

978
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,070
ourselves to 60 to 65% humidity inside

979
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:33,659
of those jars make sure you don't forget

980
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,309
about your buds make sure you don't get

981
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,898
that funky aroma in there make sure it

982
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:39,179
doesn't smell like ammonia and mildew

983
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:40,679
make sure you don't ruin it you should

984
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,300
be paying attention to the number on the

985
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,679
hygrometer and then pull in some buds

986
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,500
out and seeing what they feel like so

987
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,240
that you know what 50 what 60 what 70

988
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,099
what 80% humidity if you get to 80 you

989
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,719
[ __ ] up but so that you know what the

990
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,250
percentage of humidity feels like inside

991
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,539
these jars what the blood feels like

992
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,969
this will give you a really good idea

993
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:58,739
start paying attention to that stuff and

994
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:01,319
you will get ahead of the drying and

995
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:03,929
curing game now once you've gotten your

996
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,430
buds dried and cured to 55 to 65 percent

997
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:07,529
humidity and you don't see any

998
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:08,250
fluctuation inside that jar on the

999
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,260
hydrometer

1000
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,000
you only need to crack them open to

1001
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,440
check on them or pull out some buds to

1002
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,090
smoke you don't need to keep popping

1003
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,530
those jars open they're gonna get too

1004
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,300
dry if you do that so you can trap the

1005
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,280
moisture in there leave it right at that

1006
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,470
point and your bud will be perfectly

1007
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,790
cured for whenever you need it now I've

1008
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:26,159
said before that I don't like the Boveda

1009
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,929
packs but they work if you do [ __ ] up

1010
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,940
the Boveda packs I would buy are the

1011
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:31,230
sixty-two percent and you can just drop

1012
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,599
them right inside your jar

1013
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,440
it'll help reconstitute that package or

1014
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,420
that jar and then

1015
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,068
sometimes I feel like they leave kind of

1016
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,750
a watery flavor on the buds but I guess

1017
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:43,568
I'd rather have a properly cured bud

1018
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:45,369
that has that aroma within some Colorado

1019
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:48,338
crunch it's just gonna burn up when I

1020
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:50,079
light my joint at the show so ladies and

1021

1041

1049
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,088

1053

microphone covers over and over again so

1058
