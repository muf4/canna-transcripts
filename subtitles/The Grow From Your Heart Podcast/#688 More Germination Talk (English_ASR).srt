episode of course the previous episode

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,360
was about germinating seeds i did get a

66
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,159
lot of comments a lot of messages and a

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,480
lot of feedback about that show thank

68
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,560
you i did start that podcast off by

69
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,799
saying that that was how i germinate my

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,800
seeds that is exactly how i start my

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,200
seeds for my personal grow or for a

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,599
commercial grow and i have great success

73
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,518
with that many people told me that they

74
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,518
do it quite differently and that is

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,959
wonderful i have no problems no

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
complaints no issues with you

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,120
germinating seeds however works for you

78
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,839
that's one of my favorite parts about

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
growing cannabis there are a lot of ways

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,158
of doing it there are a lot of methods

81
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,239
techniques and styles and they all work

82
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,479
if they work you were doing it correctly

83
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,000
if you were satisfied with your outcome

84
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,479
so a lot of people wanted to give me

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
feedback and input on how to germinate

86
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,158
and i agree with you a lot of those

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,439
methods and techniques and tactics will

88
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,158
work for you there's a lot of great

89
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,079
ideas and some of the messages i got but

90
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,158
i was just telling you how i do it and

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,599
if you do it differently do it your way

92
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,919
don't let me sway you don't let me

93
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,079
change your ways do that do what works

94
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,318
for you i do want to go over some of the

95
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,560
ideas and things that people did mention

96
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,479
that i did not talk about on the show

97
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,878
when people are germinating seeds a lot

98
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:50,560
of the time they will soak their seeds

99
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:52,399
for 12 to 24 hours in water before even

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
putting them in the paper towel like i

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
showed that works that's a great idea

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
that is a great method sometimes if

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,879
you've got seeds that have a thicker

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,719
shell or a thicker hole or grew for too

105
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,639
long that will help them germinate that

106
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,479
will soften up the seed before you stick

107
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,598
it in the paper towel and get it going

108
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,280
so many people will do a 12 to 24 hour

109
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,199
soak on their seeds before they do

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
germinate them that is just filling up a

111
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,959
container maybe a shot glass maybe a

112
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,720
beer glass with water just dropping the

113
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
seeds right in the water let them swim

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,240
around for 24 hours then do the

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,120
germination method which i showed also a

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
lot of people do add peroxide to that

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,040
mix when they're doing the soak and the

118
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,679
germination they'll put a few drops of

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,639
hydrogen peroxide in the mix their idea

120
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,800
is to get rid of any uh problems any

121
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
bacteria any problem that may be on that

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
seed

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,439
a lot of other growers will add microbes

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,759
and add things to that so that is a

125
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,478
controversial topic do peroxide or add

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,639
microbes whichever way works for you do

127
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,360
it because i have seen great success

128
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,759
with both methods as you saw in my

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,639
germination lesson i do not use any

130
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,120
hydrogen peroxide in my mix i also do

131
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,759
not do the 12 to 24 hour soak for my

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,160
seeds i don't find it necessary if you

133
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,240
do that and it works for you keep doing

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,320
it another thing that a lot of growers

135
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,120
will do a moment ago i mentioned soaking

136
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,199
our seeds to soften the shell sometimes

137
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,439
some seeds grow if they are grown for

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,120
too long and not harvested on time the

139
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,680
shells will become thick those seeds

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,319
will get too hard a lot of people will

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,478
take something and scuff the outer layer

142
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,399
of that seed shell i've seen a lot of

143
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,719
different methods for doing this some

144
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,799
people will simply get a fine-grained

145
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,400
sandpaper and just rub the seed just a

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,319
little bit you don't want to penetrate

147
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,159
or puncture or break open the seed you

148
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,839
just want to scuff that outer layer to

149
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,759
make it a little bit softer so that the

150
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,159
moisture can penetrate that seed and

151
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,600
give it the indicator to pop open so

152
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
that's another thing that people do that

153
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,120
i honestly do not do

154
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,519
maybe if the seeds were really old or

155
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,918
something like that i would do that

156
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,478
speaking of old seeds i do not do the

157
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,519
peroxide method because i like to

158
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,360
promote beneficial bacteria and fungus

159
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,198
if i am starting some older seeds that i

160
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
know have been sitting around or if i

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,079
got them from somebody and i don't know

162
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,800
the health of those seeds or the age of

163
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,439
those seeds i may treat them with a

164
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,199
microbial product during germination

165
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,360
something like herb or some kind of

166
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,478
microbes just to give them a head start

167
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,639
may be the case for older seeds

168
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,318
but in most cases i don't do any fancy

169
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,400
tricks or techniques i honestly just

170
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,240
fold up the paper towel wet it and get

171
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,399
the seeds going if that is not how you

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,038
do it that is fine if your method works

173
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,879
for you keep doing your method i do not

174
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,639
disrespect or doubt your method i'm just

175
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,199
telling you how i do things and what

176
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,199
works for me and again there's no one

177
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,439
way to do this as long as the plants are

178
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,439
successful and you're happy with it you

179
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,959
are doing it correctly

180
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,478
now one comment and one piece of

181
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,519
feedback i was getting from a lot of

182
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,758
growers is that they do not even bother

183
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,598
doing the soak and the paper towel

184
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,038
method they put their seeds straight

185
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,439
into their dirt straight into their

186
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,279
cocoa they begin watering and they start

187
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,759
their seeds right in the pot in which

188
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,598
the plant is going to grow that works

189
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,000
like i said before if that works for you

190
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,879
that works for you do that there are a

191
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,199
few reasons why i don't start my seeds

192
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,038
directly in the container first of all

193
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,360
as a breeder as the person making the

194
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,000
seeds i like to observe a little bit

195
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,598
more i can pay attention to i can put a

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,918
handful of seeds in the paper towel i

197
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,000
can count them i can open it up every

198
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,159
however many hours i want and i can see

199
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,038
that it's six hours two of them popped

200
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,039
at 12 hours four of them popped at 18

201
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,360
hours i've got six of them popping i can

202
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,959
see that in 24 hours this many popped it

203
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
gives me i can see them better if

204
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,478
they're in the soil and the dirt i can't

205
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,478
monitor them as well i can't see the

206
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,478
progress i can't see what's going on it

207
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,918
is a breeder who's making the seeds i

208
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,399
like to see them i like to see the

209
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,758
growth the development the time and the

210
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,279
speed

211
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,038
all right i took a quick drink and fixed

212
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,598
my voice let's talk about a couple of

213
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,318
more reasons why i do not pop my seeds

214
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:01,439
directly into the soil in my container

215
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,120
first of all seed direction

216
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,038
once my seed is germinated and i've got

217
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,280
a little tail coming out i know which

218
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,959
direction that seed is going to be going

219
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,439
i know which way is up and which way is

220
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,598
down i can set that seed in the dirt or

221
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,598
in the cocoa and have it set perfectly

222
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,519
the direction it needs to go and it is

223
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,199
set up for success

224
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,198
if i just throw it right into the dirt

225
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
and i don't give it any direction i'm

226
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,038
not sure which direction it's facing

227
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,879
it's got to pop the root the root may go

228
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,878
up as it pops it's got to reorientate

229
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,319
itself and go down the seed needs to

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,560
figure out which way is down and which

231
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,158
way is up that's slowing me down wasting

232
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,319
time and energy if i put it in there

233
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,399
going up and down it's already set up

234
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,879
for success it already knows which way

235
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,559
to go we can save a little struggle

236
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,320
another reason why i don't like to plant

237
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,399
the seeds directly into the cocoa or

238
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,519
into the dirt is because i like to have

239
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,480
better control of the moisture level in

240
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,639
the early stages of my seedlings i know

241
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
that if i put that ceiling in a baggie

242
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,559
and a paper towel that moisture is

243
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,039
trapped there it is not going anywhere

244
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,719
i'm a busy person uh sometimes i will go

245
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,120
to a grow thinking i need to be at the

246
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,879
grow for an hour and i will be gone for

247
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,039
six hours and if i wasn't prepared with

248
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,919
my plants properly i would come home and

249
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,240
we would have dry dead seedlings so to

250
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,919
set myself up for success i put them in

251
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,600
the baggie where i can retain that

252
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,360
moisture cocoa dries soil dries if

253
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
there's air movement in the room if

254
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,639
there's wind if there's a temperature

255
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,800
change that stuff will dry out more

256
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,439
quickly i know that i can

257
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,240
control and predict the drying rate of

258
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
that

259
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,919
sealed baggie with the paper towel and

260
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,079
the moisture in there as long as i

261
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,439
continue to keep that baggie sealed with

262
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,360
the wet paper towel in there that

263
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,240
moisture is not going anywhere as long

264
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,680
as i keep that in a warm place that seed

265
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
will germinate and they will be

266
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,000
successful so that is part of why i

267
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,399
don't go straight to the pot i think we

268
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,559
give ourselves a lot of opportunity to

269
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,399
over or underwater our seedlings when we

270
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,399
go straight to the pot we just cause

271
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,799
them a lot of unnecessary stress if i've

272
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,039
got a moistened container a moistened

273
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,879
bed of soil and drop the seed directly

274
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,958
into there once it's germinated i feel

275
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,600
like i'm just setting myself up for

276
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,599
success and the seeds are expensive i

277
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,680
pride myself on making my seeds

278
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,839
affordable i have very competitive

279
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,519
prices you'll notice we are a little bit

280
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,760
lower price than a lot of the other

281
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,919
brands on the same websites i understand

282
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,319
how expensive seeds are i want to make

283
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,838
sure that every single seed germinates i

284
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
buy seeds from other breeders and other

285
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,560
vendors as well i pay for those seeds

286
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,399
just like you guys do i want success

287
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,039
just like you do so i do everything that

288
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,958
i can to ensure that success

289
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,399
so that is a quick update on germinating

290
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,000
seeds a couple of other options of

291
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,078
things you can do and things you might

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,919
not do things that i don't do but things

293
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,719
that are available to you

294
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:47,278
we started off with a 12 to 24 hour soak

295
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,680
we also added a little bit of peroxide

296
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,838
to that water to get rid of any uh

297
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,519
pathogens that may be present

298
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,680
we've also done a little bit of scuffing

299
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,519
on our seeds to open up the shells and

300
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,919
then some people may be planting

301
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,919
directly into their medium which is not

302
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,039
what i do but if you want to do that and

303
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,799
it works go for it have fun like i said

304
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,120
that's one of the best parts of growing

305
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,399
cannabis as long as you are happy with

306
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,720
the outcome as long as you're getting

307
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,440
the results you are looking for you can

308
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
do it however you want have fun grow

309
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,360
from your heart breed with love enjoy

310
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,680
the garden make that garden your zen

311
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,519
space do it however you want again i'm

312
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,439
just trying to share my knowledge my

313
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,560
info and the ways that i've had the best

314
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,800
success now this does segue me into a

315
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,039
question we have a patreon question this

316
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,519
one came from our friend maverick and it

317
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,919
basically says i started a 10 pack of

318
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,120
seeds i did receive three bonus seeds

319
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,199
you're very welcome thank you for

320
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,039
noticing it says i popped the seeds in

321
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,519
order to do a pheno hunt for some proper

322
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,078
smoke and a possible breeding project i

323
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,159
like where this is going it says i

324
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,519
started the seeds in a cup of distilled

325
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:56,000
water phd at 6.0 for 24 hours we're off

326
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,799
to a good start here it says then into a

327
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,240
paper towel for another 24 hours making

328
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,759
sense so far

329
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,959
at this point eight seeds have

330
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,879
germinated and a few have tails using

331
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,119
beer cups filled with sunshine mix

332
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,278
number four amended with a bit of kelp

333
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,200
meal and worm castings i planted the

334
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,439
seeds the depth of a pen tip the part

335
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,800
that holds the ink tube to the ball

336
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,079
point yes i know what you mean there's

337
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,919
the tube of the pen and there's that

338
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,000
little uh just the writing part where it

339
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,519
starts to taper that sounds like about

340
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,360
the right depth that is knuckle deep if

341
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,600
you compare that it says i lightly

342
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,320
covered and moistened with a few drops

343
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,399
of water i covered the cups with clear

344
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,800
beer cups all right i like most of this

345
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
so far the only thing i would have done

346
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,278
differently i think at this point is i

347
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,879
would not have covered the cups

348
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,958
with beer cups and i think i talked

349
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,278
about that in the previous episode i

350
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,039
want those seedlings to get air i want

351
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,799
them to get maybe even put a fan on them

352
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,278
so they get blown around

353
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,120
the reason we cover clones is to keep

354
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,200
the moisture in there we don't need to

355
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,959
cover the seedlings uh they're creating

356
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,040
a root zone that is where they're going

357
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,799
to eat and drink the reason we create

358
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,838
the humidity environment is because

359
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,799
clones don't have roots so in my opinion

360
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,040
the cup on top is unnecessary however if

361
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,799
it is working for you don't change it do

362
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,199
your thing that's the beauty of growing

363
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,278
cannabis in our own gardens it does go

364
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,800
on though it says three days later i

365
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,919
have two that have sprouted so you've

366
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,599
got some that have popped up that's

367
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,679
always a great feeling

368
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,440
day four i get another sprout and i

369
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,278
lightly water sprouts and add a few more

370
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,480
drops to the empty cups all right so

371
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,360
it's starting to dry you're adding some

372
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,000
water as they're growing on day eight

373
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,959
i have a total of six seedlings upon it

374
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,720
okay so you've got six out of uh either

375
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,039
10 or 13 that you germinate i don't know

376
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,680
how many you did ah got a pack of 10 got

377
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:44,399
13 seeds either way you've got six total

378
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,638
seedlings all right which is 50 which

379
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,320
honestly as the breeder i would hope for

380
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,480
more you paid for those seeds i would

381
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,879
hope that you get more than 50 success

382
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,240
out of those it says upon some

383
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,399
excavation i found twisted taproots and

384
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,039
unsprung seeds that just kind of

385
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,399
crunched and mushed at the same time

386
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,799
then the question here is did i do

387
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,278
something wrong i made sure the pointy

388
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,000
end was down and all the tap roots were

389
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,559
down as well from looking at the picture

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,958
my first instinct is that this plant has

391
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,319
been too wet for too long now it says

392
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,039
you've only been giving it a little bit

393
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,079
of water but it looks too wet in my

394
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,919
opinion the seedling itself looks a

395
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,919
little damaged like it's just funky like

396
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,078
it's just been abused by water like it's

397
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,838
been sitting in water for too long and

398
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,120
it honestly is getting a little bit of

399
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,519
rot also if you look at one section i

400
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,320
see what i think is the end of the tap

401
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,000
root popping back up out of the soil it

402
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,240
looks like it completely made a loop and

403
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,639
it is coming back up out of the soil

404
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,159
which i'm not sure why that happened

405
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,240
maybe the ceiling wasn't pointing the

406
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,399
right direction uh but something caused

407
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,320
that taproot to pop right back up out of

408
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,919
the soil if you look carefully i think

409
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,360
that's what i'm seeing i will circle

410
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,319
that part in the video so that we can

411
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,919
see that

412
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,760
but i really do think that that is the

413
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,519
end of the tap root popping back up out

414
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,159
of the soil so it is curled on itself

415
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,839
somehow which uh tells me a couple of

416
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,799
things again that tells me that it could

417
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,519
be too wet also i think it may be too

418
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,000
cold it's hard to judge heat and cold by

419
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,639
photos but by looking at this soil if

420
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,198
that clump of dirt has been that wet for

421
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,879
too long there is an extreme temperature

422
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,679
happening in there it is probably too

423
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,439
cold or too warm if it's too cold it is

424
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,919
definitely going to slow down all

425
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,759
progress of those seeds if it's too hot

426
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,639
it is going to speed up the rot and the

427
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,480
mildew process for that seed i can't

428
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,560
tell the temperature by looking at it i

429
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,000
do have a few notes here but those notes

430
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,599
of the temperature are going to be the

431
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
ambient air temp in the room i don't

432
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,079
know the temperature of the

433
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,240
soil inside that cup it could be really

434
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,638
cold especially if it's sitting on a

435
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,039
cold floor so it could be too cold and

436
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,879
too wet which would be detrimental to a

437
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,120
young seedling the other thing i think

438
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,519
about is how tightly is that soil packed

439
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,600
is that soil stuffed in there is it kind

440
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,039
of fluffy in there if it's too tight

441
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,639
that seedling has been struggling to

442
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,240
grow its entire life you said you've

443
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,919
grown a lot of seeds and you've done

444
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,440
this before so you probably didn't pack

445
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,838
it too tight i'm gonna trust your

446
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,680
judgment on that and also i'm not making

447
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,440
any accusations or pointing any fingers

448
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,758
i'm trying to give you ideas and uh

449
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,440
guidance on what this could be so i

450
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,360
don't think i'm judging you i'm just

451
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,600
noticing what i'm seeing in this picture

452
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,360
and kind of going by this one picture

453
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,000
and this one seedling which i've got

454
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,519
here uh how tightly is that soil packed

455
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,360
is there enough perlite or personality

456
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,278
in there i do see the white stuff

457
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,720
in there i'm not sure how much is in the

458
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,639
entire container a lot of times the

459
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,879
perlite does float so it's hard to tell

460
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,079
how much is in there is there air space

461
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,159
in there that's what i want to know do

462
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,599
you have some air space so when roots do

463
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,838
start to grow are you not going to

464
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,519
suffocate that little seedling the next

465
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,600
thing i want to know is are there

466
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,919
drainage holes in that cup you're using

467
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,839
a beer cup beer cups do not come with

468
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,519
holes in them you didn't say that you

469
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,600
did and you also didn't say that you did

470
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,600
not put any drainage holes in that cup

471
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,079
you've been watering it is that water

472
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,399
going anywhere or is it just evaporating

473
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,558
or is it making a mud hole inside that

474
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,000
cup if it doesn't and again if you're an

475
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,119
experienced grower i hope you did put

476
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
the holes in there maybe it's something

477
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,479
you overlooked maybe you didn't even

478
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,000
think about it is there any drainage in

479
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,640
that container because it does again

480
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,439
look like it's been too wet and or too

481
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,959
cold for too long so with the details

482
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,439
from the letter and the photo that i've

483
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,400
got i think my diagnosis is that this

484
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,480
plant has been too wet for too long it's

485
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,679
possibly cold as well i think the

486
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,000
solution would be to water less often

487
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,919
and possibly water less water each

488
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,558
watering and again make sure that you do

489
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,759
have proper draining in that container

490
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,119
because it looks like there's a lot of

491
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,960
water in there it does look like it's

492
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,719
been soaked for quite a while that

493
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,480
ceiling just has that like wrinkled

494
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,558
pruning been in the bathtub too long

495
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,640
vibe going on in the photo that's what i

496
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,839
think so that makes me think too wet too

497
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,720
cold too long now i do have one more

498
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,480
completely logical and rational reason

499
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,960
for why your seeds may not be

500
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,839
germinating this may not be your problem

501
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,480
or your fault or your issue at all those

502
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,720
seeds simply could be duds those seeds

503
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,679
simply could be old those simply could

504
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,160
be non-viable seeds those seeds did come

505
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,200
from me i do pride myself on having

506
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,840
quality products i do thoroughly test

507
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,759
everything before we release anything i

508
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,319
have not had a lot of negative feedback

509
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,480
about the line you were working with but

510
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,480
sometimes seeds do pass through that are

511
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,319
not good i obviously can't test every

512
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,038
single seed because i've got to send

513
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,399
some to you so this is a customer

514
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,319
service issue possibly on my end if you

515
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,559
feel like these seeds didn't germinate

516
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:41,200
because of my fault to no fault of your

517
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,440
own please send me an email and i would

518
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,519
love to send you a replacement pack of

519
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,960
seeds maybe you got old seeds maybe

520
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,359
those were sitting around at a vendor

521
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,360
for a long time ah maybe you just got

522
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,279
the random unviable seeds out of that

523
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,240
whole batch maybe there were six seeds

524
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,480
in there that weren't good and you

525
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,400
happen to get them either way i would be

526
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,200
happy to send you a replacement pack of

527
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,519
seeds that i know are more fresh and are

528
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,200
quality so please do feel free to reach

529
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,599
out send me a follow-up and we will get

530
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,080
you a replacement pack of seeds and then

531
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:12,879
i do look forward to that germination

532
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,879
report and that grow report as well so

533
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,280
once again to wrap this up i do think

534
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,160
that those seeds were too wet for too

535
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,918
long is my diagnosis however it could

536
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,160
have been a breeder issue and if you

537
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,000
feel like you were owed some seeds don't

538
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,919
be shy send me an email i would be

539
