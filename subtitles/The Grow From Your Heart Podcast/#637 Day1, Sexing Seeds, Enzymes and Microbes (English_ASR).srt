talking about a [ __ ] ass product i

121

127
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,360
is a very

128
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,959
common thing i see on social media i

129
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,159
need to stay off social media honestly

130
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,439
because it's going to give me a [ __ ]

131
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,039
aneurysm but

132
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,199
something i want to talk about when we

133
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,280
talk about day one of flower

134
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,759
day one of flower is day one when you

135
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,840
turn that that timer to 12 12

136
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,679
that's day one of flower that is when

137
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,120
you started flowering so

138
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
i saw somebody say that the first two

139
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,438
weeks don't count the first week doesn't

140
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,598
count

141
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,039
you don't start counting until you see

142
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,119
hairs or something

143
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,400
nah bro you're the farmer you're the

144
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,519
grower it is

145
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,519
your control day one is when you flipped

146
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,680
that timer that is when you did it so

147
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
that is always going to be day one

148
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,719
and people are gonna say why do you get

149
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,719
to decide that that's day one because

150
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,160
i make the seed packages bro i printed

151
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,399
the labels on the seed pack and i

152
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,079
i decided that on my seeds that's day

153
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,039
one and all my other breeder friends we

154
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,560
talked about it and

155
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,560
we had a little meeting and a powwow and

156
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,720
a group and we all realized and decided

157
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,519
that we needed to say day one is the day

158
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,120
we turn the lights to 1212. a lot of you

159
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,079
some of you many of you a few of you i

160
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,199
don't know the ratio

161
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,959
some of the [ __ ] out there are going

162
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
to be turning the lights off completely

163
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,839
for 48 24 hours

164
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,520
then going into flower um i think day

165
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,319
one is when you put that 12 1212 on the

166
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,000
first time

167
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,918
and when it comes on 12 hours on 12

168
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,759
hours off that is now day one

169
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,359
people are gonna say what about day zero

170
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,360
and all kinds of weird [ __ ]

171
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
just quit overthinking it day one is the

172
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,759
first time you put the plants on a

173
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,880
12-hour day

174
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,520
that's day one a lot of people also talk

175
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,279
about

176
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,038
doing weird transitions i just mentioned

177
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,638
12 uh 24 hours off 48 hours off

178
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,079
there's not really a downside to that

179
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,519
that's free it doesn't cost you anything

180
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,038
you're not getting any light energy and

181
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,560
the plants will transition more quickly

182
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,599
but it's also not completely

183
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,000
necessary also i don't agree with like

184
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,439
uh tapering down light cycles they say

185
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,879
but that happens outdoors yeah we're not

186
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,519
growing outdoors at all

187
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,240
uh you don't want in my opinion i do not

188
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,279
want to

189
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
uh just slowly decrease the amount of

190
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,198
time

191
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,439
that the lights are on in my room they

192
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,560
go from uh either 20 on and

193
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,038
four off or 18 on and six off straight

194
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,759
to

195
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:38,000
12 12. boom straight into flower that is

196
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,520
day one that the day i change that timer

197
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,680
uh maybe it's tomorrow that they're

198
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,198
gonna wake up and do 12 on and 12 off

199
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
that is when i will count day one it's

200
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,879
generally a monday for me i like to flip

201
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,439
on monday it's just easier to keep track

202
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,360
of [ __ ]

203
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,478
flip on monday feed on monday do all the

204
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,080
big work on monday

205
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,079
catch up on the rest of the stuff

206
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,879
throughout the week all right so day one

207
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,478
is the day

208
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,600
that you flip those plants into flower

209
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,318
don't let anybody tell you any

210
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,919
differently

211
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,560
we're gonna set a standard here we're

212
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:05,038
all going to agree day one is the day

213
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,000
day one of flower is the day you flip

214
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,199
that timer to

215
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,680
12 12. uh we'll touch on veg

216
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,520
you could do veg however you want i do

217
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,600
sealing or clone stage and then i do

218
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,359
small veg and then i do large veg

219
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
you can break up the veg cycle however

220
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
you want that works best for you that is

221
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,879
your uh

222
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,959
your factory your grow your farm you get

223
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,879
to decide how you want on that so

224
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,719
uh you can label that however you want

225
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,759
my clones are clones you know what i'm

226
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
saying they're clones as soon as they

227
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,360
come from the cloner they are small

228
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,119
veg they're in either a four inch square

229
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,319
pot or a six inch net pot sometimes

230
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,879
they're in a beer cup

231
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,919
that is my small veg once it goes into a

232
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,519
one gallon pot

233
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:42,959
that could be medium veg depending on

234
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,359
what i'm doing then it'll go into three

235
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,399
gallon or a five gallon maybe a seven

236
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,960
now i'm in full veg so

237
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,918
you get to decide when you enter that

238
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,598
veg stage

239
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,279
small large veg that is kind of up to

240
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,120
you it doesn't matter because it's your

241
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,000
garden it's just an arbitrary label that

242
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,759
you're giving it

243
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,759
it we're not checking on you the one

244
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,120
that really matters is flour day one of

245
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,400
flower is when you flip

246
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,639
all right i want to move down the list

247
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,079
here another thing when i'm on the

248
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,598
internet and social media another thing

249
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,639
that makes me want to have a small

250
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,159
aneurysm

251
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,680
ah is people saying that they can tell

252
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,800
the sex of a seed by the shape of

253
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,560
that seed ah that's [ __ ]

254
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,160
quit believing that quit perpetuating

255
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,360
that quit spreading that

256
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,280
uh just stop it stop it

257
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,919
just [ __ ] stop stop with that you

258
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,559
can't tell the sex of a seed

259
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,000
by the shape of the seed you can't do

260
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,280
that i make feminized seeds i make

261
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,800
regular seeds

262
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,559
i can roll them on the table together

263
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,160
you can tell no difference between the

264
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,639
regular and femme seeds you can hold

265
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,080
them

266
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,519
one of each side by side with the

267
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,439
magnifying glass you're not going to see

268
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,120
any difference you've got to grow them

269
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,800
maybe you could do some science and cut

270
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,240
them open and do some dna checking and

271
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
you could tell which seed is male and

272
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,639
female

273
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,160
maybe at that point i don't even know if

274
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,000
you can do it then but you definitely

275
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,599
cannot tell by looking

276
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,839
people say that if it's got like a

277
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:02,800
volcano on the one end or a dimple on

278
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,359
one end or

279
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
[ __ ] no dude stop no you got to grow

280
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,479
them gotta grow them out so quit with

281
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,840
that [ __ ] that is not real

282
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,680
anybody that says that immediately

283
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,959
discredits themselves for anything else

284
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
they're going to tell me about cannabis

285
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,318
in the future

286
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,000
all right so uh what i wanted to get to

287
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,919
my next note is uh the internet is full

288
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,759
of backseat drivers and armchair

289
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,519
quarterbacks take all of that internet

290
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
advice you guys with a huge grain of

291
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,439
salt

292
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,479
and to be quite honest with you even my

293
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,080
advice

294
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:35,360
i don't know your grow the advice i give

295
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,800
uh works in i grow in either soilless

296
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,158
mix or cocoa

297
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,879
cocoa pots indoors under leds

298
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,120
or gavita lights the advice i give my

299
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,958
knowledge works for what i am doing

300
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,200
i try to keep it general so it works

301
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,119
across the board

302
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
but sometimes what i'm doing is kind of

303
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,879
specific and i try to be

304
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,480
specific about that and let you know if

305
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,919
you took some of my ideas

306
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,440
and you took the ideas that i give you

307
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,199
for an indoor grow and you did that in a

308
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,200
greenhouse it may not work if you did my

309
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
soil ideas in a hydro setup

310
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,480
it just may not work so when you see

311
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
people on the internet saying you've got

312
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,600
to do this

313
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,200
maybe they're growing in a completely

314
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,639
and different environment completely

315
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,240
different method completely different

316
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,439
plan than you so

317
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,120
don't be afraid to do things your way

318
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,800
there's no wrong way to grow cannabis

319
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,720
the wrong way is when the plants die or

320
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,799
you get raided that is the wrong way

321
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,240
you get mildew you get bugs you learn

322
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,039
from that you recover you move on

323
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,120
there's no real

324
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,240
wrong way if you get a harvest that

325
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,080
you're happy with

326
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,519
you did it right so don't let people on

327
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,800
the internet tell you you're doing it

328
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,240
wrong especially

329
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,079
people that aren't experienced or even

330
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,000
me if you want to do it your way you

331
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,759
could tell me to go [ __ ] myself and do

332
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,200
it your way and have fun

333
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,399
that's one of the most important parts

334
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,320
is have fun in the grow

335
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,360
a lot of us have made i've been guilty

336
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,000
of this i worked in commercial

337
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,159
cultivation

338
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,039
for so long that i let growing become

339
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,559
stressful

340
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,639
there were deadlines there were goals

341
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,559
there were numbers i was forgetting

342
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,159
about the most important part about

343
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,000
when somebody smokes this herb they're

344
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,278
going to feel better that's the most

345
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
important part and i was forgetting

346
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:05,679
about that

347
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
so have fun in there but while you're

348
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,599
having fun in there learn

349
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,000
don't forget to experiment learn

350
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,920
something broaden your horizons

351
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
just repeating the same cycle over and

352
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,039
over and over that's cool

353
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,320
until you get good at it but once you've

354
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,679
got your [ __ ] training wheels are

355
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,200
there take off those training wheels and

356
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,039
let's do some tricks bro let's do some

357
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,480
wheelies and [ __ ]

358
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,759
so get in there and have fun don't let

359
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,879
people slow you down don't people let

360
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,519
people sway you

361
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,120
experiment learn take a bunch of notes

362
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,480
so that when you do something positive

363
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
or negative to the plants

364
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,240
you've got notes i talk about that all

365
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,479
the time grow

366
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,639
as a grower those plants are going to

367
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,159
teach you things about yourself

368
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,319
the business will teach you things about

369
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,000
yourself you'll learn how to absorb

370
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,519
knowledge how you do learn and do not

371
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,639
learn then you'll go back and you'll

372
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,000
grow the plants and the plants will

373
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,000
teach you more things and then when you

374
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,519
smoke them you learn even more things

375
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,759
these plants are incredible to us they

376
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,560
can be greatly therapeutic if you take

377
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,319
care of them

378
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,599
so the internet doesn't always know does

379
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,800
not always know

380
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,639
your goals your obstacles your situation

381
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,919
your setup when you go looking for

382
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,799
advice on the internet

383
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,199
be very leery and be very careful look

384
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,278
to

385
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,720
trusted books there are plenty of books

386
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,240
on the internet for free

387
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,160
you don't have to go to facebook and go

388
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,919
to a group and be like what is this

389
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,120
there's a book out there that has that

390
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,000
answer that was written by a

391
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,000
professional

392
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,039
cannabis grower and an author that knows

393
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,039
what they're talking about

394
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
you're going to see a lot of wacky ass

395
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,838
answers on social media

396
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,360
be very careful advice is situational

397
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,079
i see a lot of times people say

398
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,000
something like uh you need to do this

399
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,838
and i'll just comment with why does this

400
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,200
grower need to do that

401
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,839
and they'll say i do it and i'll say

402
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,600
so i eat [ __ ] vegan food and drink

403
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,200
kombucha does that mean that all growers

404
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,240
need to do that like i'm good at growing

405
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,240
does that mean that since i

406
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,759
drink kombucha and eat [ __ ] vegan

407
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,440
that everybody else out there has to do

408
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,319
it to be good at growing no

409
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,680
it does not uh if i said i eat vegan and

410
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,360
drink kombucha and it makes me a better

411
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,879
grower because of this

412
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,600
then maybe i've got some ground some

413
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,278
ground to stand on

414
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,120
but if you're just saying because i do

415
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,720
it that's [ __ ] monkey sea monkey do

416
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,919
and there's no real scientific [ __ ]

417
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,519
support behind that

418
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,519
my favorite is when somebody's like well

419
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,679
my cousin did at one time and it worked

420
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,519
like man was your cousin growing hydro

421
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,120
was your cousin growing [ __ ]

422
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
soil was your cousin growing indoors or

423
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,799
outdoors we don't know we got one idea

424
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,559
your cousin said pour [ __ ]

425
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,159
biscuits and gravy on it on sunday and

426
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,599
it would go kapow right but

427
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,039
man we don't know what kind of biscuits

428
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
we don't know what kind of gravy and so

429
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,000
we got people [ __ ] up their gardens

430
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,800
putting biscuits and gravy out there on

431
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
sunday

432
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,078
and it's just messing [ __ ] up because

433
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
one guy's uncle did it one time and it

434
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,199
worked so

435
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,200
advice is very situational what works

436
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,680
for uh your buddies biscuits and gravy

437
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,600
grow

438
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,120
may not work for my soil grow may not

439
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
work for your hydro grow

440
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,879
may not work for somebody's vertical

441
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,759
grow so pay very close attention

442
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,200
then learn the plants you've got to

443
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,639
learn the plants that's the only way to

444
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,360
do this pay attention to the plants

445
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,639
you've got to

446
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,440
experiment you got to get in there and

447
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,079
[ __ ] up i've [ __ ] up recently i've

448
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
talked about i

449
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:04,559
had to kill a few plants because i just

450
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,160
wasn't happy with the way they were

451
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,239
going but i did an experiment

452
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,559
i learned i know what not to do next

453
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,759
time trust me i know what not to do that

454
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,958
is what i learned the most

455
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,559
what not to do next time um i've done a

456
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,078
full episode about mistakes i'm kind of

457
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,000
off on a ramble here but i enjoy it

458
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,838
um i've done a full episode about my

459
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,919
mistakes i don't post my failures to

460
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,000
social media you only see my victories

461
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,360
but the failures are what have made me a

462
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,440
better grower

463
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,360
i don't learn anything if i'm successful

464
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,040
every time if i don't get a bug

465
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
if i don't get a nutrient deficiency if

466
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,199
i don't run into an equipment failure

467
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,559
what do i learn my ego gets ahead of me

468
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,079
and i start thinking i can do anything

469
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,479
in the garden i start dancing in there

470
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:42,479
and

471
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,759
popping bottles of kombucha and throwing

472
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,199
quinoa flakes in the air like it's a

473
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,958
[ __ ] party that's just a hippie joke

474
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,879
guys don't take me too seriously

475
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,319
but then i do [ __ ] like i go ahead and

476
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,600
replace [ __ ] lights in the middle of

477
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,680
winter and then three days later it's a

478
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
negative 17. i don't have hps lights in

479
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,759
this grow room to keep the grow warm

480
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
anymore

481
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,879
and all my plants look like [ __ ] and

482
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,440
nearly die what i make mistakes like

483
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,600
that

484
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,440
because i just wasn't thinking i'd been

485
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,959
winning too much i hadn't taken an l in

486
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
a long time guess what i [ __ ] lost

487
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,198
that time

488
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,799
learned my big lesson from that l

489
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,799
anyway you guys don't be afraid to fail

490
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,479
a couple times but also set yourself up

491
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,439
for success don't let the internet ruin

492
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,278
your grow

493
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,880
if i say you should do something

494
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,399
research it think about it i'm not the

495
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,519
only grower that knows what i'm talking

496
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,278
about there are a lot of other people

497
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,320
you can cross-reference what i said with

498
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,078
them

499
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,839
guru has different approaches to how i

500
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,000
grow scotty has different approaches

501
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,000
or different approaches than how i grow

502
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,919
scotty grows differently than i grow

503
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,278
uh who else out there has a aquaponics

504
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,198
steve potent ponics steve grows

505
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,799
completely differently than i grow

506
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,399
but we're both having great success

507
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,838
we've both got podcasts that could teach

508
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,278
you don't be afraid to cross-reference

509
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,880
our knowledge you guys don't be

510
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,159
don't be scared to double check me

511
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,759
especially if you're growing a little

512
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,958
bit differently than what i'm used to

513
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,039
and what i'm teaching

514
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,198
uh straight up i do soilless mix or

515
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,799
cocoa in about a three gallon pot

516
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,399
uh if it's a commercial grow i'm using

517
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,519
gavitas if it's a personal girl i'm

518
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,039
using leds

519
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,799
if you're doing something differently my

520
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,319
advice is going to be a little bit

521
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,319
different you know

522
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,160
all right i think i made my point there

523
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,278
don't let the internet sway you you guys

524
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,559
have a goal have a plan [ __ ] do it i

525
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,278
see a lot of people say

526
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,799
can i do this and i just answer yes a

527
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,480
lot of the times because

528
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,479
yes and then i see people just trying to

529
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,320
[ __ ] crush their dreams

530
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,800
don't let the dream crushers crush your

531
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,440
dreams dude you can do it yes you can

532
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,639
uh can i do this most likely with

533
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,920
cannabis yes you can

534
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,120
if you can't i'm gonna tell you no

535
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,799
that'll kill your plants or no you can't

536
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,159
do it i'll give you a reason why though

537
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,599
i'm not just gonna [ __ ] all over your

538
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,719
hopes and dreams and say no you can't do

539
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,920
that and you're [ __ ] and [ __ ]

540
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,440
don't forget your helmet

541
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,039
no i'm gonna tell you why you can't do

542
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,480
that help you learn help you set

543
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,078
yourself up for success

544
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,839
help you have a good grow and let you

545
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,758
know why the idea is simply not going to

546
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,240
work before you spend time energy money

547
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,079
effort

548
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,759
and a broken heart on this crazy

549
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,479
experiment somebody's probably already

550
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,560
done

551
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,600
all right i'm way into this episode

552
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,479
where are we

553
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,079
i got to see when i started uh that much

554
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,399
time minus that much time means i got

555
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,638
plenty more time that's what that means

556
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,159
um i got a message where did this one

557
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,039
come from this looks like it came from

558
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,039
the website

559
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,159
yes on the irie genetics website at

560
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,000
iriegenetics.com there's a grow help tab

561
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,679
if you click on that grow help tab

562
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,278
we do ask you a few preliminary

563
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,198
questions we basically ask what strain

564
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,439
you're growing where you're growing it

565
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,639
uh if you're in veg flower what kind of

566
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,320
medium you're using

567
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
just a few details to help me answer

568
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,440
your question it makes it easier for me

569
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,000
when i've got some details

570
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,759
so that is where this question came from

571
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,120
got a lot of information

572
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,959
it gets down to the point it says i love

573
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,000
your show so much i listen to you on the

574
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,919

580
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,240
could you please talk about

581
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,679
enzymes ah first off bruh i'm sorry if

582
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,879
the website was giving you [ __ ]

583
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,159
i hope you were able to post your

584
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,360
questions to the website maybe i should

585
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,799
check on that because

586
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,000
i haven't gotten a question in a minute

587
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,359
on there somebody sent me questions on

588
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,278
the website go to the grow help tab hit

589
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,039
me up make sure i'm getting those

590
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,120
um i've got a question could you please

591
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,879
talk about enzymes yes i will talk about

592
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,240
enzymes for you i wrote notes

593
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,240
somewhere here they are they're on this

594
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,359
page ooh i got scared thought i lost my

595
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,000
enzyme notes

596
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,279
um can you talk about enzymes and talk

597
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,679
about if i can use them

598
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,918
every watering as well as microbes i

599
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,679
just try to beef up non-feed days

600
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,919
or should i use them every time um

601
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
my first reaction to this was microbes

602
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,439
and enzymes every feeding

603
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,599
and i just saw dollar signs coming out

604
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,120
it's like that's [ __ ] expensive dude

605
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,719
um no you don't need to do that every

606
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,519
time that's going to get spendy

607
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,200
and that's quite excessive um those are

608
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,160
two expensive products enzymes and

609
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,919
microbes are

610
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,679
like the the turbo charge of your grow

611
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,559
and those are those are expensive so i

612
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,080
wouldn't use those

613
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:46,480
every time no i would use them

614
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,240
once a week and i would use them

615
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,120
separately in alternate feeding so if

616
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,798
you feed

617
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,079
uh you're probably gonna feed you're

618
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:53,440
gonna feed at least two or three times a

619
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,879
week right you got two or three separate

620
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,000
waterings per week no matter how big

621
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,440
your pots are

622
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,200
so let's say monday you know i like to

623
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
feed on monday give these bad [ __ ]

624
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,679
their main mix and some enzymes or their

625
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,558
main mix and some microbes one or the

626
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,000
other

627
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,160
then the next feeding give them their

628
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,200
main mix and the other one whichever one

629
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
you didn't give them

630
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,319
give it the main mix then that extra

631
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,678
nutrient the

632
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,519
enzymes are microbes sorry i'm thinking

633
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,559
about the next feeding the next feeding

634
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,160
may just be water

635
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,079
i may just give it plain water if you're

636
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
in uh soilless mix if you're in cocoa

637
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,399
feed it

638
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,160
if you're in hydro feed it but the next

639
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,320
time just water and then two feeds then

640
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,720
water maybe would be what i would do

641
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,839
but let's talk a little bit about these

642
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,000
products these uh

643
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,879
things that you're asking about um

644
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,200
enzymes

645
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,559
enzymes basically get in your they've

646
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,160
got to be fed in you can't follow your

647
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:38,639
feed them enzymes get down into the root

648
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,360
zone

649
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,280
and start breaking up any dead uh

650
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,719
anything that's dead funky decaying

651
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,480
dying matter that's not

652
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,839
going to be useful to the plant to the

653
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,200
rhizosphere it gets in there and just

654
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:50,480
eats all the dead [ __ ] that's what the

655
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,720
enzymes will do

656
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,558
kind of works as a cleaner uh cleans and

657
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,240
breaks down dead [ __ ] in your root zone

658
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:56,798
dying roots the root tips that are dying

659
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,480
off

660
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,000
if a root grew thought there's going to

661
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,120
be water here and you quit watering

662
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,279
enough to get to water

663
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,399
to that zone when you pour those enzymes

664
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,639
in there they're going to eat that dead

665
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,320
[ __ ] that died in there next time

666
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,840
to help clean it up keep it healthy keep

667
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,558
it moving kind of like a little uh

668
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,000
they're the

669
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,678
the recyclers they're just in there the

670
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,079
bottom feeders just cleaning [ __ ] up in

671
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,400
there

672
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:20,319
so that's enzymes um i do not have

673
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,240
the appropriate microscope nor the

674
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,480
appropriate education to tell you

675
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,599
if those enzymes are going to damage

676
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,599
your microbes

677
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,798
so i feel it would be wise beneficial to

678
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,038
feed them separately

679
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,000
i've seen studies that argue that the

680
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,759
enzymes could

681
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,200
disrupt the microbes if the microbes

682
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,960
could disrupt the enzymes

683
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,640
i've also seen studies that claim they

684
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,079
work together so

685
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,759
find the article that you agree with and

686
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,960
follow that one i guess but i would feed

687
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,720
them separately

688
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,240
so that is enzymes enzymes get in there

689
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,480
and clean [ __ ] up and break it down

690
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,919
that's why you hear uh enzymatic action

691
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,120
that's they're just breaking [ __ ] up

692
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,640
i think i like the little scrubbing

693
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,918
bubbles they're just in there scrubbing

694
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,280
and just chewing and just eating just

695
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,360
breaking [ __ ] down

696
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,879
uh then now let's talk about microbes

697
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,399
we've got a couple of different kinds of

698
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,600
microbes that come in mind

699
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,480
when we were talking about growing

700
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,719
cannabis uh we got mycorrhizal fungi and

701
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,360
beneficial bacteria

702
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,600
these things have a lot of different

703
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,678
functions when it comes to plants

704
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,119
these are the things that basically work

705
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,038
between the earth

706
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,038
and the plant they're the communicator

707
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,759
between your plant's root zone

708
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,960
and the der these things pick up a lot

709
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:24,480
of signals

710
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,319
they tell the plant a lot of things they

711
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,919
deliver a lot of things they provide

712
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,678
a lot of different functions there are

713
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,640
so many different types of microbes and

714
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,960
fungi

715
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,080
that they all have different jobs but

716
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,919
also can perform

717
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,678
each other's jobs i'm going to be honest

718
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,120
with you i am not the microbe

719
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,600
expert uh my friends scotty and guru uh

720
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,158
are [ __ ] overloaded with microbe

721
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,240
knowledge

722
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,400
ask them about microbes you will get a

723
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,480
long long episode

724
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,400
they're passionate about microbes but

725
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,279
the microbes basically help

726
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,519
buffer your soil or soilless mix they

727
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,279
help deliver the nutrients to the plants

728
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,679
they help the plants decide which

729
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,599
nutrients they want to be delivered

730
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,200
ah they uh what else do they do i wrote

731
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,279
something else oh they also help convert

732
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,558
nutrients into usable food

733
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,399
sometimes when we're pouring certain

734
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,480
things into the the rhizosphere there

735
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,840
into the nutrients into the root zone

736
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,079
some of those things aren't readily

737
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,678
available for the plants

738
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,519
those little microbes go oh i get this

739
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,400
little thing here and i got to do this

740
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,599
to it whomp

741
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
and it does a little magic trick and the

742
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,599
plant goes oh i can eat that now thank

743
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,038
you bro

744
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,798
so it's like just a little a little

745
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:27,919
buffer a little in between between the

746
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,319
root zone the earth

747
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,919
so to speak and the root of the plant

748
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,480
the microbes are the part that talk to

749
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,520
that

750
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,360
they're basically uh so if the the

751
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,720
nutrients are the i'm trying to pick

752
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,158
which end of this relationship i want to

753
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,759
be it's a drive-through window

754
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,679
you got the restaurant you got the

755
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,640
person coming up to the drive-through

756
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,919
the microbes are the pimply-faced kid

757
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,759
passing the burger

758
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,840
through the window or if you're going to

759
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,079
starbucks it's the beautiful barista

760
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,519
passing the the coffee over the window

761
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,119
that's the microbe for you they

762
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,480
they provide that relationship they take

763
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,678
the money they say hey we gotta give

764
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,440
this person this

765
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,559
uh stomachache [ __ ] toothache caramel

766
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,840
caffeine expendi and then they take the

767
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,960
money and i'm just making up starbucks

768
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,000
drinks couldn't think of one off the top

769
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
of my head

770
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,960
but they do the exchange for you

771
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,319
basically they take the money and then

772
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,079
they give you the drink and they send

773
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,558
you on your way so that's what microbes

774
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,119
are doing

775
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:21,038
and once again you guys i am not the

776
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,158
scientist i don't have a microscope or a

777
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,000
phd

778
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,440
i do have grow experience that's where i

779
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,119
think i am valuable i've got a lot of

780
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,679
experience i understand these plants on

781
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,959
a

782
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,320
not like a science level it's a

783
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,600
different level i just get them and i

784
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,319
can teach you that way

785
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,719
anyway i'm trying to defend myself here

786
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,480
um

787
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,079
but i'm just kind of talking a little

788
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,839
bit about microbes and enzymes

789
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,918
with the level of understanding that

790
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,639
i've got trying to let you understand

791
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,400
so um i would not use those products

792
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,159
they're expensive dude micro products

793
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,360
and enzymatic products can be very

794
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,880
expensive so

795
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,719
don't use them every watering that's

796
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,240
going to get expensive also i don't

797
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,079
think it's a there's no it's not

798
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,960
necessary there's no need for that

799
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,480
but do feed them on separate days uh

800
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,759
most of the microbe products you can

801
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,200
follow the instructions

802
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,640
with the dosage rate you're not going to

803
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,679
overdo it you can't overdo it with

804
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,880
microbes

805
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,038
the only thing you're doing is wasting

806
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,880
money when it gets to be too expensive

807
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,558
enzymes i don't know if you could over

808
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,159
feed maybe they could cause damage i've

809
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,000
never gotten that far with an enzymatic

810
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,520
product product before

811
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,400
but i hope i answered your question this

812
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,558
one did come from our buddy pt brad

813
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,080
pt brad thank you for the great question

814
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,279
i hope we rescued your strawberry

815
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:26,720
shortcake and

816
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,558
banana diesel if you've got any more

817
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,079
questions i do look forward to you uh

818
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,678
sending me more updates

819
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,678
uh ladies and gentlemen boys and girls i

820
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,360
do uh once again send me those questions

821
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,000
on the grow help tab because i haven't

822
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,000
gotten a message

823
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,599
there in a moment this message reminded

824
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,038
me that i don't think that's popping up

825
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,678
you guys might want to test me and send
