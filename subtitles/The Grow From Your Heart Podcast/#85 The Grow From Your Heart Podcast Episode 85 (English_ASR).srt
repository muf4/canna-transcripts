much uh you called me an expert before I

111
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:01,239
am no expert I just an Enthusiast who

112
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,120
has had a camera for a while I like that

113

115
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,079
corrected on the show uh so he's our

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,639
Enthusiast with a lot of experience here

117
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,120
that's what we'll call him not an expert

118
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,479
so take everything he has with the grain

119
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,319
of salt you guys I'm just kidding I

120

opinion so that's why I brought you here

00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,198
and slobs here he's going to chime in

123
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,560
once in a while and then we're going to

124
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,800
uh we're going to do this episode then

125
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,879
we're going to have another Fat dab

126
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,560
session then we're going to record an

127
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,719
episode featuring our good buddy slop

128
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,160
over here so let's jump into the

129
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,479
photography with our good buddy who's

130
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,720
almost an expert in my opinion Joe uh

131
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,120
what we want to do is improve the

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
listeners uh photography did I just say

133
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,360
that yeah anyway what we want to do is

134
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,439
improve their photography so I guess the

135
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,879
main thing that I'll start with is what

136
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,519
you guys need to do is think about why

137
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,360
are you shooting photography what's your

138
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,319
point um are you going to do it for

139
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
advertising are you going to do it for

140
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,879
magazine shots or are you simply just

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,840
trying to be cool on social media and

142
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,279
get a lot of followers uh because that's

143
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,399
going to make a huge difference in a lot

144
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,559
of the equipment that you need to

145
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,359
purchase

146
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,519
so that's pretty much what I came up

147
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,960
with and then I wanted to ask Joe if he

148
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,279
could elaborate on that and then also if

149
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,680
he could help us select a camera for our

150
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,198
purchase and or for our purpose and

151
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,680
possibly that fits our budget does that

152
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,478
make any sense to you bro yeah most

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,759
certainly awesome uh if you're doing the

154
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:22,240
social media thing stick with your phone

155
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,439
you your phone is uh an amazing device

156
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,478
you know 9 megapixels 10 megapixels even

157
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,079
more in some that's ridiculous as long

158
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,038
as you have the proper lighting that

159
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,000
phone will do everything that you need

160
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,800
um for the point and shoot if you're a

161
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,160
blogger somebody who's taking pictures

162

them on blogs too certainly No Limit

173
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,639
but if you must have the camera

174
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:08,038
quality uh the top camera quality in all

175
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,560
aspects that's definitely the DSLR a

176
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,759
digital single lens reflex camera nice a

177
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,079
uh yeah that's the way to do it you guys

178
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,720
there will not be a test so you don't

179
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:19,439
have to try to remember that yes all

180
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,639
right I don't really know what it means

181
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,360
but I know that that's what it stands

182
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,800
for you know the acronym okay I'm glad I

183
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,038
didn't ask uh so that's Joe proved the

184
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,400
point right there just think about what

185
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,639
you're shooting for if you're just

186
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,038
trying to be on Instagram if you're

187
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,840
going blogging you don't need to spend a

188
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,879
million dollars on all of your equipment

189
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,079
if you're just trying to shoot some

190
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,240
Instagram pictures if you're trying to

191
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,120

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Facebook you can use your phone all of

193
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,879
the new iPhones the Samsung phones my

194
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,960
iPhone 6 takes amazing pictures all the

195
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,240
new phones you can get really quality

196
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,959
pictures and he said lighting uh we'll

197
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,840
get into Lighting in just a minute um if

198
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,399
you guys want to be you know I've had a

199
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,318
magazine shot and I did not use a super

200
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,719
expensive camera I used a $200 camera

201
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,598
for that so it's not all about the

202
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,240
camera a lot of it is about the settings

203
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,240
a lot of it is about the lighting a lot

204
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,038
of it is about learning where to shoot

205
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,840
from and maybe a little bit of editing

206
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,519
but we'll get into that more um so

207
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,079
select a camera that fits your budget

208
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,198
get the best camera you can for your

209
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,800
budget when I first bought my camera I

210
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,478
was intimidated I bought a point and

211
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,879
shoot camera and I feel like I almost I

212
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,478
didn't waste the $200 but if I would

213
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,840
have put that money toward my nice DSLR

214
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:24,839
camera in the beginning I would be

215
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,399
further in shooting uh don't be

216
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,918
intimidated by a camera with a lot of

217
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,318
settings most of the new dslrs I think

218
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,719
all of them have an auto setting and so

219
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,039
you can learn through that auto setting

220
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,080
most all new cameras are extremely

221
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,279
userfriendly

222
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,918
manufacturers know who they're making

223
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,158
cameras for they know what Their

224
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:47,198
audience is uh even if you've never used

225
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:49,519
if as long as you're technology capable

226
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,120

capable buy any camera you want and you

228
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,720
will be able to figure it out if it's

229
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,479
not on your own through

230
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,919
experimenting YouTube YouTube definitely

231
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,439

just type in this camera and then the

233
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,598
question you have about it and it will

234
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,478
pop up 17 videos and watch a couple of

235
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,680
them and filter out the [ __ ] cuz

236
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:10,399
every one of those guys is going to tell

237
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,879
you some weird thing that is unnecessary

238
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,878
so just watch three videos and figure

239
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,560
out do the math on that get get the

240
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,879

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,519
and also while you're shopping uh there

258
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,600
are a couple of accessories that we we

259
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,120
talked about this a little bit before

260
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,040
there are definitely some accessories

261
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,120
that we would all recommend uh while

262
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,639
you're shopping get yourself a tripod

263
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,039
yes uh don't get a sorry to interrupt

264
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:06,360
don't get a cheap tripod like there are

265
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:09,319
tripods out there for $ 20 and $30 which

266
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,278
will work but they're plastic and they

267
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,120
they're soft and they're not meant to

268
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,679
last and they're not meant to really be

269
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,600
hauled around and that kind of stuff and

270
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,639
if you're not going to haul it around

271
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,440
and you're just going to leave it in one

272
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,679
place and take pictures always buy that

273
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,839
20 or $30 one but the difference between

274
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:27,599
a $30 tripod and a $70 tripod is giant

275
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,800
it's metal it's very sturdy it's gonna

276
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,120
last forever it will last as many

277
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:33,479
cameras as you could buy I ruined my $30

278
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,360
tripod quite quickly the height

279
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,759
adjustment stripped out so it's stuck at

280
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,200
one height if I want to move it up I got

281
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,439
to like yank it uh so I've got the $70

282
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,720
DX one that they have at Best Buy dude

283
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,200
great investment I agree uh the tripod

284
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,079
will make your pictures your photos will

285
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,399
be not wobbly you'll be able to leave

286
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:49,958
the shutter open a little bit longer

287
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,679
because you're not holding it and no

288
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,479
matter how steady you think you are

289
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,958
you're shaking yes and uh the way

290
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,519
physics Works think about like a

291
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,799
flashlight if you turn the flashlight

292
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,959
you make a nice Arc with the light

293
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,759
you're doing that with the lens you're

294
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,239
not just wobbling it you're waving the

295
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,559
whole end of the lens cuz the part

296
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,720
that's shooting is wiggling in a much

297
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,799
yeah it's you're making a cone shape

298
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,399
sorry that's science we we'll move on

299
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:13,240
also get yourself a nice case if you can

300
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,078
get a bag a soft bag or a case or

301
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,240
something for the camera do that because

302
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,639
you're going to want to carry extra

303
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,278
lenses you're going to want to carry a

304
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,360
lens cleaner you need the little soft

305
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,120
cloth to clean off the lens especially

306
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,039
when shooting cannabis uh my lens is

307
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,440
freaking sticky all the time it's I got

308
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,000
to clean it off I get too close to the

309
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,480
plants or something and and then just

310
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,639
you touch it and then it tricomes all

311
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,039
over your lens old Cotton t-shirts

312
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,078
nothing wrong with that no socks don't

313
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,838
use a sock actually a fresh sock there

314
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,638
is nothing wrong with that anything

315
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,800
that's soft you know don't use like

316
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,680
anything soft I'm not going to tell you

317
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:48,399
what not to use but really okay don't

318
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,039
press too hard to scratch up the lens

319
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,720
and I personally like to go to the

320
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,039
sunglasses store and get that little rag

321
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,800
that they use to clean your sunglasses

322
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,039
microfiber yes microfiber that's what

323
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,159
it's called I think that works perfect

324
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,240
for my camer lens all right so then

325
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:04,120

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,159
you recommend a few lenses I don't want

357
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,760
to give any like specific lens to get

358
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,240
just cuz everybody you know I don't want

359
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,319
it to be bad and then you say oh this

360
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,879
guy said that but but it's are you

361
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,760
trying to take pictures of tricomes are

362
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,240
you trying to take pictures of buds off

363
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,919
the plant on the plant do you want to

364
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,959
take pictures of the whole plant

365
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,838
different lenses are going to do

366
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:24,399
different things you can get you know

367
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,320
shorter focal length plants or plants

368
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:31,278
shorter focal length lenses uh for

369
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,720
portraits and uh gen that's just really

370
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:36,039
General you can get

371
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,759
uh all different there's all different

372
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:39,599
kinds of lenses really depends on what

373
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,439
you want to do and each camera is going

374
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
to have different lenses each brand is

375
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,519
going to have different lenses if we're

376
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,800
just talking about dslrs right now but

377
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:51,120
that that's the only thing that lenses

378
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:52,479
really apply to uh your lens and uh

379
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,600
you're buying your lens and your body

380
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,879
separate I mean if you're buying them in

381
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,079
a box together it's set you're getting

382
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,639
that for a reason if you're buying the

383
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,638
the body that you want because that the

384
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,799
body has all the features that you want

385
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,159
and then the lens because that lens has

386
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,399
all the features that you want it

387
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,439
depends on what you want to do so when

388
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,360
it says body only they're sending me a

389
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,839
usable camera with no lens essentially

390
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,399
correct okay cuz that's that's

391
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,480
misleading I did not know anything about

392
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,639
that when I was camera shopping I was

393
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,079
like what the hell does that mean body

394
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,159
only I wondered if there were mechanics

395
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:24,638
inside of there oh yeah it's misleading

396
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,600
is that like just the plastic or is

397
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,278
there yeah so now I know that there you

398
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,959
go guys that was a good piece of advice

399
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:33,838
um but that said you can certainly get

400
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:37,078
lenses that fit all applications uh you

401
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,360
can get like the the telephoto lens it's

402
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:44,000
telephoto and tele macro uh so you like

403
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,440
I use just as the easy lens for all

404
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,440
aspects I use it I think it's a an 18 to

405
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,680
200 it's a it's a it's a Nikon that's a

406
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,279
nice range it's a huge range it's and

407
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,758
that fits anything that you want you

408
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,120
want to take a picture of a mountain

409
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,959
you're good you want to take a picture

410
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:06,560
of a Tricom you're good

411
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:08,359
so that's a huge got 55 I got the 55 to

412
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,679
200 in my case right here yeah there you

413
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,560
go that's this is my go-to lens right

414
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,399
here this is the one I use quite often

415
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,599
everything that you need it to do yeah

416
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,360
without getting too specific okay so

417
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,519
guys what I use uh since Joe approves of

418
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,039
my setup here I'm using the Nikon D3200

419
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,440
and I bought the package that comes with

420
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,759
the case and the two lenses and I

421
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,800
usually use the 55 to 200 lens uh but

422
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,120
when I want to get in there uh sometimes

423
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,599
it's hard to maneuver around the grow

424
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,679
room if you can't back up from the plant

425
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,120
if you're up close then I'll switch to

426
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,198
the and I'm looking at the right number

427
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,679
so I don't mislead anybody here it's the

428
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:46,559
18 to 55 is the one I use when I can't

429
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:48,359
maneuver around the room too well if I'm

430
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,958
further away I go for this longer lens

431
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,519
if I'm close in tight I use the 18 to 55

432
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,758
I get much better shots with this uh 55

433
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,240
to 200 lens this is my go-to right here

434
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:02,079
so when we're saying all of this um

435
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,360
basically you to take the macro shots on

436
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:08,159
that 55 to 200 you put it all the way to

437
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,600
200 and on a tripod and you're going to

438
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:15,559
be about 18 20 Ines away from the nug uh

439
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,920
with your 200 zoomed all the way out

440
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,879
into that nug and that's how you're

441
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,519
getting your macro shots in that

442
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,399
specific zoomed all the way out or all

443
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,720
the way in well you're zoomed into what

444
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,759
you're trying to your 200 is extended as

445
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,879
far as it will go it you're you set it

446
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:34,560
to 200 so the lens is out and on your

447
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,360
viewfinder it's zoomed in on your

448
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:41,119
subject okay uh and then that's where

449
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,318
you find your macro setting in that lens

450
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,759
nice yeah that's so that's but that's in

451
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,198
these types of lenses that do everything

452
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,639
I think I've been off the mic for so

453
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,679
much of this oh I've got you up loud

454
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,799
enough to I think we can get you in

455
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:55,559
there uh the but that that so those are

456
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,479
mic mics those are lenses that do

457
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,879
everything if you want to take pictures

458
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,600
of just Tricom

459
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,039
you know really closeup things going on

460
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,480
in your garden you could take you know

461
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,120
awesome pictures of soil who knows what

462
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,959
you'll find in there you could take

463
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,198
pictures of uh whole nugs tricomes

464
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,239
that's really what you're looking for

465
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:16,758
you want to get like a dedicated macro

466
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,198
lens something that won't take pictures

467
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,000
of mountains something that won't take

468
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:24,078
pictures of your family no portraits

469
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,839
just little tiny stuff just little

470
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,519
things okay uh but yeah get the right

471
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:29,480
lens for the right job is kind of do

472
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,078
your research

473
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,319
look for something that's going tooot in

474
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:38,559
5 to one that's all about uh full full

475
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:42,879
resolution on big prints essentially

476
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:46,000
okay uh like if you have an 8 by 11

477
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,439
picture uh of a triome and it's

478
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,480
perfectly in focused and beautiful

479
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,360
that's because somebody was using like a

480
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,920
five to one lens that would allow you to

481
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,039
shoot that whole frame okay that makes

482
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:03,278
sense I get it you're zoomed into to

483
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:04,519
lifelike you're zoomed into real life so

484
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,000
basically people got to know what

485
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,400
they're aiming for and that can lead us

486
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,480
into another part of this uh we're going

487
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,959
to kind of skip a little part of the

488
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,120
notes that we made but uh instead of

489
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,160
just no no I like I like it when it

490
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,239
flows no no I like it I'm the one

491
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,558
skipping it because I like the way that

492
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,798
it's flowing it flows better we'll do

493
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:22,160
that instead of just shooting at random

494
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:23,400
[ __ ] kind of plan out your shot also

495
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,360
that's a good thing that's a good point

496
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,319
since Jo's talking about your lens

497
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,078
you're gonna have to know what you're

498
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,079
aiming for when you put this lens on

499
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,399
your camera you can't go putting on your

500
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,439
macro lens and then try to take a

501
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,400
picture of the top Cola you got to get

502
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,279
your 200 lens out to take pictures of

503
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,880
the top you kind of know what you're

504
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,119
aiming for plan your shot and uh like

505
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,480
think about like Joe said if you want to

506
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,239
take a picture of a triome or if you

507
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,798
want to take a picture of some soil

508
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,960
think about it and you'll you'll see it

509
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,359
when you walk through the grow room

510
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,759
something will go right here look at

511
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,599
this and when it catches your eye that

512
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,119
means it catches the camera and try to

513
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:55,918
stand where you were when it got your

514
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,000
eye try to try to replicate that a

515
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,159
little bit don't uh don't be scared to

516
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,279
take a lot of of pictures of even the

517
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,120
same thing and then you know there'll be

518
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,720
that one that's just like this is the

519
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,239
one like if you have the time to you

520
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,720
know I don't know take some dabs and

521
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,279
look through your pictures like the

522
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,759
magic of memory cards exactly we're not

523
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,480
wasting film anymore we're just clicking

524
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,038
away on a memory card we're wasting RAM

525
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,839
and we can delete it all and do do it

526
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,759
all over again tomorrow so yeah just

527
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,720
plan out your shot uh choose the right

528
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,038
lens for your shot yeah on just just to

529
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,120
make a a correction on that with the 200

530
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,519
the 55 to 200 when you're at 200 I don't

531
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,759
want anybody to think that you can take

532
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,079
a picture of a Tricom with the 200 it

533
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,519
won't work that way yeah I was kind of

534
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,158
thinking that you can take a picture you

535
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,200
can take really closeup good shots of

536
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,799
nugs on your plant you could take where

537
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,640
you will see each individual Tricom as a

538
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,759
DOT sometimes the stock just depending

539
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,880
on how good the lighting is but don't

540
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:53,440
think you're going to get that real

541
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,440
super official macro photography with

542
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,720
without a macro specific lens and I just

543
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,240
wrote something down to try not to

544
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,519
forget it um

545
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,279
we're going to go into lighting next

546
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,720
because you just hinted on that but you

547
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:05,480
guys one huge hint I can give you just

548
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,880
super quickly get yourself either a

549
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,679
method seven lens oh I totally forgot

550
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,640
about those yeah we both forgot use them

551
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,000
I have them they're amazing yeah so get

552
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,520
you it's either or you can just put the

553
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,200
sunglasses right over your camera if

554
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,679
you're ghetto you can do that too that

555
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,600
works but yeah that does work method

556
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,400
seven makes a a filter that cuts out the

557
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,000
uh the hid the high intensity discharge

558
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,798
light it cuts that color out and you can

559
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,919
see the natural color of your plants so

560
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,279
if you're not able to take the plants

561
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,919
out of the room uh the method 7 lens is

562
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:33,798
a good way to go so let's work into

563
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,520
lighting a little bit how should we be

564
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,798
lighting our cannabis plants when we're

565
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,839
taking pictures uh ideally not around

566
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,599
HPS lights uh not even T5 lights that's

567
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:45,399
not true light I mean it's super white

568
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,959
it looks good but it's not the true

569
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,440
representation of your plant okay uh it

570
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,000
puts a little bit of a blue to it I've

571
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,558
noticed certainly it could put any Hue

572
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,519
on it just depending on the other lights

573
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,720
in the room or number of factors

574
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,200
reflecting from yeah okay so your

575
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:06,000
lighting what's easiest you know get in

576
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,759
a room with really good outside lighting

577
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,359
or you know a whole bunch of CFLs

578
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,480
they're pretty pretty flat white easy to

579
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,839
color balance off of your camera if you

580
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,960
want to get into your settings and do

581
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,158
that but that's ideal if you don't have

582
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,759
that and you have to stay in your girl

583
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,520
room you know turn the HPS lights off

584
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:26,158
and just turn your overhead light on uh

585
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:29,279
and use a flash okay uh a flash will

586
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,960
overcome a lot is the uh stock flash

587
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,960
that came on most of our DSL cameras

588
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,079
going to be DSLR cameras is that going

589
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,720
to be good enough or should we get like

590
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,000
a ring like a like an aftermarket flash

591
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,480
yeah if you can afford an aftermarket

592
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,159
flash it is going to be a lot far

593
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,759
superior to the one built in but that

594
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,360
one that's built in is not too shabby

595
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,279
either it will definitely get the job

596
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,879
done for most applications okay when

597
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,038
you're getting an aftermarket flash you

598
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,320
should really know why you're about to

599
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,759
spend $160 on a flash like there's

600
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,480
there's a there's reasons for it I want

601
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:03,038
to tell you what they are

602
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,839
because that's cheating figure out the

603
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:08,519
reason nice I like that but we'll get to

604
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,558
some reasons later yeah yeah all right

605
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,119
so more lighting is usually the key

606
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,480
right more lighting more lighting the

607
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:16,599
better sunlight if you can sunlight's

608
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,558
the the most ideal but I know everybody

609
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:20,038
can't take their plants outside yeah my

610
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,240
favorite meme is the old lady looking

611
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:23,000
out the window and it says there's my

612
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,839
neighbor taking pictures of his Bongs in

613
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,119
the sunlight again that's a fantastic

614
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,038
one yeah yeah you see it on Instagram

615
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,000
all the time well I do because I follow

616
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,839
usually hot plants glass and pit bulls

617
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,640
is my Instagram

618
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:37,278
feed popular and ladies don't don't and

619
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,679
some ladies yeah you're right I'll be

620
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:40,919
honest and some

621
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,640
booties shout out to booties let's let's

622
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,600
try to get back on track slop come on um

623
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,919
so I wrote down settings what kind of

624
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,480
settings should I throw my is it cool to

625
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,278
just walk in there on Auto and just

626
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,360
start Auto firing or do I absolutely

627
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:53,640
that's totally fine there's nothing

628
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,759
wrong with that you'll get pictures

629
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,720
that'll be that'll be useful they might

630
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,798
not be the best but they're certainly

631
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,558
will be usable okay compared to if you

632
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,119
just throw it in manual without knowing

633
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:08,399
anything you know it'll probably just be

634
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:09,678
black uh but settings you you when you

635
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,120
don't have

636
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,759
ideal I'd say throw it in Auto for the

637
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,479
most of it there's no there's no reason

638
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,640
to not use Auto if you have great

639
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,440
lighting Auto is the best setting uh

640
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,679
just because it it'll continually

641
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,200
correct it will just make everything

642
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,038
easy and pretty and you can focus on

643
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,558
taking the pictures especially if you're

644
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:32,319
not getting paid like you don't need

645
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,440
need to be 1,00% perfect on everything

646
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,000
very true if they're just for your

647
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,960
Instagram feed you don't you don't need

648
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,720
to be all critical about it of course if

649
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,840
you want to be critical more power to

650
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,558
you yeah that's part of the art if

651
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,720
you're into that so the settings uh you

652
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,440
so settings are going to be for what if

653
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,558
you want to take pictures in the dark

654
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,840
just using flash randomly to overcome

655
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:52,879
the HPS or when the hpss are on and you

656
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:56,918
have to change the setting in your

657
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,200
camera to filter out that on the Fly and

658
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,120
don't be afraid to change settings you

659
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,240
guys it's something you're going to have

660
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,678
to learn to do with the camera it's

661
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,599
something I've just recently uh accepted

662
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,559
is that every shot I may have to change

663
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:07,558
a setting or two I didn't realize it was

664
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,119
going to be that way when I started

665
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:10,798
taking photos I thought I could just go

666
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,639
in there and put it on you know put the

667
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:13,759
apture setting here turn the iso to here

668
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,000
put the white balance here and just go

669
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,319
in there and shoot from every angle and

670
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,278
it would be legit but you want to shoot

671
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,319
from you want to take all the pictures

672
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:25,640
you want to take from the without moving

673
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,119
basically yeah uh stand in one spot take

674
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,200
all the pictures you want to take move

675
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,558
to the next spot take all the pictures

676
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,159
you want to take and do it

677
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:33,918
systematically okay I mean I'm not

678
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,760
trying to tell anybody what to do but

679
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,720
that's what I find especially when

680
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,119
you're going through your pictures and

681
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,720
everything is grouped I mean you're

682
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,719
going to be sitting down standing up

683
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,440
leaning over leaning backwards in one

684
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,079
spot without moving too much so you

685
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,278
really get a good feel of what that

686
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:50,798
angle is bringing to the table Yeah and

687
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,038
don't be afraid to take weird angles you

688
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:53,879
guys some of the best shots are really

689
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:55,278
weird angles yeah experiment have fun

690
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,919
hang off of a ladder upside down

691
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,558
backwards and take a picture comfort

692
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,080
zone that's right yep good [ __ ] comes

693
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:01,278
out of there all right so we talked

694
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:03,960
about settings a little bit we got

695
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:06,119
lighting we got lens selection uh sloppy

696
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,000
brought up a great Point earlier uh slop

697
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:11,839
asked me uh what is acceptable editing

698
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,278
for cannabis photography and Joe had a

699
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,798
great answer I'll let you uh give that

700
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,480
answer it's just don't Mal don't edit

701
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:20,400
maliciously yes uh by that Joe means

702
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,038
like myself I'm a seed breeder right I

703
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,400
own a company I try to sell seeds if I

704
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:25,960
were to edit the photos I take of the

705
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,038
plants that come from my seeds I feel

706
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,919
like it would be misleading uh I edit

707
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:31,679
out the background I edit out people I

708
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,480
edit out other plants if there's another

709
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,000
plant next to it I'll go ahead and blur

710
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,200
that one but I don't edit the subject uh

711
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,919
at all most of the time like 99% of my

712
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,120
Instagram and my website are all

713
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,600
unedited and if they are edited you can

714
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,719
tell because it's black and white or

715
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,240
it's something awkward but if you're in

716
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
there making the pistols pink and you're

717
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,000
trying to sell a pack of seeds and those

718
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,558
pistols weren't pink that's what we'll

719
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,519
call malicious editing don't do that

720
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,119
[ __ ] but if you're doing it for art like

721
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,679
if you're doing it for like look at this

722
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,798
beautiful cannabis plant that's cool but

723
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,759
if you're trying to take credit for

724
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,119
growing this beautiful plant don't go

725
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,119
[ __ ] with the colors of misleading

726
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:07,079
people don't false advertis don't try to

727
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,719
trick anyone yeah that's that's all damn

728
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,960
tricksters editing is a lot of fun

729
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,880
though great and there are certain

730
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,038
instances uh when you have to edit like

731
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,039
if you weren't you know you're not

732
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:20,119
always in the best condition for

733
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:23,079
pictures right you don't always have the

734
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,918
best opportunity to take a picture

735
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,480
sometimes you just have to snap snap

736
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:27,640
snap snap you got to brighten it up and

737
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,960
then you got to come back to some

738
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,240
photoshop and and clean it up yep which

739
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,159
is acceptable at that point it just

740
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,038
depends on what you're doing with it

741
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:39,159
yeah I agree all right so uh now that

742
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:40,919
you've learned how to uh select a camera

743
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:42,120
you've got all your accessories you

744
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,559
figured out what kind of lenses you're

745
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,558
going to use you got a cool light to

746
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:46,839
play with uh you've been tweaking on the

747
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:48,359
camera settings you learned how to do

748
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,959
some editing now you just got to get in

749
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:51,558
there in a grow room or wherever your

750
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,720
plants are and just take a shitload of

751
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:54,839
pictures you guys just take pictures

752
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,880
change the

753
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:58,319
settings uh play with the settings Don't

754
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,039
Be Afraid like I said earlier don't be

755
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,119
afraid to get out of Auto if you get out

756
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:04,480
of auto mode I like to take pictures in

757
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:07,359
Auto and then take a note on where what

758
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Auto did Auto will say everything uto

759
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,398
put the iso at this or the white balance

760
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,440
or the shutter speed or the aperture

761
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:15,038
setting was here Otto will take a note

762
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,759
for you in the photo if you save it

763
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,038
right and then look at that note and

764
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:20,278
then write that down and then if you got

765
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:21,960
a really killer picture try to duplicate

766
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,919
that setting in that environment and

767
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,720
then remember like when I was in this

768
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,200
setting this environment last time I

769
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,839
threw on this setting and I took really

770
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Killer pictures and then you'll start

771
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,000
making mental notes of it you'll just

772
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,120
it'll start coming naturally to you

773
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,960
that's really Nifty that's that's crazy

774
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:37,798
I didn't know that it did that yeah if

775
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,278
uh it shows on the camera if you if you

776
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:40,879
save it if you've got a decent camera a

777
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,440
good expensive camera it'll show you

778
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,880
what the settings were when you take it

779
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,000
and unfortunately a lot of those cameras

780
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,919
are also putting uh GPS locations in

781
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,919
there so you got to go turn that setting

782
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,038
off in your camera that's a a good tip

783
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,960
you guys turn off your yeah you don't GE

784
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:57,278
location is the future so shut that off

785
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,079
yes no good metadata in your camera you

786
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:01,519
don't want that so uh and then go take

787
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,119
pictures you guys and then just start

788
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,599
planning out better shots just start

789
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,199
shooting more and then you learn how to

790
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:07,558
set it you learn how to get to a better

791
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,519
setting you learn how to plan out your

792
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:11,519
shot frame your shot and then you'll

793
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,240
learn more how to edit them and then I

794
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,480
think that'll put you on the way to

795
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,720
making amazing photography and then you

796
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:22,159
can have 17 to 25 to 55,000 followers on

797
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,120
Instagram and you can be in the club

798
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,799
notes take notes when you do it there

799
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,959
you go slap how many uh Instagram

800
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,879
followers do you have over there uh I

801
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,558
think have like

802
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,039
1734 or

803
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:35,079
something crazy yeah yeah well it's

804
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:39,038
pretty good man I remember when you

805
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:41,079
moved here oh yeah yeah like 400 yeah so

806
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,398
you've gone a long way all right I feel

807
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:44,079
like I have covered all of the notes

808
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,359
that I have written down I see that

809
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,839
Joe's got a little uh uh what do you

810
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:49,240
call it bullet point thing over there

811
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,439
yeah show them something yeah yeah yeah

812
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,558
the only thing really that I would want

813
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,320
to say is use the Internet it's an

814
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:58,240
amazing resource for everything you know

815
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,319
anything that you want to learn about

816
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,558
about anything especially photography is

817
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,798
out there there's a lot of people who

818
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:08,599
have blogs and YouTube channels I like a

819
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:10,200
guy that calls himself frog grow I think

820
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:12,278
okay he's got a YouTube channel on

821
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,519
photography uh a lot of photographers

822
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,000
are kind of stale to watch because

823
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,440
they're good at photography and not

824
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,440
personal presentation yeah but frog grow

825
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,759
is definitely uh educational and

826
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,360
entertaining sorry I didn't mean to

827
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,839
interrupt you no absolutely that's all

828
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:29,558
I'm saying is find somebody that you can

829
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:31,398
uh watch and just watch them work and

830
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:33,038
you can learn a lot from them yeah you

831
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:34,879
can it's such a crash course sometimes

832
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,158
on YouTube they just show you exactly

833
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,200
what you want to see all right hey slap

834
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:40,559
