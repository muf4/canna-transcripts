00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,720

117
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:11,569
hadn't smoked yeah it was really it was

118
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,099
like 2:00 in the afternoon and I don't

119
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,719
even think I smoked before I went to

120
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,280
work that day because I go to [ __ ]

121
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,660
early to smoke sometimes right

122
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,069
so in smoked all day I was crispy the

123
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,090
only reason my eyes would be crispy is

124
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,959
because they'd been up for too long

125
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:25,198
working you know in the

126
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,758

132
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,550
the boss so I put him in the car like a

133
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:41,550

142
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,818
opportunity to either take him to jail

143
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,879

fifteen he didn't tell us what they are

166
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,908
he said there are fifteen things that

167
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:59,399
they look for as main keys and my buddy

168
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:02,038
hit nine of them so he definitely got

169
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,228
arrested but they let him go to me the

170
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,000
cop was really cool but I've been

171
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:07,680
talking about doing this episode about

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,718
what to do if you're involved with a law

173
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,699
enforcement I feel like my buddy handled

174
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:13,468
himself well he told them he worked in

175
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:22,860
the edge had to over you wouldn't got

176
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:26,209
that call exactly they didn't even tow

177
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,210
his car they pulled it off to the side

178
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,699
they asked us a lot of questions and I'd

179
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,660
quit when I was picking him up be the

180
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,550
cop asked

181
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,750
two questions and then he got friendly

182
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,329
with us and started asking questions

183
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,709
about the industry and work and at one

184
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,879
point I just shut up I was like oh I

185
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:42,930
don't want to answer any more questions

186
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,370
he tricked me

187
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:53,189
he's my friend now and I'm telling him

188
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:54,780
[ __ ] but it brings us to this episode

189
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:58,410
it's a really good way to segue into

190
00:07:54,779 --> 00:08:00,209
this don't drive high because they're

191
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,160
looking for people in Colorado right now

192
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,870
it's the start this officer told us it's

193
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,880
the start of their searching for DUI

194
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,389
season all the troopers have recently

195
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,610
taken a drug expert class a lot of the

196
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,389
state troopers are now cannabis what is

197
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,819
talks

198
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,620
cannabis intoxication or impairment

199
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,959
experts or whatever so where they could

200
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,879
tell how high you are and this cop said

201
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,099
things that made me think he was serious

202
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,709
he knew stuff about my buddy being

203
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,930
intoxicated that I know about cannabis

204
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:29,909
like he knew that level he said your

205
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,410
buddy doesn't look high or act high but

206
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,229
when I interviewed him I can tell there

207
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:37,259
are things inside of him that are going

208
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:39,660
on that indicate that he's high that's

209
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:41,250
kind of [ __ ] like I was impressed by

210
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,669
it the way that he put it like all right

211
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:49,200
Jedi Master like right port medical

212
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:51,689
training I don't know but so let's talk

213
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,770
about some things that we could do to

214
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,420
maybe help ourselves out and not get in

215
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,269
as much trouble and maybe prevent

216
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:02,729
ourselves maybe hopefully walk away

217
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,169
without any [ __ ] handcuffs or maybe

218
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,310
instead of giving all the way taken to

219
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,229
the jail keep yourself in a situation

220
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:09,719
where they call Rasta Jeff and he gets

221
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,860
to come pick you up to sign for you so

222
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,300
let's talk about like if you get pulled

223
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,629
over

224
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,250

225

226
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,120
method of how to handle himself when he

227
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,280
gets pulled over so I'm gonna go around

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,200

00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:31,019

233

people are gonna be like however many

235
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:43,319
percent where you are is really gonna

236
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:46,199
depend on what you should do before you

237
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,390
get the car also if you are driving with

238
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,870
weed regardless of where you are should

239
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:53,789
pretty much put it in the trunk always

240
00:09:50,870 --> 00:10:10,679
know it in no way endorsing breaking the

241
00:09:53,789 --> 00:10:14,000
law let me find you a straight brother

242
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,000

pulled over you got those red and blues

246
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:47,490
behind you they're flickering in a car

247
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:48,990
and driving and just being a person they

248
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,980
don't know what color you are they have

249
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,149
no idea what you're doing

250
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:58,050
I don't know you don't even know you

251
00:10:54,149 --> 00:11:00,629
pulled over up to the window shines like

252
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:03,389
right [ __ ] goddamn face and usually

253
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:05,279
he'll say something like yeah would have

254
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:09,929
the window rolled down before he gets

255
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,309
there okay all right both hands on the

256
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:12,809
steering wheel you want to be able the

257
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:15,589
cops should be able to see both your

258
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:20,789
hands this is to my method is avoid

259
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:23,730
anything possible be extremely

260
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:25,829
what the cop wants to happen him the

261
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,490
most desirable situation possibly

262
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:34,790
submissive to him or trying to avoid

263
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,789
paying money to the state was my goal

264
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:39,360
just keep your hands on the wheel he's

265
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,830
like place license registration say

266
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,100
that's in my glove box can I reach into

267
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,350

268
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,389

269
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,629
out give it to him I don't know

270
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:51,750
different things can happen from there

271
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:54,120
okay so grab July he's like how you

272

273
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,110

275
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,740
of insurance he's gonna walk back to the

276
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:05,340
car hopefully he's gonna come back and

277
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,649
he's gonna say my friend buzzy you were

278
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,540

279
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:11,879
like an [ __ ] in these parts I'm just

280
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,399
gonna give you a warning hopefully it

281
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,490
goes well so the key to it I think we're

282
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,299
all gonna have the same story be polite

283
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,299
to the cop

284
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,829
don't try to be know your rights but

285
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:24,149
don't try to invoke them immediately

286
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,100
when the cop comes up give him what he

287
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,529
wants until he's telling you start

288
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,509
[ __ ] with you like the important

289
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:33,919
thing to keep in mind here is that they

290
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:37,710
have all the power and can execute you I

291
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,620
mean not to [ __ ] flaunt it at all 999

292
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,990
times out of 100 or probably even more

293
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,810
than that you're gonna get annoyed

294
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:48,210
ticketed and sent on your way but you

295
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:49,799
that one time out of however many

296
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,269
they're gonna freak out shoot you in the

297
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:55,259
face or get pissed and drag you to jail

298
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,699
sometimes the cops are just great Rob

299
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:58,350
you take your [ __ ] don't leave me there

300
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,620
take your [ __ ] on the side of the road

301
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:05,430
like I want to continue in mind like

302
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,720
exercise your rights but do if you

303
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:08,489
follow the little script they're

304
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,779
expecting nine times out of ten you're

305
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,639
on your way in ten minutes

306
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:13,079
all right yeah yeah ten fifteen minutes

307
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,569
so I'm gonna take some too brother [ __ ]

308
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,590
I wore the same pullover you've gotten

309
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,820
pulled over you've gone through all the

310
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,470
[ __ ] our buddy buzzy over here is

311
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,030
handled but now when the cop comes back

312
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,210
with your license registration proof of

313
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:25,589
insurance he goes hey Mike uh kind of

314
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,470
smells like you got weed in there I

315
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,030
would like to search your vehicle now

316
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,209
what's the proper response at this point

317
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:42,720
I don't

318
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:44,979
I just I do not consent to any searches

319
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,569
there's just you keep repeating that

320
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,389
when they ask you to search your stuff

321
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:51,188
all right they need major probable cause

322
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:54,399
and they'll make [ __ ] up like you've got

323
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:55,860
Altoids that's probable cause excuse

324
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,928
that to cover their breath knew that

325
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,389
that's not probable cause about like

326
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:03,129
myself I work in a giant Gro I was

327
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,720
trimming plants that were six feet tall

328
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:06,459
today I had to chop I had to lean in

329
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,800
between two plants and chop plants down

330
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:10,928
and carry six foot tall plants if so my

331
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,789
shirt I probably break I've got trim on

332
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:14,259
me right now if I was coming from work

333
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,639
and I said you smell like marijuana I

334
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:17,470
work in the legal marijuana industry

335
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,749
that's just a side effect of my job it's

336
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:24,040
probably the probable cause to search my

337
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:25,928
vehicle though nah I'm sorry I would say

338
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,490
be strong on distinguishing the

339
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:30,578
different smells between smoked

340
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,079
marijuana and fresh marijuana yeah this

341
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,729
doesn't this is this smell that you're

342
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,008
smelling is work-related this is not

343
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,249
smoked marijuana is the smell of a plant

344
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:41,019
right at this point you're like they're

345
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:42,459
arguing about smells because you're not

346
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,899
slurring your speech because your eyes

347
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:48,338
aren't red because they didn't catch you

348
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:49,600
weaving so I is probably one of the

349
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:50,980
things we should put on the list to

350
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,999
avoid getting your ass in truth you're

351
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,459
sober right now

352
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:56,949
you can argue it this is a smell that I

353
00:14:54,458 --> 00:15:00,039
picked up at work working while sober

354
00:14:56,948 --> 00:15:01,808
I'm on my way home sober like that's

355
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:03,519
what you're smelling if you insist on

356
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:05,350
searching the car like unless they're

357
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,778
finding roaches in the ashtray or add a

358
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,428
break in a cup holder put your [ __ ] away

359
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:11,528
you guys yep you're headed on the road

360
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:13,688
yeah have it out of reach have your

361
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:15,850
Stephanie if you've got a locked

362
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:17,048
container that would be ideal that's

363
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,308
what they'd prefer to keep in the trunk

364
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:20,678
I think we were talking about that

365
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:23,078
earlier right it works just like booze

366
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:25,990
if you've got a 12-pack in the backseat

367
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:27,818
of the trunk you're fine if that 12-pack

368
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:31,178
is open and the 12th one was in your cup

369
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:32,588
holder no more sloppy little blonde he

370
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:34,298
never passed it to anybody what's going

371
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:35,740

372
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:39,929

373
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,930

374
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:58,569

375
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,970

378
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,240

379
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,839

380
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,659

381
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,680

382
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:19,089

do okay

384
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,170
so two different answers when I was

385
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,429
younger

386
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:26,199
cuz I have two totally different

387
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:27,819
perspectives on this that's why I got

388
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,440
you here from being an adolescent to

389
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:42,310
being in a dirt you know what I'm saying

390
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:45,810
like from going from you I told ya I

391
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,809
could die happy right now

392
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:51,639
[Music]

393
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,590
okay so when I was younger I was one of

394
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,199
those oh [ __ ] the police man they can't

395
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,389
do [ __ ] to me and I would you know

396
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,160
approach to the situation they'd pull me

397
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:01,419
over and I'd be like why'd you pull me

398
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,789
over this then I'd be really

399
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:05,710
confrontational towards it and then I'd

400
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,569
go to jail and that's what would happen

401
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,400
because I was being confrontational in a

402
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,889
scenario where I didn't need to nowadays

403
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,530
you comply you [ __ ] comply to

404
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,680
everything there are asking you within

405
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:20,440
reason like oh why why are you speeding

406
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,330
this keep like what buzz he said keep

407
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,340
your hands where they can see them my

408
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:27,490
goal is to make the police officer feel

409
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,809
comfortable like as soon as they walk up

410
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,400
to the window that should be your best

411
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,929

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,509
[Music]

417
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:46,599

418
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:50,500

419
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:52,269

426
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:15,489
car with his cowboy hat like he had his

427
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:17,048
badge was on the Hat so what happened

428
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,130
was I drove back to North Carolina I

429
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:19,388
brought a little bit of personal because

430
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,010
I didn't want to deal with no like

431
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:22,719
[ __ ] ratchet [ __ ] to get weed back

433
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,558
got pulled over in Kansas worst place to

434
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,940
get pulled over ever so he got out with

435
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,769
the badge on his hat and I was like oh

436
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,590
he's gonna shoot me and my dogs

437
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:34,659
I had two little puppies but so I'm

438
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:38,528
nervous I'm like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] Colorado

439
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:39,519
plates and I remember right until he was

440
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:42,130
in my peripherals

441
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,980
I was nervous like scared and as soon as

442
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:47,710
he was that I sung to him he was I could

443
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,230
have sung him a hole disc I was so nice

444
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,380
to him and he asked me why I was

445
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,750
speeding I was the officer I've been

446
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,600
driving for like eight hours I saw that

447
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,130
there's a rest area up there I was

448
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:03,278
honestly just trying to make it there so

449
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,080
I can go to sleep runs my stuff now I

450
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:07,089
don't know how the police things work

451
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,949
but I'm pretty sure that when they run

452
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:10,959
my name in any state they can see my

453
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,759
criminal background I'm pretty sure it

454
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,759
goes from state to state so he saw how

455
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:18,730
perfect but the bigger stuff yes yeah

456
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,440
I'm sure he saw I had a record and he

457
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,149
treated me totally respectfully he

458
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,340
looked me he said I pulled you over

459
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:25,629
Tuesday were speeding and I wanted to to

460
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:27,788
really come talk to you because your

461
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,769
Colorado plates I wanted to see if you

462
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:31,720
have anything to hide from me but

463
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,700
obviously you don't have a good day and

464
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,649
then he left me didn't even give me the

465
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,200
speeding ticket and it's all because I

466
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:40,658
was I made him feel comfortable and I

467
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,100
was polite because fifteen over they

468
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:43,750
could take your license on the spot if

469
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:45,849
they really want to be a dick and we

470
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,308
were in Kansas and I had two pitbulls in

471
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:51,509
the car and after he left I threw up

472
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:51,509
because I was like oh my god

473
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,240
Juke yeah I really thought I was going

474
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:58,939
back to jail and I was like I hate life

475
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,200
they're gonna take my dogs but I could

476
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,389
have handled it like when I was younger

477
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,460
and been an [ __ ] and got my dog shot

478
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:07,069
and got [ __ ] tasered she killed

479
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,590
myself or thrown back in jail but I was

480
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:11,950
play that's what I hate I hate seeing

481
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:14,808
all these videos where they're like oh

482
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,899
that's that's police abuse that's police

483
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:20,450
abuse but the dude isn't doing what the

484
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:22,908
police is asking him like lay down on

485

487
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:31,250
don't see the point like they're

488
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:34,309
pointing like I saw a video that's all

489
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:38,210
video the police had a gun pointed at a

490
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:39,769
guy he had a knife and he lunged at him

491
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,950
and they shot him and people are like

492
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:44,509
unnecessary force you're a [ __ ]

493
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,308
hypocrite because if you have a legal

00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,658
gun on you and I come and try to stab

495
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:50,119
you right now you're gonna shoot me you

496
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:52,549
[ __ ] so don't [ __ ] don't vitae it

497
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:54,138
on the police and and and when I say

498
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:57,528
[ __ ] I don't mean gay people's it'll

499
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:59,028
be all upside for sure don't be a little

500
00:20:57,528 --> 00:21:03,130
[ __ ] [ __ ] about it don't be a little

501
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:03,130
[ __ ] like because if I try to stab

502
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:09,350
that because people are so hypocritical

503
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,840
because if they put themselves in the

504
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:13,308
same position they would act totally

505
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,168
different than what they're speaking and

506
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:17,119
I hate that because if you try to stab

507
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:19,190
me I'm shooting you if I have a legal

508
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,148
right yeah like stand in front of that

509
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:24,490
guy over the knife and I'll give you

510
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:24,489
half a second deciding you're shooting

511

[Music]

512
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:33,739
why didn't you shoot him 17 times there

513
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:38,359
was only 16 bullets Lebowski records for

514
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:41,778
all the people the real trick here

515
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:43,339
though is to just be calm and go through

516
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:46,069
the script that they're expecting and

517
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:47,839
that's really easy to do if you're not

518
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:50,750
doing something you're not supposed to

519
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:53,269
be doing like but a lot of people are

520
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,009
doing something we shouldn't be doing I

521
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:56,599
remember how he used to be in Colorado I

522
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:58,369
used to have to drive and go pick up

523
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:00,199
weed and drive at home all the time and

524
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:02,418
that was the time that I was most at

525
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,120
risk is when I just went and picked up a

526
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:06,300
new quarter

527
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,369
to drive at home and I made it real easy

528
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,869
on myself I threw it in a backpack when

529
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,239
I bought it I threw that backpack in the

530
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:13,859
trunk when I got to the car if I got

531
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,380
pulled over on the way home it wasn't

532
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:17,939
for speeding cuz I did my damnedest not

533
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,190
to break a single traffic law with weed

534
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,960
in the car I got pulled over plenty of

535
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,820
times with weed in the car and when they

536
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,470
walk up to your car to go good evening

537

544
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,839
looking looking them in the eyes is key

545
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,940
yeah because you're something you're

00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,829
like aftershave yeah be respectful like

547

like if you can be calm and confident

548
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:54,960
they don't wonder why you're nervous and

549
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,399
try to figure out why you're you're

freaking out and want to date through

551
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,179
your car the hardest part for me is when

552
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,009
they make you sign the ticket like

553
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,179
normally I sign my to my name like

00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:21,569
you'll get a little motion but then you

555
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:26,040
get all nervous and your buddies

earlier today that I had to

612
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:14,140
realize as an adult is a not every

613
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,120
officer is a [ __ ] scumbag yeah I'm

saying by saying that every officer is

just trying to make your day worse is

616

basically being racist it's like the

617
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:25,269
same as labeling a racist doing so yeah

literally just trying to do what I was

00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:42,789
younger like 24 25 ish my girlfriend at

the time worked managed a bar and we

626
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:46,629
would go smoke in the Holly

627
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:47,950
there was an alleyway that went one way

628
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,390
he could turn left or right to come into

629
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,470
the parking lot of the bar if you go to

630
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,750
the other way you'll go through another

631
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,039
area this cop would roll through and he

632
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,690
knew we were out there just passing all

633
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:57,099
the time in that alley cuz you just walk

634
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,240
right out of the side door of the bar

635
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:00,099
and go sit in this little area between

636
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,109
cars and smoke when he would come

637
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:03,909
through it flashes brights so we know

638
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:05,079
put our [ __ ] away and be prepared to he

639
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,700
wouldn't have to [ __ ] with us you know

640
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:08,079
he would just rather not see you smoking

641
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,110
or maybe he's got somebody else in the

642
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,109

643
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:28,599

you drew out of there in 15 minutes tops

648
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:41,500
we never see we rarely see any good [ __ ]

649
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,269
about the cops on the news on the

650
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,039
internet on TV anywhere like that

651
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:46,869
because you rarely hear anything about

652
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,909
the good [ __ ] when people do good [ __ ]

653
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:53,069
like oh yeah that cop help that old lady

654
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,070
up it's this [ __ ] job you only see a

655
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,150
psychology class I learned about this

656
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,039
that's actually life period if you

657
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,650
notice like people talking about stuff a

658
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:09,009
lot or even the news it's never good

659
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:10,780
stuff because none even though it's

660
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:13,930
unknown you don't realise a good stuff

661
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:16,480
is happening all the time so that bad

662
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,890
stuff is a blip on the radar and that's

663
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,539
what you remember and reference to

664
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,490
because it's usually things are

665
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:22,869
copacetic so when something bad

666
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,130
Vin's it really sticks out and that's

667
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:26,319
what people want to hear they don't want

668
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:28,450
to hear like a hundred kids were saved

669
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,009
today they want to hear you know puppies

670
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,649
getting kicked off of a cliff people are

671
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:46,690
[ __ ] up man like they see bad stuff

672
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:49,269
and it it gives them I personally feel

673
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:52,120
like people want to see bad things so

674
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:54,519
they have a reason to fuel a unnecessary

675
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:57,579
fire to complain about why they're not

676
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:00,009
doing well or to use it to to why things

677
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:02,619
are so [ __ ] up this and that like yeah

678
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:05,859
especially like oh man here in America

679
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:07,658
like we are so privileged as Americans I

680
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:09,699
hate this whole anti-american thing

681
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:11,500
that's happening like people standing on

682
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,940
flags if I see you stand on a flag I'm

683
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,740
running you over at my previous I don't

684
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,808
give a [ __ ] like that's so that's a

685
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:19,269
great you wanna know why this yo this is

686
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:21,700
why this is why because no one is

687
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:23,798
fleeing from America you are not putting

688
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,298
your family on a door and pushing it

689
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,000
into the ocean to get somewhere else

690
00:29:25,298 --> 00:29:29,679
like America is fine there's no there's

691
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,569
no death rage happening when it's

692
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,159
nighttime we're making a podcast we're

693
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,839
not having one of us make sure that

694
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,520
death troopers aren't coming to killing

695
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,439
everybody in our [ __ ] village like

696
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:39,460
you know what I'm saying I hate people

697
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,980
they're like Oh

698
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,870
America is horrible no you're able to be

699
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,970
the person that you want to be because

700
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:47,408
you're in America because being yourself

701
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:51,399
in other countries can get you [ __ ]

702
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:53,039
murdered like jarl weed this is probably

703
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:55,418
but that's about a half ounce

704
00:29:53,038 --> 00:30:18,250
weed right here in most countries would

705
00:29:55,419 --> 00:30:19,659
probably get your head cut off most 75

706
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,630
different kinds of food we could drive

707
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:23,950
our own vehicles we can we're okay

708
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:34,690
everybody in this room has varying

709
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:36,250
religious beliefs tattoo here I've got

710
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,048
dreadlocks you've got your symbols there

711
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,519
I think I have a good idea what you

712
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:41,109
follow and I'm sure you two kind of

713
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,058
linked up in the same similar sort away

714
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:45,278
from conversations we've had but in

715
00:30:43,058 --> 00:31:06,908
other countries one of us would be

716
00:30:45,278 --> 00:31:08,440
beheaded for what we all at one point I

717
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:11,639
literally asked you like how the [ __ ] do

718
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,639
you not get pulled over all the time

719
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:19,388
don't realize I've been told so many

720
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:26,648
times that my voice doesn't match my

721
00:31:19,388 --> 00:31:28,000
appearance when I buy a lot of product

722
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:38,319
there and I also deliver products

723
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:39,638
sometimes to people there shopping and

724
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,629
they're like I recognize that voice they

725
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:42,699
turn around they look at me and they're

726
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,380
not sure if that dreadlock guy is the

727
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,440
guy from the podcast it's really funny

728
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:50,139
so the listeners that have never that

729
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,679
aren't privy I guess I'm six five and

730
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:56,798
I've got dreadlocks seriously too fast

731
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,720
my ass like mid thigh region almost to

732
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,599
my knees one of the really longer ones

733
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,659
goes almost to my kneecaps by now so

734
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:06,819
yeah I feel pressure from the police

735
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:07,960
sometimes the cop yesterday asked me he

736
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:10,148
said how long did it take you to get

737
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:14,528
those dreadlocks that long but like 11

738
00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:16,239
years and he goes Wow commitment buddy I

739
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:18,548
was at the courthouse getting

740
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,888
fingerprinted for when I worked at a

741
00:32:18,548 --> 00:32:22,418
dispensary everybody had to go get

742
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:23,648
fingerprinted and had to go take a day

743
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:26,020
off because it took them all [ __ ] day

744
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:27,908
to fingerprint me but uh cop in there

745
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:28,690
walked by and he goes great dreadlocks

746
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:34,840
bro

747
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:36,580
I was like it was a cop he wasn't even

748
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:39,099
being sarcastic he was like had a smile

749
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:42,129
on his face and [ __ ] so not all cops are

750
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:43,689
jocks some cops are cool but yeah I'm a

751
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:50,170
frickin so sometimes they feel some

752
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:53,830
pressure cuz that's just a big thing

753
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:56,710
going on now I could really just go on

754
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:58,629
about go on man well social media

755
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,490
warriors and stuff people who are like

756
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:02,710
just bitching about the world but not I

757
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,450
think that what we were just talking

758
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,279
about earlier like all like how ex

759
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:25,990
public executions and all that stuff

760
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:28,690
like I think that for one hour I think

761
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:30,819
that everybody should be made to watch

762
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,860
one hour of what's really going on in

763
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:34,809
other countries like a week one hour a

764
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:37,149
week of like show me like what's up in

765
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:40,980
Mexico show me what's up in Egypt like

766
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:43,330
show you was really [ __ ] up because

767
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,640
it's all about the source where are you

768
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:47,619
gonna get that material the [ __ ]

769
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:52,420
Internet has all of it it has people

770
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:56,069
being publicly executed by the good also

771
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:58,720
does it have the good as well as the bad

772
00:33:56,069 --> 00:34:01,480
every was just referencing to the fact

773
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,410
that people [ __ ] about America okay

774
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,660
it's we are really okay here like I got

775
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:11,460
I just went to Cali Cali was awesome

776
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:14,980
first time ever in Cali amazing chef I

777
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,900
think someone like Cali but I got into a

778
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,329
debate with my friend there because

779
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,490
she's like an active feminist and stuff

780
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:23,349
which I support that's awesome but she

781
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:24,579
said that like women don't have a lot of

782
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:27,069
Rights here and they're really

783
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:28,989
restrained so on and so forth which in

784
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,100
some ways I do see like statistically

785
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:32,649
they get paid less and stuff I

786
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:34,539
understand but as far as freedoms of the

787
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:38,019
world women are really free in America

788
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:39,699
and and and I hate to say it but like in

789
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:40,800
other countries women are still getting

790
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:43,710
stoned too

791
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,480
for talking to males in public and we

792
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,878
got women running for president so like

793
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,760
yes things are different but like we are

794
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:53,039
we are Farley advanced in a lot of ways

795
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,110
I don't know if that sounds like weird

796
00:34:53,039 --> 00:35:00,110
to say but like how can people find you

797
00:34:55,110 --> 00:35:03,769
on Twitter angry to me if you want to

798
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:06,960
make sure all of the tweets about the

799
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:09,269
statements are headed sloppy I didn't

800
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,360
say anything about anti said I'm totally

801
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:14,360
for it there were some microaggressions

802
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:32,430
I also think that I think it's [ __ ] up

803
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:35,460
that it's [ __ ] up to be proud of your

804
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:36,960
heritage nowadays like like no but nope

805
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,389
nobody really doesn't nobody's like you

806
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,860
I'm Italian and they're like nobodies

807
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:43,379
with their roots everybody wants to be

808
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,750
guilty of cultural appropriation right

809
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,599
right it's a step away from being racist

810
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,219
it's almost it's a foot into the racist

811
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,618
category which it isn't

812
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:54,989
but then again racism is isn't it just

813
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:57,300
having pride in one's race isn't bigotry

814
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:59,608
the real problem like or something like

815
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,130
that like cause like it's okay I feel

816
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:03,809
like it's it's a thing like it shouldn't

817
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,880
be a thin line like everybody should be

818
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:07,469
proud of who they are like if you're

819
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,970
German be proud you're German if you're

820
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:10,169
black be proud you're black if you're if

821
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:12,779
you're Asian but you know what I'm

822
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,220
saying like but it's when you add hate

823
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,820
to it like oh I don't like these other

824
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:21,199
people because they're yeah but I think

825
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:23,280
that it's misinterpreted a lot like

826
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,809
people just see what they want to see

827
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,460
like straight up you could take any

828
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:29,000
story and make it good or bad and by

829
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:34,590
changing some like minor details

830
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,940
altering [ __ ] I've seen them do it two

831
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,410

832
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,240

833

947
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:30,248
dog somewhere where they can't

948
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:37,188
aggressive towards the police because

949
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:38,568
[ __ ] that sound like crazy or nothing

950
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:40,009
but if they shoot my dogs in front of me

951
00:42:38,568 --> 00:42:46,728
I'm catching some charges cuz I'm

952
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:48,438

954
00:42:48,438 --> 00:42:52,458
pounds of pit bulls so I understand like

955
00:42:50,478 --> 00:42:53,989

956
00:42:52,458 --> 00:43:00,108
that cuz people like oh my god I'm like

957

putting my dogs up and then I I'm going

959
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:07,969
to answer the door as soon as I see that

960
00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:10,548
it's the authorities I am stepping out

961
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:12,588
and closing the door like when you said

962
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:14,239

964
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,749
have reason

965
00:43:17,298 --> 00:43:21,659
while one of them talks to the other one

966
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:24,119

where you can really learn your rights

1045
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:37,389
and some people really enjoy pulling the

1046
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:38,710
mi detained with their YouTube channels

1047
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:42,639
that are solely dedicated to people

1048
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:44,260
harassing police officers with assault

1049
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:45,639
rifles just to get a rise out of the

1050
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:50,010
police thanks sir what are you doing I

1051
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:50,009
can be here because of HB 41

1052
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:54,940
my nunchucks and samurai sword and

1053
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,579
butt-ass naked are fairly legal right

1054
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:01,050
there depending on where you live in the

1055
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:04,420
US like along our southern states

1056
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:06,400
anything bordering Mexico they've got

1057
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,889
random highway checkpoints where they

1058
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,579
look for immigration documents and all

1059
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:13,809
kinds of [ __ ] and a lot of that's

1060
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:16,869
unconstitutional and it really pisses

1061
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:19,420
people off and so people who know

1062
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:23,858
exactly how to flex their rights in a

1063
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:26,470
very specific living [ __ ] beaten out of

1064
00:47:23,858 --> 00:47:28,989
them and thrown in jail and go flex the

1065
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,209
rights if [ __ ] massive checkpoints

1066
00:47:28,989 --> 00:47:35,019
and stuff it it's nuts

1067
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:37,720
but exactly how to do that makes getting

1068
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:40,719
pulled over really easy to handle like

1069
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:44,980

00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:48,139
front like if you started off that way

1160
00:52:45,048 --> 00:52:50,028
nine times out of ten just being played

1161

sorry guys have a good night usually

1166
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,240
that gets you through it five or seven

1167
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,400
minutes

1168
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:04,899
worst case scenario they go get out of

1169
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,190
the car they search your car they find

1170
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:10,059
the weed they write your check for the

1171
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:11,769
weed you get home alright that sounds

1172
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:15,010
reasonable sloppy standing up taking a

1173
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:16,539
DAB no I like it so you don't bump the

1174
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:18,040
rig on the mics you don't dab the

1175
00:53:16,539 --> 00:53:19,869
microphone like you did last time you

1176
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:22,568
were here like even if you're about to

1177
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:25,568
get in a bunch of trouble playing it

1178
00:53:22,568 --> 00:53:28,539
cool with the original interaction with

1179
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:31,239
the officer assumed asurs you don't get

1180
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:32,949
really injured during that and don't get

1181
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:34,149
injured something I didn't mention

1182
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:36,669
earlier that I should have totally

1183
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:39,010
mentioned the cop that pulled my friend

1184
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:41,710
over and gave him a DUI asked him how

1185
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:43,150
long it had been since he smoked last my

1186
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,920
friend tried to play mr. honesty and

1187
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:46,510
told them a little too early I think I

1188
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,470
think that played a part of the the

1189
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:51,160
arrest

1190
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:52,629
say yesterday like if that cops like how

1191
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:54,429
long ago you're you're driving to get

1192
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,858
pulled over cops like you well when is

1193
00:53:54,429 --> 00:53:58,480
the last time you smoked cannabis

1194
00:53:55,858 --> 00:54:13,000
yesterday yeah not today

1195
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:15,789
before I went to bed like if you're

1196
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,739
driving you're required to hand over

1197
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:19,960
like license registration proof of

1198
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:22,029
insurance but you're not legally

1199
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,559
required to self-incriminate you're not

1200
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:27,010
legally required to answer any other

1201
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:28,750
questions dry snitching give them the

1202
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:30,309
minimum amount of the information that

1203
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:33,969
you need to give them you know let me go

1204
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:36,099
on with your you're legally obligated to

1205
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:39,219
comply you can get arrested for just

1206
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:40,660
resisting like if the cop walks up and

1207
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:42,939
you run away like the cop didn't even

1208
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:44,649
say anything you just walk onto your

1209
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,059
block or whatever it immediately turned

1210
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:48,460
and ran and she chose to chase you and

1211
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:50,140
rest you you can get arrested for just

1212
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:53,170
resisting arrest got arrested for that

1213
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:56,469
all charges got dropped it immediately

1214
00:54:53,170 --> 00:55:00,818
but I went to court a relation of mine

1215
00:54:56,469 --> 00:55:02,828
got arrested just for that he they were

1216
00:55:00,818 --> 00:55:03,980
climbing through the window of a party

1217
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:06,619
while he was in high school

1218
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:08,358
he put his arms out just to the sides

1219
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:10,760
and went get out of my house piggy and

1220
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:13,340
he got tackled and handcuffed and he

1221
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:17,359
thought it was hilarious but he knew he

1222
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:19,010
he'd survived it because after he was

1223
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,569
tackled at handcuffed like he could do

1224
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:22,690
and say what he wanted he was gonna get

1225
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:27,500
bailed out in less than 24 hours anyway

1226
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:29,150
like yeah I I was young on probation

1227
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,789
walking with another friend that was on

1228
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:33,349
probation and we had heard that if

1229
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:35,029
you're on probation you're not supposed

1230
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:37,279
to be with other people on probation so

1231
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:40,609
these cops came up on us and I darted

1232
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,550
and then I had a load of sack on me but

1233
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:45,710
I threw it and then I got arrested and

1234
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:47,240
as soon as I like I went to jail got

1235
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,920
bailed out and then as soon as I went to

1236
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:51,079
court he was like where are the other

1237
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,400
charges and I was like what do you mean

1238
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:54,108
he was like well what else did you get

1239
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,400
charge from us oh I just ran because I

1240
00:55:54,108 --> 00:55:57,349
thought I wasn't supposed to be hanging

1241
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,869
out with this person automatically drops

1242
00:55:57,349 --> 00:56:03,170
let it go bottom are right here nice um

1243
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:04,970
so I mean that's a that's the easier if

1244
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:06,590
you just come you know even if you're

1245
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:08,569
about to get in trouble it's so much

1246
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:11,570
easier to do with the court without the

1247
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:14,570
why did you run away like why did you

1248
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:16,789
live on a car chase yeah why did you

1249

1251
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:27,880

myself I feel like for the most part I

1264
00:57:01,909 --> 00:57:05,838
got pretty good judgement of what a cop

1265
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,099
looks like and when huh but if I I'm not

1266
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:09,380

1273
00:57:21,949 --> 00:57:36,169

1278
00:57:42,469 --> 00:57:50,000

[Music]

1287
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:27,440
robbing people like bless you that's

1288
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:28,579
another thing would you do you think

1289
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,099
that you have to roll your window down

1290
00:58:28,579 --> 00:58:32,869
all the way or can you just do it than

1291
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:34,609
this necessary amount to talk and

1292
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:36,318
exchange like is that being a douche are

1293
00:58:34,608 --> 00:58:38,358
you pushing the limit by not giving them

1294
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:38,960
the full window like what are you trying

1295
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:40,519
to prove

1296
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,199
yeah I just roll it down to talk to him

1297
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:47,300
yeah I mean yeah because if somebody's

1298
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:50,618

I lick your ballsack today right like

1300
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:55,789
that's why you play it cool from the

1301
00:58:52,969 --> 00:58:58,730
get-go so that the cop doesn't decide to

1302
00:58:55,789 --> 00:59:00,710
play it the hardest way possible

1303
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:02,329
as they could just decide to arrest you

1304
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:04,429
and come through that window no problem

1305
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:05,509
like yeah just roll that [ __ ] down

1306
00:59:04,429 --> 00:59:07,009

1307
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:09,200
backseat or in the trunk

1308
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:11,090
throw it in an extra bag or a backpack

1309
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:13,039
so that your car doesn't stick where in

planned for Denver over the 4/20 weekend

1519
01:11:27,369 --> 01:11:32,090
Denver said no they did not issue the

1520
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:34,670
permits that were needed high times

1521
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:38,690
response was to move the cannabis cup to

1522
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:40,760
Pueblo Colorado yeah that's where we are

1523

yeah yeah Denver's too expensive Springs

1556
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:47,460
is a kind of a military vibe I think is

1557
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:49,500
a high-crime - okay yeah I've been

1558

unique smell I don't even know how to

1583
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:45,659
describe that ah it almost reminded me

1584
01:13:43,829 --> 01:13:47,039
of a specific turpenoid I can't remember

1585
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:53,189

1586
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:54,659
anymore thank you for the heads up there

1587
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:56,609

1588
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:58,409
it's always the one that I forget the

1589
01:13:56,609 --> 01:14:01,049
herb smells like it's got a lot of

1590
01:13:58,409 --> 01:14:02,250
little oil in it anyway we're jokin over

1591
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:04,560

1593
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,820
shadow to the turf ex crew all right

1594
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:11,760
we're gonna do a podcast about selecting

1595
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:13,799
a male plant for breeding if you're

1596
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,539
trying to breed some seeds there are a

1597
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,090
few things to look for in a male plant

1598
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:20,489
so let's say you buy yourself a 10 pack

1599
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:21,840
I would do it to ten packs if you're

1600
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:23,189
trying to do a Fino hunt to find a male

1601
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,989
but not everybody's got the room

1602
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:25,379
try to do at least two 10 packs there's

1603
01:14:24,989 --> 01:14:27,840
power

1604
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:29,909
numbers the more plants the better I

1605
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,279
agree 20 to 50 is a good number right

1606
01:14:29,908 --> 01:14:34,979
you can usually find super plants in 20

1607
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:36,840
to 50 just astounding keepers a standout

1608
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:39,329
yeah and if you can't do that many at a

1609
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:41,610
time just do them in phases do 10 find a

1610
01:14:39,329 --> 01:14:44,550
keeper out of that 10 do 10 more find

1611
01:14:41,609 --> 01:14:45,960
the best out of those 2 out of those 10

1612
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:47,670
and then you got to stack up against

1613
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,350
each other keep doing it until your room

1614
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:52,350
is fooled in a certain eliminating [ __ ]

1615
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:54,480
that's right I even sometimes a right

1616
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:55,679
out of the gate you can kind of tell you

1617
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:56,428
know you have those seeds that just look

1618
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,170
like they're gonna have a hard time

1619
01:14:56,429 --> 01:14:59,158
they're gonna struggle and you can tell

1620
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:00,710
whenever they open the show they have

1621
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:03,029
the little tiny leaves or sometimes are

1622
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:04,469
mutated or doesn't look as strong or

1623
01:15:03,029 --> 01:15:07,859
vibrant as the others I just go ahead

1624
01:15:04,469 --> 01:15:09,960
and Chuck as a breeder as somebody who

1625
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:11,429
is I've read a lot of plants and if you

1626
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,139
were looking for a male plant you're

1627
01:15:11,429 --> 01:15:14,730
going to have to learn to get rid of

1628
01:15:13,139 --> 01:15:16,889
some plants and not be too attached to

1629
01:15:14,729 --> 01:15:18,209
your babies be ruthless yes be ruthless

1630
01:15:16,889 --> 01:15:19,800
these are not humans these are little

1631
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:22,079
baby plants and you are creating the

1632
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,880
future of cannabis if you do not pull

1633
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:26,639
those ugly little [ __ ] you are going

1634
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:31,319
to ruin and [ __ ] up and you're gonna

1635
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:32,460
[ __ ] the progression of cannabis yes

1636
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:33,779
you are and we don't want to do that

1637
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:36,060
we're breeding to improve the genetics

1638
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:37,800
so if you have a plant you start a bunch

1639
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,969
of seeds you got a couple that are kind

1640
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,590
of wonky looking you got one with the

1641
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:43,170
[ __ ] up leave don't be afraid to get

1642
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:46,260
rid of it as they grow keep a good eye

1643
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:48,029
on them um so before we get to that part

1644
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,550
let's talk about what the male plant is

1645
01:15:48,029 --> 01:15:52,559
going to bring to our breeding project

1646
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:54,420
when we hit a male plant with pollen - a

1647
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,960
female plant that accepts pollen that

1648
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:59,880
has pistols it's going to create seeds

1649
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:03,239
that are going to have traits of both

1650
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:05,699
plants what is the male mostly going to

1651
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:08,099
bring to the table here I feel like it's

1652
01:16:05,698 --> 01:16:10,710
going to bring a lot of the pest

1653
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:13,710
resistance and a lot of the vigor and a

1654
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:15,119
lot of the shape that's it that's a lot

1655
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:17,279
of what it is the hybrid vigor and

1656
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:19,800
without that male side of the family you

1657
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:22,109
really can't catch that true hard figure

1658
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,570
like that um I always tell people all

1659
01:16:22,109 --> 01:16:26,369
the time you know you can't create you

1660
01:16:24,569 --> 01:16:31,679
know Halle Berry's by eliminating half

1661
01:16:26,369 --> 01:16:33,630
gameful I like believe but that people

1662
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:35,429
catch on there all right so yeah we need

1663
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:36,159
the male to bring that good structure

1664
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:38,140
and

1665
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:40,329
resistance I think a lot of the flavor

1666
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:41,560
comes from Mama comes from the girl so

1667
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:43,449
when you're looking for structure and

1668
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,670
shape a lot of it is gonna come from the

1669
01:16:43,449 --> 01:16:49,269
boy so now we could talk a little bit

1670
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:52,239
about what to look for in a male plant I

1671
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:54,550
keep saying the structure I like a male

1672
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:55,750
plant if you're breeding a sativa you're

1673
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:57,640
gonna want one that gets a little bit

1674
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:59,739
taller the males are always gonna win

1675
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,000
you're when you're in veg the males are

1676
01:16:59,739 --> 01:17:03,429
always gonna start taking off a little

1677
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,810
taller their goal is to get above the

1678
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:07,329
females so that when they pollinate

1679
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:08,800
their pollen falls down onto the girl so

1680
01:17:07,329 --> 01:17:10,930
that's a good hint well they're growing

1681
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,720
in veg look for that one that's taken

1682
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:14,800
off that might be a boy for you so

1683
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:17,860
you're looking for if you've got a

1684
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,570
sativa you want the one that keeps not

1685
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:20,739
too tall and doesn't take off too much

1686
01:17:19,569 --> 01:17:23,500
because you don't want to make your

1687
01:17:20,739 --> 01:17:24,729
progeny skyrocket immediately but you

1688
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,649
want to find the one that's the right

1689
01:17:24,729 --> 01:17:28,989
shape of you almost want to find what

1690
01:17:26,649 --> 01:17:30,939
you want your girls to look like you

1691
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:32,439
want the boy to look the shape to be

1692
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:34,329
what you want your females to look like

1693
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:36,849
is what I think I'm trying to say so

1694
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:38,229
fine look for that you want tight close

1695
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:39,940
node spacing you don't want a whole

1696
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:41,859
bunch of gaps in between your branches I

1697
01:17:39,939 --> 01:17:44,529
don't like it when a plant spits out

1698
01:17:41,859 --> 01:17:45,849
really long branches like Tahoe say the

1699
01:17:44,529 --> 01:17:47,949
oh geez that was about to come right out

1700
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:49,510
of my mouth the og family the whole

1701
01:17:47,949 --> 01:17:51,010
family over there on that side even

1702
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:52,420
grapes top row G and some of the other

1703
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:54,070
ones that are hybrids most of them take

1704
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:55,569
off because the boys like you're saying

1705
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:57,670
the structure it comes from the male is

1706
01:17:55,569 --> 01:17:59,380
a perfect example Joseph the Joseph male

1707
01:17:57,670 --> 01:18:03,420
that gage uses everything they crossed

1708
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:05,069
that great male by the way but

1709
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:06,569
it comes out tall a lot of the times you

1710
01:18:05,069 --> 01:18:07,949
get mostly dominant phenotypes of

1711
01:18:06,569 --> 01:18:11,399
stretchy plants because the stretchy

1712
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:12,960
stretchy with little popcorn balls it's

1713
01:18:11,399 --> 01:18:13,979
a dominant OG male and that's that's

1714
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,810
what's going on there it's that

1715
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:18,209
structures taken over the dominance from

1716
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:20,730
that male plant in this do G dominance

1717
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:22,920
and that oh jeez always the cushions

1718
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:24,509
have always had had that dominance and

1719
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,949
it really there's an Afghan heritage

1720
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:27,750
it's just trace back it's recessive

1721
01:18:25,949 --> 01:18:28,920
Afghan genes that are really strong and

1722
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,359
they're always gonna come forward and

1723
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,010
breed true unless you find a dominant

1724
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:33,869
gene from a different side of the family

1725
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:36,659
that breeds just as hard like something

1726
01:18:33,869 --> 01:18:38,369
from blue dream for example good example

1727
01:18:36,659 --> 01:18:39,960
of a good breeding parent or white widow

1728
01:18:38,369 --> 01:18:41,250
used to be a really good breeding parent

1729
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,899
I've spread to white widow with two

1730
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:45,329
other strains and it does very well

1731
01:18:42,899 --> 01:18:47,429
that's exactly and that's what you're

1732
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:50,340
doing at the time you take another s'ti

1733
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:52,650
of genotypes from different parts of the

1734
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:55,319
world Brazil South America things like

1735
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:57,049
that and then diversifying them against

1736
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:59,849
things like OG coaches which are

1737
01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:01,199
originally derivative Afghan places like

1738
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:02,789
that they're mostly purged into

1739
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,329
California East Coast places with

1740
01:19:02,789 --> 01:19:07,319
coastlines

1741
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:10,229
and then out out a lot of the stuff that

1742
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:11,639
started off in the Dutch genetics has

1743
01:19:10,229 --> 01:19:17,159
those real thin leaves because it was

1744
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:19,950
all bred for indoor cultivation and

1745
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:22,619
things like that and genetics Moroccan

1746
01:19:19,949 --> 01:19:25,380
genetics you see a lot of Spain a lot of

1747
01:19:22,619 --> 01:19:27,539
Spanish genetics that's where you see

1748
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:28,529
the influx of that in Netherlands so I

1749
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:29,850
want to give a shot at the gauge between

1750
01:19:28,529 --> 01:19:32,009
genetics since we were talking about the

1751
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:33,810
grape stopper OG there those guys

1752
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:35,940
finally took home a cannabis cup for the

1753
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:39,270
grape stopper good work guys nothing but

1754
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:41,909
love and respect free gauge grits m4k

1755
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:43,140
mk4 and key play the whole true they

1756
01:19:41,909 --> 01:19:45,300
kind of help me get a little start in

1757
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:47,970
the cannabis industry so much much love

1758
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:49,440
much respect shutout for that so look

1759
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:50,579
for something that doesn't get too tall

1760
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:51,899
too crazy if you're looking for an

1761
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:54,420
indica if you're trying to breathe it

1762
01:19:51,899 --> 01:19:56,369
into Camille find the shortest stoutest

1763
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:58,590
[ __ ] dias one you can find probably

1764
01:19:56,369 --> 01:20:01,079
with those big fattest leaves you can

1765
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:03,000
find the who that why there's dinner

1766
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:04,409
plate leaves if you can camp out under

1767
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,210
those leaves if you can almost make a

1768
01:20:04,409 --> 01:20:07,619
hammock under those leaves that'd be a

1769
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:09,930
sweet male to breed with if you're

1770
01:20:07,619 --> 01:20:11,699
looking for a nice indica plant so you

1771
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:14,670
want something with nice nice tight

1772
01:20:11,699 --> 01:20:16,199
closed note spacing so if you can find a

1773
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:16,550
male plant you got a flower about you

1774
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:19,250
guys

1775
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:21,079
Ejim I'll start looking for note there

1776
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:22,639
structure in veg watch what they do you

1777
01:20:21,078 --> 01:20:24,769
don't have to get them too tall take a

1778
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:27,949
clone off of them label the clone that

1779
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:30,520
matches the so clone a to plant a clone

1780
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:32,839
be to plant be flower your plants out

1781
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,010
see what they do if you've got females

1782
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,360
and you're looking for males you can

1783
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:36,860
just go ahead and toss the females or

1784
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:38,868
you can finish them out have some buds

1785
01:20:36,859 --> 01:20:40,549
I will take my male plants and flower

1786
01:20:38,868 --> 01:20:43,039
them all the way out to see what they do

1787
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:44,809
all the way to like 7 8 maybe 9 weeks

1788
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:46,488
into flower I want to see if they're

1789
01:20:44,809 --> 01:20:48,230
gonna produce trichomes I want to see if

1790
01:20:46,488 --> 01:20:49,759
they're gonna produce a whole bunch of

1791
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:51,229
pollen I want to see if they're just

1792
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,840
barren some plants will only produce a

1793
01:20:51,229 --> 01:20:56,209
little bit of pollen as a breeder you

1794
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,920
can see which pollen will be so there's

1795
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:59,389
kind of grainy pollen I don't feel like

1796
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,309
that pollens worth a [ __ ]

1797
01:20:59,389 --> 01:21:02,840
it's the pre pollen it's the pollen

1798
01:21:01,309 --> 01:21:05,360
before your plants actually start

1799
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:06,860
busting out that real grainy dusty [ __ ]

1800
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:08,118
I don't think that is good you want to

1801
01:21:06,859 --> 01:21:10,460
let that if you're gonna collect pollen

1802
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:13,488
let that fall let that get away and then

1803
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:15,739
collect that like it's about 14 days

1804
01:21:13,488 --> 01:21:17,718
into the pollen e pollination that's

1805
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:19,578
about 10 to 14 days into when they bust

1806
01:21:17,719 --> 01:21:21,260
open that's when the really good pollen

1807
01:21:19,578 --> 01:21:22,670
starts coming out it's a little softer a

1808
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:24,650
little smoother to the touch

1809
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:32,868
plants fully mature in the flower at

1810
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:34,549
that point hormones going over so if

1811
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:36,439
you're playing is producing trichomes

1812
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:37,880
and a whole bunch of resin and has the

1813
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:40,819
perfect structure you want to breed with

1814
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:42,559
that I like to rub the stem and smell

1815
01:21:40,819 --> 01:21:47,469
the stem of my plants my favorite thing

1816
01:21:42,559 --> 01:21:47,469
if it smells like puke it's a good thing

1817
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:56,389
trash can and vomit that's a good to me

1818
01:21:54,979 --> 01:21:58,009
that's a lot of that when you smell that

1819
01:21:56,389 --> 01:21:59,300
stem and if he if the male you know

1820
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:01,820
across the board and say you have a

1821
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:03,050
bunch in a row from your phyno hunt that

1822
01:22:01,819 --> 01:22:04,819
you're doing put them all next to each

1823
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:06,139
other sit down smell each one of them

1824
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:08,058
side by side make sure you're cleaning

1825
01:22:06,139 --> 01:22:09,739
your hands each time via really good

1826
01:22:08,059 --> 01:22:11,510
profile what each one is doing usually

1827
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:13,669
the ones it stinks the worst is the best

1828
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:15,770
one yeah typically and then you judge

1829
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:17,539
narrow it down by smell and then narrow

1830
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:19,040
down by structure sight use all your

1831
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:20,929
senses don't don't eliminate anything

1832
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:22,819
you know feel free to take a leaf and

1833
01:22:20,929 --> 01:22:24,859
snap one off and taste the stem a little

1834
01:22:22,819 --> 01:22:26,238
bit if it's sour and tart tea is stuff a

1835
01:22:24,859 --> 01:22:27,828
lot of the times and you're using hardly

1836
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:29,929
no nutrients at all it's a good thing

1837
01:22:27,828 --> 01:22:32,689
it's telling you I got a lot of terpenes

1838
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:34,190
I got a lot to add to the table they're

1839
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:36,319
definitely the bail is definitely going

1840
01:22:34,189 --> 01:22:38,750
to contribute to the flavor I think the

1841
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:40,549
mama definitely over overwhelms the

1842
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:44,750
flavor category but the male is going to

1843
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:46,190
contribute to the amount of flavor just

1844
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:55,250
use any old male you want to use the

1845
01:22:46,189 --> 01:22:56,989
best one you can yeah so if you bested

1846
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:58,880
ten pack of seeds you probably find you

1847
01:22:56,989 --> 01:23:00,769
know maybe five males hopefully you know

1848
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,329
five females five males oh you're gonna

1849
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:03,410
toss two of those right away one of

1850
01:23:02,329 --> 01:23:05,090
them's gonna be funky

1851
01:23:03,409 --> 01:23:09,079
one of them's gonna be run so let's go

1852
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:12,020
away now you got three I think that I

1853
01:23:09,079 --> 01:23:14,180
never used I personally know that I

1854
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:16,280
never used that first plant to show me

1855
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:18,079
male flowers I don't like to take that

1856
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:19,880
first one he's too dominant I feel like

1857
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:21,710
he's going to do too much to my breeding

1858
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:24,109
he's gonna all the plants are gonna look

1859
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:26,630
like that one if I've got three of them

1860
01:23:24,109 --> 01:23:29,089
I kinda would lean toward the third one

1861
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:30,890
to flower if I've got five if I had five

1862
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:32,210
males it worked well probably that third

1863
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:34,010
or fourth one would be the one that I

1864
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:35,840
would use I wouldn't go right for that

1865
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:38,060
first one that busted out it's too

1866
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,650
obvious me I always choose it honestly I

1867
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:42,350
when I'm doing my breeding I always

1868
01:23:39,649 --> 01:23:43,909
choose it honest like like based on what

1869
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:45,950
the mothers doing what I'm trying to do

1870
01:23:43,909 --> 01:23:47,899
if I'm trying to say like if I'm out

1871
01:23:45,949 --> 01:23:49,460
crossing like a blue dream or a sativa

1872
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:50,869
or something close to it has a longer

1873
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:52,189
flowering time and I want to come in

1874
01:23:50,869 --> 01:23:53,750
with an indica and actually shorten its

1875
01:23:52,189 --> 01:23:56,960
flowering time then then that's when I

1876
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:58,310
would choose a male that it's bust out

1877
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:02,869
first because I want to take that flower

1878
01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:05,870
and Tommy that's perfect thing good but

1879
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:07,130
but if you say you have a little indica

1880
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:09,349
dominant but you want to make it a true

1881
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:11,539
hybrid and you want to make it go a

1882
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:13,070
little bit longer in the garden say more

1883
01:24:11,539 --> 01:24:14,750
if it's a seven eight week and you want

1884
01:24:13,069 --> 01:24:16,159
it to go more like eight nine maybe

1885
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,930
tennis or something like that then

1886
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:22,819
that's you know another reason you'd go

1887
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:24,320
with a long and don't be afraid to have

1888
01:24:22,819 --> 01:24:26,479
plants that flower for a long time you

1889
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:28,309
guys I know nine ten and eleven weeks

1890
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:30,409
sounds like scary flowering times but I

1891
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:32,510
flowered plants for 14 and 15 weeks and

1892
01:24:30,409 --> 01:24:33,670
what happens is amazing once they get

1893
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:36,219
that right that's far

1894
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:38,350
Sour Diesel is a good example of that

1895
01:24:36,219 --> 01:24:39,760
going that long 10 11 weeks on it but

1896
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:40,960
it's well worth it in the end I mean

1897
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,579
you're getting a connoisseur product

1898
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,800
that you can't gain anywhere else and

1899
01:24:42,579 --> 01:24:46,300
the testers also you the wrists for and

1900
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,980
the harvest weights come through it

1901
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:49,480
makes it well worth it but I had an

1902
01:24:47,979 --> 01:24:51,428
African land race that didn't have a

1903
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:53,379
name and it grew colas

1904
01:24:51,429 --> 01:24:55,300
I couldn't down at week 14 and the coals

1905
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:56,500
were bigger than my legs I think I think

1906
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,100
it's the biggest complication with all

1907
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:00,369
growers uh

1908
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:01,780
young to old is patience yeah I think

1909
01:25:00,369 --> 01:25:03,849
it's the hardest thing we all have to

1910
01:25:01,779 --> 01:25:06,099
overcome just in life that's it in

1911
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:07,810
general that's it alright I got to take

1912
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:10,770
a drink I'm about to choke and then

1913
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:10,770
we're gonna keep this moving

1914
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:20,219
all right I'll let it that part out I

1915
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:22,019
was gonna beat Boxster oh man you should

1916
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:23,219
have thought have been French I might

1917
01:25:22,019 --> 01:25:24,689
not even edit it now since you're

1918
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:28,948
beatbox and I might just leave that part

1919
01:25:24,689 --> 01:25:29,849
right there alright what else you want

1920
01:25:28,948 --> 01:25:31,259
to add to that but you don't anything

1921
01:25:29,849 --> 01:25:32,639
you want to add to - talking about

1922
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:34,349
selecting a bale that we pretty much

1923
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,479
covered I mean use all your senses you

1924
01:25:34,349 --> 01:25:38,279
know and breathe for a purpose that

1925
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:40,499
that's is the biggest thing breed for

1926
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:42,029
purpose I cannot stress nothing for

1927
01:25:40,498 --> 01:25:43,800
purpose at all because if it's good and

1928
01:25:42,029 --> 01:25:45,389
you want to bang it together with

1929
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,949
something else that just looks good just

1930
01:25:45,389 --> 01:25:48,118
don't do it just because to do it or

1931
01:25:46,948 --> 01:25:50,339
don't do it because you got a cool name

1932
01:25:48,118 --> 01:25:51,630
lined up do it be do it for purpose do

1933
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:52,889
it for purpose we see too much of that

1934
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:55,409
in the industry every day that you get

1935
01:25:52,889 --> 01:25:58,050
you know create the strain come up with

1936
01:25:55,408 --> 01:26:01,859
the name lastly yes and if you do make

1937
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:04,349
something and it sucks okay so let's say

1938
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:05,668
you make a stream you take whatever

1939
01:26:04,349 --> 01:26:07,649
you've got this mail and then you've got

1940
01:26:05,668 --> 01:26:10,349
this prized female you throw pollen all

1941
01:26:07,649 --> 01:26:12,329
over it you let it go so once you

1942
01:26:10,349 --> 01:26:14,458
pollinate it's gonna take you you know

1943
01:26:12,328 --> 01:26:15,538
about six more weeks until the seeds are

1944
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:17,729
ready maybe six or eight more weeks

1945
01:26:15,538 --> 01:26:19,559
before he can chop that plant down I let

1946
01:26:17,729 --> 01:26:21,030
the plants dry until they're crispy at

1947
01:26:19,559 --> 01:26:22,199
that point I just chop them down let

1948
01:26:21,029 --> 01:26:23,518
them get super crispy and then I just

1949
01:26:22,198 --> 01:26:25,708
rub them and the seeds fall out then I

1950
01:26:23,519 --> 01:26:28,380
go collect all the seeds then I blast

1951
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:30,029
the material into oil honestly but so

1952
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:32,069
then you gotta grow those seeds yourself

1953
01:26:30,029 --> 01:26:34,109
I would recommend you grow a hundred of

1954
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:35,518
them just at least germinate a hundred

1955
01:26:34,109 --> 01:26:37,799
of them right away and see what they do

1956
01:26:35,519 --> 01:26:40,260
before you give any of them away to

1957
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:42,269
anybody germinate a hundred of them veg

1958
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:46,199
out at least fifty and flower at least

1959
01:26:42,269 --> 01:26:48,630
25 of them dry uhm kiram smoke em see

1960
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:50,279
what they do if it sucks flush the seeds

1961
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:53,038
down the toilet get rid of them feed

1962
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:54,809
them to your birds it's human we all we

1963
01:26:53,038 --> 01:26:56,969
all make mistakes and you can only

1964
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:58,918
control what you're doing so much it's

1965
01:26:56,969 --> 01:27:00,779
not its nature I would say nature you

1966
01:26:58,918 --> 01:27:02,609
can only control so much of what you're

1967
01:27:00,779 --> 01:27:04,139
doing the rest is left in her hands yeah

1968
01:27:02,609 --> 01:27:05,368
and sometimes things just don't want to

1969
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:07,649
breed together I made a strain that

1970
01:27:05,368 --> 01:27:10,738
totally sucked it produced giant colas

1971
01:27:07,649 --> 01:27:12,780
that tasted amazing but it would not get

1972
01:27:10,738 --> 01:27:20,488
you high at all you could smoke the

1973
01:27:12,779 --> 01:27:23,429
entire crop and ooze no high at all my

1974
01:27:20,488 --> 01:27:24,779
main thing was a breeding we had one

1975
01:27:23,429 --> 01:27:25,590
recently that came out with a Dante's

1976
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:27,479
Inferno

1977
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:28,349
it was a big hit for a lot of people

1978
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:29,698
because a lot of people do our

1979
01:27:28,349 --> 01:27:31,469
connoisseur smokers out there that like

1980
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:33,149
I brewing things like Grinspoon and

1981
01:27:31,469 --> 01:27:35,698
other other strains out there that are

1982
01:27:33,149 --> 01:27:37,618
just absolutely 100% top-grade

1983
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:40,229
connoisseur weed they yield like crap

1984
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:41,848
you know Girl Scout cookies I mean it's

1985
01:27:40,229 --> 01:27:44,579
not a known for its yield it's known for

1986
01:27:41,849 --> 01:27:46,619
its power and flavor every sweet funk

1987
01:27:44,579 --> 01:27:48,238
taste oh that's it and you're not

1988
01:27:46,618 --> 01:27:49,948
growing that as a cash crop you know you

1989
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:51,539
know a lot of the times you're growing

1990
01:27:49,948 --> 01:27:55,129
that for personal and if you do you are

1991
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:55,130
growing for cash crop you have a lot

1992
01:27:59,868 --> 01:28:04,710
what are we even talking about to get us

1993
01:28:01,889 --> 01:28:06,260
nails but anyway I did have was

1994
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:10,079
something I wanted to add to the RAL

1995
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:11,789
terpenes breeding for Terps um one of

1996
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:13,380
our perfect ones it's coming up now it's

1997
01:28:11,789 --> 01:28:15,719
gonna be one of our big frontrunner is

1998
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:19,199
the s1 version of our blueberry fuel umm

1999
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:20,819
this cut has amazing terpenes it soft

2000
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:22,649
it's just all day it's hard to explain

2001
01:28:20,819 --> 01:28:24,059
it's really really hard to explain it's

2002
01:28:22,649 --> 01:28:27,029
it's got a little bit everything in it

2003
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:28,530
and the reason that is is because when

2004
01:28:27,029 --> 01:28:29,849
you're choosing males and females and

2005
01:28:28,529 --> 01:28:31,529
you're doing that breeding work you know

2006
01:28:29,849 --> 01:28:32,940
actually look at the terpene profile if

2007
01:28:31,529 --> 01:28:34,979
you don't know and you can get it tested

2008
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:37,138
spend the forty fifty seventy-five bucks

2009
01:28:34,979 --> 01:28:38,729
whatever it takes get it tested did you

2010
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:40,889
have paperwork to back your stuff up if

2011
01:28:38,729 --> 01:28:42,479
you're in a legal state you should test

2012
01:28:40,889 --> 01:28:44,250
and the more widely it's becoming

2013
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:46,259
nowadays do you have literally half the

2014
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:47,579
country now we're 50/50 and it's taken

2015
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:50,429
over and you should be able to get it

2016
01:28:47,579 --> 01:28:52,590
tested by someone somehow somewhere or

2017
01:28:50,429 --> 01:28:55,380
almost you know use your connections to

2018
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:57,420
reach out and then get it done you know

2019
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:59,460
it makes a big difference I mean you can

2020
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:00,719
find out like a terpene profile and then

2021
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:03,719
try to match it up with something that

2022
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:05,969
absolutely would complement those

2023
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:08,639
terpenes but doesn't have them like are

2024
01:29:05,969 --> 01:29:10,380
very fuel blue dream which is a good

2025
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:12,690
clone only a good breeding parent breach

2026
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:14,250
true breach solid it doesn't isn't it's

2027
01:29:12,689 --> 01:29:15,629
known the breach table I've read a

2028
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:18,569
couple good strains with it you know you

2029
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:19,949
can pop 100 200 seeds and you might get

2030
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:23,039
wanted to harm ease out of it just

2031
01:29:19,948 --> 01:29:24,448
because it breached that stable and and

2032
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,670
it usually takes the dominance of things

2033
01:29:24,448 --> 01:29:28,319
but when you breathe wood was something

2034
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:29,579
like oh geez and Diesel's and things

2035
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:31,289
like that you had a whole different

2036
01:29:29,579 --> 01:29:33,420
terpene profile that really complements

2037
01:29:31,289 --> 01:29:35,279
the blueberry muffin ears and the blend

2038
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,779
and the creaminess of the Blue Dream it

2039
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:37,679
just stands out and everybody creates a

2040
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:39,448
whole nother animal

2041
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:41,429
you don't even those people when he

2042
01:29:39,448 --> 01:29:43,198
smoked with him first tell him what it

2043
01:29:41,429 --> 01:29:45,389
is lastly they did never even what a

2044
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:47,038
guest it came from blue dream that's the

2045
01:29:45,389 --> 01:29:48,538
thing look at it never would have

2046
01:29:47,038 --> 01:29:50,639
thought and taste it never would have

2047
01:29:48,538 --> 01:29:52,828
thought and it just peels him back he's

2048
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:54,449
got you know diesels it's got oh gee

2049
01:29:52,828 --> 01:29:59,849
tones it's got blueberry taunts it's got

2050
01:29:54,448 --> 01:30:00,899
creamy tones in it and I think I've

2051
01:29:59,849 --> 01:30:02,159
smoked some of that with you before I

2052
01:30:00,899 --> 01:30:03,779
think you brought that last time and it

2053
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:04,859
was definitely a tasty strain because

2054
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:07,288
that was what you brought for me to

2055
01:30:04,859 --> 01:30:08,908
smoke so I've noticed everything I

2056
01:30:07,288 --> 01:30:10,498
breathed to the Blue Dream I've never

2057
01:30:08,908 --> 01:30:12,238
used it as a mail obviously because it's

2058
01:30:10,498 --> 01:30:14,010
a clone only and it's a girl but

2059
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:16,438
everything I've read to it it has made

2060
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:18,900
huge colas everything you put to it

2061
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:21,300
that's it that's a - that's why we did

2062
01:30:18,899 --> 01:30:23,969
the og cross one typically was the DEXA

2063
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:25,619
gaining a little bit extra you yeah

2064
01:30:23,969 --> 01:30:27,599
because oh jeez our lanky and stuff I

2065
01:30:25,618 --> 01:30:29,308
was trying to put more I bred grateful

2066
01:30:27,599 --> 01:30:31,708
dog to the Blue Dream and I call it the

2067
01:30:29,309 --> 01:30:33,958
Blue Heeler and my point was to put more

2068
01:30:31,708 --> 01:30:35,760
vigor to the Grateful dog just make it a

2069
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:37,979
little bit bigger a little chunkier but

2070
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:41,130
I'm not a fan of the flavor of blue

2071
01:30:37,979 --> 01:30:43,920
dream that it's grow its grow eat it's a

2072
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:45,479
stripper weed it is it's real it's kind

2073
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,639
of like a bland blueberry it's real

2074
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:50,789
muffiny and real creamy it's like it

2075
01:30:47,639 --> 01:30:54,000
tastes like Jiffy muffins

2076
01:30:50,789 --> 01:30:54,000
[Music]

2077
01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:08,578
[Music]

2078
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:10,679
weird flashback yeah so I put that to

2079
01:31:08,578 --> 01:31:12,988
the Grateful dog and it made it more

2080
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:14,929
pungent and more more piney and then it

2081
01:31:12,988 --> 01:31:17,819
brought out a bottom layer of fruit i

2082
01:31:14,929 --> 01:31:20,998
bred it to the king Kim cross the grapes

2083
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:23,819
topper og and we call it the watts the

2084
01:31:20,998 --> 01:31:26,399
blue stopper but uh that one made it

2085
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:28,408
much stinkier and that the kink in

2086
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:30,089
grapes na / og made little tiny popcorns

2087
01:31:28,408 --> 01:31:31,549
and now it makes Spears since we put it

2088
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:33,510
to the Bluejays

2089
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:35,189
people all the time you know I've know

2090
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:37,920
you've had I know it's been around for a

2091
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:39,329
long time held 15 years now but don't

2092
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,920
count it out as a breeding mother with

2093
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:42,328
hybrids you know don't see blue dream on

2094
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,498
the label and automatically turn it away

2095
01:31:42,328 --> 01:31:45,748
because you're probably passing up a

2096
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:47,639
really really good cross I know a lot of

2097
01:31:45,748 --> 01:31:49,050
people that do not like blue dream at

2098
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:49,600
all shadows of those guys they know who

2099
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:50,920
they are

2100
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,079
gonna see your names on the show what up

2101
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:54,520
boys no no a lot of the nightmare lines

2102
01:31:53,079 --> 01:31:55,510
people fell in love with and things like

2103
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:57,100
that the reason why they called it

2104
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:59,670
nightmare where you think nightmare

2105
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:02,770
dream I mean put two and two together

2106
01:31:59,670 --> 01:32:04,300
people didn't even know no yeah lynnie

2107
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:06,610
Tom like now there's no blue dream in

2108
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:08,829
there alright so something important I

2109
01:32:06,609 --> 01:32:12,039
should mention this is uh this is kind

2110
01:32:08,829 --> 01:32:14,529
of a breeding by eye technique here you

2111
01:32:12,039 --> 01:32:15,850
could make Eliel charts you could take a

2112
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,139
whole bunch of notes you should take a

2113
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:19,150
whole bunch a whole bunch of notes

2114
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:21,490
either way but this is kind of just a

2115
01:32:19,149 --> 01:32:24,460
breeding breeding with love girl from

2116
01:32:21,489 --> 01:32:26,469
your heart sort of do it by your eye old

2117
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:29,649
school sort of thing we're breeding with

2118
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:31,600
a lot of experience here so I think if

2119
01:32:29,649 --> 01:32:33,699
you find a good male you're gonna want

2120
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,050
to do a Fino hunt of at least 20 seeds

2121
01:32:33,699 --> 01:32:37,389
you're gonna want to find one with a

2122
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:39,190
good structure you want it to look you

2123
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:42,070
want it to have this shape that you want

2124
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:44,289
the babies to have find one that makes

2125
01:32:42,069 --> 01:32:45,819
resin if you can find one that makes a

2126
01:32:44,289 --> 01:32:46,869
whole bunch of pollen if it doesn't make

2127
01:32:45,819 --> 01:32:49,420
enough pollen you're not gonna make

2128
01:32:46,869 --> 01:32:52,059
enough seeds find one with real close

2129
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:52,329
node spacing find one that smells real

2130
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:54,940
good

2131
01:32:52,329 --> 01:32:57,069
try not to select the very first one

2132
01:32:54,939 --> 01:32:59,710
that goes into flower and shows you that

2133
01:32:57,069 --> 01:33:01,449
it's a boy definitely do not use any

2134
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:03,579
male plants that show any sign of

2135
01:33:01,449 --> 01:33:06,220
hermaphrodite male plants can

2136
01:33:03,579 --> 01:33:07,750
hermaphrodite also you'll see pollen

2137
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:09,730
sacks you'll see little mail sacks

2138
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:11,710
popping out and then right out of the

2139
01:33:09,729 --> 01:33:14,329
sides you'll see female pistols come out

2140
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:17,550
yeah it's not those aren't nut hairs

2141
01:33:14,329 --> 01:33:17,550
[Music]

2142
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:32,369
that will create lots of problems in the

2143
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:34,779
future you do not want to breed

2144
01:33:32,369 --> 01:33:36,699
hermaphrodites that's right that is not

2145
01:33:34,779 --> 01:33:39,969
a good that's the exact opposite of what

2146
01:33:36,699 --> 01:33:41,649
we're aiming for so yeah and then pay

2147
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:43,060
attention that pollen you guys and when

2148
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:45,039
the pollen does start spitting you don't

2149
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:46,960
want that first grainy sandy pollen you

2150
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:48,039
want that the pollen will when you catch

2151
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,149
some of it and put it in your hand and

2152
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:51,250
rub it in the palm of your hand it'll

2153
01:33:49,149 --> 01:33:53,439
feel smooth and silky it'll feel real

2154
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:55,300
nice and then when you leave the grow

2155
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:58,029
room gonna have to hose yourself down

2156
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:00,130
get a mister like a sprayer and spray

2157
01:33:58,029 --> 01:34:01,779
like a pump sprayer like you'd almost

2158
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:02,270
used to pump pesticides get one of those

2159
01:34:01,779 --> 01:34:03,889
and just

2160
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:05,780
bring yourself down and wash your hands

2161
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:07,670
because tap water worked really great as

2162
01:34:05,779 --> 01:34:09,829
chlorine it's safe for everything plants

2163
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:11,449
and there you go that'll deactivate any

2164
01:34:09,829 --> 01:34:13,550
palm that you've got on you and then if

2165
01:34:11,449 --> 01:34:15,260
you are going from that pollen room and

2166
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:17,150
do a room that has female plants you can

2167
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:18,710
always hose them down as you walk in

2168
01:34:17,149 --> 01:34:20,299
just hit them with the sprayer and they

2169
01:34:18,710 --> 01:34:22,010
won't receive pollen for a little while

2170
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,539
just trying to prevent that pollen from

2171
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:25,550
getting onto your females if you don't

2172
01:34:23,539 --> 01:34:27,590
want to breed because if you have a male

2173
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:30,260
plant in the house or in the room or in

2174
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:32,960
the facility with your females it's

2175
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:34,670
going to try to get pollen everywhere

2176
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,020
one thing I've noticed bro you can tell

2177
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:38,359
me if you've recognized this

2178
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:40,580
I've got separate breeding rooms I've

2179
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:42,409
got an upstairs in the downstairs area

2180
01:34:40,579 --> 01:34:44,390
an area over here an area over here that

2181
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:47,210
I've got a male in one area and females

2182
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:49,730
in a totally different area I've noticed

2183
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:51,619
when I've got girls and a flowering male

2184
01:34:49,729 --> 01:34:53,569
in the same house the girls get a little

2185
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:56,239
stickier and they flower a little more

2186
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:58,489
quickly do you think those girls know

2187
01:34:56,239 --> 01:35:00,529
there's a male around somewhere good

2188
01:34:58,489 --> 01:35:02,809
question that is a good question it goes

2189
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:04,369
into some of my forte lighting and it

2190
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:05,990
actually yeah they do

2191
01:35:04,369 --> 01:35:09,170
they know because of infrared lighting

2192
01:35:05,989 --> 01:35:10,670
okay let's use infrared lighting to see

2193
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:11,750
around them that's why you have natural

2194
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:13,699
spacing in the woods

2195
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:15,050
that is why trees naturally spaced

2196
01:35:13,699 --> 01:35:16,699
themselves out naturally weed out

2197
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:18,260
smaller ones below them and around them

2198
01:35:16,699 --> 01:35:19,609
and you typically go into the woods and

2199
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:24,949
new pine tree forests and things like

2200
01:35:19,609 --> 01:35:32,809
that and they have okay so infrared

2201
01:35:24,949 --> 01:35:35,960
lighting plants know there's pheromones

2202
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:37,550
I believe as well okay because well they

2203
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,930
can take in co2 and they can they

2204
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:40,909
breathe out carbon dioxide you know

2205
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:44,780
there's always a constant intake between

2206
01:35:40,909 --> 01:35:48,319
oxygen and carbon dioxide battling right

2207
01:35:44,779 --> 01:35:49,789
and in a lot of their annual plants so

2208
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:50,989
they built over thousands and millions

2209
01:35:49,789 --> 01:35:52,909
of years beyond this earth they have

2210
01:35:50,989 --> 01:35:54,739
built defense mechanisms to try to

2211
01:35:52,909 --> 01:35:56,269
breathe that is their purpose that's why

2212
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:57,979
they're hermaphrodite honestly if

2213
01:35:56,270 --> 01:35:59,570
anybody remembers the first Jurassic

2214
01:35:57,979 --> 01:36:01,669
Park allegation say nature will always

2215
01:35:59,569 --> 01:36:02,599
find a way and then y'all said you have

2216
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:04,369
eggs

2217
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:06,200
that is why because nature will always

2218
01:36:04,369 --> 01:36:07,880
find a way and you're talking about

2219
01:36:06,199 --> 01:36:08,929
something that is on a total different

2220
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,930
levels than what you think it's

2221
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:14,990
mind-boggling to think how you know an

2222
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:17,390
evolution sense how far ahead some

2223
01:36:14,989 --> 01:36:18,739
plants are then then what we are you

2224
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:20,030
know we tend to think we are the kings

2225
01:36:18,739 --> 01:36:22,429
of the world you know weird sin of the

2226
01:36:20,029 --> 01:36:24,920
universe every day its weak but really

2227
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:27,619
if you look at an ant if he was our size

2228
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,420
he could lift your house right yeah they

2229
01:36:27,619 --> 01:36:30,710
can lift like 500 times in a natural

2230
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:37,970
weight and it's writing this smile at

2231
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:39,800
you in your house what it is you know

2232
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:41,090
it's really more about perception than

2233
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:51,619
anything you just push with all the

2234
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:55,400
listeners how you perceive things it's

2235
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:59,449

2449
01:49:14,770 --> 01:49:20,440
the cannabis cup was supposed to be in

2450
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:21,940
Denver on 4/20 supposed supposed to but

2451
01:49:20,439 --> 01:49:23,559
unfortunately the city of Denver

2452
01:49:21,939 --> 01:49:24,039
declined off the permit I'm not sure

2453
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:25,810
exactly

2454
01:49:24,039 --> 01:49:30,880
Denver officials declined all the

2455
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:33,400
permits they were either way they said

2456
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:36,369
not gonna do it nope they had some

2457
01:49:33,399 --> 01:49:39,279
issues namely out-of-state dispensaries

2458
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:41,109
handing out samples and what was

2459
01:49:39,279 --> 01:49:43,840
supposed to be 14 thousand people a day

2460
01:49:41,109 --> 01:49:51,699
actually being 35,000 people a day all

2461
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:54,730
right Colorado where Mike and I reside

2462
01:49:51,699 --> 01:49:58,269
yes they claimed we were going to do the

2463
01:49:54,729 --> 01:50:00,159
festival on the 18th 19th 20th 21st

2464
01:49:58,270 --> 01:50:02,200
within that range those original goal

2465
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:03,699
they put up fliers they put out some

2466
01:50:02,199 --> 01:50:05,170
announcements on their website they put

2467
01:50:03,699 --> 01:50:11,769
out some stuff on Twitter or Instagram

2468
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:13,859
and Facebook oh [ __ ] the next weekend so

2469
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:15,790
the permits have been entered

2470
01:50:13,859 --> 01:50:18,159
they've been submitted they're being

2471
01:50:15,789 --> 01:50:19,930
reviewed so far the city of Pueblo has

2472
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:22,510
not said if they are going to allow or

2473
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:24,369
decline the cannabis cup to happen in

2474
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:26,289
Pueblo Colorado this episode will come

2475
01:50:24,369 --> 01:50:27,729
out in two or three days and I'm pretty

2476
01:50:26,289 --> 01:50:29,979
sure the decision will not be made at

2477
01:50:27,729 --> 01:50:32,199
that time so right now there is no

2478
01:50:29,979 --> 01:50:34,629
definite location for the high times

2479
01:50:32,199 --> 01:50:36,220
his Cup in Colorado and it if it does

2480
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:39,730
happen it will be moved to the weekend

2481
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:42,699
of the 22nd and the 23rd if it does

2482
01:50:39,729 --> 01:50:45,279
happen in Pueblo Colorado at all yeah I

2483
01:50:42,699 --> 01:50:49,619
read something today claiming that this

2484
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:52,119
move was it was sort of an option B if

2485
01:50:49,619 --> 01:50:53,710
Adams County didn't go through and

2486
01:50:52,119 --> 01:50:56,819
they've been looking for bigger

2487
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:59,140
locations than the Denver mark and the

2488
01:50:56,819 --> 01:51:01,389
location down here in public claims to

2489
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:03,579
be able to handle the 25 or 30 thousand

2490
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:04,930
people a day no problem so I'm not too

2491
01:51:03,579 --> 01:51:06,579
familiar with the location I thought

2492
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:07,570
Denver Mart was great but of course when

2493
01:51:06,579 --> 01:51:11,289
I heard that it was going to be in

2494
01:51:07,569 --> 01:51:14,139
Pueblo I was awesome that shows a lot a

2495
01:51:11,289 --> 01:51:16,269
huge chunk of money out of going to the

2496
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:23,350
cup really just want to go to the cup

2497
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:25,690
yeah you gotta go and it's a multiple

2498
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:28,450
day of vein I have to go just because

2499
01:51:25,689 --> 01:51:30,069
that's how I go to all three days or

2500
01:51:28,449 --> 01:51:32,289
have to go to all three days you gotta

2501
01:51:30,069 --> 01:51:33,880
be up there for you know paying top

2502
01:51:32,289 --> 01:51:36,699
dollar for hotel rooms right now it

2503
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:38,170
never sucks and all the shitty hotels go

2504
01:51:36,699 --> 01:51:40,630
expensive if you think you're gonna pay

2505
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:42,250
70 or 80 for a hotel those 70 and 80

2506
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:47,560
dollar hotels are now a hundred and

2507
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:49,590
thirty knows that 420 is a big weekend

2508
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:51,310
in Denver and they cash the [ __ ] and

2509
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:52,930
unfortunately a bunch of people have

2510
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:55,690
already booked plane tickets they have

2511
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:57,520
booked the rooms in the big complaint

2512
01:51:55,689 --> 01:51:59,579
about the cup in Denver was always that

2513
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:02,680
the planning was sort of like a d-minus

2514
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:04,600
like the roof didn't fall in like nobody

2515
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:06,280
got squashed but other than that it was

2516
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:07,570
kind of a [ __ ] well when they

2517
01:52:06,279 --> 01:52:08,739
change their mind that they weren't

2518
01:52:07,569 --> 01:52:10,389
going to do it in Denver and they

2519
01:52:08,739 --> 01:52:15,699
decided to move it to Pueblo a lot of

2520
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:17,590
people were like yeah [ __ ] Pueblo we

2521
01:52:15,699 --> 01:52:19,510
sure do but then when they push the date

2522
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:21,310
to a completely different weekend I'm

2523
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:22,900
sure that a large portion of the people

2524
01:52:21,310 --> 01:52:25,060
that we're going to attend just decided

2525
01:52:22,899 --> 01:52:27,369
[ __ ] it they weren't even gonna try if

2526
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:28,810
the cup goes off in Pueblo because it's

2527
01:52:27,369 --> 01:52:31,689
not at all a sure thing at this point

2528
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:34,539
folks it's the decision comes down to

2529
01:52:31,689 --> 01:52:38,529
the County Planning Department and then

2530
01:52:34,539 --> 01:52:40,779
if they decide yes it can be appealed by

2531
01:52:38,529 --> 01:52:43,119
any number of people and our local

2532
01:52:40,779 --> 01:52:45,309
sheriff has told the press that if it's

2533
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:47,769
approved he's going to appeal

2534
01:52:45,310 --> 01:52:50,260
um because he doesn't he doesn't have

2535
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:52,780
any idea how he's gonna handle 35,000

2536
01:52:50,260 --> 01:52:54,280
cannabis cup attendees not because of

2537
01:52:52,779 --> 01:52:55,479
the number of attendees but because

2538
01:52:54,279 --> 01:52:56,769
they're attending the cannabis cup

2539
01:52:55,479 --> 01:52:58,719
something about the event makes it

2540
01:52:56,770 --> 01:53:00,580
special how we're going to be drive

2541
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:02,800
we're going to be too high to drive what

2542
01:53:00,579 --> 01:53:07,569
I saw in a statement they're really

2543
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:09,550
scared of DAV's yeah to the average to

2544
01:53:07,569 --> 01:53:11,079
normal person who's never seen cannabis

2545
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:12,550
and sees me pull out a torch and heat up

2546
01:53:11,079 --> 01:53:14,710
a nail and do this crack like looking

2547
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:16,750
drug I can understand the fear that he's

2548
01:53:14,710 --> 01:53:18,310
a police officer he's a sheriff he needs

2549
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:19,779
to figure out what's going on with the

2550
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:21,789
medical marijuana community and be in

2551
01:53:19,779 --> 01:53:23,469
touch with us and come join us instead

2552
01:53:21,789 --> 01:53:25,359
of be afraid of us and try to persecute

2553
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:27,460
us and prosecute us right spend 10

2554
01:53:25,359 --> 01:53:33,670
minutes talking to any member of the

2555
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:35,199
community a lot of big crazy weird words

2556
01:53:33,670 --> 01:53:36,460
but when it comes down to it I'm a

2557
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:37,779
peaceful chilled out dude and I'd love

2558
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:43,119
to sit down and have a conversation with

2559
01:53:37,779 --> 01:53:45,279
anybody who needs to be education that's

2560
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:47,829
what today is there was there was a lot

2561
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:49,779
of hilarity I think in this story if you

2562
01:53:47,829 --> 01:53:52,720
look at some of the reasons stated and

2563
01:53:49,779 --> 01:53:55,119
quoted that the permits wound up in

2564
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:56,740
Denver were denied the two big reasons

2565
01:53:55,119 --> 01:54:00,039
that are cited over and over and over

2566
01:53:56,739 --> 01:54:03,279
again in the press are a woman jumped

2567
01:54:00,039 --> 01:54:04,810
out of her car like somewhere in or

2568
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:06,340
around the cannabis cup where she had

2569
01:54:04,810 --> 01:54:08,890
just attended her was on her way it

2570
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:10,840
doesn't really specify but like clearly

2571
01:54:08,890 --> 01:54:14,440
marijuana use doesn't cause jumping out

2572
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:16,210
of cars I've smoked people if you know

2573
01:54:14,439 --> 01:54:18,099
me like colorado sold almost a buoy

2574
01:54:16,210 --> 01:54:31,510
those with we last year if it cost

2575
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:32,740
jumping out of cars we would know 90% of

2576
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:35,170
the people on the plane right like

2577
01:54:32,739 --> 01:54:38,679
that's not an effect we wouldn't see

2578
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:40,149
four years down the road jump out of

2579
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:42,430
cars I would have done backflips out of

2580
01:54:40,149 --> 01:54:44,079
buses by now right and there were 35,000

2581
01:54:42,430 --> 01:54:46,150
people a day at the cup and one woman

2582
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:48,640
jumped out of a car like that exactly

2583
01:54:46,149 --> 01:54:50,109
like a fat related they forgot to

2584
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:51,940
mention in the article that she took a

2585
01:54:50,109 --> 01:54:53,289
DAB and then she went and did a whole

2586
01:54:51,939 --> 01:54:55,979
bunch of Molly and then she drank

2587
01:54:53,289 --> 01:54:58,210
whiskey and then

2588
01:54:55,979 --> 01:54:59,799
jumping out of a car one of the time and

2589
01:54:58,210 --> 01:55:00,279
she was stone sober and fight another

2590
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:07,630

2596
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:19,750

to be looking for people driving too

2604
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:36,940

2605
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:39,159
alcohol if you're going to be leaving

2612
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:55,090

yourself a DUI or an illegal possession

2620
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:11,050
of cannabis ticket because that is still

2621
01:56:08,890 --> 01:56:15,520
a possible thing here in Colorado

2622
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:17,380
if this cannabis cup if it goes off in

2623
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:20,350
Pueblo is gonna be under a lot of

2624
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:22,270
scrutiny and honestly Puebla could use

2625
01:56:20,350 --> 01:56:23,800
the cup down here and I'd really like to

2626
01:56:22,270 --> 01:56:25,770
see the event do well if it gets

2627
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:28,000
approved at all I would love to see it

2628
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:29,740
one of the big complaints in Adams

2629
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,930
County was out-of-state dispensaries

2630
01:56:29,739 --> 01:56:34,800
coming here and selling weed and dabs at

2631
01:56:31,930 --> 01:56:39,640
their booths some of them were doing

2632
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:42,670
donation legal mumbo jumbo other people

2633
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:45,220
were straight doing sales um at least

2634
01:56:42,670 --> 01:56:46,690
according to recent reports and yeah

2635
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:48,520
that's a big no-no here which is why

2636
01:56:46,689 --> 01:56:51,309
none of our local dispensaries were even

2637
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:52,990
handing out product at the cup I get

2638
01:56:51,310 --> 01:56:54,760
that the cup is supposed to be the

2639
01:56:52,989 --> 01:56:58,359
community gathering and celebrating and

2640
01:56:54,760 --> 01:57:00,340
having a huge smoke out but how you hand

2641
01:56:58,359 --> 01:57:01,960
out samples or what people bring to

2642
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:05,020
smoke like there's a lot of rules around

2643
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:06,730
that you need to know the law and please

2644
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:09,040

2656
01:57:23,649 --> 01:57:27,009

2657

line be able to pass the tests remember

2660
01:57:31,569 --> 01:57:34,329
we did the episode a little while back

2661
01:57:32,859 --> 01:57:36,579
about interacting with law enforcement

2662
01:57:34,329 --> 01:57:39,579
be prepared for that [ __ ] if you're a

2663
01:57:36,579 --> 01:57:41,979
nervous person don't be extra high and

2664
01:57:39,579 --> 01:57:43,300
nervous when you're leaving the cut for

2665
01:57:41,979 --> 01:57:44,649
an extra hour you know understand if you

2666
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:46,659
take a couple dad's hang out for an hour

2667
01:57:44,649 --> 01:57:49,149
I went back and listened to that episode

2668
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:51,729
the one thing I realized I meant to

2669
01:57:49,149 --> 01:57:52,779
emphasize and didn't was the easiest way

2670
01:57:51,729 --> 01:57:54,429
to not get in trouble with law

2671
01:57:52,779 --> 01:57:57,069
enforcement and to be calm and cool

2672
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:58,780
during those interactions is to not be

2673
01:57:57,069 --> 01:58:00,519
breaking the law you know that's

2674
01:57:58,779 --> 01:58:01,869
something my buddy Lewis shoutout Magoo

2848
02:04:41,399 --> 02:04:50,698
need to know people who moved here that

2849
02:04:49,079 --> 02:04:52,590
didn't know how to do none of this and

2850
02:04:50,698 --> 02:04:55,349
don't meet the requirements and so

2851
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:56,969

2852

trying to get a job doing whatever it is

2853
02:04:56,969 --> 02:05:00,179
it was they were doing that they hated

2854
02:04:58,679 --> 02:05:01,710
so much they moved across the country to

2855
02:05:00,179 --> 02:05:03,119

application that's where you start it's

2880
02:05:54,988 --> 02:05:59,399
not super hard to find if you just

2881
02:05:56,909 --> 02:06:00,930
by name right there are a lot of things

2882
02:05:59,399 --> 02:06:02,579
to filter through though it's confusing

2883
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:04,860
and what you're looking for yeah it does

2884
02:06:02,579 --> 02:06:06,119
take a minute of reading and kind of

2885
02:06:04,859 --> 02:06:07,769
clicking around to find the actual

2886
02:06:06,119 --> 02:06:09,300
application that you need cuz they've

2887
02:06:07,770 --> 02:06:11,130
got like four of them post right and

2888
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:12,720

2891
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:19,590
I made a note to talk about that so find

2892

the application read and review the

2893
02:06:19,590 --> 02:06:23,489
application you'll get to a part that

2894
02:06:21,479 --> 02:06:25,259
says this marijuana occupational

2895
02:06:23,489 --> 02:06:26,609
employee application form is an official

2896
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:28,350
document if you provide false

2897

information on your marijuana license

2898
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:32,550
application and/or do not disclose all

2899
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:34,350
information the application asks your

2900
02:06:32,550 --> 02:06:36,810
license is subject to denial or

2901
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:38,820
revocation and you may be subject to

2902
02:06:36,810 --> 02:06:40,320

Enforcement Division will conduct a

2904
02:06:40,319 --> 02:06:43,289
complete background investigation and

2905
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:45,480
we'll check all sources of information

2906
02:06:43,289 --> 02:06:47,640

02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:51,000

2912
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:58,320

2913
02:06:56,670 --> 02:07:00,000

2914
02:06:58,319 --> 02:07:02,009

2918
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:09,930

2919

2920
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:12,750
long time he writes them letters all the

2921
02:07:11,399 --> 02:07:14,460

2922

2932
02:07:35,819 --> 02:07:39,149
like we'll get more specific but really

2933
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:41,039
just tell the truth

2934
02:07:39,149 --> 02:07:42,569
there's no fudge in this know the

2935
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:44,250
requirements if you don't meet them

2936
02:07:42,569 --> 02:07:45,809
straight up don't try cuz you ain't

2937
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:47,369
gonna get passed and if you do it's a

2938
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:51,030
special crime this is the age of the

2939
02:07:47,369 --> 02:07:53,309
internet if you did some [ __ ] like just

2940
02:07:51,029 --> 02:07:54,899
write it down they really don't care as

2941
02:07:53,310 --> 02:07:56,160
long as it violates a couple of

2942
02:07:54,899 --> 02:07:57,960
requirements and they play those

2943
02:07:56,159 --> 02:07:59,909
straight up and down for the most part I

2944
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:01,980
might hurt one person who didn't get

2945
02:07:59,909 --> 02:08:03,599
their badge and they tried to make it

2946
02:08:01,979 --> 02:08:05,399
sound like a big conspiracy it was like

2947
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:09,480
nah dude it was that felony three years

2948
02:08:05,399 --> 02:08:10,089
ago oh yeah the disqualifying conditions

2949
02:08:09,479 --> 02:08:12,349
it's

2950
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:14,929
these questions go like this have you

2951
02:08:12,350 --> 02:08:17,030
ever discharged a sentence for a

2952
02:08:14,929 --> 02:08:18,920
conviction of a felony pursuant to any

2953
02:08:17,029 --> 02:08:20,529
state or federal law regarding the

2954
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:22,310
possession distribution manufacturing

2955
02:08:20,529 --> 02:08:24,829
cultivation or use of a controlled

2956
02:08:22,310 --> 02:08:26,750
substance including probation or parole

2957
02:08:24,829 --> 02:08:28,368
within the last 10 years even if the

2958
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:28,908
conviction occurred more than ten years

2959
02:08:28,368 --> 02:08:30,979
ago

2960
02:08:28,908 --> 02:08:32,559
so that means have you been in jail for

2961
02:08:30,979 --> 02:08:35,658
any felony is that what that means

2962
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:37,550
that's no drug felonies in ten years is

2963
02:08:35,658 --> 02:08:40,250
what that questions asking about like

2964
02:08:37,550 --> 02:08:43,100
you have to have completed the jail

2965
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:45,380
sentence and any probation or parole at

2966
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:50,300
least 10 years before you apply for your

2967
02:08:45,380 --> 02:08:53,359
Emmy deep edge so ten years ago ten

2968
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:55,699
years let's be specific it says drug

2969
02:08:53,359 --> 02:08:57,618
felony yes so you had to have drugs

2970
02:08:55,698 --> 02:08:59,419
involved in your felony and it has to be

2971
02:08:57,618 --> 02:09:02,599
more than ten years ago if that happened

2972
02:08:59,420 --> 02:09:10,420
if it was nine years and 365 days

2973
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:12,469
because it's [ __ ] leap year so

2974
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:14,289
condition number two have you served a

2975
02:09:12,469 --> 02:09:16,520
sentence including probation parole

2976
02:09:14,289 --> 02:09:18,408
within the last five years upon

2977
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:20,090
conviction for any felony even if the

2978
02:09:18,408 --> 02:09:22,129
conviction occurred more than five years

2979
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:24,739
ago so once again if you're on probation

2980
02:09:22,130 --> 02:09:27,020
or parole five years ago or within the

2981
02:09:24,738 --> 02:09:28,968
last five years you are not allowed to

2982
02:09:27,020 --> 02:09:32,239
work in the industry so no drug felonies

2983
02:09:28,969 --> 02:09:33,859
and ten no felonies period in five or

2984
02:09:32,238 --> 02:09:35,419
probation or parole yep and the

2985
02:09:33,859 --> 02:09:37,429
probation of parole for many of those

2986
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:39,289
felonies has to be got done at least

2987
02:09:37,429 --> 02:09:41,329
that many years ago and this one is neat

2988
02:09:39,289 --> 02:09:43,609
are you a licensed physician making

2989
02:09:41,329 --> 02:09:45,439
patient recommendations yep if you're a

2990
02:09:43,609 --> 02:09:47,420
doctor in the industry you can't be

2991
02:09:45,439 --> 02:09:48,948
affiliate affiliated with the dispensary

2992
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:50,630
you're involved with that part of it so

2993
02:09:48,948 --> 02:09:53,509
you don't need a badge that makes good

2994
02:09:50,630 --> 02:09:54,829
sense I understand that rule kind of

2995
02:09:53,510 --> 02:09:56,000
makes sense and I really get where

2996
02:09:54,829 --> 02:09:58,100
they're going with the felony rule

2997
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:01,698
they're really trying to play it so that

2998
02:09:58,100 --> 02:10:04,369
the state can say with all reassurance

2999
02:10:01,698 --> 02:10:07,479
that people who were dealing drugs in

3000
02:10:04,368 --> 02:10:09,829
the past aren't owning dispensaries and

3001
02:10:07,479 --> 02:10:11,658
an easy way to do that is to make sure

3002
02:10:09,829 --> 02:10:13,880
that anyone convicted of selling drugs

3003
02:10:11,658 --> 02:10:17,509
doesn't get to be a dispensary owner for

3004
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:18,980
at least the first decade and yeah that

3005
02:10:17,510 --> 02:10:20,300
kind of sucks for people who got busted

3006
02:10:18,979 --> 02:10:22,069
back in the day and they're now trying

3007
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:24,829
to be totally straight-up legal

3008
02:10:22,069 --> 02:10:26,569
but that's how Colorado wants to play

3009
02:10:24,828 --> 02:10:31,880
this position part they just don't want

3010
02:10:26,569 --> 02:10:33,259
you to be a doctor hanging out alright

3011
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:35,270
number four says have you had your

3012
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:38,150
authority to act as primary caregiver

3013
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:39,679
revoked by the state health agency so if

3014
02:10:38,149 --> 02:10:41,598
your you were somebody's primary

3015
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:43,520
caregiver as not under the Medical

3016
02:10:41,599 --> 02:10:45,139
Marijuana type of caregiver but as their

3017
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:46,849
caregiver for somebody who's elderly or

3018
02:10:45,139 --> 02:10:48,230
disabled if that's been revoked you are

3019
02:10:46,849 --> 02:10:50,179
not allowed to work in the cannabis

3020
02:10:48,229 --> 02:10:52,669
industry the next question is are you

3021
02:10:50,179 --> 02:10:55,609
under 21 years of age you have to be 21

3022
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:58,099
years old when you apply it gotta be 21

3023
02:10:55,609 --> 02:11:00,618
that's not too hard to figure out 21 the

3024
02:10:58,099 --> 02:11:02,389
next question says are are not question

3025
02:11:00,618 --> 02:11:05,238
but let me take a sip here hold on talk

3026
02:11:02,389 --> 02:11:22,460
Mike I don't know what the next question

3027
02:11:05,238 --> 02:11:23,928
is but I can guess student loans are you

3028
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:25,578
the spouse or child living in the

3029
02:11:23,929 --> 02:11:27,170

3045
02:12:12,529 --> 02:12:16,130

3046
02:12:14,149 --> 02:12:18,948
pass special like non-compete clause

3047

when this is their job DVD now that's

3049
02:12:20,988 --> 02:12:27,319
pretty good and then the next one on the

3050
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:29,300
last one are you a sheriff deputy

3051

3056
02:12:38,849 --> 02:12:43,590

says stop if you answered yes to any of

3058
02:12:43,590 --> 02:12:47,819

3060
02:12:47,819 --> 02:12:52,710
marijuana occupational employee license

3061
02:12:50,368 --> 02:12:54,029
those are just straight-up you can't get

3062
02:12:52,710 --> 02:12:55,859
a license period

3063
02:12:54,029 --> 02:12:57,840
don't try we'll find it with the FBI

3064
02:12:55,859 --> 02:12:59,488
background check yep so if you heard if

3065
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:02,460
you qualify under any of that [ __ ] that

3066
02:12:59,488 --> 02:13:04,468
we just read you cannot work in Colorado

3067
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:05,998
in the legal marijuana industry you're

3068
02:13:04,469 --> 02:13:08,578
gonna have to go to California or

3069
02:13:05,998 --> 02:13:10,288
Washington or Oregon or maybe Michigan

3070
02:13:08,578 --> 02:13:18,090
or who else is legal now Mike where can

3071
02:13:10,288 --> 02:13:20,670
people go the legal states Oregon Alaska

3072
02:13:18,090 --> 02:13:22,920
there's 23 medical marijuana States get

3073
02:13:20,670 --> 02:13:25,199
online look at the laws in each one see

3074
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:31,440
which ones you can still work or or or

3075
02:13:25,198 --> 02:13:33,598
or what you should really do better make

3076
02:13:31,439 --> 02:13:35,219
it legalize cannabis where you are if

3077
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:37,349
you can't work in the legal industry

3078
02:13:35,219 --> 02:13:41,130
that doesn't mean you can't lobby on its

3079
02:13:37,349 --> 02:13:43,949
behalf that's the truth throw that out

3080
02:13:41,130 --> 02:13:45,690
there yeah you can you can do what you

3081
02:13:43,948 --> 02:13:48,058
can do for your area maybe you can't be

3082
02:13:45,689 --> 02:13:49,888
a grower maybe you can't be a manager

3083
02:13:48,059 --> 02:13:52,019
you can't be an owner but you can always

3084
02:13:49,889 --> 02:13:53,699
be a lobbyist you can be an activist you

3085
02:13:52,019 --> 02:13:54,809
can do your part in some way shape or

3086
02:13:53,698 --> 02:13:57,598
form that is for sure

3087
02:13:54,809 --> 02:13:59,400
so after it asks you all these questions

3088
02:13:57,599 --> 02:14:01,110
and you check no to them or yes to them

3089
02:13:59,399 --> 02:14:02,279
it makes you sign and it says I have

3090
02:14:01,109 --> 02:14:03,658
thoroughly read and understand the

3091
02:14:02,279 --> 02:14:05,550
questions above and understand that I

3092
02:14:03,658 --> 02:14:08,038
cannot hold a Colorado marijuana license

3093
02:14:05,550 --> 02:14:12,329
if at any time in the future I can ever

3094
02:14:08,038 --> 02:14:13,978
answer yes answer if at any time in the

3095
02:14:12,328 --> 02:14:15,509
future I can ever answer yes to any

3096
02:14:13,979 --> 02:14:20,099
other questions above that's weirdly

3097
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:22,440
worded but it's crazy legal talk for if

3098
02:14:20,099 --> 02:14:24,210
the answer this change is like if you

3099
02:14:22,439 --> 02:14:25,018
committed a felony nine years ago in two

3100
02:14:24,210 --> 02:14:26,849
years past

3101
02:14:25,019 --> 02:14:29,820
oh god that felony conviction and all

3102
02:14:26,849 --> 02:14:31,078
your [ __ ] with it was over ten years ago

3103
02:14:29,819 --> 02:14:34,259
like you're good to go now

3104
02:14:31,078 --> 02:14:36,779
alright you can reapply or apply period

3105
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:40,559
so then there's also an arrest

3106
02:14:36,779 --> 02:14:42,268
disclosure forum form if she says if

3107
02:14:40,559 --> 02:14:43,920
since turning age eighteen have you ever

3108
02:14:42,269 --> 02:14:45,659
been arrested served criminal summons

3109
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:47,578
charged with or convicted of any crime

3110
02:14:45,658 --> 02:14:48,659
regarding the possession distribution or

3111
02:14:47,578 --> 02:14:50,670
use of a controlled son

3112
02:14:48,659 --> 02:14:52,920
you must disclose this information to

3113
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:54,510
the marijuana Enforcement Division make

3114
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:56,970
sure you get them all on there too cuz

3115
02:14:54,510 --> 02:14:59,430
oops I forgot that one looks really

3116
02:14:56,970 --> 02:15:03,240
[ __ ] bad they give you plenty of

3117
02:14:59,430 --> 02:15:05,070
space to list yep holy crap check any of

3118
02:15:03,239 --> 02:15:06,779
the following or professional licenses

3119
02:15:05,069 --> 02:15:08,460
you have held so it asks which licenses

3120
02:15:06,779 --> 02:15:10,289
you've had it asks if you've had a

3121
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:12,480
liquor license or a lawyer license or

3122
02:15:10,289 --> 02:15:13,739
racing license a lottery license so it's

3123
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:16,199
gonna ask you a lot of crazy questions

3124
02:15:13,739 --> 02:15:18,750

3133
02:15:39,510 --> 02:15:44,640

3143
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:06,050
that apply to most of the people

3144
02:16:04,529 --> 02:16:18,779
listening to the show or the first two

3145
02:16:06,050 --> 02:16:21,300
alright alright there's probably a

3146
02:16:18,779 --> 02:16:22,920
couple you know I remember there was an

3147
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:24,600
event that we did for the show we did a

3148
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:26,190
live show somewhere the place doesn't

3149
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:27,690
exist anymore but we did a live show

3150
02:16:26,189 --> 02:16:29,639
somewhere and we invited people to come

3151
02:16:27,689 --> 02:16:31,859
and I made flyers for the show right and

3152
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:34,370
I put out flyers for the podcast to come

3153
02:16:31,859 --> 02:16:36,840
listen to wall people it was a smoking

3154
02:16:34,370 --> 02:16:38,400
remember because I used to sit in a room

3155
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:41,130
with a number of members of law

3156
02:16:38,399 --> 02:16:43,109
enforcement every Monday night okay like

3157
02:16:41,129 --> 02:16:45,149
when this happened that I was keenly

3158
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:47,880
aware of how many officers were in that

3159
02:16:45,149 --> 02:16:49,949
room every Monday night I put out flyers

3160
02:16:47,879 --> 02:16:51,689
to listen to the podcast at a smoking

3161
02:16:49,950 --> 02:16:53,070
event and somehow law enforcement found

3162
02:16:51,690 --> 02:16:55,230
the Flyers and thought that they were

3163
02:16:53,069 --> 02:16:57,420
like some sort of tickets to get free

3164
02:16:55,229 --> 02:16:58,739
weed at the event or something and so in

3165
02:16:57,420 --> 02:17:00,030
the next episode I gave a shout out to

3166
02:16:58,739 --> 02:17:01,500
the cops open that they were listening

3167
02:17:00,030 --> 02:17:02,969
because they had the Flyers and it said

3168
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:04,679
listen I had a little QR code if you

3169

3171
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:09,150
I appreciate you for listening I hope

3172
02:17:07,950 --> 02:17:10,440

3268
02:20:34,439 --> 02:20:38,460
go to like seven different courthouses

3269
02:20:35,909 --> 02:20:41,189
to pick up stuff that they got between

3270
02:20:38,459 --> 02:20:42,898

3271
02:20:41,189 --> 02:20:45,029
they've been perfect for a decade but

3272
02:20:42,898 --> 02:20:46,799
they had still had to spend four days

3273
02:20:45,029 --> 02:20:49,109
driving between courthouses getting

3274
02:20:46,799 --> 02:20:50,670
paperwork so that they could then apply

3275
02:20:49,109 --> 02:20:54,329

3283

plenty of people that have yes so we

3295
02:21:29,809 --> 02:21:33,769
neither of us had an issue but we've all

3296
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:36,109
talked to countless people that have no

02:23:37,068 --> 02:23:39,350
support

3349
02:23:37,729 --> 02:23:40,699
it is a hundred and fifty dollars my

3350
02:23:39,351 --> 02:23:42,560
colectomy is that wrong because I just

3351
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:45,579
know it wasn't prices were right but I

3352
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:47,899
think jumper takes cash I'm like 85%

3353
02:23:45,579 --> 02:23:52,220
somebody else that was helping me with

3354
02:23:47,899 --> 02:23:53,810
this episode will not accept cash and

3355
02:23:52,220 --> 02:23:55,250
the website says bring check or money

3356
02:23:53,810 --> 02:23:58,341
order so I'm pretty sure they quit

3357
02:23:55,250 --> 02:24:00,171
accepting cash just surprise me I knew

3358
02:23:58,341 --> 02:24:01,341
that only one office did and I could

3359
02:24:00,171 --> 02:24:03,711
have sworn it was Denver but I might

3360
02:24:01,341 --> 02:24:05,690
have taken the check I worked at a place

3361
02:24:03,710 --> 02:24:08,510
that had a lot of cash flow like we had

3362
02:24:05,690 --> 02:24:10,810
a lot of cash they've worked at several

3363
02:24:08,511 --> 02:24:14,271
places and just imagine how many

3364
02:24:10,810 --> 02:24:17,979
applications they handle at $150 the

3365
02:24:14,271 --> 02:24:24,771
badge minimum times 16,000 employees

3366
02:24:17,979 --> 02:24:27,529
imagine that much money in a box and the

3367
02:24:24,771 --> 02:24:29,239
office anywhere over a [ __ ] couple of

3368
02:24:27,530 --> 02:24:31,521
days that box is full of cash so I

3369
02:24:29,239 --> 02:24:33,380
understand just be prepared you guys

3370
02:24:31,521 --> 02:24:34,881
take a check or take a money order

3371
02:24:33,380 --> 02:24:36,859
just stop it somewhere that sells a

3372
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:38,510
money order freaking Walmart sucks they

3373
02:24:36,860 --> 02:24:45,351
have money orders I think most Walgreens

3374
02:24:38,511 --> 02:24:46,881
will sell you a money order go to the

3375
02:24:45,351 --> 02:24:48,381
place now let's talk about the

3376
02:24:46,880 --> 02:24:50,869
difference between a key badge and a

3377
02:24:48,380 --> 02:24:52,430
support badge there always has to be a

3378
02:24:50,870 --> 02:24:55,250
support badge on premises

3379
02:24:52,431 --> 02:24:56,540
nobody can be in micro without a support

3380
02:24:55,250 --> 02:24:58,040
battery there has to be a red badge

3381
02:24:56,540 --> 02:25:00,110
which is the owner badge if they own the

3382
02:24:58,040 --> 02:25:02,271
place to get that one or a key badge if

3383
02:25:00,110 --> 02:25:03,950
you don't have a key badge if there's

3384
02:25:02,271 --> 02:25:04,671
not a key badge on premises nobody else

3385
02:25:03,950 --> 02:25:06,200
can be in there

3386
02:25:04,671 --> 02:25:09,950
none of the support badges can be in the

3387
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:11,961
room so I find it advantageous to go

3388
02:25:09,950 --> 02:25:13,461
ahead and get that key badge because

3389
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:14,840
then you're kind of more qualified to do

3390
02:25:13,460 --> 02:25:17,539
more [ __ ] you've already got more

3391
02:25:14,841 --> 02:25:20,390
ability to take on more responsibility I

3392
02:25:17,540 --> 02:25:22,521
made sure to get the key yeah and did it

3393
02:25:20,390 --> 02:25:24,039
help you do you feel like getting your

3394
02:25:22,521 --> 02:25:26,450
key badge helped you advance in your

3395
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:28,400
position at the spot I think those rules

3396
02:25:26,450 --> 02:25:34,011
are more heavily enforced on the medical

3397
02:25:28,399 --> 02:25:35,421
side okay or maybe I'm just no I've got

3398
02:25:34,011 --> 02:25:38,450
to be the I'm the only support badge

3399
02:25:35,421 --> 02:25:39,591
several nights a week at work or my only

3400
02:25:38,450 --> 02:25:41,721
key badge that might be why I got

3401
02:25:39,591 --> 02:25:43,159
promoted yeah yes it was one of my

3402
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:46,279
promotion it just makes you more

3403
02:25:43,159 --> 02:25:47,989
promotable so a support badge you can be

3404
02:25:46,280 --> 02:25:49,610
like a budtender you can be a trimmer

3405
02:25:47,989 --> 02:25:51,829
you can be a joint roller

3406
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:53,480
you can in the gardens you can support

3407
02:25:51,829 --> 02:25:55,639
badges in starter badges like if you've

3408
02:25:53,479 --> 02:25:57,020
only got 150 to spend on a badge and you

3409
02:25:55,639 --> 02:25:59,239
know you're gonna be a trimmer for the

3410
02:25:57,020 --> 02:26:00,680
first year like tinder or a budtender

3411
02:25:59,239 --> 02:26:02,209
you can go ahead and get the support

3412
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:04,399
well like we're not saying don't but the

3413
02:26:02,209 --> 02:26:06,169
key badge definitely gives you more

3414
02:26:04,399 --> 02:26:07,699
opportunities in the industry and if

3415
02:26:06,170 --> 02:26:10,190
you're one of those people that's moving

3416
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:13,820
to Colorado with a degree in

3417
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:16,280
biochemistry like you might want to go

3418
02:26:13,819 --> 02:26:18,049
ahead and get the support badge or the

3419
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:20,180
key badge I'm sorry I thank you mixing

3420
02:26:18,049 --> 02:26:23,269
those two I was trying to figure you

3421
02:26:20,180 --> 02:26:24,770
confused me so sorry yes edge is the

3422
02:26:23,270 --> 02:26:26,300
more important one I was looking for the

3423
02:26:24,770 --> 02:26:27,680
distinguishing it says something about

3424
02:26:26,299 --> 02:26:29,569
on the application if you're going to

3425
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:31,790
have keys and be in charge of employees

3426
02:26:29,569 --> 02:26:33,770
and have access to limited access areas

3427
02:26:31,790 --> 02:26:35,270
you should go ahead and get a key badge

3428
02:26:33,770 --> 02:26:36,440
so I recommend of course get the key

3429
02:26:35,270 --> 02:26:38,270
badge if you don't have the money for it

3430
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:40,130
get yourself a support badge if you're

3431
02:26:38,270 --> 02:26:41,300
an ambitious ambitious person and you

3432
02:26:40,129 --> 02:26:43,489
feel like you want to move up if you're

3433
02:26:41,299 --> 02:26:44,750
gonna manage that [ __ ] get the key go

3434
02:26:43,489 --> 02:26:46,010
ahead and get a key badge if you want to

3435
02:26:44,750 --> 02:26:47,540
work with the grow team if you're real

3436
02:26:46,010 --> 02:26:49,460
enthusiastic and you can show that you

3437
02:26:47,540 --> 02:26:50,870
can do it get yourself a key badge we'd

3438
02:26:49,459 --> 02:26:52,879
love to see you move up in the industry

3439
02:26:50,870 --> 02:26:54,829
super quickly I knew I wasn't gonna be

3440
02:26:52,879 --> 02:26:56,750
on the bottom rung for long so I fully

3441
02:26:54,829 --> 02:26:58,309
got that one on purpose like I know a

3442
02:26:56,750 --> 02:27:00,170
lot of other people that did that too

3443
02:26:58,309 --> 02:27:02,510
and I know a couple of people who got

3444
02:27:00,170 --> 02:27:04,399
the support and have been kind of passed

3445
02:27:02,510 --> 02:27:06,200
over several times because they can't

3446
02:27:04,399 --> 02:27:07,549
meet some of those requirements that you

3447
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:10,250
have to have the key for gotta have a

3448
02:27:07,549 --> 02:27:12,679
key badge on premises at all times gotta

3449
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:14,420
be pretty much in the same room with the

3450
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:17,059
support badges it doesn't even leave

3451
02:27:14,420 --> 02:27:18,920
them in another room so alright so if

3452
02:27:17,059 --> 02:27:20,420
you want to be like the cultivation

3453
02:27:18,920 --> 02:27:22,460
manager get a key badge you're gonna be

3454
02:27:20,420 --> 02:27:24,260
a trim team leader get a key badge maybe

3455
02:27:22,459 --> 02:27:25,489
even if you want to be LEED budtender

3456
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:27,409
you might need a key badge because

3457
02:27:25,489 --> 02:27:29,539
you'll be carrying product back to the

3458
02:27:27,409 --> 02:27:32,869
storage room which requires a key badge

3459
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:34,190
to get into or at least it should so get

3460
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:36,020
your badge it's gonna cost money

3461
02:27:34,190 --> 02:27:37,399

3462

bud tuning and trimming those are the

3483
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:22,280
ways into this industry if you want to

3484
02:28:20,629 --> 02:28:25,779
be a master grower most places have a

3485
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:25,780
master grower you're gonna start

3486

3488
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:37,370

02:28:34,851 --> 02:28:39,590
wants it done and also contributes skill

3490
02:28:37,370 --> 02:28:41,420
knowledge and care to the job you may

3491

3507
02:29:11,659 --> 02:29:18,950
profession I have played bud tender

3508
02:29:14,771 --> 02:29:22,311
manager fire hire and fire work I did

3509
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:25,909
hire him firing I grew the weed I'm

3510
02:29:22,310 --> 02:29:33,729
still doing the growing I do the I do

3511
02:29:25,909 --> 02:29:33,729
some transportation a bunch of different

3512
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:41,870
the Bob and like people need to people

3513
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:43,909
every day that aren't prepared for that

3514
02:29:41,870 --> 02:29:45,590
idea they're like well I've been in

3515
02:29:43,909 --> 02:29:47,510
marketing for like 10 years and it's

3516
02:29:45,590 --> 02:29:52,549
like cool are you ready to trim some

3517
02:29:47,510 --> 02:29:53,989
we'd learn everything in this room and

3518
02:29:52,549 --> 02:29:56,600
what their different applications are

3519
02:29:53,989 --> 02:29:58,851
for different patients and and sell it

3520
02:29:56,601 --> 02:30:00,319
accurately and inform well-informed like

3521
02:29:58,851 --> 02:30:02,120
can you pull that off because if you

3522
02:30:00,319 --> 02:30:03,920
can't do that or be cool trim to show a

3523
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:07,181
little weed like you're gonna have a

3524
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:09,101
really hard time looking for dispensary

3525
02:30:07,181 --> 02:30:10,601
it's actively looking for a marketing

3526
02:30:09,101 --> 02:30:13,360
dude who's never worked in legal weed

3527
02:30:10,601 --> 02:30:16,271
before and doesn't necessarily know the

3528
02:30:13,360 --> 02:30:18,250
community the culture of the product the

3529
02:30:16,271 --> 02:30:20,290
clients like there's a lot you need to

3530
02:30:18,250 --> 02:30:21,940
know and you learn that when you start

3531
02:30:20,290 --> 02:30:23,650
as a budtender a trimmer it's a whole

3532
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:25,841
etiquette it's a whole world to be

3533
02:30:23,649 --> 02:30:28,239
involved in a buddy of mine started as a

3534
02:30:25,841 --> 02:30:30,011
trimmer in like six weeks later he was

3535
02:30:28,239 --> 02:30:31,271
running a trim crew for like seven

3536
02:30:30,011 --> 02:30:33,610
different dispensaries and they just

3537
02:30:31,271 --> 02:30:36,641
cycled between them as they harvested

3538
02:30:33,610 --> 02:30:39,400
shout-out to Linus yep shoutout - like

3539
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:41,079
he had a he struggles for a while find a

3540
02:30:39,399 --> 02:30:43,899
dispensary that would even take him on

3541
02:30:41,079 --> 02:30:46,000
as a trimmer and when he finally found

3542
02:30:43,899 --> 02:30:51,779
one he made sure to put it in his all

3543
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:51,780
and now he's running a big ass crew and

3544
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:57,520
they're killing it right now they've

3545
02:30:54,489 --> 02:31:03,670
done a good job I'm the same way we

3546
02:30:57,521 --> 02:31:05,409
moved up quick be motivated we're

3547
02:31:03,670 --> 02:31:06,940
growing so rapidly there are so many

3548
02:31:05,409 --> 02:31:10,030
people coming from around the world to

3549
02:31:06,940 --> 02:31:11,920
be in this industry that there are 50

3550
02:31:10,030 --> 02:31:14,771
people trying to take your job in this

3551
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:16,420
industry every [ __ ] day green and

3552
02:31:14,771 --> 02:31:19,030
healthy wellness is a small shop with a

3553
02:31:16,420 --> 02:31:20,440
small no small location we aren't very

3554
02:31:19,030 --> 02:31:21,610
well-known yet we're kind of new we

3555
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:22,989
don't have a large following I think

3556
02:31:21,610 --> 02:31:24,040
that's what I'm trying to say with a

3557
02:31:22,989 --> 02:31:27,399
whole bunch of words we don't have a

3558
02:31:24,040 --> 02:31:29,381
huge following but we get probably 5 to

3559
02:31:27,399 --> 02:31:31,170
10 applications every single day of

3560
02:31:29,380 --> 02:31:33,520
people that want to be growers trimmers

3561
02:31:31,170 --> 02:31:35,229
bud tenders whatever they can do they

3562
02:31:33,521 --> 02:31:37,659
like I will clean the toilets as long as

3563
02:31:35,229 --> 02:31:39,489
you give me a job in there yeah I see

3564
02:31:37,659 --> 02:31:41,440
some crazy I see a lot of people coming

3565
02:31:39,489 --> 02:31:43,869
in that are doing it right that are

3566
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:48,700
ready to work that know the industry and

3567
02:31:43,870 --> 02:31:50,170
know how to sell their place in it and a

3568
02:31:48,700 --> 02:31:51,490
lot of it comes down to like knowing how

3569
02:31:50,170 --> 02:31:54,460
to pitch your previous work experience

3570
02:31:51,489 --> 02:32:01,091
because I sold weed for my living room

3571
02:31:54,459 --> 02:32:03,659
for the last 10 years you did an episode

3572
02:32:01,091 --> 02:32:05,771
before the cover like some of the

3573
02:32:03,659 --> 02:32:07,899
resumes you got to grow and how

3574
02:32:05,771 --> 02:32:10,239
ridiculous some of them could get put

3575
02:32:07,899 --> 02:32:13,659
together real resume like if you don't

3576
02:32:10,239 --> 02:32:15,640
know what that is google it yeah be

3577
02:32:13,659 --> 02:32:18,341
prepared cuz there's a lot of people got

3578
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:20,529
in for the jobs that are available even

3579
02:32:18,341 --> 02:32:22,029
with this how fast were expanding

3580
02:32:20,529 --> 02:32:24,090
if you want to stand out at all you

3581
02:32:22,029 --> 02:32:26,738
gotta do all right now let's talk about

3582
02:32:24,090 --> 02:32:28,870
some of the problems that come with

3583
02:32:26,738 --> 02:32:31,238
getting a job working in the cannabis

3584
02:32:28,870 --> 02:32:34,569
industry the number one most obvious

3585
02:32:31,238 --> 02:32:38,049
problem to me is banking yep that's an

3586
02:32:34,568 --> 02:32:40,420
issue when you work at a dispensary or

3587
02:32:38,049 --> 02:32:42,309
as a grower and I can't speak for every

3588
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:43,870
shop or every grow and this is something

3589
02:32:42,309 --> 02:32:46,269
that I probably shouldn't say too much

3590
02:32:43,870 --> 02:32:50,109
about but this is the damn truth when

3591
02:32:46,270 --> 02:32:52,930
payday comes you get an envelope stuffed

3592
02:32:50,109 --> 02:32:53,439
with cash everything is done in cash it

3593
02:32:52,930 --> 02:32:55,450
sucks

3594
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:58,000
yeah you get a pay stub and taxes are

3595
02:32:55,450 --> 02:33:00,159
taken out and that you get is the same

3596
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:03,488
but instead of a check at the bottom or

3597
02:33:00,159 --> 02:33:05,189
better yet a voided check that tells you

3598
02:33:03,488 --> 02:33:09,068
about the direct deposit you just got

3599
02:33:05,189 --> 02:33:10,779
you get a check stub folded up with a

3600
02:33:09,068 --> 02:33:13,209
bunch of 20s in the middle a bunch of

3601
02:33:10,779 --> 02:33:14,979
[ __ ] yeah you carry all these damn

3602
02:33:13,209 --> 02:33:17,648
twenties in your backpackers somehow to

3603
02:33:14,978 --> 02:33:20,590
the car it's not just payroll it's

3604
02:33:17,648 --> 02:33:24,909
everything like state taxes federal

3605
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:26,228
taxes electric bills rent it's yes when

3606
02:33:24,909 --> 02:33:28,389
you get home you got to figure out a way

3607
02:33:26,228 --> 02:33:29,920
to convert all that cash into some way

3608
02:33:28,389 --> 02:33:33,010
to pay your rent so that is the obvious

3609
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:36,010
problem luckily employees can usually

3610
02:33:33,010 --> 02:33:38,139
get back accounts it's smaller banks no

3611
02:33:36,010 --> 02:33:39,398
problem it's the businesses that really

3612
02:33:38,139 --> 02:33:41,799
can't get accounts but you've still

3613
02:33:39,398 --> 02:33:43,568
gotta transfer cash to bank right right

3614
02:33:41,799 --> 02:33:48,299
you got and that cash came from a

3615
02:33:43,568 --> 02:33:48,299
dispensary sometimes it stinks like we

3616
02:33:50,549 --> 02:33:54,849
we have a mutual friend whose account

3617
02:33:53,170 --> 02:33:56,559
was just closed because their cash

3618
02:33:54,850 --> 02:34:02,109
deposits smelled way too much like

3619
02:33:56,559 --> 02:34:03,459
cannabis yeah also one of the problems

3620
02:34:02,109 --> 02:34:04,899
we've talked about this a little bit on

3621
02:34:03,459 --> 02:34:06,039
the podcast another problem that can

3622
02:34:04,898 --> 02:34:07,750
happen if you work in the cannabis

3623
02:34:06,040 --> 02:34:09,040
industry is you're gonna get pulled over

3624
02:34:07,750 --> 02:34:10,568
you're gonna smell like a pound of

3625
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:13,300
[ __ ] weed and the cops are gonna

3626
02:34:10,568 --> 02:34:14,769
harass you if you've got a badge a lot

3627
02:34:13,299 --> 02:34:16,478
of times they expect you to be a model

3628
02:34:14,770 --> 02:34:18,069
citizen because you've got the badge and

3629
02:34:16,478 --> 02:34:19,358
you know the rules is we're gonna be a

3630
02:34:18,068 --> 02:34:22,338
little more careful we're back to

3631
02:34:19,359 --> 02:34:24,350
putting your best foot forward like

3632
02:34:22,338 --> 02:34:27,078
don't stink like weed with your badge

3633
02:34:24,350 --> 02:34:28,640
last and also how because they're good

3634
02:34:27,078 --> 02:34:30,408
they're gonna as soon as they see that

3635
02:34:28,639 --> 02:34:32,328
[ __ ] or even the green lanyard that

3636
02:34:30,408 --> 02:34:34,609
goes with it they're automatically gonna

3637
02:34:32,328 --> 02:34:36,859
be thinking is this person high right

3638
02:34:34,609 --> 02:34:40,488
now behind the wheel do I have a DUI

3639
02:34:36,859 --> 02:34:44,328
arrest so don't be that person true also

3640
02:34:40,488 --> 02:34:46,128
renting is hard yeah hard when your

3641
02:34:44,328 --> 02:34:48,918
place of employment is green and healthy

3642
02:34:46,129 --> 02:34:50,569
wellness there's a stigma involved that

3643
02:34:48,918 --> 02:34:54,068
a lot of people don't realize I've got a

3644
02:34:50,568 --> 02:34:57,918
friend leaving the industry right now

3645
02:34:54,068 --> 02:35:00,559
and they were talking to me just this

3646
02:34:57,918 --> 02:35:03,010
afternoon that they're applying for jobs

3647
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:06,260
that aren't in the cannabis industry and

3648
02:35:03,010 --> 02:35:08,180
he's real hesitant because he hasn't

3649
02:35:06,260 --> 02:35:09,619
faced the company the drug tests in a

3650
02:35:08,180 --> 02:35:12,799
decade

3651
02:35:09,619 --> 02:35:16,279
he's a budtender and a cannabis consumer

3652
02:35:12,799 --> 02:35:19,220
and passionate about cannabis really

3653
02:35:16,279 --> 02:35:21,020
enjoys that aspect of his life and at

3654
02:35:19,219 --> 02:35:23,898
minimum he's gonna have to give it up

3655
02:35:21,020 --> 02:35:25,578
until we compete clean and he wasn't

3656
02:35:23,898 --> 02:35:28,128
except necessarily expecting to leave

3657
02:35:25,578 --> 02:35:31,878
the industry this abruptly so he's not

3658
02:35:28,129 --> 02:35:33,109
prepared for that and so at best his ass

3659
02:35:31,879 --> 02:35:35,209
is gonna be out of work for a while

3660
02:35:33,109 --> 02:35:39,260
while he looks for either jobs that

3661
02:35:35,209 --> 02:35:40,999
don't test or what not but he's extra

3662
02:35:39,260 --> 02:35:43,459
hesitant because as soon as they're like

3663
02:35:40,998 --> 02:35:44,838
well what do you just get stopped doing

3664
02:35:43,459 --> 02:35:46,699
and he's like well I'm working on

3665
02:35:44,838 --> 02:35:49,510
marijuana industry for three years and

3666
02:35:46,699 --> 02:35:52,248

3667
02:35:49,510 --> 02:35:53,238

they're gonna they're gonna be

3669
02:35:53,238 --> 02:35:57,378
judgmental for sure right so like even

3670
02:35:55,309 --> 02:35:59,088
if they don't typically drug test or

3671
02:35:57,379 --> 02:36:00,379
there's a lot of companies I work for a

3672
02:35:59,088 --> 02:36:03,289
bunch of them back in the day they just

3673
02:36:00,379 --> 02:36:04,909
threatened a drug test and the only drug

3674
02:36:03,289 --> 02:36:07,668
test they do is whether or not you show

3675
02:36:04,908 --> 02:36:09,318
up to get your cup they can't actually

3676
02:36:07,668 --> 02:36:12,680
afford to pay like the seventy five

3677
02:36:09,318 --> 02:36:14,448
bucks or whatever to test yeah yeah even

3678
02:36:12,680 --> 02:36:16,068
those companies are more apt to test

3679
02:36:14,449 --> 02:36:18,979
somebody who's coming out of the legal

3680
02:36:16,068 --> 02:36:23,350
weed industry it's just got that sense

3681

envelopes in the mail from credit

3689
02:36:46,029 --> 02:36:49,090
companies that declined my credit and

3690
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:51,430
when you look at why it says

3691
02:36:49,090 --> 02:36:53,020
insufficient employment and I make a

3692
02:36:51,430 --> 02:36:54,460
[ __ ] ton of money not to brag about my

3693
02:36:53,020 --> 02:36:56,920
money but I make plenty of [ __ ] money

3694
02:36:54,459 --> 02:36:57,969
for the car that I bought and they just

3695
02:36:56,920 --> 02:36:59,829
didn't like it that I worked at her

3696
02:36:57,969 --> 02:37:01,868
dispensary they would call me while I

3697
02:36:59,829 --> 02:37:03,520
was waiting in the Ford dealership to

3698
02:37:01,869 --> 02:37:04,449
buy my car they would call and they'd be

3699
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:07,210
like hey we've just got one question

3700

02:37:09,250 --> 02:37:15,988
to avoid questions for green and healthy

3703
02:37:11,738 --> 02:37:15,988
wellness like oh are you a weed grower

3704
02:37:20,309 --> 02:37:28,539
it's not the companies that don't apply

3705
02:37:26,770 --> 02:37:30,399
to this but like there's a statement

3706
02:37:28,540 --> 02:37:32,800
that you're gonna take on and you kinda

3707
02:37:30,398 --> 02:37:34,959
have to be ready to bear that cross it's

3708
02:37:32,799 --> 02:37:37,090
not just out in the world like plenty of

3709
02:37:34,959 --> 02:37:38,829
you got family that's like Oh [ __ ]

3710
02:37:37,090 --> 02:37:41,559
cousin Ricky working at the weed store

3711
02:37:38,829 --> 02:37:43,719
we should mention all the drug testing

3712
02:37:41,559 --> 02:37:45,398
talk the dispensary bond drug test you

3713
02:37:43,719 --> 02:37:46,139
noop don't worry but don't show up high

3714
02:37:45,398 --> 02:37:48,818
either

3715
02:37:46,139 --> 02:37:50,559
if there's too many [ __ ] rules to

3716
02:37:48,818 --> 02:37:51,908
come toast if we can't tell you're high

3717
02:37:50,559 --> 02:37:53,139
it's okay if we can tell you're high

3718
02:37:51,908 --> 02:37:59,799
you're in trouble don't be that high

3719
02:37:53,139 --> 02:38:02,978
[ __ ] problems working in the industry

3720
02:37:59,799 --> 02:38:05,398
our banking credit getting the car

3721
02:38:02,978 --> 02:38:07,658
getting a loan that kind of [ __ ] is hard

3722
02:38:05,398 --> 02:38:09,010
shout out to my friend Jessica I asked

3723
02:38:07,658 --> 02:38:11,590
her for guidance on this because she is

3724
02:38:09,010 --> 02:38:13,059
a manager in a dispensary she said the

3725
02:38:11,590 --> 02:38:15,309
first thing she spouted off what the

3726
02:38:13,059 --> 02:38:17,680
passion was [ __ ] sexism in the

3727
02:38:15,309 --> 02:38:19,478
cannabis industry this is she called it

3728
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:21,398
a boys club and said that this is ran by

3729
02:38:19,478 --> 02:38:22,929
guys and she's a woman and it's hard to

3730
02:38:21,398 --> 02:38:26,228
be taken [ __ ] seriously by all the

3731
02:38:22,930 --> 02:38:28,119
men in this industry so ladies ah

3732
02:38:26,228 --> 02:38:30,099
when you come to Colorado your chances

3733
02:38:28,119 --> 02:38:32,189
of getting a job are nearly tripled of

3734
02:38:30,100 --> 02:38:35,020
what a guy with the same qualifications

3735
02:38:32,189 --> 02:38:36,158
are going to have the chances of that

3736
02:38:35,020 --> 02:38:37,840
same dude are gonna have of getting

3737
02:38:36,158 --> 02:38:38,709
employment I know that sounds rude to

3738
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:40,000
say they don't

3739
02:38:38,709 --> 02:38:42,309
care what you'd look like if you're a

3740
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:45,280
trimmer for the most part but if you're

3741
02:38:42,309 --> 02:38:46,809
a budtender automatically hot females go

3742
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:48,370
to the top of the stack and that's kind

3743
02:38:46,809 --> 02:38:50,319
of true in any industry but it's really

3744
02:38:48,370 --> 02:38:52,150
true in the cannabis industry

3745
02:38:50,319 --> 02:38:55,389
unfortunately so you're gonna get hired

3746
02:38:52,149 --> 02:38:57,670
first at the same time everybody's gonna

3747
02:38:55,389 --> 02:38:59,829
look at your titties all [ __ ] day long

3748
02:38:57,670 --> 02:39:01,270
in the cannabis industry we are used to

3749
02:38:59,829 --> 02:39:02,920
growing weed in our basement we're used

3750
02:39:01,270 --> 02:39:06,819
to being a bunch of bros it's kind of a

3751
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:08,680
boys club we should know this by now but

3752
02:39:06,819 --> 02:39:10,930
the grow environment the weed business

3753
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:13,420
environment sometimes people forget and

3754
02:39:10,930 --> 02:39:16,750
it gets a little bit sexist a little bit

3755
02:39:13,420 --> 02:39:18,489
so yeah the rules the messes like kind

3756
02:39:16,750 --> 02:39:31,930
of apply to every other industry like

3757
02:39:18,489 --> 02:39:39,399
we're under so remind us myself after

3758
02:39:31,930 --> 02:39:41,050
one or two of those shout out to the

3759
02:39:39,399 --> 02:39:42,279
ladies that have taught us that there

3760
02:39:41,049 --> 02:39:44,849
are some sexism in the cannabis industry

3761
02:39:42,280 --> 02:39:47,739
be prepared for that a little bit

3762
02:39:44,850 --> 02:39:50,530
another huge problem you cannot consume

3763
02:39:47,739 --> 02:39:51,850
on site if you want to consume cannabis

3764
02:39:50,530 --> 02:39:53,229
while you're working at a medical

3765
02:39:51,850 --> 02:39:55,630
marijuana or a recreational marijuana

3766
02:39:53,228 --> 02:39:57,909
grow facility processing facility

3767
02:39:55,629 --> 02:40:00,159
anything like that you cannot do it

3768
02:39:57,909 --> 02:40:02,649
anywhere near the building you know go

3769
02:40:00,159 --> 02:40:05,260
somewhere else I don't care where you do

3770
02:40:02,649 --> 02:40:07,739
the cameras cannot see you people that

3771
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:07,739
are leaving

3772
02:40:08,219 --> 02:40:14,250
go far away consume your medicine some

3773
02:40:11,440 --> 02:40:21,250
more far away safely that goes for

3774
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:23,879
customers okay

3775
02:40:21,250 --> 02:40:26,469
don't do that get out of there also

3776
02:40:23,879 --> 02:40:28,119
something that I would mention is a pain

3777
02:40:26,469 --> 02:40:29,559
in the ass in the cannabis industry and

3778
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:33,130
you may think I'm crazy some people can

3779
02:40:29,559 --> 02:40:36,670
make glam but there is so much tedious

3780
02:40:33,129 --> 02:40:38,649
regulation and so much pressure they

3781
02:40:36,670 --> 02:40:42,280
were way overboard with the regulation

3782
02:40:38,649 --> 02:40:45,728
and like just I watch people every day

3783
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:47,989
grind up scraps of marijuana like stems

3784
02:40:45,728 --> 02:40:50,300
like [ __ ] that you wouldn't

3785
02:40:47,989 --> 02:40:52,640
even consider feeling bad about if you

3786
02:40:50,300 --> 02:40:54,020
threw away like it's just trash they

3787
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:55,161
have to grind it with coffee and

3788
02:40:54,021 --> 02:40:57,530
shredded paper to make it

3789
02:40:55,161 --> 02:40:59,841
indistinguishable and unusable yes like

3790
02:40:57,530 --> 02:41:04,070
and when that you translate that to a

3791
02:40:59,841 --> 02:41:05,601
major grow the amount of like just how

3792
02:41:04,069 --> 02:41:07,610
you throw out the trash because a

3793
02:41:05,601 --> 02:41:10,730
majorly complicated process that will

3794
02:41:07,610 --> 02:41:12,681
reduce ridiculous I run the the big row

3795
02:41:10,729 --> 02:41:16,550
we are harvesting eighty five lights

3796
02:41:12,681 --> 02:41:19,069
worth of plant right so what we do I

3797
02:41:16,550 --> 02:41:21,050
will start a trash can where the

3798
02:41:19,069 --> 02:41:22,640
trimmers are and I'll put I'll harvest

3799
02:41:21,050 --> 02:41:24,501
the plant and I will put that pot of

3800
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:25,819
dirt in the bottom of the can now

3801
02:41:24,501 --> 02:41:27,530
there's like a little bit of dirt in the

3802
02:41:25,819 --> 02:41:28,851
bottom and then as we trim the leaves

3803
02:41:27,530 --> 02:41:30,411
and a little bit of sticks will go in

3804
02:41:28,851 --> 02:41:32,751
and then I'll go harvest another plant

3805
02:41:30,411 --> 02:41:35,620
or maybe we've got old pots stacked up

3806
02:41:32,751 --> 02:41:41,390
and I'll pour some and it goes dirt

3807
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:43,609
leaves dirt leaves and the sweepings in

3808
02:41:41,390 --> 02:41:50,540
there but you got a mix up that weed the

3809
02:41:43,610 --> 02:41:53,989
weed recognisable which is also behind a

3810
02:41:50,540 --> 02:41:56,090
gate and we still have had our [ __ ]

3811
02:41:53,989 --> 02:41:58,040
trash broken into torn out of the

3812
02:41:56,091 --> 02:41:59,961
dumpster they tear the bags open and

3813
02:41:58,040 --> 02:42:01,310
they destroy all that and I gotta go

3814
02:41:59,960 --> 02:42:02,751
[ __ ] sweep it up and put the trash

3815
02:42:01,310 --> 02:42:06,351
back in the goddamn trash can in the

3816
02:42:02,751 --> 02:42:09,341
morning when I get there so the

3817
02:42:06,351 --> 02:42:11,391
regulations are ridiculous I have to

3818
02:42:09,341 --> 02:42:13,461
everything's gotta be weighed a million

3819
02:42:11,390 --> 02:42:15,350
times everything and there are checks on

3820
02:42:13,460 --> 02:42:17,210
things also so it's a little bit

3821
02:42:15,351 --> 02:42:18,371
stressful on all the regulation all the

3822
02:42:17,210 --> 02:42:21,081
pressure is crazy

3823
02:42:18,370 --> 02:42:23,210
things have to happen at a certain time

3824
02:42:21,081 --> 02:42:25,851
things have to be done quickly you can't

3825
02:42:23,210 --> 02:42:27,800
wait for some [ __ ] in a big grow and

3826
02:42:25,851 --> 02:42:29,360
you're on camera from 9000 different

3827
02:42:27,800 --> 02:42:31,279
angles so don't ever think you're gonna

3828
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:34,011
get away with anything the being on

3829
02:42:31,280 --> 02:42:35,931
camera on every square inch takes some

3830
02:42:34,011 --> 02:42:38,091
adjusting like I watch it all day at

3831
02:42:35,931 --> 02:42:39,649
work we forget there are camera or I

3832
02:42:38,091 --> 02:42:41,661
pointed out to customers like we're on

3833
02:42:39,649 --> 02:42:44,270
camera like we can see and hear

3834
02:42:41,661 --> 02:42:46,011
everything stop it hear everything you

3835
02:42:44,271 --> 02:42:47,900
try to get us in trouble like why it's

3836
02:42:46,011 --> 02:42:49,970
not [ __ ] asking how to take we just

3837
02:42:47,899 --> 02:42:51,831
axis look we can't answer you right yeah

3838
02:42:49,970 --> 02:42:53,899
stop asking how many views edibles which

3839
02:42:51,831 --> 02:42:55,671
you should eat is [ __ ] one and wait

3840
02:42:53,899 --> 02:42:57,020
two hours [ __ ] I told you twice they

3841
02:42:55,671 --> 02:42:59,870
get stressful

3842
02:42:57,021 --> 02:43:02,931
the rules always [ __ ] change I get

3843
02:42:59,870 --> 02:43:04,760
emails once a week with new rules rules

3844
02:43:02,931 --> 02:43:06,739
there's a special company that makes law

3845
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:09,560
books and they're on there like third

3846
02:43:06,739 --> 02:43:11,090
marijuana book now Wow like you have to

3847
02:43:09,560 --> 02:43:13,399
buy the original book and then the two

3848
02:43:11,090 --> 02:43:15,049
addendum books so that's uh that's most

3849
02:43:13,399 --> 02:43:16,970
of what I've got that's stressful but

3850
02:43:15,049 --> 02:43:20,000
one thing that might can testify to

3851
02:43:16,970 --> 02:43:23,119
because he's a budtender mostly now the

3852
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:26,299
consumer is so educated that they expect

3853
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:27,110
a bud and and foe educated they think

3854
02:43:26,299 --> 02:43:29,000
they know what the [ __ ] they're talking

3855
02:43:27,110 --> 02:43:31,400
about that they expected but I hear the

3856
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:35,360
phrase out of a lot and I hear good to

3857
02:43:31,399 --> 02:43:38,420
go even more oh it's a good and a bad

3858
02:43:35,360 --> 02:43:40,940
thing I'm blessed to be in the the

3859
02:43:38,420 --> 02:43:43,760
medical side of things I get a lot of

3860
02:43:40,940 --> 02:43:45,681
that too but honestly I see kind of a

3861
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:48,079
truce a more touristy side of it and

3862
02:43:45,681 --> 02:43:49,909
honestly they just haven't had the the

3863
02:43:48,079 --> 02:43:51,709
culture of the community out loud and

3864
02:43:49,909 --> 02:43:54,590
proud like we have here in Colorado like

3865
02:43:51,709 --> 02:43:59,569
down in Texas in Arkansas for as long

3866
02:43:54,590 --> 02:44:01,670
the like you can really tell who who's

3867
02:43:59,569 --> 02:44:03,860
been in the community actively who

3868
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:06,200
hasn't who's been like a marijuana

3869
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:08,210
consumer in the total shadows like most

3870
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:09,590
of their friends don't know they

3871
02:44:08,209 --> 02:44:11,619
definitely wouldn't talk about it in

3872
02:44:09,590 --> 02:44:14,271
public or on the news around the radio

3873
02:44:11,620 --> 02:44:16,460
so they've never heard anyone say sativa

3874
02:44:14,271 --> 02:44:18,620
before or indica it's just never

3875
02:44:16,459 --> 02:44:20,569
happened they've only ever read it and

3876
02:44:18,620 --> 02:44:22,070
just thinking about that kind of boggles

3877
02:44:20,569 --> 02:44:23,750
my mind a little bit so I try to pay

3878
02:44:22,069 --> 02:44:25,220
them a little bit but a [ __ ] when I

3879
02:44:23,750 --> 02:44:26,601
hear for like the 14th time on a

3880
02:44:25,220 --> 02:44:31,909
Saturday makes me want a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3881
02:44:26,601 --> 02:44:34,579
punch somebody but I saw the same thing

3882
02:44:31,909 --> 02:44:36,140
in the wine world like so it exists

3883
02:44:34,579 --> 02:44:39,129
other places people think they know a

3884
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:41,270
lot and they acts naughty it's funny I

3885
02:44:39,129 --> 02:44:43,220
love the dispensary where the budtender

3886
02:44:41,271 --> 02:44:44,750
knows [ __ ] everything it makes you

3887
02:44:43,220 --> 02:44:47,779
feel stupid and doesn't realize that I'm

3888
02:44:44,750 --> 02:44:49,521
a breeder right like I love it when

3889
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:51,681
they're wrong I was gonna shop the other

3890
02:44:49,521 --> 02:44:53,450
day in Denver and I heard wrong

3891
02:44:51,681 --> 02:44:55,040
information there was a strain labeled

3892
02:44:53,450 --> 02:44:56,690
wrong and I listened to the button or go

3893
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:58,641
on for like four minutes about how it

3894
02:44:56,690 --> 02:45:00,140
was an indica wasn't really popular

3895
02:44:58,640 --> 02:45:01,970
sativa and I'm just sitting there

3896
02:45:00,140 --> 02:45:04,190
shaking my head as the customer gobbles

3897
02:45:01,970 --> 02:45:06,079
it up and I'm like dude look at the buds

3898
02:45:04,190 --> 02:45:07,521
like I can tell that's a [ __ ] sativa

3899
02:45:06,079 --> 02:45:08,060
just by the way the buds are growing

3900
02:45:07,521 --> 02:45:11,271
damn

3901
02:45:08,060 --> 02:45:13,029
