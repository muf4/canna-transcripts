hammered out in meetings that i somehow

269
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,479

it got like we invented it here so mike

273
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,720
was coming to me and saying hey bro this

274
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,799
is the grow rule they are uh what's it

275
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,399
proposing they want to do this how do

276
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,479
you feel what is the good and bad of

277
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,399
that and i would say oh that would ruin

278
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,759
this because of this or a lot of times

279
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,440
they would try to say that each plant is

280
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,958
going to harvest seven pounds and take

281
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,640
30 gallons of water a day and you can

282
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,919
pull seven of them a week

283
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,519
and mike would say give me the real

284
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,278
numbers and i would give him like square

285
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,879
footage per light how many grams i would

286
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,000
expect and he would take that to the

287
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,759
people that were actually making the

288
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,559
rules and say i know a grower this is

289
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,759
what he really does and so mike was

290
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,518
i wasn't going to go there and say i

291

the time dude i had that white van that

322

the doors didn't lock that would come

323
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,720
open when you turn it it would run out

324
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,240
of gas because the gas gauge didn't work

325
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160

326
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,079
sections the engine would just die and

327
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,600
make me [ __ ] my pants yeah oops ran out

328
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,439
of gas dude why didn't you get gas oh

329
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,120
the gas gauge doesn't work so yeah those

330
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,360
that used to be how our life is and now

331
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,159
i know my car will start we built it up

332
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,480
slow and a lot of that was

333
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,799
we carved out a place for ourselves in

334
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,959
in the legal cannabis world a big part

335
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,719
of how we create the legal cannabis

336
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,799
world to carve ourselves a piece out of

337
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,200
there and we didn't [ __ ] anybody over

338
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,439
yep that's a huge part of it we took a

339
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,000
couple of individual [ __ ] and a

340
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,839
group [ __ ] uh but we didn't [ __ ]

341
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,600
anybody over probably we still have the

342
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,519
opportunity but we're not gonna there's

343
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
plenty of us just why do business that

344
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,879
way yeah that's part of why why i think

345
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,120
we got where we did because we didn't

346
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,958
[ __ ] the people that needed it or that

347
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,278
could have right yeah we just took in

348
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,559
stride and laughed and walked away and

349
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,240
told other people i wouldn't [ __ ] with

350
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,359
them because they they bent us over

351
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,000
pretty good

352
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,879
ah but yeah so uh mike let's focus in a

353
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,039
little bit because uh we did go from we

354
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,480
we were not doing financially well like

355
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,199
i remember your house on eighth street

356
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,879
dude oh yeah it's uh

357
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,839
yeah there was a minute where we were

358
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,759
living with in-laws and there were like

359
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,800
five adults in this tiny little three

360
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,639
room

361
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,799
spot for a minute while we got everybody

362
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,120
back on their feet and

363
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,519
um that was back before there was a

364
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,200
legal cannabis market right

365
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,560
that was back when i was walking to city

366
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,278
council meetings because i didn't have a

367
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,958
car because we were a one-car household

368
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,000
and my wife had a better job so she got

369
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,000
the car

370
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,278
um and i walked because it was i wasn't

371
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,958
getting paid i was just going to city

372
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,799
council because somebody needed to go to

373
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,679
city council

374
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,759
and i could i uh

375
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,919
i talk about it sometimes on patreon and

376
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,399
other places

377
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,639
for a couple of different reasons uh if

378
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,759
you went and spoke about cannabis

379
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,360
uh

380
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,799
you had to have nothing to lose because

381
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,000
you were risking kind of everything

382
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,359
doing it

383
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,519
and some of that started to change when

384
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,120
i was going i was risking a lot but i

385
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,159
wasn't risking like what cheech and

386
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,839
chong were risking being them back then

387
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,480
and

388
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,399
uh after a while it sort of like a

389
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,320
little protective thing formed because

390
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,240
all of the police knew me and they knew

391
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,120
that i was active in city council and

392
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,879
that

393
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,560
if they came and

394
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,000
tried to raid my house or something that

395
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,599
would make the paper and so that

396
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,639
everything would have to be perfect so

397
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,320
they just never bothered to try

398
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,320
and i never gave them a reason to try i

399
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,639
had to be very very careful

400
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,399
but because i was careful and because

401
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,919
everything worked the way it did

402
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,360
this whole city is different now and

403
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,199
that's sort of what the episode's about

404
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,519
is where the city started and where it

405
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,600
is now yeah that's completely good segue

406
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
brother um you like the segway we're

407
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
trying to bring it in you got it dude i

408
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,320
was quiet and patient letting you do it

409
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
i knew it was coming uh we're called

410
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,600
pueblo is called the steel city uh we

411
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,360
have a steel mill here that's what

412
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,519
forged our city a long time ago we had

413
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,919
the opportunity to either get uh the

414
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,679
university or the steel mill and instead

415
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,679
of a university we chose a steel mill

416
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,199
and so uh that is kind of the mentality

417
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,559
that has been here for a long time no

418
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,959
offense to the people that forged our

419
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,078
city it exists because of you but

420
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,198
it was very

421
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,879
it was like 60 some thousand jobs at one

422
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,799
point and

423
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,958
by the time i moved to pueblo it was

424
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,958
like 5 000.

425
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,879
so just i mean the city was hurting bad

426
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,119
it was 2010. it was dusty it was dirty

427
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,720
it was broke there was nowhere to eat uh

428
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,198
it's still a little funky but it's

429
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,278
getting a lot better now i used to be

430
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,278
just all labor jobs if you were our age

431
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,278
well not our age now but if you're in

432
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,320
the mid-20s 30 you were doing

433
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,639
construction or fast food or crime a lot

434
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,720
of people legit straight up here

435
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,399
we're doing petty crimes just enough to

436
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,320
get away just to survive and there's not

437
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,839
enough law enforcement here to make that

438
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,199
uh dangerous you could do that here and

439
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,800
make a small living doing that don't

440
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,159
come here and try to do that but that's

441
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,919
how you used to live here now all those

442
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,198
people that were living by petty crime

443
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,039
restaurants struggling unemployment uh

444
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,879
just doing whatever kind of hustles a

445
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,240
lot of them got legit jobs in the

446
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,159
cannabis industry a lot of people were

447
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,399
illegal growers illegal dealers illegal

448
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,319
whatevers now they are actually in the

449
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,320
legal industry paying taxes with the

450
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,320
badge being contributing members to

451
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,199
society not having to hide not being in

452
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,560
fear

453
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:45,838
now that's one less person for law

454
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,198
enforcement to look out for so we've

455
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,399
come a long way

456
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,559
and we've got

457
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,559
restaurants here bro

458
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,039
watching the city transform has been fun

459
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,638
isn't it it uh

460
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,639
the whole place used to shut down at

461
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,759
like 7 30 at night he used to drive me

462

batty because i'm from denver i grew up

463
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,319

464
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,958
20s and mid-20s in denver

465
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,879

466
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,399
of delicious food at two in the morning

467
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,639
and to move to pueblo and have that not

468
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,278
be an option sucked yeah i'm from

469

30 at night is jack-in-the-box or

471
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,639
something you cook that's just miserable

472
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,559
and

473
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,278
slowly but surely

474
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,119
over the years pueblo's gotten like five

475
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,120

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,839
vegetarian menus and items and meals and

492
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,278
it's got the v on it or the little

493
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,199
vegetable next to it to let me know hey

494
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,198
bro you can eat this here a few years

495
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,679
ago that wasn't an option you could get

496
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,519
mexican food or a burger and or a burger

497
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,439
with green chili on it that was also an

498
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,399
option here yep yeah

499
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,440
so

500
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,879
i i mean even our mall is dying slower

501
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,920
than the rest of them because uh legal

502
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,278
cannabis

503
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,599
our city council and our less so

504
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,278
but the county commissioners saw the

505
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,560
opening that that that would give

506
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:33,838
economically and they dove on it hard

507
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:36,319
and uh we're still i think it was fifth

508
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,440
or sixth largest producing county in the

509
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,759
state

510
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,440
um tax revenue wise so

511
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,639
pueblo's doing really well right now

512
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,000
because of this

513
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,919
and people do like to talk a lot of

514
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,120
trash about us but we're growing we're

515
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,198
expanding it's getting a weird

516
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,278
reputation well there are parts of their

517
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,719
parts of town i will not wear my watch

518
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,879
to that is for damn sure but there's

519
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,959
parts of that part of town

520
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,559
where you don't work where the drip yeah

521
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,919
you take the watch off and you hide the

522
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,679
sneakers and you just don't get out the

523
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,958
[ __ ] car but that's there's that part

524
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,359
in every city it's just you got to be

525
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,480
careful where you go uh but it's getting

526
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,639
better and we're getting a lot more

527
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,038
stores speaking of the drip uh there's a

528
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,000
sneaker shop here now i was shocked when

529
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,400
you're like there's a really good

530
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,919
sneaker shop in pueblo yes myself

531
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,839
like high-end hoodies and high-end

532
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,240
sneakers and like fashion stuff like

533
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:22,399
luxury fashion items that are not super

534
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,480
affordable for the average shopper but

535
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
since we've got a nice thriving economy

536
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,240
here a lot of the people that shop there

537
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,679
honestly are in the cannabis industry i

538
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,798
recognize them we see each other when

539
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,120
we're there it's like what's up bro you

540
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,798
run that run grow like we we all smell

541
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,239
like dank when we go in there like and

542
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,679
that's because of this industry we

543
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,679
wouldn't have no drip to drip if we

544
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,000
weren't working at the grows

545
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,840
it's uh

546
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,759
the impact it had in pueblo we've got

547
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,359
one of the higher unemployment rates in

548
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,400
town and this sort of jeff was talking

549
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,599
about

550
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
it

551
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,798
it added jobs at exactly the right

552
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,559
moment and it added

553
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,519
building investment and real estate

554
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:03,038
investment into just the right moments

555
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:05,839
and really revitalize the whole county i

556
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,679
mean it's not like a lot of winning it

557
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,519
it didn't change everything overnight

558
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,519
our streets aren't paved in gold most of

559
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,720
them still are full of potholes

560
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,000
but

561
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,558
little things got better and it gets a

562
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,558
little bit better every year because the

563
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,759
whole industry gets a little bit bigger

564
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,759
every year

565
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,919
so like the first year

566
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,359
we paved a couple of sidewalks near some

567
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,559
middle schools

568
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,159
and bought some golf carts for a

569
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,720
golf course

570
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,600
that a lot of senior citizens in this

571
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,640
area use so it was sort of like a senior

572
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,918
citizen tax funded thing i wasn't real

573
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,559
happy they were spending money on golf

574
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,480
carts but whatever it's an old grudge

575
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,160
and then you know three years later

576
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,319
we're not doing sidewalks in front of

577
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,440
schools we're doing a gymnasium on a

578
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,439
school

579
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,640
and then uh five thousand dollars in

580
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,798
scholarships becomes 15 and then 20 and

581
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,559
now it's at like 2 million a year i

582
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,480
think 2 million

583
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,678
a year in scholarships going into pueblo

584
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,160
county

585
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,840
good job pueblo county anybody can apply

586
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,720
if they meet some really basic

587
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:11,678
criteria and

588
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,960
uh

589
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,960
i mean

590
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,880
it doesn't sound like a ton of money per

591
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,558
student but like twenty five hundred

592
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,960
dollars a year can be the difference

593
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,720
between going and not going oh yeah and

594
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,319
pay for your books right yeah it turns

595
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,319
out that it is for a lot of people

596
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,399
especially because the universities down

597
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,000
here in pueblo don't charge

598
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,679
what some of the major universities

599
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,279
elsewhere do but they

600
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,679
they give you a good education and this

601
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,279
lets a lot of kids locally go to college

602
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,880
that might not otherwise it's

603
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,558
opportunity that wasn't there so yeah

604
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
that's great man that's great that's

605
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:42,960
good to know that we're putting that

606
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,359
much money back into education here

607
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,079
through cannabis and that's just pueblo

608
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,279
county that's from a local tax

609
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,119
initiative

610
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,879
that's not some of the state taxes that

611
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,959
we'll talk about a little bit later

612
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,039
that's just from a local county tax that

613
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,319
they do it all goes into one education

614
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,079
fund

615
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,200
someone we know from the cannabis

616
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,599
industry

617
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,400
that used to work at the retail level

618
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,719
now works in that education fund

619
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,600
that's so great it's it just provided

620
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,679
that

621
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,000
employment stepping stone and that

622
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,880
little bit of extra lifeblood that our

623
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
city needed to get back on its feet

624
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,440
so many of our people here were

625
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,119
unemployed and lost and now they've all

626
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,200
got really cool jobs because of this

627
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,798
industry so i've met so many cool people

628
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,558
that's the next thing on my list is the

629
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,440
people bro the quality

630
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,879
of the people has changed here in town

631
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,720
and it's a more

632
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,960
uh it's just a more enlightened more

633
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,159
open-minded maybe a younger sort of a

634
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,919
vibe

635
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,320
when i moved here

636
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,840
the biggest issue that the city council

637
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,480
was talking about was how do we get

638
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,720
not senior citizens to move here

639
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,279
because it was sort of a retirement

640
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,640
community because we just didn't have

641
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:57,119
a lot of jobs for your average

642
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,440
like 20 to 50 year old

643
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:03,119
we had a couple of call centers and a

644
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,600
couple of other small time you know 50

645
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,359
job 100 job production facilities and

646
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,038
then the mill had like five or six

647
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,199
thousand employees

648
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:14,480
and that was sort of it

649
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,720
and little by little

650
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,880
this industry slowly grew like we

651
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,360
watched it back in the medical only days

652
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,039
before the wreck wave of funding and

653
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,279
money really hit

654
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,119
all of the grow shops first there was

655
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,480
two hydroponic shops in town and they

656
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,479
both sucked

657
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,000
and then they both got a lot better

658
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,480
because there was a lot more money going

659
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,519
through them yep and now there's like

660
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,558
15. there's three or four on each side

661
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,279
right and

662
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,839
they all suck but

663
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:46,000
but most of them are thriving because

664
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,918
growing at home a couple of plants is

665
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,240
something that a lot of people do and

666
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,520
they all need all the supplies for that

667
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,798
and

668
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:57,359
yeah just the different ways

669
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,119
that legalization has impacted the city

670
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,519
are kind of ridiculous the longer you

671
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,719
think about it the more impacts you see

672
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,960
right um

673
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,240
and then when the wreck wave hit

674
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,079
it was

675
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,839
50 of our construction funding for on my

676
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:16,079
list that's one of the things on my list

677
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:18,798
is construction i think it was 2013.

678
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:21,839
it was like 52 million

679
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,279
um and i know these because in 2015 the

680
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,720
anti-pop people tried to throw the

681
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,038
industry out of town and i had a lot of

682
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,400
other people do the data digging for me

683
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,279
and i just remember the numbers from

684
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,640
then

685
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,599
but uh

686
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,000
uh we had 1300 employees back then it's

687
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,759
about 2500 now

688
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,640
um

689
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,640
there's 30 or 40 different businesses

690
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,679
down here that employ thousands of

691
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,840
people

692
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,320
across the state there's like 40 000

693
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,079
employees across the state 40 000 all

694
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,439
right i can give you exact numbers i

695
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,399
wrote those down

696
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,279
so this is fun before the pandemic

697
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,200
we had 40

698
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,359
267 individuals licensed to work in

699
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,279
legal cannabis you have to have an

700
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,279
employment badge so we know exactly how

701
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,038
many of those are active okay and there

702
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,079
were

703
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:12,240
1686 businesses currently uh two years

704
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,240
into it we've got forty one thousand

705
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,079
seven hundred and eighty three

706
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,519
uh so a thousand fifteen hundred more

707
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,199
badged people

708
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,679
and eighteen hundred and eighty

709
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
businesses so 200 businesses opened

710
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,880
during the pandemic

711
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,919
all right things weren't as bad as we

712
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,240
might have thought

713
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,919
not for the cannabis industry it's i get

714
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,519
i wouldn't call it recession-proof but

715
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,200
it's recession-proof just like all the

716
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,200
other mild vice industries when you're

717
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,960
stuck at home and can't see people what

718
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,880
smoking hang out

719
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,720
yeah sales have gone up every year

720
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,600
colorado's had the industry not

721
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,679
substantially but they do

722
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,519
if you're curious it works out to about

723
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,320
355

724
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,240
bucks per person in the states i started

725
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,240
to do the math and gave up i was like

726
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,519
i'm good so

727
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,278
uh the way you can do the math

728
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,839
um

729
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,079
is you just take the yearly sales and

730
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,879
divide it by

731
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:10,240
575 or 5 million 759 000 people in

732
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,159
colorado

733
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,519
um i think i [ __ ] this math up

734
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,278
actually

735
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,720
somebody out there will correct you if i

736
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,558
remember right i might have done the

737
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,480
total tax haul

738
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,798
divided by

739
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,798
the people in the state it would be 355

740
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,798
dollars per person in the states so far

741
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,400
after like seven years

742
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,918
which is a weird way that's not a

743
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,679
helpful number

744
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,278
still fun you don't get while you do

745
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,640
your research folks hey you didn't have

746
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,000
a lot of time to prepare mike so i'm

747
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,278
glad that you that you made a guy shout

748
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,440
out tonight for me

749
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,798
but there was some scrambling today so

750
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,080
i'm going to go fast because we're

751
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,240
already i wrote down here mike if you

752
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,439
see me making check marks this is 30 45

753
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,880
and 60 that's how many minutes we've

754
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,278
been going just to politely let you know

755
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,360
where we are we're almost to this point

756
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:52,640
um so you've covered this i just wanted

757
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,558
to say uh there are a lot of cool

758
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,120
ancillary businesses that did open head

759
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,558
shops restaurants sneaker shops clothing

760
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,479
places the mall is staying alive just

761
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,918
like the ripple effect is intense

762
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,440
because

763
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,880
like there's the the grows the

764
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,880
transport people

765
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,679
the retail outlets

766
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,480
and then there's the hashmakers of the

767
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,480
processors the edible companies all of

768
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,558
those people need packaging all of those

769
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,240
people need labeling all of those people

770
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,759
need light bulbs

771
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,640
all of those people need plumbers and

772
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,558
electricians and bankers and lawyers

773
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,880
and business executives

774
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,200
yeah all of those people need lunch

775
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,520
um you know all those people need tires

776
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,919
on their cars dude how about so there's

777
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,400
a small subdivision uh west of us

778
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,799
ironically it's called pueblo west out

779
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,720
there in pueblo west there are there are

780
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,639
a lot of groves and a several

781
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,839
dispensaries out there uh there was

782
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,919
nothing to eat out there there are a few

783
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,359
there's like a thai restaurant and some

784
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,919
other [ __ ] this is a thai food place and

785
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,119
a wendy's yeah he's really right unless

786
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,480
you've got all day then you can go to

787
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,558
sonic but that who wants to do that

788
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,558
shout out to not eating sonic uh

789
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,639
eventually a bunch of food trucks popped

790
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,480
up out there and it from like 11 to

791
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,880
about 2 o'clock it looked like a food

792
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,159
truck fair and they were banking money

793
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,600
because you'd see the whole trim crew

794
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,120
out there just lined up and they'd all

795
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,798
be and they'd come back and hold their

796
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,239
gut be like bro that barbecue place is

797
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:13,679
fire tomorrow we're going to the chicken

798
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,919
wing place and the next day we're having

799
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,600
falafel and like those barbecue trucks

800
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,360
and uh food trucks were killing it out

801
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,359
there so that was a whole other business

802
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,199
just because of the business that was

803
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:26,719
out there it's

804
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,558
it's been fun watching it grow and

805
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,200
when it started there was that whole

806
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:34,798
area was just empty warehouses yeah and

807
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,880
now it's all thriving businesses with 5

808
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,319
10 15 employees each all those people

809
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,480
need lunch all the security guards

810
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,079
the gas stations are busy try to go at

811
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,159
lunch and get like something from the

812
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,558
gas station and you got to wait in line

813
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,320
crews out there yeah the traffic on that

814
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,000
area is nuts and it used to be empty

815
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,918
because there were no jobs out there so

816
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,079
the only traffic was at night with

817
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,000
people coming back into town

818
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,759
and now it's swamp all day because

819
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,079
there's just a ton of people out there

820
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,319
do you know the average age of the

821
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,158
people working in the cannabis industry

822
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,720
no okay i just wonder if you have that

823
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,679
because i would assume it's mostly like

824
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,120
24 to like 35s

825
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,640
and then you're gonna have a few you

826
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,439
know there's gonna be some some outliers

827
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,200
but then you're gonna have like

828
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,759
management and stuff is gonna be like 40

829
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,399
to 50 year olds this is sort of

830
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,640
researchable information the state of

831
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,038
colorado one of the things we did right

832
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,000
from the get-go was trying to collect

833
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:29,759
data

834
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,759
and so you can go on the colorado

835
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,200
department of revenue website and just

836
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,879
google is your friend

837
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,519
just ask google questions you want to

838
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,039
know and it'll it it was real easy to

839
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,079
find the number of people that have

840
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,319
badges

841
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,879
the number of business licenses

842
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,558
you can look up who got fined last year

843
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,960
they make that real easy to find you can

844
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,918
look up taxes by county

845
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,558
they've even got a real uh a tab that

846
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,559
makes graphs for you and you can do pie

847
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,240
charts or bar charts and look at taxes

848
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,319
oh that's too fun that's why i know that

849
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,038
pueblo was like the sixth i didn't have

850
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,720
time to sit there and add up all the

851
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,240
numbers

852
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,240
because you asked me if i could figure

853
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,960
out the percentage of marijuana grown in

854
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,519
colorado that comes from pueblo yeah and

855
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,360
technically i know how to do that and i

856
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,000
know where to get the info but it's

857
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,879
hours and hours and hours worth of work

858
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,480
until i find a way to make it easier and

859
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,520
i'm sure smarter people already know

860
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,278
that way

861
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,240
but with the data that's available to me

862
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:31,278
i would have had to go for to

863
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,319
january 1st 2014

864
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:37,519
and just write down um how much pueblo

865
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,678
paid in taxes and hit plus

866
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,759
and go forward a month at a time to

867
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,759
present day and then just

868
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,398
do the math because the the totals are

869
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,319
there

870
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,798
but it's easy to find

871
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,839
somebody somebody get on it start typing

872
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:51,759
i want to know

873
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,678
what percentage of the legal cannabis

874
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,839
produced in colorado is produced in

875
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,200
pueblo if it's recreational or medical

876
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,959
so there's a hundred percent of cannabis

877
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,679
produced in colorado what percentage is

878
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,319
made here in pueblo count uh a city or

879
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,159
county uh recreational or medical one of

880
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,079
my daily counties the number one way to

881
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,240
let you break it down okay because it's

882
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,759
broken down by county and no one outside

883
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,759
of pueblo county understands that the

884
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,240
city of pueblo and the cit the county of

885
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,919
pueblo are different entities yeah i

886
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,240
tried to explain that to city government

887
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,278
and they got kind of pissy about it

888
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,720
um

889
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,119
but uh

890
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,480
this you can figure it out by county

891
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:31,839
we're only 160 000 people down here

892
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,880
and puts the state of colorado's 5.75

893
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,759
million

894
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,679
so 160 000 is not that many people our

895
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,558
city's not that big

896
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,159
and we're we're the fifth fourth fifth

897
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:43,759
or sixth i think it's the fifth largest

898
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,960
producer in the state

899
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,519
so

900
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,480
we're supplying all kinds area around

901
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,918
town around the state that uh

902
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,519
either can't grow their own or can't

903
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,120
grow enough of their own

904
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,319
yeah everybody says go down to pueblo

905
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,079
and get some herbs down there that's

906
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,278
what it's a whole commercial market

907
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,359
knows you're gonna stop down here and

908
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,398
get some pounds for a while if you're in

909
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,439
the commercial market you guys don't

910
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,199
think you're just driving here to get

911
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,840
pounds that's not it's not

912
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,519
we might still be the only county in

913
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,079
pueblo where it's legal for a business

914
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,759
to grow outdoors

915
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,359
i know that was true for a while i

916
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,119
haven't been super on top of other

917
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,199
county's law changes for the last little

918
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,719
bit so somebody might have squeaked that

919
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,159
one in there but i think we're still the

920
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,319
only county where that's legal in

921
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,320
colorado which is sort of insane when

922
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,158
you think about it but

923
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,119
the other counties are dumb and pueblo

924
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,200
week reaps the windfall

925
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,439
unfortunately for a while

926
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,399
the anti-pop people and the powers that

927
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,320
be have a moratorium on new businesses

928
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,079
so we're sort of capped at where we are

929
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,960
right now but

930
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,639
um for a long time it was a boom here

931
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,278
and if you don't have legal pot in your

932
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,278
area by all means use this podcast to

933
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:52,798
help argue for a legal pot in your area

934
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,038
yeah pay off a lot of the debts in your

935
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,278
town fix the roads fund some schools get

936
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,839
some kids some scholarships

937
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,240
the moratorium here doesn't bother me um

938
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,319
there is plenty of cannabis available

939
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,000
plenty of cannabis businesses it's it's

940
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:10,798
fine we don't need more uh it's okay

941
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,278
um for now it uh when it goes legal

942
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,359
nationally it it'll hurt us

943
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,759
right now it might be helping

944
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,639
but uh the rest of the planet needs our

945
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,038
herb

946
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,720
and i love that we need to expand enough

947
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,599
to provide that growth enough for the

948
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,880
whole planet um or just get everybody

949
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,278

did the math in my head but since i

986
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,319
don't anymore i went back and did the

987
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,000
math in my head and i just chuckle

988
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,398
um

989
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,440
especially when i do the math and i

990
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,359
pretend like it's the year 2000

991
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,278
uh when it was 400 announced was just

992
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,359
the friend price yeah

993
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,079
um letting you know letting you shop

994
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,038
here was was the friend discount

995
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,240
yeah

996
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,839
um we've made businesses

997
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,159
multi money

998
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,839
yeah yeah rivers literally of money

999
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,840
rivers and rivers and we got paid small

1000
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,839
streams the analogy i used to get the

1001
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,199
city to finally allow businesses was i

1002
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,519
kept telling them there's a river of

1003
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,759
money flowing right around the city

1004
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,679
because the county was dove in with both

1005
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,919
feasts when this started oh yeah there

1006
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,080
were a city tiptoed in back in the day i

1007
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,759
had to drive either 15 that way or 15

1008
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,000
that way to get out of city limits to be

1009
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,558
able to go buy medical cannabis and then

1010
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,759
um we bro we put one right in the middle

1011
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:37,759
of the [ __ ]

1012
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,359
downtown big shout out to tom and karen

1013
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:40,879
for trusting us and having faith in us

1014
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,678
to run that business

1015
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,799
uh one day i told tom i forget the words

1016
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,080
that i used i basically told him i

1017
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:47,359
didn't really know how to run a business

1018
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,798
i think i said it more politely than

1019
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,959
that because i did respect him you need

1020
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,879
help and he reached across the counter

1021

and he gave me keys and he said do it

1022
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,399

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,679
anything that you'd like to add to this

1031
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,039
show because honestly we've gone through

1032
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,398
most of the notes that i've got there's

1033
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:13,679
no reason to backtrack on the things

1034
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,000
i've got here

1035
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,000
um

1036
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,679
just

1037
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:20,639
not to put a damper on it but to put

1038
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,200
some

1039
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,240
perspective on it

1040
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,878
colorado state's total budget is like 30

1041
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,759
to 40 billion a year

1042
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:33,838
so far to date our total cannabis tax

1043
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,159
hall just broke 2 billion which is a

1044
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,519
huge record that's two billion dollars

1045
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,919
with the awesome stuff we couldn't have

1046
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,358
done before that we got to do now

1047
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,319
because of this

1048
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:47,279
but it's like half a percent or one

1049
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,399
percent maybe of a year a state's yearly

1050
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
budget

1051
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:50,559
so

1052
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,720
like it's not

1053
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,799
it's really not a lotto ticket but it's

1054
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:58,559
a hundred percent a lifeline

1055
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,240
and for our city 100 it saved us like i

1056
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,358
can't even imagine what pueblo would be

1057
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,279
like now

1058
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,199
if this wouldn't happen i wouldn't be

1059
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,200
here um

1060
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,960
it got us

1061
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,039
national press

1062
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,599
it brought in

1063
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:17,599
a lot of people moved here that were

1064
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,359
like in their 20s and 30s um

1065
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,200
the boom for

1066
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:22,719
the construction industry was hit so

1067
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,358
hard back then

1068
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:27,199
and the way that this really revitalized

1069
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,719
pueblo has been awesome

1070
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,480
and getting to see it all firsthand has

1071
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:35,039
been a lot of fun

1072
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,440

1080
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,320
meeting that i was i was randomly

1081
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,239
approached after a city council meeting

1082
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,519
to attend a meeting about a specific

1083
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,598
rule

1084
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,280
and other people

1085
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,760
officially were invited they didn't know

1086
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,040
how to make the rule and how to craft it

1087
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,040
and so

1088
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,358
i show up to this meeting

1089
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,039
and i'm early and excited

1090
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,719
because i'm being included finally and

1091
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,159
i'm not kicking and screaming at a wall

1092
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:15,279
is what it felt like for a lot of the

1093
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,838
work

1094
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,599
and we start talking

1095
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,400
and the two people sitting next to me

1096
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,480
are narcotics detectives who are talking

1097
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,680
about shooting a video that i 100 appear

1098
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,519
in at least a couple of times

1099
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:36,239
and i just have the biggest smile on my

1100
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:38,400
face and finally one of them goes what

1101
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,679
and i go i used to go up and down those

1102
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,160
stairs a lot and they just both didn't

1103
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,440
have any idea what to say to that they

1104
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:46,960
just kind of looked at each other and

1105
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,480
looked at me and looked back at each

1106
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,079
other and i just started laughing

1107
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,838
and it was a lot of fun at the end of

1108
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,760
that meeting they took my suggestion and

1109
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:56,719
my suggestion is still the rule for the

1110
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,880
city

1111
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,559
so

1112
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,400
yeah i win

1113
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,480
story time with mike and he won in the

1114
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,480
end so that's a good victory for mike

1115
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,679
ah man those stairs i remember i know

1116
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,358
the stairs are talking about that you

1117
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,598
know exactly

1118
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:14,480
uh there was a lot of uh loading of

1119
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,480
plants uh loading of product in and out

1120
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,079
that was a good time dude i wonder what

1121
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,320
kind of footage they got i'd like to see

1122
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,760
that footage yeah the

1123
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,440
there was apparently a camera watching

1124
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,320
the back stairs for the last several

1125
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,880
weeks

1126
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,039
that is scary yep

1127
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,400
that place is gone um we paid them a lot

1128
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,320
of tax money and then they decided to

1129
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,838
come in and shut us down uh mike and i

1130
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,519
that's how it goes we had some friends

1131
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,119
that were founding a dispensary and they

1132
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,960
didn't quite know what to do they had a

1133
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,400
really good idea that's the best way to

1134
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,760
say it yeah they needed some young blood

1135
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,880
in there and i was young and eager and i

1136
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,160
went in there and i was like let's do

1137
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,079
this and this so we got them going as a

1138
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,719
dispensary i couldn't handle it so i

1139
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,560
hired mike in there um and then we took

1140
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,319

any time that you can get off the leash

1218
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,680
any time you can uh i asked him i asked

1219
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,920
mike if he was morally wrong or legally

1220
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,519
wrong to kennel the children and he

1221
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,930
didn't seem to find that appropriate you

1222
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,000
guys so mike's a good person

1223
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:29,598
[Laughter]

1224
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,440
i might be a piece of [ __ ] mike's a good

1225
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,960
person every day they get older getting

1226
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,400
away from them gets a little easier if

1227
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,838
you've got kids you understand that

1228
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,599
sentiment yeah

1229
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,679
yeah but uh for a minute it was tough

1230
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,200
for a couple of different reasons

1231
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,039
um

1232
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:44,239
part of it is just the routine doesn't

1233
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,358
let up

1234
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:49,598
and finding gaps is is getting easier

1235
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,279
right now so hopefully there's a lot

1236
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,640
more of these this studio is too awesome

1237
