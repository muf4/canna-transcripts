00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,769
episode this one goes a lot like this

82
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:28,449
hey Rasta Jeff

83
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,340
you're not just growing killer plants to

84
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:32,589
help medicate the masses in Colorado but

85
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,900
you're also growing the knowledge and

86
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,360
ability of people worldwide to grow

87
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,129
medicine to the best of their abilities

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,260
that is awesome this guy notices that

89
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:43,090
I'm traveling up and down i-25 here in

90
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:45,009

facilities how to grow I'm growing for

92
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:48,939
the masses and at the same time I am

93
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,349
spreading free knowledge yes that is my

94
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:52,599
goal that is my mission that is kind of

95
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:54,069
my purpose of course I'm a father first

96
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,719
all that stuff matters more but then

97
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,719
after that I'm supposed to be teaching

98
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,310
the world how to grow the best quality

99
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,259
cannabis they can produce so that is my

100
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,579
one of my life purposes so I'm glad that

we're gonna keep moving on this email

122
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,470
because I'm obviously [ __ ] rambly

123
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:49,329
today it says I've emailed you in the

124
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,310
past and your advice has saved my

125
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:54,339
backside from issues that would have

126
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,780
been evitable ruined many grows I'm glad

127
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:57,699
I was helping able to help you out in

128
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:00,159
the past hopefully I can continue to

129
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,899
provide quality information it goes on

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,090
to say I just finished up my first run

131
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:06,219
of lemon Jeffrey and my lady and I have

132
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:08,169
fallen in love with it I'm glad you

133
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,000
chose a I read genetics train to grow

134
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,770
especially at the lemon Jeffrey that is

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,990
named after me so I'm glad that your

136
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,939
lady and yourself enjoyed that he says I

137
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,310
have three stepkids who have fallen prey

138
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:20,800
to Prohibition lands anti cannabis

139
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,569
rhetoric so my current set-up is a three

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,879
foot wide by three and a half foot tall

141
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:27,159
by one and a half foot deep cabinet

142
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,250
outfitted with LED lights which is

143
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,860
perfect for us but does not produce huge

144
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,839
yields due to the size constraints yes

145
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,160
that is a fairly limited space you've

146
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,779
got there but you should be able to

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,070
produce some quality medicine it sounds

148
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:40,899
like you drew some lemon Jeffrey that's

149
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,819
got you and your lady happy let's

150
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:44,739
continue see what else we've got to work

151
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,420
with I was able to top and trellis my

152
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,449
lemon Jeffrey to fill out most of the

153
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,860
net and keep it small enough sadly we

154
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,629
had to pull her a little bit early

155
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,600
because of timing issues with the kids

156
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:58,269
but I was so surprised from the quality

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,980
and yield even with an early harvest a

158
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:02,379
that is awesome to hear I had to cut it

159
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,850
down early sometimes [ __ ] happens I'm

160
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:05,350
not gonna speculate on what happens you

161
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,790
say it was problems with the kids who

162
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,550
knows what went on there I hope

163
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,319
everything is cool now but even though

164
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,030
you had an interruption we had to in the

165
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,370
grow a little bit early you were still

166
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:17,379
more than satisfied with the yield and

167
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,910
the quality of the product so that means

168
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,069
a lot to me I'm really glad you had a

169
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:24,460
successful grow it keeps going it says

170
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:27,519
high energy and clear-headed high with

171
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:30,189
tasty ass lemon heads and newly opened

172
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,839
tennis ball flavors aplenty that's

173
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,819
really interesting I quite often

174
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,189
describe the lemon Jeffrey as smelling

175
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:38,019
like if you got a box of lemon heads and

176
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:40,149
dumped the candy out of the box and

177
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:43,719
smelled the inside of the box and

178
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:46,029
that soft candied lemon flavor I also

179
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,130
quite often described it as country time

180
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:51,459
lemonade powder it smells very much like

181
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:54,699
lemonade powder I have not heard anybody

182
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:57,039
describe the lemon Jeffrey as the fresh

183
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:59,409
tennis ball aroma before that is very

184
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,270
unique that is very interesting you cut

185
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,100
it down early so maybe that is something

186
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:04,629
that happens earlier in the process

187
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,820
maybe that tennis ball smell goes away

188
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,889
by the time I'm cutting it down I have

189
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:11,170
never had that I have had the tennis

190
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,759
ball aroma in many other crosses and

191
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,530
strains that I've grown but I have never

192
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,269
experienced that in the lemon Jeffrey so

193
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:17,619
that's really interesting to me I want

194
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,759
to keep going with this email because it

195
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,100
does keep going and there's a lot of

196
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,839
great stuff to it tasty ass lemon heads

197
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,000
that is great I'm going to continue that

198
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,949
says we hope that someday the stigma of

199
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,230
the anti cannabis folks will fizzle out

200
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,689
so we can enjoy our passion for this

201
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,450
plant without the worry of Johnny Law

202
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:36,490
breaking down our door yes that is the

203
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:38,469
the hope the dream and the goal of

204
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,259
cannabis growers and consumers and

205
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:44,110
activists nationwide if not worldwide we

206
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:46,509
do want to be able to grow and possess

207
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,970
and consume our medicine safely without

208
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:51,370
the fear of Johnny Law kicking in the

209
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,590
door shooting the dog destroying your

210

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,299
moving right through this giant pile

280
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:12,309
this one goes like this what's happening

281
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,740
Rasta Jeff you can use my name

282
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:16,779

283
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,850
on the podcast what up Casey Benny big

284
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,949
shout out to my new friend it says I'm a

285
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,870
faithful listener and I met you at the

286
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,129
dude grows cup back in April what's up

287
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,019
bro we had a good time at the dudes

288
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:28,000
grows cup in April it says I've made

289
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:30,399
some BHO and I've ended up with clear

290
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,860
shatter snapping pool and sugar wax

291
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,399
let's talk about that for a quick second

292
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,080
here this guy this person made some BHO

293
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,720
and they ended up with clear shatter

294
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,129
which is usually the goal shatter is

295
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,070
basically when you've got to concentrate

296
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:46,809
it kind of looks like a thin layer of

297
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,910
maybe like a thin layer of jolly rancher

298
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:50,529
kind of an amber color maybe a light

299
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:52,539
yellow color maybe a golden Jolly

300
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,399
Ranchers sort of a thing usually a real

301
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:55,870
nice thin layer we call it shatter

302
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,970
because when you try to get some off of

303
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,639
the sheet the little piece it breaks

304
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,410
like candy or like glass kind of like

305
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,449
breaks like a Jolly Rancher it shatters

306
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:06,549
we call it shatter that is why it gets

307
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,360
the name shatter then the next one he

308
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:09,789
listed is

309
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,100
and pool snap and pool is a lot like

310
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:14,110
shatter but it is softer if you take

311
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,040
shatter and you heat it with your hands

312
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,600
if you just put a little piece of

313
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,919
shatter it would have to be in parchment

314
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,659
paper because it will stick directly to

315
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,639
your hands fold a piece of parchment

316
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:22,480
paper put some shatter in there hold it

317
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,369
between your hands

318
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,629
your body heat will melt the shatter

319
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:28,239
enough to where it comes to a

320
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:30,369
consistency known as snap and pull you

321
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:31,778
can just snap and pull a quick little

322
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:33,999
dab off there you got to set the dabber

323
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:35,708
on it just enough to get the dabber into

324
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:37,058
the concentrate and then just pull a

325
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,198
little dab right off real quick just

326
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:39,818
pull it off there real quick and oh come

327
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,678
just one dab will come off really

328
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:44,259
quickly we call it snap and pull it's

329
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:46,600
kind of a a thicker Laffy Taffy sort of

330
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:48,339
a texture it's like the shatter but

331
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,808
melted down a little bit to be softer

332
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,999
it's a little more pliable it's a little

333
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:53,558
bit easier to work with depending on

334
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:55,509
your situation some people prefer the

335
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:57,188
shatter some people prefer the snap and

336
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:59,289
pull I've been there is another

337
00:11:57,188 --> 00:12:01,988
consistency that this listener has

338
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:04,899
spoken of they said they made sugar wax

339
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:06,699
now that is a just another consistency

340
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,860
it is the same product just a different

341
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:10,958
consistency it comes out looking a

342
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,970
little bit like a big chunk of earwax

343
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,289
and I know that sounds disgusting it

344
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,928
also looks like maybe just a little

345
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:18,548
chunk of melted crayon or sometimes it

346
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:20,828
can be battery and it can look like a

347
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:23,350
thick piece of butter or possibly a

348
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:26,289
piece of cheesecake batter or possibly

349
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,839
even maybe in some cases cake batter or

350
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:31,178
cookie dough looking sort of texture and

351
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,549
appearances and consistency when he says

352
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:35,889
sugar wax I'm thinking it is probably

353
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:37,629
sort of like a snap and peel but a

354
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,068
little bit I don't want to say the word

355
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:41,259
mushy because that doesn't give a good

356
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:44,198
opinion but like sort of like a puddle

357
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:45,730
of like waxy maybe apple sauce might be

358
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:48,219
the consistency I'm trying to think of

359
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,139
light apple sauce would be a nice sugar

360
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,239
wax consistency that'd be a good

361
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:54,668
description so those are some of the

362
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:57,278
things that this person is made by

363
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:59,558
making BHO on their own these are very

364
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,360
similar products basically you make them

365
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:03,789
all the same I don't talk about making

366
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,918
concentrates on my podcast because I am

367
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:08,259
NOT a concentrate maker I can't give a

368
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:10,119
proper advice on how to do it and most

369
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:12,789
importantly I don't know how to do it

370
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:14,798
completely safely without putting you

371
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:16,958
your neighbors or your family or your

372
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:18,100
house or your building at risk so I'm

373
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,508
not going to teach you how to make

374
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,639
concentrates this person has already

375
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:22,409
done it so

376
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm not gonna put him in any risk this

377
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:25,740
way he's doing it I can't tell him not

378
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,629
to he's already got a product we could

379
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,250
talk about the finished product what

380
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:31,409
he's done is with these three different

381
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,289
products these are mainly just what

382
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:36,299
happens from very little manipulation of

383
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:37,919
the product or the starting material the

384
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:40,169
shatter will come out if you do not

385
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,909
disturb if you run the material and do

386
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:43,679
not disturb the final outcome that

387
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:46,069
concentrate that's in the container it

388
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,919
most likely will come out as a shatter

389
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:52,470
some strains will not shatter up some

390
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,958
things will always come out kind of snap

391
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,720
and pulley now you can take the shatter

392
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,278
and heat it or before it solidifies and

393
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,930
you can whip it there are several

394
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,919
different techniques to whipping and

395
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:07,139
that will turn it into a batter or a

396
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:09,629
sugar or a different consistency just

397
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,458
depends on the starting product how it

398
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:12,600
is whipped and meant when I say starting

399
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,359
product there are a lot of contributing

400
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,370
factors how moist or dry is your

401
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,669
starting product then we have many

402
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,429
things like how large are the trichome

403
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:25,740
heads of the starting product how long

404
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,509
are these stocks of the starting product

405
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,269
many things like that will make a factor

406
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:32,009
then everything else in that plant will

407
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,659
make a factor what is the percentage of

408
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:35,578
terpenoids what is the percentage of

409
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:37,679
lipids what is the percentage of esters

410
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:38,879
and Paley it's all of that stuff is

411
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,639
going to make a difference on the

412
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,250
quality of your concentrate another very

413
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,679
large contributing factor is was

414
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,629
anything applied to the plant in any

415
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,489
cycle of its life was there a pesticide

416
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,679
was there an essential oil was there

417
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,389
anything else sprayed onto this plant

418
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,149
all of that is going to come through in

419
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:58,889
your concentrate so every detail will

420
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,049
have something to do with the result of

421
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:02,789
your final product every detail in the

422
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:04,799
grow and the handling and in the

423
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:07,500
processing of the extraction will have

424
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,778
something to do with the quality and the

425
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,179
texture and consistency of the final

426
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,129
product so this person has ended up with

427
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,169
shatter which is pretty much standard

428
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,850
they've come up with snap and pool which

429
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:19,769
is really easy to do once you catch onto

430
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,180
the shatter then they have made sugar

431
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:22,828
wax and let's keep going with their

432
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,958
email and get to the actual question

433
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:27,239
sorry I'm so rambling today I hope you

434
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,789
enjoy it for the podcast it says my

435
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,370
question is how do I know that I am

436
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:34,409
purging enough I have a vacuum chamber

437
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,200
which is a small stainless steel

438
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:38,759
with a lucite lid and a gauge I leave

439
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,740
the product in there on a heating pad

440
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,110
set at high to about a hundred and ten

441
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,210
degrees under a full vacuum either until

442
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,450
it turns to wax or there are absolutely

443
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:50,879
no bubbles happening am i getting it

444
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,800
right or am i giving myself cancer the

445
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,659
product is always tasty and usually

446
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,759
blows my head off thank you for the

447
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:59,730
podcast and the beans and all of the

448
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:02,460
knowledge and entertainment sincerely

449
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,800
from KC Bennie hey first off you are

450
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,970
very welcome for the podcast you're very

451
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,349
welcome for the beans

452
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,509
you're very welcome for the knowledge

453
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,790
and also for the entertainment thank you

454
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:14,399
for noticing and acknowledging that like

455
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:15,899
I said before that keeps my fire burning

456
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,149
so now let's talk a little bit about

457
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:20,429
your question you are concerned that the

458
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,279
concentrates you are making at home are

459
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:25,229
they purged efficiently sufficiently

460
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,419
properly and enough are you giving

461
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,279
yourself cancer are you smoking butane

462
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,629
is what you want to know now keep in

463
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,600
mind that I've already said a few times

464
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:35,490
I am NOT a concentrate maker I've seen

465
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,860
this done several times I've watched

466
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,930
Kevin do this for a brief point in time

467
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,539
our buddy Spence was trying to teach me

468
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:44,309
how to make concentrates I did okay it

469
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:46,079
was not for me I would rather be in the

470
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:48,569
garden I would rather be breeding seeds

471
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,180
I'd rather be recording podcasts so I

472
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,730
leave the concentrates up to my expert

473
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:55,620
friends now that being said let's talk a

474
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,050
little bit about what I do know about

475
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,460
purging a concentrate it sounds like

476
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:01,019
you've got the right idea you were

477
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,360
putting it on heat and you were putting

478
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,939
it in a vacuum chamber the heat is going

479
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,279
to allow the concentrate to stay viscous

480
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:11,009
the vacuum is going to pull the air out

481
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,799
of there as the air comes out supposedly

482
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:16,410
it is sucking the residual butane out of

483
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,119
that concentrate at the same time if you

484
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,430
were doing everything correctly and

485
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,188
giving it enough time to properly purge

486
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:25,259
you should be removing most of the

487
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,689
butane and enough of the butane that

488
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,670
would make the product dangerous I do

489
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:31,830
have a couple of concerns are you

490
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,539
flipping the slab at any point in time

491
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:35,519
while it's in that chamber vacuum

492
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:38,159
purging you ever release the pressure

493
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,839
take the lid off turn the slab over so

494
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,920
that the bottom is now the top and you

495
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,599
can kind of Reaper it the other

496
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,789
direction just in case any bubbles got

497
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,909
trapped in there how long are you

498
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:49,440
letting the slab sit in the chamber

499
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,930
most of the people I know that are

500
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,960
making concentrates have upgraded to an

501
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,940
across international vacuum chamber so

502
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,920
we can actually watch the concentrate

503
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,019
bubble up a little bit on the tray then

504
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,029
we can create a vacuum inside of that

505
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,619
vacuum chamber so you've got heat and

506
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:06,210
you've got a vacuum and you can make the

507
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:07,500
little muffin in there and you can

508
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,180
release the pressure and watch the

509
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,750
muffin collapse and that way you know

510
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,640
that you are getting all of the residual

511
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,470
hydrocarbons out of each bubble in that

512
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,270
concentrate now I understand that you

513
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,430
were limited by your equipment those

514
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:22,200
vacuum ovens are not cheap so if you are

515
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,880
a new concentrate maker if you were a

516
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,799
home grower maybe that is out of your

517
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,600
reach at this time so we have to think

518
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,549
about working with what we've got I

519
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,099
would make sure to purge that

520
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:34,619
concentrate longer than you feel

521
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:37,079
necessary if you're going 12 hours and

522
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:39,329
you feel like it is good enough go 24

523
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:42,299
hours and see what happens I don't think

524
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:43,799
you can over purge your concentrate the

525
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:46,409
thing you're going to have to be careful

526
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,659
of at that point is volatize interms if

527
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,279
you get too hot you could roast off the

528
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,440
turps you said you're setting your heat

529
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,720
mat to a hundred and ten degrees again I

530
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,000
am NOT a concentrate maker or an expert

531
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,769
but from my memory from most of my

532
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,079
reading I do recall that either

533
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:04,500
cannabinoids or terpenes begin to

534
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:06,119
volatize around 106 degrees is where we

535
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,009
really started losing important things

536
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,919
so pay attention to your temperature

537
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:12,809
when we were first learning to make BHO

538
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,820
concentrates and we did not have all the

539
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,440
science all the technology all of the

540
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:19,619
equipment and most importantly all of

541
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,049
the research one of the key phrases that

542
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:24,839
many of the makers would say was slow

543
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:27,869
and low we want to bat slow and low

544
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:30,089
purge that low temperature really slow

545
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:32,459
purge that was what everybody's goal was

546
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:34,199
back in the day so if you think you are

547
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,660
purging your product correctly and

548
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,120
properly and enough I would let it go

549
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,250
just a little bit longer now without a

550
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,069
lab test you're not going to be able to

551
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,109
tell how much butane is left in your

552
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:48,000
final product there's no way to look at

553
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:50,129
it there's no way to smell it you can't

554
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,470
see it by looking at bubbles if you see

555
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,690
bubbles in your shatter how do you know

556
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,670
that that is butane many people say this

557
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,080
has butane in it there's bubbles how do

558
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,060
you know those bubbles aren't oxygen

559
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,179
oxygen makes bubbles that could be

560
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,710
anything

561
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,390
the concentrate was folded when the

562
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,610
concentrate was moved could have made an

563
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,110
oxygen bubble in there just as easily as

564
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:10,209
a butane bubble so there's no way to

565
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:12,099
identify a butane bubble

566
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:15,220
now if the concentrate is purged

567
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:17,740
properly you will receive more butane

568
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,049
from flicking a lighter to smoke a bowl

569
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:23,140
then you would receive from smoking

570
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:25,269
properly purged BHO so when you were

571
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,490
putting your dab on the dab nail pay

572
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:29,950
attention what is happening is it

573
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,370
sparkling is it cracking does it taste

574
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,289
funny

575
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:34,569
does it smell funny does it burn your

576
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:36,670
throat does it burn your lungs does it

577
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:39,220
burn your mouth does it leave a funky

578
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,019
residue on the rig without a lab test

579
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,319
those are the things we're going to have

580
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:46,950
to rely on to determine if there are any

581
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:50,470
residual hydrocarbons remaining in our

582
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,600
hopefully finished concentrate now I

583
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,089
don't have a lot of good ways to test

584
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:57,490
this but perhaps you could set a piece

585
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:59,379
of your concentrate on something that is

586
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,480
flame resistant maybe you've got like a

587
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,550
metal put it on a pan and then maybe

588
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,829
take your torch and put your torch to

589
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:08,109
that concentrate does it catch on fire

590
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:09,849
does it burn or does it just melt if it

591
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:12,459
just melt you've probably got a nice

592
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:14,319
clean concentrate if it sparkles if it

593
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,930
pops if it does anything that gets your

594
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,389
attention there's probably something in

595
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:21,640
there you do not want to dab but without

596
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,320
a lab that is the only way we are going

597
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,680
to be able to test our concentrate I

598
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:29,409
think if there was enough butane left in

599
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,390
that product the flame that you put to

600
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,250
it as a tester would let you know the

601
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,410
heat that comes off your dab nail when

602
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,940
you drop that dab into the nail it would

603
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,670
let you know there would be some sort of

604
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,830
an indicator your throat your mouth your

605
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,720
lungs would let you know if there was

606
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:46,389
too much of butane left in that product

607
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,480
now one good thing about butane is it

608
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,000
does dissipate very quickly butane is

609
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,650
not a gas that wants to hang around

610
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,750
butane is really light butane is really

611
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,120
thin so if you've got your concentrate

612
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,529
sitting out in a fairly warm environment

613
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:03,069
and you don't have it in a thick layer

614
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:04,899
it will auto purge itself in Colorado

615
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:06,789
and concentrate making was knew it

616
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,650
wouldn't be too uncommon to walk past

617
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:10,210
somebody's car and see just a little

618
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,850
Tupperware dish with a piece of

619
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,690
parchment paper folded up inside of the

620
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:15,128
Tupperware day

621
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,808
and the Tupperware dish either sitting

622
00:22:15,128 --> 00:22:18,939
on the passenger seat or just chillin on

623
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:20,950
the dash guys like myself knew what was

624
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,470
going on they're using the heat of the

625
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,749
car and the Sun to auto purge their

626
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,089
concentrates that's how easy it is if

627
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:29,440
you are not making ridiculously large

628
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:31,928
batches if you're not running

629
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,419
tremendously large amounts of butane you

630
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:37,359
can use the Sun and a piece of parchment

631
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,889
paper to auto purge your concentrate it

632
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:41,798
sounds like you were a smart enough

633
00:22:38,888 --> 00:22:43,689
person to be able to tell if something

634
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:45,999
is wrong with your concentrate you said

635
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,739
that it rips what'd it say it blows my

636
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:49,749
head off so it sounds like you've got a

637
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:51,909
quality product if it's the right color

638
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:54,159
if it's the right consistency and it

639
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:55,899
doesn't make you feel bad if it doesn't

640
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,940
taste bad if it doesn't burn if it

641
00:22:55,898 --> 00:23:00,278
doesn't leave a funky residue or

642
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,840
anything on the nail if you put some of

643
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,028
it on a metal surface and light it on

644
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,970
fire and nothing bad happens I'm going

645
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:09,909
to assume you've got a mostly safe

646
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,848
product again I cannot see the product

647
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:15,249
I'm not a doctor I am NOT a scientist I

648
00:23:12,848 --> 00:23:16,689
am just some guy with the podcast who is

649
00:23:15,249 --> 00:23:18,489
hoping you have done everything

650
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,070
correctly and having faith in your

651
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:22,450
skills so don't take my word for it if

652
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:24,519
you really want to know

653
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,409
take it to a lab they can test it for

654
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:28,089
residual particles per million of

655
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:30,700
hydrocarbons they can tell you exactly

656
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:33,339
what is left but until then we've just

657
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,919
got to do a few simple at-home tests

658
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:38,199
which honestly I don't know how reliable

659
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,028
they are but they may make you feel a

660
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,098
little bit better throw it on some fire

661
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:43,989
check on your body check on yourself

662
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:46,239
check on your equipment if everything

663
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:48,639
seems ok then all we can do is hope

664
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:50,200
everything is OK I feel like if there

665
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:52,658
was enough butane in there to cause a

666
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,369
problem to you it would catch on fire it

667
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:57,369
would spark and there would absolutely

668
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:59,648
be some sort of an indicator now after

669
00:23:57,368 --> 00:24:02,079
that long BHO conversation I do have to

670
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:04,658
give a disclaimer be [ __ ] careful you

671
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,699
put yourself at great risk when making

672
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:08,919
concentrates you were using a very

673
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,528
volatile gas you could cause a lot of

674
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,929
problems it also could cause you some

675
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:16,628
legal problems so be very careful

676
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:18,669
working with hydrocarbons be very

677
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:21,699

723
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:51,259
MacBook I am using right now to record

724
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,480
this podcast was covered by patreon

725
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:55,819
contributors my old MacBook took a [ __ ]

726
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,150
and just in time before it finally took

727
00:25:55,819 --> 00:26:01,099
its last last gasp of breath my patreon

728
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,320
supporters were able to come through and

729
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:05,919
replace that MacBook with this brand-new

730
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:08,179
machine so that came from the patreon

731
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,460
contributions without patreon this

732
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,000
podcast just may not have gotten this

733
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,730
far

734
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,920
also the patreon contributions cover the

735
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,970
cost of my website my website is where I

736
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,070
host the show

737
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,259
so having patreon help cover the cost of

738
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:24,259
the website helps me deliver the podcast

739
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:26,509

740
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:28,670
the show to you for free also the

741
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:30,920
patreon contributions cover things like

742
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,630
these microphone covers when Mike comes

743
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,640
over he doesn't have to spit into the

744
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,500
same microphone cover the dab and granny

745

was spitting into they really do

746
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,849
appreciate that so the cost of the

747
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:42,680
website the cost of the computer the

748
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,719
