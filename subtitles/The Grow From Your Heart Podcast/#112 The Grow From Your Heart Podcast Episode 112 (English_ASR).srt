101

105
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:39,129
feeling the Christmas vibe I've been

106
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,719
working too much I've been busy I've

107
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,039
been on the go but I finally got all my

108
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,629
Christmas shopping done I got caught up

109

110
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:47,289

taking dabs getting the show prepared so

112
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:52,000
let's get into it I know you guys would

113
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:53,979
prefer draw lessons but it's been a busy

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,539
couple of weeks and then I saw this news

115
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:58,149
article so there's gonna be a little bit

116
00:03:55,539 --> 00:04:01,269
of news on this episode and then I am

117
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,340
going to talk about how I got into the

118
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,019
cannabis industry um I was hanging out

119
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,069
with a few friends that have known me

120
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,629
for quite a while and they're like dude

121
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:09,699
how did you even get into this and I was

122
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,900
like well that's a podcast topic so let

123
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:12,488
me just say it into a microphone and

124
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,629
then you guys can listen to the show so

125
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:15,519
I'll talk about that in a couple of

126
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,439
minutes before I get to the news article

127
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,629
before I get to talking about how I got

128
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,548
into the industry I want to give a

129
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:23,889
little bit of advice a friend asked me

130
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:25,419
about foliar spray he's actually

131
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,189
applying silver thigh

132
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,280
sulphate to his plants so that he can

133
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:32,740
reverse his females into males and make

134
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,750
feminized seeds and he asked me one

135
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,670
question about foliar spray that I

136
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,889
thought I should help you guys out with

137
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,480
a little bit when you were spraying your

138
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,639
plants whether it be foliar spray

139
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,160
whether it be pesticides whether it be

140
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,439
silver thiosulfate to try to make male

141
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,050
plants out of them however you were

142
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,430
spraying them I highly suggest that you

143
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,319
either spray right when the lights go

144
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,689
off or that you turn the lights off

145
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,339
while you spray there are a couple of

146
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:59,379
reasons for this but my main reason for

147
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:01,419
this is that you don't want to spray

148
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:03,279
your plants when you've got big heavy

149
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,960
high-intensity discharge lights right

150
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,369
above them because you're gonna spray

151
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,750
little bubbles all over your plants

152
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,550
you're gonna put this layer of bubbles

153
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,110
that's basically a bunch of bubbles all

154
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,759
of your plants if you want a nice fine

155
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,139
mist when you spray so you're gonna have

156
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,730
bubbles all over your plants plants are

157
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,620
gonna be soaked and these high-intensity

158
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,300
discharge lights are gonna shine down

159
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,100
onto those bubbles and it's going to

160
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,569
work kind of like a magnifying glass

161
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,520
remember when you're a little kid used

162
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,680
to roast ants with a magnifying glass I

163
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,789
know not everybody did that but a lot of

164
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,500
the boys are not in their head going

165
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,230
yeah we did that well you're gonna do

166
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,970
the same thing to your plant the lights

167
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,530
are gonna act like the Sun the bubble is

168
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,180
gonna act like the magnifying glass and

169
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,619
your leaf is gonna get little white burn

170
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,819
dots on it you're gonna be really

171
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,319
confused as what it's from you're gonna

172
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,909
think a bug ate it you think you have a

173
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,199
deficiency you're gonna think

174
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,060
something's messing up but honestly what

175
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,439
happened was you foliar sprayed and the

176
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,180
light made a little bubble on there and

177
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,370
it burned the [ __ ] out of your plant so

178
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,350
I highly recommend either removing the

179
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,970
plants from the light turning off the

180
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,379
light or waiting until the light clicks

181
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,120
off right when that light clicks off if

182
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,709
you've got a small crop you should be

183
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,149
able to get in there and you should be

184
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,529
able to spray that entire crop in just a

185
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:03,969
couple of minutes and your plants won't

186
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,139
even notice that you kept them up for a

187
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,370
couple of extra minutes and that way

188
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,409
you're not gonna get any burns on your

189
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,149
plants from the light and then you're

190
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,380
not interrupting your photo period and

191
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:12,489
your plants are gonna get all of the

192
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:14,290
light that they should have gotten

193
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,120
throughout the day cycle so I recommend

194
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,890
spraying right as the lights go off or

195
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,319
if you need to turn the lights off or if

196
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,250
you must just remove the plants if

197
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,500
you're only gonna spray one or two

198
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,170
plants like my friend Fred is trying to

199
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,389
reverse a female plant into a male by

200
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,500
spraying it with silver thiosulfate and

201
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,870
I would just take that plant into

202
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,310
another room I would almost take that

203
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,509
plant to another part of the house if

204
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,889
it's a home grow I would go out to the

205
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,110
garage and spray it out there

206
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:40,879
because that way you will not get any of

207
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,848
that silver thiosulfate on the plants

208
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,218
that you want to remain female so that's

209
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:48,709
my guidance on that also Fred let that

210
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:50,300
plant that you sprayed dry before you

211
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,680
return it to the grow room with the

212
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,110
females because you don't want to spread

213
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,180
that liquid dripping silver thiosulfate

214
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,098
on to any of the other plants

215
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,860
alright so that's my guidance on foliar

216
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:02,418
spray or pesticide application mainly

217
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,590
don't do it with the lights on cuz you

218
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:05,658
don't want to burn the [ __ ] out of the

219
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,888
plants alright now I've got a news

something's going on in Pueblo County

238
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:38,569
you might not notice as you drive

239
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:40,009
through the town which took a big hit

240
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:41,810
during the steel recession of the 80s

241
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,550
and has slowly been coming back but your

242
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,899
nostril should get a clue once you reach

243
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,360
the outskirts where the aroma of

244
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:49,338
cannabis hits you although this isn't an

245
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,139
unusual odor in Colorado these days the

246
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:53,329
pot industry is in full bloom in the

247
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,620
county surrounding Pueblo I wish I could

248
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:56,418
write my high school guidance counselor

249
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,189
a letter about this says Michael Cadwell

250
00:07:56,418 --> 00:08:00,168
Director of Sales for the Los Suenos

251
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,569
cannabis farm as he sniffs above the

252
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:05,389
size of a football this is the way we do

253
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,819
it he says excuse my coughing you guys I

254
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,189
was taking some dabs earlier los sueños

255
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:12,439
is a 36 acre farm just outside the city

256
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:14,479
in Pueblo County it's one of the largest

257
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,310
outdoor grows in the country unlike

258
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,959
Denver County this one does not require

259
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,028
that commercial cannabis cultivation be

260
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,128
confined inside and a stroll through the

261
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:23,689
four fields planted with 55 strains

262
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,270
shows what a difference the bright

263
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:28,370
southern Colorado Sun makes plants here

264
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:30,049
grow much taller and heavier and they

265
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,328
need to be tied to stakes just to stay

266
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,719
upright the high elevation increase and

267
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:37,458
increase in ultraviolet rays tricks

268
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,949
tricks the plant into higher res resin

269
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:42,348
production explains Erin Hovey head

270
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:44,208
grower at Los Suenos and the natural

271
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:46,699
sunlight is virtually year-round he says

272
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:48,889
still the area can get cold so when the

273
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:50,219
winter for winter frost hits loose los

274
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:52,649
sueños an outdoor

275
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,839
becomes unfeasible Hovey and his team

276
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:56,399
operate in four greenhouses a more

277
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,649
eco-friendly alternative to the light

278
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,299
bulb warehouse setups in Denver you can

279
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:01,919
have a thousand lights and some huge

280
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:03,328
warehouse for massive production but

281
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,169
that's not what we're trying to do down

282
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:08,549
here Hovey says this is farming cannabis

283
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:10,169
hopi grew up in North Carolina where he

284
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,208
started growing marijuana outdoors as a

285
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:13,679
teenager despite the objections of his

286
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:16,559
parents and local law enforcement he

287
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,359
honed his craft there before finding a

288
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,479
legal heaven Haven in Pueblo County

289
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,399
where he now matures nurtures I'm sorry

290
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,740
nurtures the lives of more than 10,000

291
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,208
marijuana plants there's no playbook to

292
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,829
growing pot like this and there are no

293
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,479
guarantees with growing in the natural

294
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:32,849
elements but that's what makes it fun

295
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,860
Hobie says you can't be successful at

296
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,870
this without good help when the hill and

297
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,300
mold hits you need people who know what

298
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,709
they are doing

299
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:42,568
Kogi is just one of many Coloradans who

300
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,578
moved the Pueblo to work with the legal

301
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:45,448
marijuana but locals are getting in on

302
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:47,849
the action too

303
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:50,159
more than 1300 jobs were created in

304
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,689
Pueblo County in 2014 by the marijuana

305
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,669
industry according to a study by the

306
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:54,539
southern Colorado Colorado Growers

307
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:56,309
Association

308
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:58,469
a staffing firm that helps people land

309
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:01,109
marijuana jobs opened in Pueblo last

310
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,819
February at the same time Industrial

311
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,829
vacancies decreased by more than 15

312
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:06,599
percent and marijuana related businesses

313
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:08,159
accounted for 36 percent of new

314
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,620
commercial building projects in Pueblo

315
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,328
County in 2014 according to the Pueblo

316
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,278
County Regional Building Department

317
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:16,409
folks are quickly realizing that the

318
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,088
cost of cultivation is a lot less in

319
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,309
greenhouses and outdoor says Pueblo

320
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:21,930
County Commissioner Sal pace who is

321
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:24,328
championed the marijuana industry as a

322
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:27,809
form of economic growth in the area we

323
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:29,909
have a very sizable rural rural agrarian

324
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,619
portion here sorry I've never read that

325
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:33,958
word before and I probably should have

326
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,399
when Coloradans voted to legalize the

327
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,719
growing and selling of recreational

328
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,308
marijuana they also agreed to allow

329
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,199
towns and counties to choose whether or

330
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:42,299
not to allow retail pot businesses

331
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:44,789
within their boundaries Denver already

332
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,799
the state epicenter of medical marijuana

333
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:48,778
quickly became the first retail

334
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,188
marijuana capital of the world while

335
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:51,629
much of the rest of the state struggled

336
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:54,028
over the decision of whether to accept

337
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:55,740
pot businesses and if so how to regulate

338
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,328
them but pace and his fellow

339
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,909
commissioners were keen on the idea of

340
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:01,649
an agricultural marijuana economy early

341
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,569
on and began issuing cultivation

342
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:05,309
licenses in 2014

343
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,500
in hopes of spurring local industry

344
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:09,719
there are now cultivation licenses for

345
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,549
33 medical operations and 57

346
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,360
recreational operations in Pueblo and

347
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:17,129
Pueblo West County let me clarify for

348
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,389
people that are not from Colorado and

349
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:20,100
there were a couple things in that sense

350
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:22,409
I want to clarify us is there are now

351
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,659
cultivation licenses for 33 medical

352
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:28,139
operations and 57 recreational

353
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:30,779
operations recreational and medical are

354
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:34,080
grown in completely different areas

355
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,699
there so if a grow applies to be a

356
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,320
legalized girl with the meed the

357
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,060
marijuana Enforcement Division they

358
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,930
either apply to be a medical grow or a

359
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:44,699
recreational grow and it's just the

360
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:46,500
difference in licensing it's how your

361
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,320
plant count adds up it's how your

362
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,360
cannabis is handled so if your medicine

363
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,050
if the cannabis is grown in a medical

364
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,620
facility

365
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:57,750
it can only be sold to medical retail

366
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,909
facilities if the cannabis has grown in

367
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,879
a recreational facility it can only be

368
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:04,709
sold in a recreational retail

369
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,879
establishment so that's why they make

370
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,800
the indication there if it's

371
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,529
recreational or a medical marijuana

372
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:13,589
facility and also they talk about Pueblo

373
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:15,179
and Pueblo West County those are on the

374
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,980
border of each other and there are a

375
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:19,709
bunch I think there are 14 or 15

376
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,350
dispensaries in Pueblo West which is

377
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,300
just a small short quick drive from the

378
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,190
city of Pueblo actually worked in Pueblo

379
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,169
West and I live in the south side of

380
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,430
Pueblo and it used to take me just 15 or

381
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:31,649
20 minutes to get there so it's not like

382
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:33,989
it's a distance and the city of Puebla

383
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:36,509
does not allow any cannabis sales within

384
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,149
city limits so everything that is sold

385
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:40,740
is just in Pueblo County and Pueblo West

386
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,509
all right I've gotten off on a tangent

387
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,279
let's get back to the article that says

388
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:45,600
all of the although the city of Pueblo

389
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,329
allows cultivation it's been more

390
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,320
guarded in its approach to sales

391
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,420
recreational pot shops are still under a

392
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,670
moratorium in the city until a public

393
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:55,649
vote on the matter in November of 2016

394
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:57,719
so residents need to purchase their pot

395
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,610
of at one of the thirteen recreational

396
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,889
shops in Pueblo County where retail

397
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,269
sales aren't illegal the Pueblo City

398
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:04,830
Council is starting to come around on

399
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:07,500
the medical side however and the first

400
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:10,139
MMJ dispensary within pueblo city limits

401
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,490
opened in october wellö natives Stephen

402
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,230
and Monique Duran who've been together

403
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,820
for 13 years started looking into

404
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,980
medical marijuana businesses several

405
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,390
years ago he started studying medical

406
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,370
Merrill

407
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:21,169
after his shift at the Comanche power

408
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,200
plant while Monique became a regulatory

409
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:26,029
regulatory rules Wiz finally after

410
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,680
finding one of the rare buildings in

411
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,079
Puebla that met all of the city's Street

412
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,819
stringent zoning requirements for the

413
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,830
marijuana operation which include the

414
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,720
location in a small council approved

415
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,730
industrial zone the Duran's poured their

416
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,899
savings into a lease for the building

417
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:43,519
which is now the 7-1 9mm J dispensary

418
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,899
there was a map the city had for us in

419
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,850
order to meet the requirements and it

420
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,529
was very very limited we found this

421
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,450
place which met all of them Monique says

422
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:52,069
right now it's us and and one employee

423
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,720
running the store we're just a couple

424
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,670
but we want to be the model for how to

425
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,290
properly medicate patients in Pueblo

426
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,389
there won't be many competitors

427
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:01,579
following that model though since zoning

428
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,720
maps the zoning map is so restrictive

429
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,250
that only a few more Medical

430
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,500
dispensaries might manage to find a

431
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,940
suitable spot within the city the

432
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,379
couples inspiration for seven one nine

433
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,330
came from watching Stephens sister

434
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:13,279
struggle through the difficulties of

435
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,690
multiple sclerosis and seeing how

436
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,089
pharmaceutical marijuana may keep

437
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,740
medication affected her this was just a

438
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,450
different person on the she was just a

439
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,669
different person on those meds says

440
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,830
Steven seeing what real patients have to

441
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:26,719
fight through was some strong motivation

442
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,550
now these homegrown owners are happy

443
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,320
with what they've created just coming in

444
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:32,120
the shop and looking around has two kids

445
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,129
from Pueblo who never really had much

446
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,529
sometimes it's like a dream Monique says

447
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:39,110
it's such a cool story and we hope to

448
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:41,389
make it a better one it's a big shot at

449
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,680
the Pueblo Colorado several years ago

450
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,939
like the article said this town was

451
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:46,039
falling apart when I used to tell people

452
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,600
that I'm from Pueblo Colorado they would

453
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,329
laugh at me they would not take me

454
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,920
seriously now when I'm in Denver or

455
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,750
Colorado Springs and I say that I am

456
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,069
from Pueblo a lot of people are like oh

457
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,080

458
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,879

here we go I've got a little bit of la

476
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:57,880
cush it's LA Confidential crossed to

477
00:15:53,679 --> 00:16:00,309
some OG Kush but this is pH oh wax most

478
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:03,159
of the time I'm smoking BHO most of the

479
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:04,778
shatter and dabs that you see available

480
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,948
on the market right now are made with

481
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:10,120
butane this hash was made with propane

482
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:11,439
let me open up some shatter that was

483
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,818
made with butane so that I can compare

484
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,470
them side-by-side and kind of give you a

485
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:16,240
little a better description of what I'm

486
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,319
working with here so the shatter most

487
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,889
you guys are familiar with shatter

488
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:24,879
shatter is an amber II colored sort of a

489
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:29,528
honey colored slab of shatter it's a

490
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:31,448
little thin sheet of real if I bend it

491
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:32,649
it cracks like it'll just pop off and

492
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,049
some of it will chip off and go flying

493
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:37,778
away when you're watching Jurassic Park

494
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:39,669
all those big slabs of like the amber

495
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:41,379
resin that the bugs are kept in that the

496
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:42,729
bugs are stuck in that is what shatter

497
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:45,100
looks like in my opinion I think that

498
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,319
stuff looks like shatter so compared to

499
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,069
the shatter I'm gonna open up this pho

500
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:51,669
and take a look

501
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:54,729
this is propane honey oil it looks like

502
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:57,309
ah and it looks like a piece of soap

503
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,069
it's really lightly colored it almost

504
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,809
resembles since it's holiday time this

505
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:04,119
looks like a small piece of Amanda's

506
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:06,009
peanut butter fudge yeah if somebody cut

507
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,448
Amanda's a peanut butter fudge perfectly

508
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:09,970
smooth I think it would look just like

509
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,740
this stuff I just noticed that there was

510
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,209
a kind of a shitty technical difficulty

511
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,308
with my microphone so I apologize if

512
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,230
part of the show was subpar quality that

513
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:18,490
is not my style I'll do my best to fix

514
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,409
it but I just noticed that there wasn't

515
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,029
something working properly so shout out

516
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:23,380
to the failed cable pretty sure it's

517
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:25,209
just an XLR cable that needs to be

518
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,439
replaced not a big deal anyway I was

519
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,880
talking about this hash I'm picking

520
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,580
something some of it up right now

521
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,500
this is much easier to handle and deal

522
00:17:30,579 --> 00:17:34,449
with and work with than shatter shatter

523
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,410
is real sticky it'll stick to your

524
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,880
fingers

525
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,410
when you break it it'll break off when

526
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,080
your fingers heat it up it gets kind of

527
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,550
goopy I'm holding on to this pho and I

528
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,529
would be able I am able to break off

529
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:46,509
little dabs for myself I'm able to break

530
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:48,670
off big-ass dabs for myself and little

531
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:51,129
dabs for my friends it's much easier to

532
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,400
handle I just took a few dabs of it one

533
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:57,910
thing that I can really say this stuff

534
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,190
is flavorful it's got a really sweet

535
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,080
really dank flavor to it I can't even

536
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,150
properly describe the flavor of it

537
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,730
it's got a cushy flavor to it it tastes

538
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:09,759
the essence of cannabis is really in the

539
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,230
pho I was skeptical at first but a

540
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,789
friend of mine that works at just at a

541
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,230
dispensary she convinced me that I

542
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:15,879
wanted to try some of it so I grabbed

543
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,400

546
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,039

00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,440
and choke into the microphone a whole

557
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,150
bunch oh my gosh I'm so sorry that was

558
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,009
gross anyway I said it was gonna come

559
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,370
back and talk a little bit about how I

560
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:56,470
got myself into the cannabis industry

561
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:57,939
let me get into that um I'm grabbing I

562
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,350
wrote a couple little notes here nothing

563
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,090
major I just took a couple little bullet

564
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:02,469
points while I was dabbing so I wanted

565
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:05,230
to say that I was in the cannabis

566
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:08,620
industry illegally before the cannabis

567
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,670
industry ever existed you guys I don't

568
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:11,319
know how much of this I should talk

569
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,390
about her admit but we're beyond that

570
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:15,669
right the statute of limitations is

571
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:18,340
probably gone if I admit to any criminal

572
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,720
activity anyway when I moved here from

573
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:22,179
California I was going to high school

574
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,529
here and her little crew I was on a

575
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,019
camping trip and somebody pulled out a

576
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,279
pipe and we started smoking and I was

577
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:28,720
like nice some weed

578
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,539
Zedan seed weed since I'd left

579
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,430
California so we got stoned and then uh

580
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,420
I was like alright all my friend smoked

581
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,950
weed that means we're gonna have to find

582
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,960
s'more to buy weed and none of our crew

583
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,400
really had a weed guy yet and I knew

584
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,259
that a couple of the guys at school were

585
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,570
hustling weed but they didn't really

586
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:46,210
there were some racial tensions there in

587
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:48,129
my school back in that time the Mexican

588
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,048
guys hung out with the Mexican guys and

589
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,460
the white guys hung out

590
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:52,259
white guys and we didn't fight or

591
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,629
anything it's just kind of what those

592
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,669
groups did we didn't there was no

593
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:57,988
there's no reason for us to mix we were

594
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:59,549
over here listening to Green Day and

595
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:01,169
Nirvana and fish and they were over

596
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:02,999
there listening to I don't even know to

597
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,869
Cypress Hill is one of the things I

598
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:07,169
remember they listened to a whole bunch

599
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:08,819
of but anyway ah I was brave enough to

600
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:10,379
hit up one of the Mexican guys that I

601
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:12,329
knew sold weed I was like hey Nick you'd

602
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:13,769
sell me some weed he was kind of leery

603
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:16,199
about it at first but he's like yep she

604
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:17,548
have to buy ounces and at that time we

605
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,619
were just high school kids so announces

606
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:19,950
a little bit of a stretch so I made it

607
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,939
happen

608
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,288
I bought her an ounce and I started

609
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,739
hustling a little bit of that herb to my

610
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:27,690
friends and then uh those guys were

611
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:28,829
heavily connected and they were like

612
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,028
you're moving ounces you're gonna start

613
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,769
moving pounds now and they started

614
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,480
throwing me pounds for dirty dirty cheap

615
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:35,009
around here in this town I was I had the

616
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,899
cheapest hookup on pounds around here

617
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:38,399
for a while

618
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:41,398
until one day I was selling a pound on

619
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:43,558
the east side of town and a couple of

620
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:45,238
guys with face tattoos and assault

621
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:47,069
rifles walked up to my car and they did

622
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:48,659
not take my [ __ ] from me I was so amazed

623
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:50,368
but they told me that I was not allowed

624
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:52,799
to be selling my product on that side of

625
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:54,388
town that I was able to sell my product

626
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,798
on the north and south ends of town but

627
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:57,358
don't [ __ ] with the east and west side

628
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,158
and if they see me again they're gonna

629
00:20:57,358 --> 00:21:02,278
take all my [ __ ] from me and they sent

630
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,960
me home nicely so I kind of just became

631
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:06,450
the street dude I hustled the brick weed

632
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,710
the Mexican brick weed from a couple of

633
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,480
friends that were just flooding it to me

634
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,829
so since since not the other white guys

635
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,389
in my neighborhood wanted to talk to

636
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:13,769
these Mexican guys I was just getting

637
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:15,418
pounds from the Mexican guys and just

638
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:17,099
selling it to all my gringo friends and

639
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:18,600
it was working out for me so that's kind

640
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:20,898
of where I made my break into the weed

641
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,939
scene that's how I learned how to hustle

642
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:25,229
all of that is a fictional tale if you

643
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,669
were involved in any sort of law

644
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,230
enforcement I just made that up I'm

645
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:29,759
writing a book and that is all going to

646
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,589
be in the fictional book I'm writing all

647
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,980
right so how's that feel all right so

648
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:36,358
then let's see I'm smoking and hustling

649
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,788
and doing my thing several years go by

650
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:42,079
and then I learned how to grow actually

651
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:42,079
I learned how to grow um

652
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,500
I had a guy that lived in the same

653
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:46,460
apartment building as me when I was like

654
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,200
seven years old

655
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,690
and that guy was growing wheat in his

656
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,850
backyard and I would listen to his

657
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,279
conversations between my friend Wayne

658
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:57,019
and my uncle Eric and this dude and they

659
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,609
would talk about how to grill weed I was

660
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:00,680
like somewhere between 7 and 10 years

661
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,389
old when I lived there and I absorbed so

662
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,070
much information from that conversation

663
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,380
that I felt like I was destined to grow

664
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:08,659
weed at some point in time so we jump

665
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,710
way forward into the early 2000s I

666
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,750
couldn't even tell you exactly which

667
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:15,319
year a friend of mine was growing some

668
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:17,240
weed in Colorado and he needed a hand

669
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:19,220
and so I went helped him out he didn't

670
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,289
let me do a whole bunch but he let me he

671
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,839
exposed me to some things and so I

672
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,240
learned how to do that I know I got good

673
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,709
at that and I moved to Lawrence Kansas

674
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,200
that just for unrelated reasons for

675
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,490
musical reasons I changed a band chased

676
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,840
the dream of being in a band and went

677
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,859
and played in Lawrence Kansas for

678
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,529
several years travelled around the

679
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:38,179
Midwest but anyway a friend of mine

680
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:40,279
there had a place where we would play

681
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,980
music and one day I was playing the

682
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:43,700
drums and I looked up I don't know why I

683
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,620
looked up when you're playing the drums

684
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,730
your eyes just wander your eyes just go

685
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:47,929
places you get bored of staring at the

686
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,089
guitar players back all day because

687
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,640
guitar players asses are all to you so I

688
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:54,769
looked up and I see this light coming

689
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,390
from the Attic and I'm like oh [ __ ]

690
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:57,769
that's a high-intensity discharge light

691
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,120
they've got an HP s light up there

692
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:00,559
they're growing some [ __ ] weed up

693
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,289
there and it's just like the crawlspace

694
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,879
in the garage a little storage area so I

695
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:06,230
waited for everybody to leave except for

696
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,330
the dude that owns the place it was his

697
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,860
space and I go hey bro uh not to be an

698
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:11,299
[ __ ] but I got hit in the face with

699
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:13,339
the girl light a couple of times up

700
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:15,289
there what you got up there and he kind

701
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:17,480
of looked at me like huh weed smoke

702
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,460
together we drank together we're bros so

703
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,019
he goes what do you know about aggro and

704
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,549
I was like I'm I'm okay in a girl I've

705
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:24,049
never been like in charge of a girl but

706
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:25,609
I've been a helper plenty of times you

707
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:27,289
know and he's like well then come up

708
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:28,849

709
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,109
problem and he'd help doing this and I'm

710
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:31,879
gonna be out of town for a few days can

711
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,979
you take over I was like sure so he goes

712
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,960
out of town and he ended up getting in

713
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,970
trouble and he was gone for several days

714
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,309
way more days than expected so I kind of

715
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,289
took care of that crop harvest time came

716
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,669
and I was there through the whole

717
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:45,139
harvest I hope the dude pull down the

718
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,789
plants I helped him trim I got paid

719
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,740
pretty decently for helping him trim

720
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:50,389
some weed and this is in Kansas you guys

721
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,680
so I got paid a little extra because we

722
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,870
were really running a risk being in

723
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,019
Kansas the laws it was still completely

724
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:57,419
illegal

725
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:59,609
we were growing in basically a jam space

726
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,980
where we had a band practice set up so

727
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:03,839
we were begging for attention every day

728
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,549
with plants just right above my head I

729
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,839
could reach up and touch the ceiling

730
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:08,220
where these plants were sitting on

731
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:11,159
actually which would be the floor in the

732
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,470
opposite side so I got to finish that

733
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,779
crop with my buddy in Kansas I actually

734
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,490
brought some of that that we grew what I

735
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:19,139
got paid with I brought that back to

736
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,220
Colorado and shared that with a lot of

737
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,930
my friends here and my friends are like

738
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,910
dude you guys kind of killed it and they

739
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,320
were kind of impressed with my herb so I

740
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,180
had to move back to Colorado for some

741
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,099
family reasons my grandparents were

742
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,289
passing I came to spend the kind of

743
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:32,669
final days with them you know I it was

744
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:34,049
one of my good excuses to get away

745
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,820
Lawrence Kansas was [ __ ] me up you

746
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:37,440
guys I became an alcoholic I became a

747
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:38,789
drug addict I needed to get away from

748
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,820
there change my life and honestly I have

749
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:43,740
not drank since Lawrence Kansas not

750
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:45,059
blaming it on Kansas but once I left

751
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,349
there I was I was able to get away from

752
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,480
that lifestyle and I feel like I'm Way

753
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:52,289
more productive anyway I moved back to

754
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,589
Colorado and I get it I get a medical

755
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:56,819
marijuana card and um cuz there's not a

756
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:59,059
lot of weed on the streets anymore and

757
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:00,899
the weed that I can find isn't up to the

758
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:02,549
expectations that I'm looking for and

759
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,730
it's not as available as I would like it

760
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:07,139
to be so I get a medical marijuana card

761
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,549
and I told myself that when I got this

762
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,259
medical marijuana card I would quit

763
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,970
drinking now that there's as much

764
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,890
cannabis available as I want why do I

765
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,839
need to drink right so I go to a couple

766
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,310
of dispensaries and some of them were

767
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,769
okay this was when it was the wild wild

768
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:21,089
west you guys this was way different so

769
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,589
I go to a couple of dispensaries and I

770
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:24,779
don't really see anything that impresses

771
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:26,099
me but I made friends all over the

772
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:28,230
industry and then one day somebody told

773
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:29,789
me hey there's a new dispensary in your

774
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,980
neighborhood but it's kind of a private

775
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:33,930
deal and they told me that you had to

776
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,279
call this number first and then they

777
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,630
would tell you where to go and then you

778
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,950
had to knock on the door at the back of

779
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:41,460
this building and they would let you in

780
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,809
so ah I get my card ready I get my ID

781
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,069
and I called the number and the guy's

782
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,720
like sure I'll be home in about a half

783
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:47,939
hour it's my house just come knock on my

784
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,950
door so I knock on his door and he lets

785
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,360
me in he's up so there was an old health

786
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,220
food store downtown and it was a

787
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,079
three-story building and you have to

788
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,610
walk up to the back stairs to the third

789
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:58,649
storey and knock on the door and this

790
00:25:56,609 --> 00:26:00,359
dude had an apartment up there and he

791
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,040
would ask for your ID and your medical

792
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,869
marijuana card then you would have you

793
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,279
sit on the couch and he would light up a

794
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:07,019
joint and smoke with you and then after

795
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,269
you smoked about half the joint he would

796
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:09,829
bring out

797
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:11,239
couple of different bags of weed I

798
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:12,939
remember one of the first ones he showed

799
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:16,190
me was chocolate chunk and then he had

800
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,269
ak-47 Northern Lights there was another

801
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,190
one I can't remember I wish I remembered

802
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:21,528
but I remember the chocolate chunk got

803
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,269
my attention so he comes and shows me he

804
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:25,219
shows you these strains and then he only

805
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:26,419
let me buy a quarter the first time he's

806
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:28,009
like no I don't know you don't know he

807
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,599
checked my medical marijuana papers too

808
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:32,628
he made a copy of my ID and my medical

809
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:34,548
marijuana card and sold me a quarter and

810
00:26:32,628 --> 00:26:35,958
told me that I could come back every day

811
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:39,319
if I wanted and we'd make friends and

812
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:40,879
all that stuff so I was kind to grab an

813
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:42,558
herb for other people I would go get

814
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:44,418
weed for the girl I was dating at the

815
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,038
time I would grab weed for my neighbor

816
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:47,719
there was a DJ friend of mine who needed

817
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,219
weed all the time and I was the only one

818
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:51,979
that really knew about this dispensary

819
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:53,179
in my group so I would go there every

820
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:55,159
day I would gather all my friends money

821
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,419
I'd go to this dispensary to ring the

822
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,669
doorbell I'd call him up and bring the

823
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:00,049
doorbell and then he'd let me in and

824
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:01,459
we'd sit on the couch smoke a joint he'd

825
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:02,658
sell me a couple of quarters and every

826
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:04,369
day I'd go he'd sell me a little bit

827
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:05,659
more a little bit more then you'd be

828
00:27:04,368 --> 00:27:07,128
like so what are you doing this is just

829
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:08,509
for the people on my block the people

830
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:09,978
that sit in my basement and smoke weed

831
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:11,419
all day instead of them smoking all my

832
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:14,149
weed I'm grabbing weed for everybody

833
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,349
he's like all right cool so one day I

834
00:27:14,148 --> 00:27:16,939
show up and I could tell that he's

835
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:18,858
overwhelmed with work he was just

836
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,909
completely slammed we've I walk up the

837
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:21,348
stairs and I could see that he's been

838
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:22,639
carrying [ __ ] up the stairs and it's all

839
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,558
piled up by the door I can tell that

840
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:25,608
he's getting ready to transplant and I

841
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:26,868
was like you gonna transplant some

842
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:28,878
plants bro and he goes yeah you ever

843
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:30,348
done that before I was like oh yeah I've

844
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:31,488
transplanted a whole bunch of plants in

845
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,288
my life because I have at this point

846
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:34,909
I've been growing for a little bit I've

847
00:27:33,288 --> 00:27:36,588
helped with a couple other gardens and

848
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:37,999
of course I got that little lesson when

849
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:40,038
I was a little kid from my grower

850
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:41,149
neighbor in the apartment building so I

851
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:42,648
was like yeah I can definitely help you

852
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:43,848
and he goes tell you what come back

853
00:27:42,648 --> 00:27:45,319
tomorrow

854
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:47,148
come back at like 10:00 in the morning

855
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:48,288
and we'll do all of this tomorrow I'll

856
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:49,968
show you the grow and everything and I

857
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:51,108
was like cool so I go back of course I

858
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,058
show up a few minutes early and he's

859
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:54,588
impressed by that we smoke and get good

860
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:56,418
and stoned and then he shows me the grow

861
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:57,950
they had a bunch of lights this was a

862
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:59,570
third storey building that they had his

863
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:03,169
apartment was on the top story

864
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:05,450
the middle story was all the big grow

865
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:07,129
and so he shows me the grow and he's

866
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,019
like we need to pot all of these pots

867
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:11,358
into bigger pots and so I'm like cool

868
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:12,919
let's do it and it took me like I don't

869
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:14,298
know maybe seven hours to do all those

870
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:15,499
he watched me do a few and he's like

871
00:28:14,298 --> 00:28:16,398
[ __ ] this guy knows what he's doing and

872
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:18,139
he just went out and did his own

873
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,959
business and left me there to do those

874
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:22,159
pots I went up back up the stairs and

875
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,960

or half ounce or whatever I was getting

890

for the crew and I would just bring cash

891
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,820
for that but then he would always have

892
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,259

the boss sent you this and he handed me

908
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:16,009
a nice stack of cash and I was like

909
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,090

910

00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:27,740
show up and do the work I was like holy

915
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,390
[ __ ] okay so this dude was running the

916
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,400
dispensary out of his bedroom and I was

917
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,830
running the grow on the second storey

918
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,480
and then he would have to go run errands

919
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:36,829
he would do deliveries also at this time

920
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,940
it was kind it might have been illegal

921
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:40,759
back in the day but whatever that's

922
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,870
already passed ah he was going to do

923
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,759
deliveries and he'd be like hey bro

924
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:45,109
people are coming up to the store will

925
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,450
you be able to help them out I was like

926
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:49,009
I got this and so one night I'm helping

927
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,779
we actually had medical marijuana

928
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:52,759
patients that would show up these people

929
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:55,009
were really sick and we were a real

930
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:57,140
dispensary so one night there was an

931
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:58,759
elderly couple came and I'll never

932
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,240
forget him this lady was actually sick

933
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,680
and we sat on the couch and as I was

934
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,349
having the conversation the guy that was

935
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,970
running this dispensary showed up and he

936
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:10,490
got to hear me explain the differences

937
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:14,180
between indicas and sativas and he lent

938
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:15,650
me he got to hear me kind of care give

939
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,630
for this woman I built a relationship

940
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,370
with her over a few minutes and figured

941
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,050
out what's wrong with her what why she's

942
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:23,089
sick how she likes to consume cannabis

943
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:25,039
what she's consuming for how it makes

944
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:26,149
her feel if any because her sativas

945
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,440
worked better for her what the

946
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,750
difference is between indicas and

947
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,789
sativas I spent 30 minutes talking with

948
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,380
this lady to make sure that I sold her

949
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:34,819
the right cannabis and to make her feel

950
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,730
comfortable it was her first time buying

951
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:37,529
cannabis from us

952
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,089
or so the student that actually ran the

953
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:41,849
place walked in and saw me doing this

954
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:43,529
and he's like bro you were amazing at

955
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:44,969
that I have no business doing it after

956
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:46,500
seeing what you just did with that lady

957
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,269
so he's like you were kind of now the

958
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,920
budtender guy oh there wasn't the word

959
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:51,720
blood tinder I don't think existed at

960
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,070
that point so he's like you were now the

961
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,360
sales guy you're gonna be dealing with

962
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:57,359
the customers and I was like I've got

963
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,429
this so I would grow weed most of the

964
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,750
day and deal with the customers and then

965
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,490
I realized I was like we've got a

966
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,690
dispensary on the third storey I was

967
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,339
like why don't we have this down on the

968
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,960
first floor where everybody can access

969
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:09,240
it and they said that the city asked

970
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,390
them not to do that and I was like we've

971
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,799
got all the proper licensing um Monday

972
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,840
when I come in I'm going to move this

973
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,220
door down to the first floor and you

974
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,839
know we went to the second storey first

975
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,009
we moved we cleaned out an area and went

976
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:21,449
to the second storey so that you could

977
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:23,519
come into the first door on the bottom

978
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,750
story and it would be a little office

979
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,129
area and we'd greet you and then we'd

980
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,539
take you up to the second floor and sell

981
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,790
you buds we did that for a little while

982
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:31,289
and then I just kept getting braver and

983
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:32,759
ballsier I was like you know we got to

984
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:34,319
move this down to the first floor where

985
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:36,180
the handicapped people can come it's a

986
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,609
medical marijuana dispensary so we moved

987
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,810
it to the first floor and now the owner

988
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:40,859
was really excited about what I was

989
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:42,299
doing he's like I love that you got

990
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,709
balls he's like I love that you can help

991
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,669
the customers he's like I love the way

992
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,769
you deal with things you know about

993
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,840
cannabis you can grow so he gave me a

994
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:52,289
full-time position ah

995
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:54,359
and eventually the guy that hired me

996
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:56,129
ended up moving on to open his own

997
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:59,039
business he wanted to open his own

998
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,300
dispensary because he was he learned how

999
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,529
to run it pretty much he saw everything

1000
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,909
he needed to do he had a dream of

1001
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:04,889
opening his own shop he didn't want to

1002
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,900
work for my friend Tom shot at the Tom

1003
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:09,120

1004
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,680

Richard under Richard Richard is the one

1006
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,740
that kind of told them to hire me but

1007
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,440
then they trusted me with their shop and

1008
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,759
gave me a shot so one day Richard left

1009
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,769
there's a whole nother story on that if

1010
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,000
you guys know me you know that story

1011

1012
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,500
on a podcast but so Richard left one day

1013
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:27,240
Tom and Karen came over to try to run

1014
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,640
the store I pretty much had the store

1015
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,200
under control I knew what I was doing I

1016
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,840
knew all of our customers by first names

1017
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,890
I had a young lady by the name of tree

1022
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,690

we get to hang out play some music

1026
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,590
sometime I loved both of those ladies

1027
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:52,469

1028
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:53,609

1029
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,210
you call a receptionist kind of lady

1030
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:55,918
they weren't mine

1031
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,150
they were thee the shops receptionist

1032
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,470
kind of person they would check people

1033
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,400
in when they got there they'd be like

1034
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,079
hey what's your name let me see your

1035
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,940
marijuana card cool we'll put you in

1036
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,639
line and then they'd send it back to me

1037
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,298
they'd be like Jeff your patient bill is

1038
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,000
heading back

1039
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:11,400
so they'd come back and see me the owner

1040
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,500
that originally owned the place would

1041
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,240
show up every day and I'm kind of a

1042
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,288
systems guy I make like systems and

1043
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,579
procedures when you're running a

1044
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,859
dispensary you've got to have like

1045
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:21,509
procedures in the way that [ __ ] flows or

1046
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:23,339
[ __ ] doesn't flow properly just like any

1047
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:25,740
real business needs so I would set up

1048
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:27,119
procedures and systems and nothing

1049
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,009
against my friend Tom who owned the

1050
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,109
place but he's an old southern boy from

1051
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:33,869
North Carolina and he doesn't believe in

1052
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:36,269
any sort of systems or order or putting

1053
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:38,099
things here or doing things this way he

1054
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:39,599
just wants to smoke a joint and let

1055
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,369
things happen the way they do which is

1056
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,259
beautiful but it doesn't work for

1057
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:45,959
business so one day I had to get the

1058
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:47,398
balls and I had to say hey Tom the best

1059
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,690
thing for your business right now would

1060
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:49,949
be for you to go on the mountain and

1061
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,600
grow the weed that you grow and bring

1062
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,798
that weed back to the dispensary and let

1063
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,959
me sell it and you get the hell out of

1064
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,918
here he's like you really think so and

1065
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,210
it's like I love you but you don't know

1066
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,350
how to run a business dude you're kind

1067
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,819
of a train wreck when it comes to a

1068
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:01,829
retail establishment and he took it very

1069
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:03,058
well so he handed me the keys and he

1070
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:04,769
said young man you got yourself a

1071
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:07,678
dispensary don't do me wrong and he left

1072
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:10,440
and he let me run that dispensary we ran

1073
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,909
that for quite a while that's how I met

1074
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,700
our friend white Mike that comes on the

1075
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,829
podcast here I met Mike there I hired

1076
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:18,868
Mike Mike was the first person I ever

1077
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:20,730
hired the first time I ever hired

1078
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:22,619
anybody is an employee it was Mike I

1079
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:25,409
hired Mike to work as a backup bud

1080
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:29,070
tender at metamour ministries dispensary

1081
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:31,829
a Pueblo Colorado that's how we met so I

1082
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,809
hired a few people the shop got huge we

1083
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:35,190
were the only shop in town we were the

1084
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:37,559
most popular shop in this part of

1085
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,909
Colorado for a little while we hired a

1086
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,088
couple more employees we heard several

1087
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:43,919
more employees we had Jordan and Andrea

1088
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:46,648
is backup bud tenders and computer

1089
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,759
people and managers but anyway I'm kind

1090
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:49,500
of getting sidetracked here talking

1091
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,530
about madam R I'm reminiscing in my own

1092
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,358
head one day a city manager and a police

1093
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,889
officer came in and handed us a cease

1094
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:58,019
and desist letter that said we can no

1095
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:01,380
longer serve cannabis out of that

1096
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:02,588
location so we pretty much all of the

1097
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,450
patients that were in the store

1098
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:05,858
gave them most of the product that was

1099
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:07,259
on the shelf because we were now closed

1100
00:35:05,858 --> 00:35:09,278
there was nothing we could do with it I

1101
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:11,079
remember I picked a jar of Sour Diesel

1102
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:12,728
Mike picked the jar of Chocolate Chunk

1103
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:14,318
Jordan picked a jar of what he liked and

1104
00:35:12,728 --> 00:35:15,968
Andrea picked a jar of what he liked we

1105
00:35:14,318 --> 00:35:17,228
took those jars the boss was like go get

1106
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:19,329
a jar do whatever you want I don't care

1107
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:21,998
what happens to the product or close you

1108
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:23,589
can have the [ __ ] so the owner gave us

1109
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:25,268
the product we gave most of the edibles

1110
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:27,338
and all that like perishable stuff to

1111
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:28,838
all the people that so when the cop came

1112
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:30,460
in a bunch of people just left they're

1113
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:31,960
like [ __ ] this and they got out of there

1114
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,159
but the people that stuck around they

1115
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,659
got a lot of free product so we just

1116
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:37,239
gave all that [ __ ] away and then

1117
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:39,818
metamour was officially closed that was

1118
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:41,769
the end of that era I guess and that was

1119
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:43,298
my jump start into the industry I'm

1120

00:36:14,228 --> 00:36:17,379
would started calling my phone they like

1136
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,318
hey the store is closed where can we get

1137
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,119
some herb I was still doing I had what's

1138
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:23,710
called a caregiver girl the whole time I

1139
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,499
was working at Meadow Mar I was acting

1140
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:28,568
as a caregiver I had a personal home

1141
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:29,978
grow it was completely legal and

1142
00:36:28,568 --> 00:36:31,690
compliant with the state of Colorado

1143
00:36:29,978 --> 00:36:33,848
because I was a private registered

1144
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,528
caregiver for five other medical

1145
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:36,729
marijuana patients and myself which

1146
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:39,548
meant that I was allowed to grow plants

1147
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:41,558
for myself and them so I was growing

1148
00:36:39,548 --> 00:36:42,788
product for myself and my patients but a

1149
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,979
lot of these people were trying to get

1150
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:46,809
it from me so there were a select few

1151
00:36:44,978 --> 00:36:48,548
that honestly I sold the [ __ ] out of

1152
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:49,690
some weed to those guys but I don't do

1153
00:36:48,548 --> 00:36:51,639
that anymore so I could talk about it

1154
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:54,338
but what I really ended up doing was I

1155
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:55,598
was caregiving and I was consulting and

1156
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:58,599
teaching people how to be a better

1157
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,309
caregiver so I would go if you didn't

1158
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,140
know how to grow weed yet I'd go to your

1159
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:03,369
house and I'd help you set up your drill

1160
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:05,018
I'd figure out how much herb you need to

1161
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:06,789
grow how much space you've got we'd set

1162
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:08,949
you up and then I would either get a fee

1163
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:10,930
upfront or I would get a portion of your

1164
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:12,308
harvest so that's kind of how I stayed

1165
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:14,018
afloat there and kept myself real

1166
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:16,780
popular into this cannabis industry

1167
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:18,849
around here that and caregiving

1168
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,760
as soon as I saw madam our start I'd

1169
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:24,779
been breeding seeds and crossing plants

1170
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,280
a little bit a little bit before now

1171
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,990
before this time but when met amar went

1172
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,660
down I realized that I needed something

1173
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:33,789
solid because the consulting thing was

1174
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:34,420
great but it's unreliable people around

1175
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:36,190
here

1176
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,019
they say they're gonna pay and a lot of

1177
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:41,230
times they kind of don't want to pay so

1178
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:42,550
I started breeding seeds for retail

1179
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,230
distribution and that's how I read

1180
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,060
genetics came up I was posting pictures

1181
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,250
online people were loving my cannabis

1182
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:51,070
pictures I decided to make an I read

1183
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,920
genetics Facebook page and then I read

1184
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:56,920
genetics really exploded I began finding

1185
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,570
my seeds to event or distributing my

1186
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,340
seeds to a vendor known as nature's

1187
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,860
green remedies calm they are now known

1188
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,420
as if the dank team.com they might have

1189
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,710
a little bit of my products available

1190
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,930
right now as if you check them out the

1191
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,250
dank team.com you may be able to get

00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:11,500
some high region etic seeds from there

1193
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,960
so I started putting my seeds out I went

1194
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,309
to a few cannabis cups and hustled

1195
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,500
millions of seeds I've got millions of

1196
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:20,920
seeds on the planet now they're my fault

1197
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,690
that I've given away and or sold so uh I

1198
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,400
was noticing that I was getting a little

1199
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,500
stagnant honestly I had the podcast

1200
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,510
after after the seed company got going I

1201
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,429
started doing a podcast with my friend

1202
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:33,100
Wade we had a podcast called seven one

1203
00:38:30,429 --> 00:38:34,989
nine the blocks it is now defunct uh but

1204
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:36,400
he was doing a podcast one night I went

1205
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:38,559
to a comedy show and he wanted to do a

1206
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,670
podcast after the comedy show and he

1207
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,769
didn't have anywhere to do it and I've

1208
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,000
got this sweet table and I was like

1209
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:46,119
let's go to my house and record it'll be

1210
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,059
fun so I did a podcast with Wade and I

1211
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:51,429
honestly fell in love with podcasting

1212
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,989
because of that but I did not like the

1213
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,549
equipment that Wade had and I didn't

1214
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:56,319
approve of the quality production that

1215
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,080
Wade was doing and so I kind of

1216
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,059
volunteered to help Wade get his show up

1217
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,170
to par and I bought some recording I

1218
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,340
already had some equipment cuz I'm a

1219
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,960
drummer in a musician but I bought a

1220
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,240
couple other add-ons for my equipment

1221
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,150
bought a interface to make it work with

1222
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:11,829
my MacBook started podcasting fell in

1223
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,420
love with podcasting with Wade we did a

1224
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,949
couple episodes that featured cannabis

1225
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,869
and then he got tired of hearing about

1226
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:20,319
weed on his show so I made my own

1227
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:22,119
cannabis spin-off and we're here now at

1228
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,410
a hundred and twelve episodes holy crap

1229
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:25,420
thank you guys for listening to me rant

1230
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:29,338
this long and fit listening to 112

1231
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,778
episodes so I started podcasting um

1232
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:32,639
then there were a bunch of dispensaries

1233
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:34,528
opening up in my area and I was watching

1234
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,960
a lot of my friends in my age group get

1235
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:38,278
really cool jobs at dispensaries and it

1236
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,690
just kind of looked like fun I missed

1237
00:39:38,278 --> 00:39:41,670
the meta Mart days I missed having

1238
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:44,338
coworkers I was working from home and

1239
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,900
private facilities and I wasn't having

1240
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:47,489
the interactions with the social

1241
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,430
interactions that I missed that I

1242
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:51,568
desired so uh my buddy Kevin our old

1243
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,578
friend Kevin they used to be on the show

1244
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:55,170
he worked at the spot dispensary and he

1245
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:56,519
kept putting in good words for me and

1246
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,659
saying that they should hit me up and

1247
00:39:56,518 --> 00:39:59,098
have me be their grower because they

1248
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:02,009
were having issues with their master

1249
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:05,729
grower so I kept putting that off and

1250
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:07,380
putting that off and then I decided I

1251
00:40:05,728 --> 00:40:09,058
started dating a girl named Angela and

1252
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,009
Angela got a job at the spot and talked

1253
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:13,650
about how much fun it was and so they

1254
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:15,630
would have functions what's his name

1255
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,759
afro man came out to the spa and we got

1256
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:20,039
to meet afro man they did a few other

1257
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:21,748
things that I went to as a guest with

1258
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:23,278
Angela and I hung out and the spot crew

1259
00:40:21,748 --> 00:40:26,098
was a bunch of fun people I had a good

1260
00:40:23,278 --> 00:40:27,690
time with them we're all dirty minded

1261
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,818
dudes and I had a really good time with

1262
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,900
Rob and with Dave and with Vegas and

1263
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:34,710
with the whole true I really got along

1264
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,660
with everybody so one day Angela said

1265
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:38,369
hey they want you to come in and talk

1266
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:39,868
about a job so I walked into the spot

1267
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,099
dispensary and they're like who are you

1268
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:42,630
what do you do I was like I'm Ross to

1269
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,680
Jeff I'm the owner of Ira genetics I've

1270
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,469
been growing for this long I've been

1271
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,449
breeding for this long I helped found

1272
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:50,759
the only dispensary in the city of

1273
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:52,288
Pueblo Colorado I've got a podcast with

1274
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:54,568
this many listeners I had at the time

1275
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:57,150
and Instagram following of like 15,000

1276
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:58,619
followers which has been deleted so I

1277
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,210
just threw down who I was and what I did

1278
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:02,400
and they looked me straight in the face

1279
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,809
and they said can you grow hydro and I

1280
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,489
told him you know I have very very

1281
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:06,630
little hydro experience but I'm pretty

1282
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:08,249
sure I can learn it because it's a

1283
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,749
cannabis plant I can learn anything and

1284
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:11,098
they looked at each other like they were

1285
00:41:09,748 --> 00:41:12,209
impressed and they shook my hand and

1286
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:14,249
they said how much money do you want to

1287
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,920
make I told them and they said okay and

1288
00:41:14,248 --> 00:41:18,268
I take myself in the ass because I

1289
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,650
should have shot a lot higher since they

1290
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,478
didn't budge at all they're like okay

1291
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,599
we'll pay you that and so that's how I

1292
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:26,460
got into the spot I basically they knew

1293
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,440
who I was from my buddy Kevin hyping

1294
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,519
them up and then Angela told me that

1295
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,749
they were talking to her and that I

1296
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:32,578
should go in there and hit them up for a

1297
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:34,768
job so I went in there and they gave me

1298
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:36,390
a job on the spot so shout out to Kevin

1299
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:37,498
shout out to Angela and shout out to the

1300
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:39,239
whole spot crew even though I'm not

1301
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:41,788
there anymore I have no ill will toward

1302
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:43,230
the spot it's just not my spot for me

1303
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:45,030
they didn't have any plants

1304
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,130
I need to grow plants so that puts me

1305
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,570
into the next phase of how I got into

1306
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,059
the industry or where I am now in the

1307
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:53,369
industry I guess I worked at a spot for

1308
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:55,320
quite a while they were having issues

1309
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:58,108
getting their grow rooms up and running

1310
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,970
and up to par and I was struggling to

1311
00:41:58,108 --> 00:42:01,949
find something to keep myself busy with

1312
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:03,539
for 40 hours and I was on salary so I

1313
00:42:01,949 --> 00:42:05,699
was expected to be doing something I

1314
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:07,079
caught myself cleaning [ __ ] in the

1315
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:09,449
parking lot one time and I thought about

1316
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,980
it and I was like not to be conceited

1317
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:12,989
but I was like I'm a master grower and

1318
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,909
I'm pretty sure I make one of the top

1319
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:16,739
salaries in the building why am I here

1320
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:20,339
picking up [ __ ] and not growing

1321
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:22,079
cannabis and that really started to like

1322
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,570
eat at me I was like I'm doing things

1323
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,909
like sweeping up dead bugs and fixing

1324
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:29,430
hanging shelves in the bud room was like

1325
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:30,809
I'm not here to be [ __ ] Felix fix it

1326
00:42:29,429 --> 00:42:32,699
or fix it Felix from wreck-it Ralph

1327
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:35,579
brother that's not my duty I'm kind of a

1328
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:38,039
cannabis grower so one day I was at work

1329
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:39,719
and our good friend hunt from green and

1330
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:41,429
healthy wellness sent me a text message

1331
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:43,469
and it said give me a call as soon as

1332
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:44,969
you can and hunt doesn't really send out

1333
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:46,319
the SOS like that usually it's like

1334
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:47,639
what's up brother let's take dabs and

1335
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,460
you're free but he said as soon as you

1336
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:52,769
can so since I wasn't doing a damn thing

1337
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,000
at the spot anyway I pulled out my phone

1338
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:56,159
I gave him a call I was like what's up

1339
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,199
brother and he's like hey there was an

1340
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,819
issue with my grower here and he no

1341
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,118
longer is employed and I need a master

1342
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:05,880
grower and I was like he actually was

1343
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,410
calling to ask if I had a partner or a

1344
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,940
minion that worked in my groves that I

1345
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:11,159
would donate to him so that he could

1346
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,780
have somebody to work his grows and I

1347
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:15,599
said you know what huh I want that job

1348
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,960
and we agreed on a wage and a starting

1349
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,329
date and about six weeks ago it feels

1350
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,220
like I took over as the lead cultivator

1351
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:24,179
at Green &amp; Healthy wellness in Colorado

1352
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:26,730
Springs Colorado

1353
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:28,139

1354
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,659

1355
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:32,969

1356
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:35,759

1357
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:37,439
430 West Colorado Avenue in Colorado

1358
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,900
Springs it's the old gas station

1359
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,639
we call it the Terp station now we've

1360
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,289
got some art in there we had a

1361
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:45,539
professional artist come and do some

1362
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:47,460
beautiful art on the inside the building

1363
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:50,699
is looking really great there's a lot of

1364
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:53,429
parking we will have a bunch of great

1365
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:55,289
product around a February first we will

1366
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:56,789
be harvesting the first round of green

1367
00:43:55,289 --> 00:43:59,400
and healthy wellness medicine

1368
00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:01,409
grown by myself asana Jeff put this into

1369
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,539
flour I've been taking good care of it

1370
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:04,889
so it'll be ready pretty soon but that's

1371
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:06,239
where I am now in the industry you guys

1372
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:07,920
that's pretty much how I got in the

1373
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,679
industry and that's where I am today in

1374
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,510
the industry I still breed seeds my next

1375
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,929
breeding project will probably be making

1376
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:18,300
an f2 version of the strain arise I will

1377
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:20,549
also add about four or five other

1378
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,590
females into that selection there will

1379
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:25,170
so there will be some arise f2 s and

1380
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,940
then a couple of arise crosses that come

1381
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,190
out of IRA genetics in the near future

1382
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,019
I do intend to keep this podcast going

1383
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,030
as long as people will listen I know

1384
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:34,590
lately it's been a little bit unprepared

1385
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,000
but that's because I'm working a lot of

1386
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:37,890
hours at Green and healthy wellness

1387
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,750
getting things put together there and

1388
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:41,400
definitely adjusting to my new schedule

1389
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,139
I'm getting everything back in order so

1390
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,820
the shows are gonna get back to to what

1391
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,379
they used to be I said that after

1392
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,640
episode 100 we get back into the grow

1393
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,590
lessons and I've been doing it a little

1394
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:51,359
bit it's the holiday season so this

1395
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,980
episode and the one next week are just

1396
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,349

1397
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,150
next week I'm going to talk a little bit

1398
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:59,130
about what I do in the grow room I'm

1399
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,720
just gonna kind of take you guys to the

1400
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,070
grow room with me we'll walk into the

1401
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:03,599
girl we'll talk about my chores that I

1402
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,300
do the things that I check we'll talk

1403
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,650
about my personal grow and a small home

1404
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,300
grow and we'll talk about the large

1405
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,010
scale grow it green and healthy wellness

1406
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,260
I'll try to talk about both of those I

1407
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:16,980
also want to do a checklist of things

1408
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:19,230
that you guys should be doing on a daily

1409
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:22,139
weekly and monthly basis so those will

1410
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,639
probably be the next two episodes anyway

1411
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:23,969
I feel like I'm rambling on and on and

1412
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:25,589
on

1413
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:28,199
I'll keep this podcast going is what I

1414
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,760
was saying I'm gonna keep breeding seeds

1415
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:31,469
I read genetics will continue to come

1416
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,020
out with new seeds I will keep breeding

1417
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:36,029
my new stuff to my old stuff plus the

1418
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:38,219
newest crosses that I find that I really

1419
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,660
like will be bred into my lines I'm

1420
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:42,209
