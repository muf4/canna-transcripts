buddy I hope you're doing well the

63
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:41,500
message from Zane goes just like this

64
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,958
Canada is taking off with sustainable

65
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,659
cannabis growing utilizing aquaponics

66
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,699
what companies in Colorado can I support

67
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:51,159
that are using sustainable techniques

68
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:53,289
and furthermore what sustainability

69
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,318
techniques do you use or would you

70
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:58,328
recommend for commercial or home use

71
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:01,030
thanks for your time brother keep

72
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:02,500
slinging that green thingy they did not

73
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,090
sign it but I know who it's from big

74
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,068
shout out to our buddy Zane thanks for

75
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,049
the great message Zane this is a great

76
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:10,328
question and I'm glad you brought this

77
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,519
to our attention let's talk a little bit

78
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:14,019
about sustainability there are so many

79
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,909
different things to touch on when it

80
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:17,980
comes to sustainably growing and

81
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:19,840
producing cannabis especially when it

82
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:22,090
comes to commercial production there is

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,370
a lot of waste in the production then

84
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,170
there is an excessive amount of waste in

85
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,239
the packaging so let's talk a little bit

86
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,039
about sustainability and commercial

87
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,900
growing in Colorado let's first talk

88
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,090
about this first question that Zane

89
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,799
asked it says what companies in Colorado

90
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,098
can I support that are using sustainable

91
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,290
techniques unfortunately I cannot tell

92
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:44,199
you off the top of my head any companies

93
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:46,269
that boast or brag about using

94
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:49,060
sustainable techniques there are a few

95
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,799
no-till grows there are a few boutique

96
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,049
style growers that are trying to do it

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,659
sustainably but most of the commercial

98
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:58,450
grows in Colorado in my experience our

99
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:00,219
turn and burn waste machines they want

100
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,689
plants on the ground they want those

101
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,459
plants in flower they want them

102
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:05,289
harvested they want them processed they

103
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,489
want them turned into whatever product

104
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:07,900
they're going to they need that on the

105
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,079
Shelf they want the money to come back

106
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,969
so they can pay to repeat that cycle so

107
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,700
unfortunately I cannot point you

108
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:18,579
directly to any companies in Colorado

109
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:20,738
that are working on sustainability so

110
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,439
then he follows up with furthermore what

111
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:25,718
sustainability techniques do you use or

112
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,370
would you recommend for commercial or

113
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:29,560
home use

114
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,899
is a great way to follow this up I try

115
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,449
to be mindful being mindful is the first

116
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:36,698
step to being sustainable and I will

117
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,530
admit that I am a salt grower I am NOT

118
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,240
an organic sky that is just not my

119
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,649
method that is not my technique that is

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,660
not how I learned how to do it that's

121
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,489
not how I prefer to do it if you like

122
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,979
going full organic if you like growing

123
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,509
no-till do that grow the way that makes

124
00:04:47,978 --> 00:04:51,370
you happy and don't [ __ ] at other

125
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:53,860
people for doing it the way that works

126
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,840
for them but I do understand that I am

127
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,300
having nutrients I'm having salts

128
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,069
shipped across the country for my grow I

129
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,020
understand that but I try to be mindful

130
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,788
there are a lot of things to think about

131
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:05,948
I try to think about how many lights

132
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:08,949
I've got running do I need all of these

133
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:11,228
lights on in most situations I'm working

134
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,419
in very large environments and I'm

135
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:15,430
talking a hundred or five hundred lights

136
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:17,109
in Flour at a time which gives me a

137
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,810
hundred to two hundred veg lights

138
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,699
sometimes more than that sometimes if we

139
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,069
can move this row of plants over here

140
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:25,840
and turn off four lights for a week

141
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,909
that'll save us a little bit of money

142
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,529
and that helps environmentally and that

143
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,870
keeps us a little bit more sustainable

144
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:34,569
so I think about lighting when it comes

145
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,189
with lighting we also have less HVAC to

146
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:39,069
run if I'm not running that many lights

147
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:40,719
I don't need that much HVAC so those are

148
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,819
a couple of things that I look at

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,830
immediately when I go into a growth to

150
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:47,348
find ways to cut costs one of my job's

151
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:50,228
is to cut costs in the grow as well as

152
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:52,329
increase productivity so I find ways to

153
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:54,038
turn off a few lights by pushing a few

154
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:55,509
plants closer together just be mindful

155
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:57,639
think about what you're doing think

156
00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:00,550
about what you're seeing another thing

157
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,470
to be mindful about is nutrients I just

158
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,538
said I know I'm having my nutrients

159
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,270
shipped across the country I have

160
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:09,610
shifted to mostly powdered nutrients

161
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:11,859
many of the nutrients we are purchasing

162
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,598
that are in bottles are mostly water so

163
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,069
we are paying to have water driven

164
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,500
across the country we are paying

165
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:19,629
shipping for water so if you can buy

166
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,300
powdered nutrients I would suggest a

167
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,769
powder nutrient again I understand that

168
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,990
we've got the things we like in the

169
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:27,639
methods we prefer I like new millennium

170
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,189
nutrients those are not powdered

171
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,348
nutrients I also like veg bloom they are

172
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,819
powdered nutrients I understand that

173
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,259
people like different things and we have

174
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,879
different preferences you just have to

175
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,288
use your mind and think about do you

176
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,000
want to pay for the shipping is this

177
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:41,168
good for the environment is this going

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,610
to be cost-effective

179
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:45,038
so that's the next thing I think about

180
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,229
is shipping everything has to be put on

181
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,468
a truck and sent to us most of the

182
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:52,360
things we use are not locally made I try

183
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:54,968
to source things that are at least in

184
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,800
Colorado oftentimes I have to have stuff

185
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:58,930
sent from California or other regions

186
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,749
but I try to get most of my stuff from

187
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,319
Colorado so be mindful of shipping and

188
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:06,490
shipping costs I also work on

189
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,680
sustainability by working on what is

190
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,050
known as best practices what are the

191
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,999
best practices in your commercial what

192
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,129
is your culture in your grow environment

193
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:17,289
what are you doing in your environment

194
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:19,778
in your grow in your facility to make

195
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:21,759
sure you are leaving as little footprint

196
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:23,468
on our planet as possible what are you

197
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,150
doing what is in your employee handbook

198
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:27,250
what is in your standard operating

199
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:29,168
procedure that helps you protect

200
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,728
yourself and the environment

201
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:32,799
think about those sorts of things there

202
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:34,870
are a lot of things and your grow that

203
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,728
you can adjust like I said earlier the

204
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,709
first things in most grows I go to I

205
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:40,568
look at how many lights are on and how

206
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,519
many plants are under each light and can

207
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:44,650
we simply move a few plants over ten

208
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,930
feet and turn off a whole entire row of

209
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,728
lights those are things that each grow

210
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,709
will have something like that you can

211
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:53,168
look at is there a huge leak where your

212
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,399
HVAC is just blowing fresh air right out

213
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,899
of the building and wasting all that

214
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,658
cool air you just put in there are you

215
00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:00,609
pumping co2 out as you exhaust the room

216
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:02,079
things like that look at your best

217
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,699
practices how are you mixing your

218
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,310
nutrients are you wasting water are you

219
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:08,949
wasting nutrients another important

220
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,959
thing is pesticide safety are you

221
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,838
handling are you mixing are you applying

222
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,180
pesticides safely especially in an

223
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:18,399
outdoor environment where is that going

224
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,528
you may be aiming at the cannabis plant

225
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,598
directly in front of you where is the

226
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:24,579
wind taking the rest of that pesticide

227
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:26,709
is it blowing on the orchard down the

228
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:28,778
row from you where is it going be

229
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,848
mindful of that sort of stuff that stuff

230
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:32,889
is very important you may want to

231
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:34,479
destroy the bugs in your crop I don't

232
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:36,009
want you destroying the bugs on my

233
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,570
property I don't have a cannabis farm

234
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:39,698
I've got other plants that are natural

235
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,589
and local to my area I don't know what

236
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,629
your pesticide is going to do to those

237
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:46,029
plants out there in my beautiful looking

238
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:47,769
yard to my desirable insects that are

239
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:49,568
out there taking care of my yard having

240
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,009
a little nature like they should be I

241
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:52,599
understand we got to get rid of the bugs

242
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:54,539
on the cannabis don't get rid of the

243
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,550
bugs in my yard I like them there

244
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:59,219
be mindful with your pesticide

245
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:01,198
applications now this is really going to

246
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,470
be contradictory to the last thing I

247
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:06,149
said we have to wear gloves and personal

248
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,070
protective equipment when we were in the

249
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,110
grow at all times especially when

250
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,569
handling pesticides and other chemicals

251
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,139
or whatever you want to call them but

252
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:17,818
try to not waste a bunch of gloves be

253
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,919
mindful of how many gloves you were

254
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:22,379
using in a commercial environment we can

255
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,849
go through a box of gloves in a day if

256
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:25,860
there are one or two guys wearing the

257
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,509
same size gloves you think about it you

258
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,730
come in you put on a pair of gloves you

259
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:31,769
do a job then you probably change gloves

260
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,089
and use the men's room you wash your

261
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:34,379
hands you come back you put on another

262
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:36,389
gloves you're already at two pairs of

263
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,278
gloves two pair of gloves before the

264
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:38,909
first break of the day then we go to

265
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,259
break

266
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:41,578
you take a break you do whatever you do

267
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,149
a break you come back you put on more

268
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:44,099
gloves

269
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,539
hopefully you're working hard maybe you

270
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,879
break a glove you got to put on more

271
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:50,789
gloves I think we go between five and

272
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,860
twelve pair of gloves per person per day

273
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:55,318
in a commercial environment and that can

274
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,079
add up quite quickly look at that much

275
00:09:55,318 --> 00:10:00,299
wasted latex and a pile and think about

276
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:01,828
first of all how much latex you're

277
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,958
throwing away you're putting that into a

278
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:06,299
landfill then also that had to be

279
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,129
shipped to you so you're wasting stuff

280
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,750
two times when we're wasting too many

281
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:12,750
gloves I understand we have to use that

282
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,639
stuff but be mindful and another thing

283
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,879
we need to be more mindful of is the

284
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:20,639
wasting of water don't get me wrong I

285
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,948
have overflowed a reservoir in every

286
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,690
single grow in which I have worked I'm

287
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:26,458
not trying to say I don't do it but we

288
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,769
all need to pay more attention to the

289
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:31,500
amount of water we are using and wasting

290
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:33,480
in our commercial environments after we

291
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,490
water a room a few times we should know

292
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,980
how many gallons of water that room

293
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,230
needs we should not mix up too much we

294
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,509
should not be throwing away excess

295
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,370
nutrient solution and if you were

296
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,500
throwing that away where is it going

297
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,929
where are you dumping your excess

298
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,089
nutrient solution be mindful of that if

299
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:53,278
you were running a drain to waste system

300
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:55,500
or you've got runoff water where is that

301
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,179
water going is that going in a floor

302
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,009
drain I know that once it hits the floor

303
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,289
drain that's out of your mind but where

304
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,568
does it go after that if you've got to

305
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:05,490
take some water and dump it out back or

306
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:07,500
dump it somewhere in your facility where

307
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,460
is that water going is that going right

308
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,769
into the drain that

309
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,600
back to the river is that going to some

310
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:14,939
sort of recycling is that just draining

311
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,860
right into the dirt right in your area

312
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,899
or all the bushes outside of your grow

313
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,669
growing rapidly and you can't figure out

314
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,889
why because you're dumping all that

315
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:24,419
nutrient water out there or the bunnies

316
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,159
eating that are you destroying the

317
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,169
natural environment that should be out

318
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,299
there be mindful of that sort of stuff

319
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:31,708
let's not waste too much water I'm

320
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:34,229
getting thirsty just talking about

321
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:37,319
wasting water one day we may run out of

322
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,300
water and when we do we are [ __ ] so be

323
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,010
mindful how much water you were mixing

324
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,289
when you're mixing a nutrient solution

325
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,360
be mindful if you're filling a reservoir

326
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:48,088
just set a timer and don't let that [ __ ]

327
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,620
overflow on to the floor and if you are

328
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:51,600
running a drain to waste off you're

329
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,429
disposing of some sort of water be

330
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,409
mindful of where that water is going

331
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:57,239
like I said before out of sight out of

332
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:59,100
mind right once it goes down the drain

333
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,259
who cares what happens to it you

334
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,389
probably should care what happens once

335
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:05,370
it goes down the drain so the main tips

336
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,399
I can give about being more sustainable

337
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,139
are basically being more mindful and

338
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,759
being aware of what we're doing just

339
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,799
simple steps that we may not have paid

340
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,870
attention to try to recycle more

341
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,109
appropriately if possible try not to

342
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,600
waste waste is a big cost in the grow

343
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,330
environment waste is a big cost to our

344
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,370
environment in general now let's kind of

345
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,040
work into some things we can do on a

346
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,409
larger scale that will help us be more

347
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,449
sustainable and of course the first

348
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:35,750
obvious things to help us be more

349
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:39,180
sustainable would be to grow outdoors

350
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:41,278
outdoors is much more cost effective

351
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:43,679
than an indoor grow you don't have to

352
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,230
pay for lights the Sun is the best

353
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,539
natural light ever that's why it's there

354
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,310
that's how everything started is it all

355
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:54,149
grew because the Sun gave it light and

356
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:55,588
life so use the Sun it is free then if

357
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,569
you're growing outdoors you don't have

358
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:59,490
to add an air conditioner because you're

359
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,350
outdoors you can't air condition the

360
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,299
entire outdoors those plants have to

361
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,579
deal with it now you're not wasting HVAC

362
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,958
that's that much more chemical gas that

363
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:08,870
is not being released into our

364
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,309
environment we're getting better already

365
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,528
now I understand we can't all grow

366
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:15,059
outdoors I'm in Colorado my outdoor grow

367
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:17,129
season is very limited we build

368
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,599
greenhouses and hang lights in them we

369
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,669
use the sunshine when we can we

370
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,790
supplement with grow lights as needed so

371
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:25,669
I understand we can't all grow outdoors

372
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:28,099
this is an ideal world now if you are

373
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:30,860
forced to use grow lights what would be

374
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,629
a most helpful option would be solar the

375
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,820
only problem with that is it costs a

376
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:36,289
little bit of money to install solar so

377
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,970
you've got to put the money out upfront

378
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:40,009
then it's got to pay for itself over

379
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,019
time a lot of companies a lot of

380
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:43,939
environments a lot of situations cannot

381
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,909
afford to put the money for solar

382
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,590
outright upfront so grow outdoors you

383
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,969
don't have to pay for lighting grow

384
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,190
outdoors you don't have to pay for air

385
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,320
conditioning if we move indoors let's

386
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,120
try to utilize the power of solar that

387
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,220
way we can take that energy from the Sun

388
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,919
and we can still power our plants with

389
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,240
that natural Sun energy now when it

390
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:04,039
comes to solar we have to do our

391
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,750
research because does it cost more

392
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,189
damage to the environment to make those

393
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,139
solar panels than it does to actually

394
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,090
run the electricity there's a lot of

395
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,949
thinking to be done when it comes to

396
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,600
designing big facilities and trying to

397
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,250
set up solar and trying to think

398
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,820
ethically and trying to put your money

399
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,240
somewhere

400
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,379
we are not causing more problems so

401
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,960
obviously growing outdoors would be our

402
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:26,269
first step to sustainability the next

403
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,280
step to becoming more sustainable and

404
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:30,079
environmentally friendly would be to run

405
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,269
some sort of a no-till type of

406
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,389
environment a no-till environment would

407
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:37,870
give you much less waste and waste is a

408
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:40,759
huge problem in a commercial facility

409
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,340
imagine if I've got a room with 200 3

410
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,279
gallon pots filled with cocoa we harvest

411
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,370
now I've got a dumpster filled with 3

412
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:51,319
gallon pots filled with cocoa if we were

413
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,179
running no-till we would basically pull

414
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,340
out the main root ball we would put in

415
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:57,139
another plant backfill with some compost

416
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,300
and we would be good to go there would

417
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,220
be very minimal waste we could actually

418
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,809
throw that root ball and that leftover

419
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,670
stick and probably most of my other

420
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:06,619
sticks and all my trim right into my

421
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:09,199
compost bin and it would become food

422
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,960
again for my plants in the future that

423
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,480
is a much more sustainable way to

424
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,519
operate a grow unfortunately in my

425
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,500
experience it is much more difficult to

426
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,990
operate a commercial environment in a

427
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,850
no-till type of setup I'm sure people

428
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,279
are doing it I'm sure they kick ass at

429
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,820
it but it is not my style I am NOT good

430
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,159
at that

431
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,080
I am a salt grower I'm a bottled

432
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,509
nutrients grower I set up a drip system

433
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,120
I know how to train guys where they can

434
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:37,069
feed these nutrients to these plants at

435
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,370
this week and I can train them to do

436
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,200
that

437
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,970
in multiple facilities and I'm going to

438
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,920
get the same outcome in multiple

439
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,680
environments that is why I like my

440
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:47,179
regimen but going full no-till going

441
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,588
fully organic would be much more

442
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,689
sustainable it would be much more

443
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,430
environmentally friendly it would be

444
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,120
fully organic which is already a

445
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,559
headstart

446
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,960
you don't have to ship all of those

447
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,439
bottles that's a big advantage and there

448
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,300
is much less waste and like I said a

449
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,880
minute ago most of the waste from a

450
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:07,609
no-till grow can be put right back into

451
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,320
the compost bin it will become composted

452
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,300
and you can use it right back on the

453
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,640
plants in the future and that will feed

454
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:15,889
your plants again and keep that cycle

455
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,939
going there is very minimal waste and

456
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:18,919
that type of a setup

457
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,779
so my first tips to becoming more

458
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,309
sustainable would be to learn to grow

459
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:24,289
outdoors that is much more

460
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:26,299
environmentally friendly I understand

461
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:28,699
that is not always everybody's option

462
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:32,000
the next step would be to learn to grow

463
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,980
no-till or at least fully organically

464
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,528
and stop shipping bottles around the

465
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,960
country the next steps to learning to

466
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:41,778
grow more sustainable are being mindful

467
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,080
in your environment what can you do in

468
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:47,419
your grow situation to save some tread

469
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,129
on the earth and also save some tread on

470
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:50,958
your wallet they will go very well

471
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:53,600
together they'll both make you feel very

472
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,009
good about your choices so when you were

473
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,360
in your grow and you're mixing your

474
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,679
nutrients or you're applying your

475
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,259
pesticide or you're doing whatever

476
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,659
you're in your grow doing be mindful say

477
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:04,308
all right there I'm probably [ __ ] up

478
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:05,088
the environment just a little bit more

479
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:07,338
than I need to

480
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,958
I could probably dial back my footprint

481
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:11,659
just a little bit just by skipping that

482
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,029
step or by may be doing this one extra

483
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,529
step so just be more mindful in your

484
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:17,629
garden pay more attention to what you're

485
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:20,058
doing and look for opportunities to be

486
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,490
more gentle on the environment and also

487
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:24,349
more gentle on your wallet now let's

488
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,870
talk about another thing that I find to

489
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:30,139
be completely embarrassing about the

490
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:31,759
Colorado legal cannabis industry one of

491
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,910
the most wasteful things you could ever

492
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:37,609
find is cannabis packaging in Colorado

493
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,769
if you buy a pre-roll joint it comes in

494
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:42,139
a tube that is about six inches long and

495
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:43,879
an inch in diameter and it's got a label

496
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,890
on it from the company this is a

497
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,810
whatever joint and then once you

498
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,060
purchase it the dispensary is required

499
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:51,389
to put a sticker on it that says that it

500
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,428
was grown at this play

501
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,049
it was rolled at this place it was sold

502
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:57,269
at this place and it was bought by this

503
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:59,069
person then it's got to be sold to you

504
00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:00,990
in some sort of a childproof container

505
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:02,819
if that tube isn't already childproof

506
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,920
they've got to put it in an exit bag or

507
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:06,659
another childproof container then they

508
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,179
probably throw that into a brown paper

509
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,529
bag then they give you a receipt then

510
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,970
they usually give you some sort of a

511
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:13,529
pamphlet about a new product that's

512
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,910
coming out that you do not care about

513
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,798
because you just bought the product that

514
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,450
you enjoy then they high-five you until

515
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,429
you two have a good day then

516
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,558
most of us get to the car and we throw

517
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:24,330
away all of that packaging all we need

518
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,490
is that pre-roll joint it was in that

519
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:28,829
tube and a lighter we don't need any of

520
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,950
the other [ __ ] every product in

521
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:34,470
Colorado comes with excessive

522
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:36,480
ridiculously wasteful packaging many of

523
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,880
the concentrate companies will sell you

524
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,009
a gram of concentrate but that gram of

525
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,350
concentrate will be inside of a fancy

526
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:45,390
cardboard box with a lot of fancy

527
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:48,029
labeling you open the top of that

528
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,770
cardboard box and there is a small like

529
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,539
a jewelry pouch something that a hippie

530
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:53,400
would keep their little magic rocks in a

531
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:56,069
little tiny Crown Royal bag so you've

532
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,780
got a cardboard box I cracked that open

533
00:18:56,069 --> 00:19:00,149
now there's a little Crown Royal bag in

534
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:01,500
there I cracked bad open both of those

535
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,179
immediately go in the trash [ __ ] that

536
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,980
Crown Royal bag [ __ ] that cardboard box

537
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,620
do not need that for anything

538
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,390
now inside is a little glass container

539
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:11,069
that's a little tiny container

540
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,150
it weighs I'm gonna drop it on the table

541
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:16,048
so you can hear how heavy these

542
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:18,840
containers are I was one hash container

543
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:20,819
for one gram of concentrate I don't need

544
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,740
that much packaging I know that there's

545
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,269
a gram of hash in here just a little

546
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,548
container would have been just fine I

547
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:28,529
don't need all of this packaging then

548
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:30,210
they put this in a brown paper bag

549
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:32,308
they put stickers on it to show where it

550
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,289
was purchased who purchased it what time

551
00:19:32,308 --> 00:19:36,298
I purchased it then I've got a receipt

552
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:38,220
there is so much [ __ ] coming along

553
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:39,808
with this one gram I wish I could get a

554
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,120
little container and put it in my pocket

555
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:44,069
and say thanks bro have a great day I

556
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,689
don't need all the extra [ __ ] to throw

557
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:47,759
away I don't need the paper trail

558
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,370
there's no need for all of that I wish

559
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,440
that Colorado did not require all of the

560
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:54,389
ridiculous packaging everything has to

561
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,700
be childproof everything has to be

562
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,650
ridiculously labeled sometimes I think

563
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,480
that the packages are only this big so

564
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,980
we can fit all of the requirements on

565
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,250
here we have to have a small billboard

566
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,190
for all of our requirements on our pack

567
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,890
so when you are creating legislation in

568
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,779
your area please be mindful of all of

569
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,450
the packaging requirements in Colorado

570
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:16,369
and how embarrassingly wasteful this has

571
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,200
become I was just looking at the

572
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:20,719
products on my table I've got a couple

573
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,130
of vape cartridges from a very

574
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,259
well-known company you guys know whose

575
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,570
vape carts I will smoke and who's I will

576
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:28,190
not consume this company is required

577
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:30,829
this is not their fault this is the

578
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,980
requirement of the state for a vape

579
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,939
cartridge this thing is probably

580
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,860
unscrewing it from the battery now to

581
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,538
get a good idea of what size this this

582
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:40,519
is probably it's smaller than my pinkie

583
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:42,259
this thing is definitely smaller than my

584
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,119
pinkie probably the size of the average

585
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:46,220
person's pinkie this is about a pinky

586
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:49,099
finger the packaging that this comes in

587
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,048
is about the size bigger than a pack of

588
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:53,269
cigarettes it's a little bit bigger than

589
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:55,579
a pack of cigarettes so this little tiny

590
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:57,829
thing has got to come in something about

591
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:59,418
the size of a package of cigarettes so

592
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:01,250
then you try to open that up and it's

593
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,960
any childproof pack it's got this little

594
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,038
press thing you got a press here squeeze

595
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,900
here pull here

596
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:07,129
honestly I usually just end up tearing

597
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,019
the packages apart because that should

598
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,110
only works half the time then on the

599
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,819
inside there's like four or five things

600
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:15,949
folded together to keep this little tiny

601
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:18,408
product in place they could have done

602
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,929
this with very minimal packaging if

603
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:23,030
Colorado did not require all of these

604
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,409
first of all probably this billboard on

605
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,538
the back of the package is part of it

606
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:28,760
and then all this child proof and this

607
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:30,769
over-excessive safety stuff I don't

608
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,359
think it's necessary it reminds me of

609
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:34,429
when I was young and I used to go to the

610
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,699
record store and try to buy a cassette

611
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:39,919
or a CD and you had to carry that giant

612
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,569
contraption up to the front desk so that

613
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,919
they could get your CD out of there they

614
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:44,359
had to put in that little machine and

615
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,100
try to break it out that's kind of what

616
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,798
it's like when you go to buy products in

617
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:51,019
Colorado there is a ridiculous amount of

618
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,308
packaging all right Dekker I really got

619
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,798
off on a ramble there

620
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:56,629
you asked what companies should you

621
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,210
support in Colorado that are sustainable

622
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:01,309
unfortunately I don't have any companies

623
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,380
I can point you to directly that are

624
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:05,178
more sustainable hopefully people are

625
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,070
listening to this episode and there are

626
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:09,048
people it grows there are people in

627
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:11,509
facilities that are going to say hey

628
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:13,730
Rasta Jeff use us and as an example we

629
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:15,679
grow sustainably here are some photos

630
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,720
here's what we do give us a shout out

631
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,759
and I will if you send me info

632
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,740
qualifies I'll give you a shout out and

633
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,319
say that you deserve a fist bump for

634
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:27,109
being sustainable then you ask what

635
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,490
techniques I could recommend for home or

636
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:30,589
commercial use to make us more

637
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,259
sustainable I hope I gave you a lot of

638
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:35,539
examples almost everything I said will

639
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:38,509
apply in a commercial environment or in

640
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:41,210
a small craft or home grow they should

641
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:43,670
apply all the way around mainly pay

642
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,620
attention and be mindful what are you

643
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,300
doing in your grow wonder if you saw

644
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:49,519
somebody else doing that would you go oh

645
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,230
man you're dumb or would you go oh

646
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,400
that's the perfect way to do it watch

647
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,200
yourself on camera

648
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,600
watch yourself from the third-person

649
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,160
view just think about everything you

650
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,299
were doing in your grow everything you

651
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,430
were doing in your outdoor and your

652
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:03,799
indoor and your greenhouse think about

653
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,810
it all pay attention and think about how

654
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,639
you would react if I told you I was

655
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:09,230
doing that in my grow if I was like hey

656
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,450

657
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,009
[ __ ] held on to a light with one hand

658
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,480
and applied pesticides without any

659
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,920

like bro what the [ __ ] are you doing

661
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,250

662
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,839

663
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,700
